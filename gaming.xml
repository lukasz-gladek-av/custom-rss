A voice in my head rambles about death, civilization, and the violent heist I’ve been tasked to help with. After every grisly death, my synthetic body is reborn. A sprawling, AI-controlled city stretches out in front of me, like an ultra-advanced, grimly efficient panopticon situated galaxies away at the end of history. The first hour of <em>Metal Eden</em> feels like a mashup of <em>RoboCop</em> and <em>The Matrix</em> and I dig it. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195259" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Phantom Liberty Is Undoing One Key Thing That Cyberpunk Got Right" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="229" data-playlist="195259,195386,195734" data-current="195259"><div><p>Phantom Liberty Is Undoing One Key Thing That Cyberpunk Got Right</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195259/195259_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195259/195259_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195259/195259_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195259/195259_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20720.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Anyone who watched The Game Awards 2024 showcase might recall a dizzyingly frenetic and neon-fueled trailer midway through the show that definitely looked like it might be for Bungie’s distinctly stylized sci-fi shooter <em>Marathon</em>. But it was actually for<em> Metal Eden</em>, the upcoming cyberpunk boomer shooter from Reikon Games, best known for the bloody 2017 twin-stick shooter <em>Ruiner</em>. It arrives May 6 on console and PC and I recently played the free demo on PlayStation 5.</p><p>Like the prior indie-sized release, <em>Metal Eden</em> is unequivocally metal and not afraid of embracing slick aesthetics and evocative jargon simply because they look and sound really cool. But in some ways it’s a much more ambitious game, not least of all because it’s a first-person shooter in a 3D world with the unmistakable sheen of an Unreal Engine 5 project. The mission design and gameplay feel are <em>fine</em>, and aptly described as <em>Doom</em> crossed with <em>Ghostrunner</em>. But what had me pressing on was the neat worldbuilding and confident style. </p><figure id="" data-id="0318d3c08381c8abea0e1734ae2166ec" data-recommend-id="image://0318d3c08381c8abea0e1734ae2166ec" data-format="jpg" data-width="2000" data-height="1125" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows a city at daylight.

The synth soundtrack and streamlined levels keep propelling you toward the next weird lore beat.</p><p>Mostly I just love the dreamlike images<em> Metal Eden</em> conjures in my head of a hyper-violent, metallically vibrant heat death at the end of human civilization long after AI has colonized the cosmos and the lines between computer and consciousness have become indistinguishable. It’s a vivid backdrop against which to smash, shoot, and kill lots of fleshy machines. <em>Metal Eden</em> might not win GOTY but it’s sill occupying a surprising amount of my headspace the day after, like a haunting dream that’s  eerily hard to shake. </p><figure id="" data-id="b031b898038309acdeb7850b2c1d5b8f" data-recommend-id="image://b031b898038309acdeb7850b2c1d5b8f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1999" data-height="1125" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows a mission splash screen.

<p>Before Dragon Breath shotguns had an opportunity to take over Warzone’s meta, Raven Software temporarily removed the attachment in the April 11 update, and Treyarch also rolled out a change to the Shattered Veil boss in Black Ops 6 Zombies. </p>



<p>The return of Verdansk in Warzone in Season 3 caused a massive uptick in interest. <span>As a result, some players who previously dropped the game are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/author/ryanlemay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">re-installing Warzone on PS5</a> and other platforms.  </span></p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-player-count-off-charts-as-verdansk-exceeds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Activision</a>&nbsp;is reportedly pleased with the results, and the devs have already previewed new content for the upcoming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-warzone-season-3-reloaded-release-date-expected-start-time-verdansk-ranked-play-new-multiplayer-maps-smg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mid-season update</a>. In addition, the Warzone and Black Ops 6 teams are constantly releasing new minor patches to improve the overall experience. </p>

<figure><figcaption>Black Ops 6 players universally praised the new Zombies map. Image via Activision </figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-12-gauge-dragon-s-breath-ammunition-removed">12 Gauge Dragon’s Breath Ammunition Removed</h3>



<p>Warzone players discovered that using 12 Gauge Dragon’s Breath ammunition and the Kimura RYL33 Laser Light together on the MX Guardian transformed the shotgun into the best close-range weapon in the game. </p>



<p>With both attachments equipped, the MX Guardian had an unbelievable 280-millisecond time-to-kill speed in gunfights up to five meters, and that only dropped off to 560 ms from 10 meters. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/03/call-of-duty-bo6-warzone-season-03-patch-notes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Activision</a> explained, “12 Gauge Dragon’s Breath ammo was only meant to be available on specific trigger types for the MX Guardian Shotgun. As such, we’ve disabled this attachment until we can address the issue.” </p>



<h3 id="h-shattered-veil-boss-changes">Shattered Veil Boss Changes </h3>



<p>The Shattered Veil boss was designed to be challenging in BO6 Zombies, but players used an exploit with the Void Sheat that allowed it to do more damage than intended. This update addresses that issue and makes a few changes, to provide other options to use against the boss. </p>

<p>Larian Studios announced an impending final update for Baldur’s Gate 3 in <strong>November 2024, </strong>but it’s only now that it’s shaping up to be released. It’s simply known as ‘Patch 8’, and it’s set to introduce some major changes and additions to Baldur’s Gate 3, which Larian has already moved on from.</p>



<p>Amongst these additions are crossplay mechanics, photo mode, and an array of subclasses.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-when-is-patch-8-being-released-in-baldur-s-gate-3">When is Patch 8 Being Released in Baldur’s Gate 3?</h2>



<p><strong>Larian has confirmed that Patch 8 will be released globally across all platforms on April 15.</strong> This marks the final major update for the award-winning epic that launched to an overwhelmingly positive reception when it was released in August 2023.</p>



<p>The team has been reluctant to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/baldurs-gate-3-patch-8-comes-next-year-and-includes-cross-play-photo-mode-and-more/">release Patch 8</a> in Baldur’s Gate 3 until it was as close to perfect as possible, it seems. It has been in testing for months and that only came after strenuous efforts to polish the new features.</p>



<p>It has also been reported that Baldur’s Gate 3 will go on sale when Patch 8 is released on April 15, which is sure to bring about a spike in sales as newcomers jump on board to find out what all the fuss has been about over the last year and a half.</p>



<p>In January, Larian Studios confirmed that it had shifted priorities and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/baldurs-gate-3-devs-have-moved-their-full-attention-to-the-next-game/">sighted the ‘next game’</a> for the team as the core focus. Baldur’s Gate 3 will get Patch 8, and then no more major updates are set to follow – but the game remains popular regardless.</p>



<p>Will the Patch 8 update in Baldur’s Gate 3 bring you back to the game? Let me know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/talisman-the-magical-quest-5th-edition-board-game-review.1162311/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/talisman-the-magical-quest-5th-edition-board-game-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Questing through dangerous dungeons in search of loot and magical artifacts goes together with board games like peanut butter and chocolate, and the Talisman: The Magical Quest Game series was one of the first to make that combination so compelling. The first edition of Talisman was released back in 1983 by Games Workshop – now best known for their Warhammer and Lord of the Rings tabletop war games – introducing players to its various regions and the Crown of Command. Now, more than 40 years later, Avalon Hill has released the fifth edition of Talisman, and once more, you will be able to test your mettle against the dragon and see if you can claim the crown for yourself.</p><div catalogid="7058f2f2-e805-4c66-bfe7-40102c74cecc" id="217979"><div id="217979" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Talisman: The Magical Quest Board Game (5th Edition)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In Talisman, you and up to five friends select from 12 possible characters in this contest for the Crown of Command. These include a nimble thief, an arcane wizard, and a mighty warrior, among others. This latest edition of Talisman maintains a similar flow to previous iterations – roll dice, move to a space where you may draw an adventure card that could spawn a monster, grant you a magic item, or send you to a tavern where a dice roll determines your fate. Then it's the next player's turn, and this cycle repeats until a character who has managed to claim one of the titular Talisman relics passes through the Valley of Fire and defeats the powerful Elder Dragon, claiming the Crown of Command and winning the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This rather simplistic – or perhaps <em>aged</em> – approach to adventure board games is not a detriment but rather a point in Talisman’s favor. Right now, there is no shortage of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-campaign-board-games">campaign-style board games</a> that feature grand adventures, like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-the-board-game-review">Elden Ring</a> or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/divinity-original-sin-the-board-game-review">Divinity: Original Sin</a>, and even Avalon Hill’s other Games Workshop revival, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/heroquest-buying-guide">HeroQuest</a>, feeling like evolved extensions of Talisman. However, many modern examples can be intimidating and expensive for younger players or those new to the hobby. While it may not be a game I reach for with my seasoned group of gaming friends, I can see it being a great choice when hanging out with my nephews or a group of friends who are <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-beginner-board-games">less experienced with board games</a> but open to trying something new.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the actions you take on your turn may seem mundane compared to more modern adventure games, much of Talisman’s appeal lies in the balancing act of <em>Do I try to get stronger, or do I move ahead?</em> This tug-of-war – needing to grow powerful enough to defeat the final dragon without falling too far behind – adds a layer of second-guessing to every turn. How much of a risk do you take by <em>not</em> going after that next enemy for its rewards in favor of getting a jump on the others by heading to the next area?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For all your planning, Talisman is highly luck-dependent, with nearly every aspect determined by a die roll. Calling it "Adventure Monopoly" wouldn’t be entirely off base, though fortunately, Talisman is far more fun (and much quicker to play). You roll a die to determine movement, with your only decision being whether to move clockwise or counterclockwise. The outcomes of different spaces are dictated by another die roll or a random draw from a deck of cards, and combat is yet another roll of the dice. This heavy reliance on chance won’t be for everyone, and the fifth edition includes a Fate resource which allows you to reroll dice or move up to six spaces on your turn, it doesn’t quite go for enough and I would have loved new mechanics that further mitigate the luck element and reward strategy more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This latest edition makes some changes that help speed up the game and make it less punishing for players. One example is the iconic <em>Toad</em> transformation, which turns a player into a toad, reducing their strength, craft (magic), and movement. Previously, this effect lasted three turns, but now it only lasts one. Character death has also been significantly adjusted. In past editions, when a character died, all items, followers, gold, and other trinkets they had accumulated were dropped on the space where they fell, and the player had to start fresh with a brand-new character. In the fifth edition, you retain all your items and simply move to the Village space, where you can pay for additional lives at the start of your next turn.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While this change makes the experience "nicer" and more forgiving, I feel it also removes some of the tension and sense of danger in confrontations. As a smart inclusion, the rulebook features many of the old rules in the back as "Alternate Rules," with all new fifth-edition changes marked for easy reference by returning Talisman fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside the gorgeous redone artwork featured all over the game, much of the rest of Talisman Fifth Edition’s design and aesthetic feels dated and could use some updates to help with accessibility. Text on the board and cards is very small, and the fact that all text is always facing outwards means that no one, regardless of where they are seated, will ever be able to read all of the spaces on the board. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Inside the rule book, there are descriptions of all of the spaces, but a player aid – a fairly common component in modern games – that has them listed instead would have been a great help, and is honestly something I plan to print out and keep in my game box. Even the stat tracking cones – a hallmark of the Talisman series – feel like they could have benefitted from a bit of a refresh too. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Besides from a colorblind standpoint, being able to tell the difference between the ever so slightly large cones and the smaller ones was troublesome even up close on your own board, let alone across the table to gauge the other player’s stats. I get that it’s part of the game’s identity, but perhaps having each stat be a different shape, add some sort of stylized texture, or even just making the difference in size more easily distinguishable, would have gone a long way. Maybe a premium component add-on will come out one day that tweaks this and gives us some good coins too; worst case, there’s always 3D printing and the fan community.</p></div><div catalogid="6829f5e1-68bd-4ab1-800a-648a28062f38" id="218533"><div id="218533" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Talisman Alliances: Fate Beckons Expansion</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of add-ons, the Talisman games are known for their plethora of expansions (see our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/talisman-board-game-buying-guide">Talisman buying guide</a>), and while it's still early in this edition’s lifecycle, its first expansion does something no other Talisman expansion has done – introduce a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">co-op mode</a>. Talisman Alliances (<a href="https://zdcs.link/aoXKMv?object_uuid=358aae6e-83d9-49c7-9358-a1f1f6c97f98&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">see at Amazon</a>) transforms the base game into a campaign/legacy-light experience, featuring five Trials that players work together to overcome, earning rewards they can carry forward. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With envelopes and small boxes to open, my friends and I enjoyed this tweak to the formula, as it nudges the game slightly toward <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-strategy-board-games">strategy</a>. We could plan how to tackle objectives, trade amongst ourselves to optimize our chances, and watch as the Doom Track made the game progressively more challenging. I wasn’t as fond of swapping out cards from the main Talisman deck before playing, but it's a small inconvenience, and Alliances’ rulebook provides clear instructions on how to reset your game to stock Talisman when you’re done.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite releasing in 2024, Talisman Fifth Edition feels very much rooted in the past – for better and for worse. Some may find its mechanics outdated, while others may view them as faithful adaptations of what has kept Talisman alive for over 40 years. I land somewhere in the middle, wishing the game relied less on dumb luck and rewarded strategic play more, while also appreciating the new fifth-edition rules that make it a kinder, faster experience. The Alliances expansion also makes Talisman a fine gateway game into the adventure board game genre – made even more appealing by its reasonable retail price.</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Apr 11, 2025 6:00 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Talisman: The Magical Quest Game continues to weave its spell on players, challenging them to seize the Crown of Command and rule. While it may not find its way into my regular game-night rotation, it’s a game I’d be happy to introduce to friends, and I’m eager to see what future expansions bring. Until then, the Talismans and the Crown of Command will rest safely on my shelf – waiting for the next ruler to be crowned.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The question that has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/3/24286842/nintendo-alarmo-doom-hack-usb-custom-firmware-instructions">challenged tinkerers</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/12/15/13971784/doom-2-optimus-maximus-keyboard-working-hack">hardware hackers</a> for years has now come full circle. <a href="https://limitedrungames.com/products/doom-doom-ii-will-it-run-edition-switch-ps5-xbox-pc">Limited Run Games has announced a new collector’s edition</a> of the iconic first-person shooter that ships in a box that itself can play <em>Doom</em> on a built-in screen.</p></div><p>The <em>Doom</em> plus<em> Doom II</em> Will It Run Edition, available in Switch, Xbox, PS5, and PC versions, will be available for preorder starting on Friday, April 18th, 2025 at 10:00AM ET. It’s being limited to just 666 units, naturally, at a price of $666.66. When asked if the steep but fitting price tag would be affected by tariffs, Alex Verrey, an LRG spokesperson, told <em>The Verge</em> in an email that “I do not believe there are any plans at this time to change the pricing due to tariffs.”</p><p>Although a $29.99 Standard Edition and a $99.99 Big Box Edition will also be available, the Will It Run Edition includes an assortment of extra games, levels, gameplay upgrades, and add-ons that could justify the expensive collection for <em>Doom</em>’s biggest fans. But it’s the other accessories that will be its biggest selling point.</p><p>In addition to the <em>Doom</em>-playing box, the Will It Run Edition includes four hours of the game’s soundtrack on four cassette tapes (despite audio CDs existing long before the original <em>Doom</em> launched), a three-inch Cacodemon figurine that floats atop a magnetic base, and a pack of random trading cards. But the pièce de résistance is a <em>Doom</em>-playing handheld shaped like a Cacodemon with several of its teeth doubling as controller buttons. Let’s hope LRG decides to sell that on its own one day.</p><p>On the games side of things, the Will It Run Edition includes <em>Doom</em>, <em>Doom II</em>, <em>TNT: Evilution</em>, <em>The Plutonia Experiment</em>, <em>Master Levels for Doom II</em>, <em>No Rest for the Living</em>, <em>Sigil</em> and <em>Sigil II</em>, a new Deathmatch pack with 25 maps, and <em>Legacy of Rust</em> which was released just last year. The games also feature enhancements such as alternate soundtracks, upgraded visuals, modern controller support with gyroscopic aiming, new accessibility options, and eight new translations including Korean, simplified and traditional Chinese, Portuguese, and Polish.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I think they’re doing that. I think that’s in the works.” Jumping from them definitively doing it to a bit of uncertainty likely means he doesn’t really know if it’s actually happening, but there’s also the small chance he realized he might’ve spoiled a Disney surprise and quickly changed course.<br></p><p>Whether it’s definitive or not, the epochal sci-fi franchise has flirted with elements of horror for its entire 48-year history. Darth Vader using the Force to choke someone nearly to death without touching him is what Michael Myers would’ve done if he was a Sith. Although we didn’t see it on screen, Anakin Skywalker killing a bunch of child Jedi-in-training was bone-chilling. There’s also <em>Death Troopers</em>, a 2009 horror novel written by Joe Schreiber set in the <em>Star Wars</em> universe in which a virus outbreak leads to a zombie takeover. To be honest, I don’t know what’s been taking them so long to adapt that novel into a Jordan Peele-directed screamfest. </p><p>This news probably excited <em>Star Wars</em> fans who will take whatever they can get from a galaxy far, far away, and enraged <em>Star Wars </em>fans who want to preserve the more sunny space-opera quality of this fictional universe. Either way, Gilroy put the idea out in the world. Let’s just see if it comes to fruition. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>'s enormous final content update - which has been undergoing public stress testing for a good few months now on PC - finally has a release date, and is launching for Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and PC next Tuesday, 15th April.
</p>
<p>
Patch 8 was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-is-getting-new-subclasses-cross-play-and-more-next-year">unveiled last November</a>, with developer Larian Studios promising some major final additions before it waved goodbye to Baldur's Gate 3 and moved onto pastures new. These included cross-play, a photo mode, the l<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3s-patch-8-adds-long-awaited-split-screen-co-op-for-xbox-series-s">ong-awaited addition of split-screen co-op on Xbox Series S</a>, and most significant of all, new subclasses for each of the game's 12 existing classes.
</p>
<p>
It seemed like quite the parting gift, then, but rather than slinging it at fans and calling it a day, Larian announced Patch 8 would initially undergo public testing ahead of a full release so it could  "catch things before they [could] become an issue once a patch has been released."

<p>
Testing eventually got underway at the end of January <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3s-eagerly-awaited-patch-8-out-now-on-ps5-but-larian-says-it-shouldnt-be">after a bit of a premature start</a> and, following a steady period of finessing, the end is now firmly in sight. Larian <a href="https://x.com/baldursgate3/status/1910709438018998733">confirmed Patch 8's 15th April arrival in post on social media</a>, noting it'll be marking the occasion with a special <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> stream a day later, taking an especially close look at its new subclasses.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, it's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1086940/Baldurs_Gate_3/">discounting the acclaimed RPG by 20 percent on Steam</a> ahead of Patch 8's full release, meaning anyone yet to leap onboard the Baldur's Gate 3 appreciation train can pick it up for £39.99 until 21st April. Which is a bargain route to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-gives-baldurs-gate-3s-withers-a-pair-of-big-naturals-to-celebrate-100m-mod-downloads">Withers' "big naturals"</a>, if you ask me.
</p>
<p>
As to what Larian's doing next, that's still something of a mystery. Last year, the studio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larians-next-game-wont-be-a-baldurs-gate-3-sequel-dlc-or-anything-with-dungeons-dragons">confirmed it would moving away from Baldur's Gate and Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a> entirely, teasing its new project would be "big and ambitious", and "new in the sense that it is different from the things that we've done before."
</p>
<p>
But while Larian is moving onto new things, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-mammoth-success-drives-larian-to-bumper-207m-pre-tax-profit-for-2023">Baldur's Gate 3's remarkable success</a> inevitably has Dungeons and Dragons owner Wizard of the Coast already dreaming of a sequel. Last April, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wizards-of-the-coast-now-talking-to-lots-of-partners-about-next-baldurs-gate">confirmed it was "now talking to lots of partners"</a> about the next <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/baldurs-gate">Baldur's Gate</a> game, but later <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hasbro-wants-baldurs-gate-4-but-isnt-in-a-hurry">insisted it wasn't "in a hurry" to get a fourth instalment made</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/xalavier-nelson-interview-strange-scaffold-el-paso-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Xalavier Nelson Jr might not be a household name, but you’ve probably seen him around. Maybe via one of the many, many games from his studio Strange Scaffold, like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1876590/I_Am_Your_Beast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>I Am Your Beast</em></a>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/clickolding-review-impressions-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Clickolding</em></a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1507780/Space_Warlord_Organ_Trading_Simulator/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator</em></a>, or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1546310/El_Paso_Elsewhere/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>El Paso Elsewhere</em></a> – the latter of which saw him voice the main character and create <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2612330/El_Paso_Elsewhere_The_Rap_Album/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an entire rap album</a> for the soundtrack. Maybe on <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@writnelson" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TikTok</a>, where he dispenses legitimately useful game development advice with an energy I can only describe as frantic. Or perhaps at an event like GDC, where he’s everywhere and nowhere all at once.&nbsp;</p><p>As I approached Nelson for an interview in San Francisco’s oasis-like Yerba Buena Gardens last month, another developer recognized him and blurted out what we were all thinking “Xalavier, man! I don’t know how you do it!”</p><p>This is how Xalavier Nelson does it.</p><p><strong>Aftermath: One tie that binds all of Strange Scaffold's otherwise very different games is a dedication to a tight, focused scope. How do you maintain that scope, even as game development shifts and unexpected things inevitably happen?</strong></p><p><strong>Nelson:</strong> I think something that has become very prominent as a lot of our leg weights – to use anime terminology – have been taken off, is that developers and publishers and investors have increasingly leaned into an environment where developers are trained to make games but not to ship them. And that's a very subtle distinction that's so important, because when you are shipping a game, when you have ten months left, six months left, four months left, you do think about your priorities, what quality means, and how that quality will manifest for a player in a completely different perspective than someone who is working on the game.&nbsp;</p><p>I think I'm confident that this is a big reason why crunch – or overtime, or whatever you want to call it – is still so prevalent in the medium, is because we are entering the point where we start thinking about shipping a game while the game is in production, potentially close to launch, instead of at the beginning of the game's origin. So what [Strange Scaffold does] is not rocket science. We have our time. We have our budget. I spend a significant amount of time knowing exactly what I want from the new vision of the game and even potentially the tools to make it. I start slowly pulling in team members to validate those assumptions and to talk about how we would achieve that goal. And then from moment one, we are focused on finding bit by bit how to ship that game.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>Now that our leg weights are off, a lot of the instincts for what it means to ship a game and ship it consistently and at a high quality have been lost with it, and it's resulted in systemic breakdowns at every level of the process.</p></blockquote></figure><p>This has been scary to do, obviously, but we've also become increasingly transparent with talking about that process as it shifts, as the game moves towards ship. So <em>Creepy Redneck Dinosaur Mansion 3</em>, we originally advertised it as as a match-3 survival-horror comedy RPG. We got a wonderful play test in December where our play testers said that the story was great, the mechanics were engaging and novel, and the art was beautiful, but that no one knew what the fuck they were playing. It had no unifying structure or framework for players to understand what the game there was and what it meant for them to be moving through it.&nbsp;</p><p>And so really confronting that alongside the team, a one-hour meeting became a three-hour meeting. We saw based off of our development timeline [that the clock was ticking]. This was December, so we said, “OK, based off where we are, we have about 24 hours to figure out what we do with that.” We assembled a fallback plan. We all broke for 24 hours. I set some additional constraints of what this solution would need to satisfy and what the original creative goals for the project were to guide what that solution was. </p><p>One of our designers, Dan Pearce, came up with a Metroidvania structure to tie it all together, and that would utilize what we already had, but give it a unifying structure and metaphor for the player to move through. And we all thought that was really cool. And 24 hours later, we had a solution, the game continued development, and I made a public TikTok talking about how our genre changed and how we could call it Matchroidvania.&nbsp;</p><p>There was a time in games where this was more common and more public. Well, maybe not public, but there's a time in games where this was more common because, [for example], the PS3 is launching in two years. You only have a console generation. You only have this much time or this much memory that a gaming console can give you. Now that our leg weights are off, a lot of the instincts for what it means to ship a game and ship it consistently and at a high quality have been lost with it, and it's resulted in systemic breakdowns at every level of the process.</p><p><strong>Aftermath: You say this used to happen a lot, and I think it still does. It's just that it tends to come out for bigger games as an expose after the fact, as opposed to during development as an act of transparency. You hear about what happened to</strong><strong><em> Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em></strong><strong> and how it was functionally multiple entirely different games over the course of development, a couple of which were scrapped almost entirely, with parts eventually fashioned into the so-so game we ultimately got. It seems like you believe in communicating that as it's occurring, instead of keeping it under wraps and hoping no one ever finds out.</strong></p><p><strong>Nelson: </strong>Yes, because also, with how quickly we make games, we couldn't market the game at all if we weren't going to let our discussion around the game encounter the public sphere as well. So my hope is, as we continue to be more transparent, as we talk about genre shifts and about learnings and about successes and failures, players will see our games as the things that they are and that all games are – which is a collection of choices made by artists, rather than as a product that has either succeeded or failed in their eyes. Because the former gives us a conversation. It gives us all a place to grow from. The latter is kind of a bland race towards whatever is the newest outlier that will capture our attention before we're left waiting for something to give us life again.</p><p><strong>Aftermath: You talked about the idea of succeeding or failing, and that’s become a big part of video game discourse. There's all this discussion around “dead” games, games that didn't sell enough, or their Steam numbers aren't doing well. And one thing that you guys have also done that's unique is, you’ve started letting players – and even prospective buyers – know when you’ve moved on from games, when you’ve stopped updating them. You're like “Yeah, this is a completed project in our eyes. We're moving on to the next thing. We have to by necessity.” How have people received that?</strong></p><p><strong>Nelson: </strong>There has been, I'd say, overall, more of an appreciation for us to be honest about it, given that games live on the internet pretty much forever and now, which is a beautiful, newer trend. People are coming back to <em>An Airport For Aliens Run By Dogs</em> for the first time. And that's wonderful, but it means that there needs to be a communication element of “This is new for you; for us, we're working on our 16th, 17th and 18th games right now. If you find a bug, that's a delightful quirk of the game as it exists, and it's good, and we've moved on, and that is natural and normal and right.”</p><p>There will always be some grumbling about that in the live-service world, but I've found, overall, more players are receptive to having it concretely explained, rather than waiting for, even, say, a game breaking bug. I remember when I played a game on PS2 or Xbox, and I looked online, it was like, “Hh, this is just a bug that's here forever now.” Rather than that being a fact of the times or never communicated, and just sitting here waiting and hoping that the thing gets better, I find that most people appreciate the transparency. </p><figure><blockquote><p>A lot of incentives in game development and a lot of strategies around game development right now, especially from larger entities, are focused on treating both their developers and their audience as little like people as possible.</p></blockquote></figure><p>They appreciate being treated like people, and a lot of incentives in game development and a lot of strategies around game development right now, especially from larger entities, are focused on treating both their developers and their audience as little like people as possible. Because then that makes these groups into little discrete chunks that you can solve, rather than as people who in a conversation can talk back to you and can have a meaningful input.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Aftermath: Right, and you were mentioning that you’re on your 16th, 17th and 18th games. You publish a lot of TikToks. You do many, many things. Can you walk me through a day in your life? How do you accomplish all of this without going insane?</strong></p><p><strong>Nelson:</strong> I sleep six to eight hours. I wake up roughly 10 minutes before my first meeting. I read my Bible and pray and in some cases, beg for just, just for sanity, and I'm doing a lot of admin around the studio of going through emails, answering emails, chasing opportunities. I'm in meetings, collaborating with my fellow developers on solutions for things, reviewing material and figuring out what to do next. I am, yeah, doing a lot of feedback on things as they're brought in and talking about the vision of the game and whether or not something fits.</p><p>One to several times a week I'm making time for developers, either inside or outside of the studio, to talk to them about what they want to do with their lives or their studios outside of our own and ways we can either support, or that any of my experience can be relevant for, what they want to do next and how they want to do it. And then after all of that stuff is done, which brings us into 5pm, 6pm territory, I have dinner with my wife, we might relax for a little bit, and then I begin what we colloquially call Night Work, which is when I get to do writing and design and documentation that typically I don't have space for during the day, that helps unblock people for the next day.</p><p><strong>Aftermath: It strikes me that you are very multidisciplinary at this point. Some people would consider just doing the social media work that you do to be an entire job. Similarly, for </strong><strong><em>El Paso Elsewhere</em></strong><strong>, you learned how to rap, you did the soundtrack for that, or at least a substantial chunk of it. Where do you find the time to also do those things? Is that Night Work?</strong></p><p><strong>Nelson:</strong> It's Night Work. Sometimes it's day work. I'm constantly trying to calibrate my work-life balance as well, and I am treating that as a priority more than ever. But yeah, to run a studio like this in the way that I want, I know that, at least for the foreseeable future, there's no way I can have a standard 9-to-5. So finding a version of this that makes me happy and lets me be the type of person [I want to be] and show up for my family in the ways that I want, and treating that on a very individual, bespoke basis, has been the most useful thing, and that's what I try to provide for my collaborators as well.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>It is tough, and it does mean that a lot of hours fall on me, but it also means I live the life that I want to live, and now I'm deeply grateful because I recognize that most people don't get the chance to do that.</p></blockquote></figure><p>When I notice that someone has a working pattern, would they like to work at a giant burst and then rest? We have conversations inside the studio of how to support them in that way, rather than try to force them in a way that doesn't fit their creative style or their natural patterns: Produce one asset in these fixed hours and then get away from it and then come back, reducing their effectiveness and their happiness in the process. We will sometimes have conversations with people where, because of things outside of our studio, they're like, “I'm feeling burnt out. I'm feeling drained in this way or that way.” And we have a bespoke discussion of that. I see part of the development of the game, a critical piece of it, as in that moment, and when and how people feel comfortable and safe talking through what they need, what is needed from the game, what the game needs from them, and then working towards a bespoke way to address that.&nbsp;</p><p>And yeah, that same strategy applies to me. There's days that I can really lock in on writing, and I can even push back or eliminate meetings to create space to work. And then there's times that I'm mainly facilitating other people and reviewing other people's work and making that an ongoing discussion of that ratio. It is tough, and it does mean that a lot of hours fall on me, but it also means I live the life that I want to live, and now I'm deeply grateful because I recognize that most people don't get the chance to do that.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Aftermath: Honestly, relatable. That's the Aftermath cycle, too: never not working in some ways, but happy with what I'm doing.</strong></p><p><strong>Nelson:</strong> If you're addressing things in an individual way, you can also make space for things that matter to you, right? Me and my wife– her name is Brianne. She's a giant weeb. Coolest person who I've ever met, the most caring person I've met. Sorry, I think she's really cool.</p><p><strong>Aftermath: That's good. I'm glad that you're married to someone you like. That’s allegedly how it’s supposed to be.</strong></p><p><strong>Nelson: </strong>So one thing that really matters to us is dancing. I taught her how to dance, and we dance together. And so when I'm making a schedule for a weekend, when I'm working with my studio producer to figure out what my schedule looks like and what projects need, there's times where we'll shift some things so there will be a more intense time at the back end of the week to make space for us to dance together earlier in the week, and make space for this habit and this exercise that helps keep us sane in doing what we do otherwise. And speaking from the experience of having worked on over 100 games and worked in a lot of different ecosystems, environments that are far more rigid, I find myself so much happier getting to, on sometimes a daily basis, figure out what matters for me and my collaborators and fix that – rather than create a perfect spreadsheet that serves no one.</p><figure><figcaption>Strange Scaffold</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Aftermath: In establishing this kind of cadence, it sounds like this has been a process, something you arrived at. But I'm sure that you got there in fits and starts. Were there ever points at which you were close to burning out, or in the headspace of, “This just isn't workable. I've got to change this?”</strong></p><p><strong>Nelson:</strong> 2023. Studio nearly closes down. No one is really showing up for us in ways that I thought my track record would make easy to do, and the reason I burnt out wasn't even the workload, which is the funniest and worst part. The workload was not the thing that made me burn out, despite the fact that we were working on, like, six or eight projects at the time. Yeah, I think my peak was nine. That wasn't what caused my burnout: It was the existential load of feeling alone. It was the workload of not just doing the work to push projects forward, but also creating pitch documents and demo materials and doing meetings with external partners at all hours of the day and night to find funding. I call this the work on top of the work, and it's something I'm sure you're familiar with.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Aftermath: Yes, very.</strong></p><p><strong>Nelson: </strong>You love your job, but to make it happen, you now need to kind of crowdfund all the time, and you’ve gotta create documents for it and rewards–</p><p><strong>Aftermath: And advertising yourself. Building all the scaffolding that holds up your work, basically.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Nelson:</strong> And for a while, Strange Scaffold had a good scaffolding for making things, but when I confronted every situation in which I needed to do additional work to keep the scaffolding even present, it nearly broke me in the process. I went through practically an ego death of having my values challenged and figuring out what we cared about, and this was chronicled in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69Ukg2BqIk0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the documentary we did with Noodle last year</a>. We gave him access to our entire archives to chronicle the story of <em>Bass Reeves Can’t Die</em>. He got to read everything in that server to chronicle the entire history of that project, including our recorded meetings.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="how does an indie game get made?" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/69Ukg2BqIk0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>I'm really proud of that documentary for a few reasons, but one of them just being that, like, that's a typical indie game story, and that's the part that we don't budget for when we talk about a 40-hour week. What does it mean to avoid burning out when you are fighting for your very survival? The additional workload of getting the tools to use to survive, that can break you. By the time <em>El Paso</em> <em>Elsewhere </em>came out, I was fairly confident we wouldn't be able to make another game, and I was almost excited to be free from carrying the burden of the studio.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Aftermath: How did you get through that period? How did you come out the other</strong> <strong>end?&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Nelson: </strong>Honestly, getting my values rearranged was enormous. I really found a new relationship with my faith. I've always been a Christian, but really being able to recenter those values in the context of games. Like, it's really easy to start idolizing an IGF [award] or a certain sales number or concurrent users, so getting my values rearranged by that time, and being open to whatever God had for me next, I think, was critical.&nbsp;</p><p>I think finding someone who would, by the grace of God, show up for us [also made a huge difference]. At the time I was working, on top of all the stuff for the studio, to keep the studio open because no funding was coming in, I was taking every freelance job I could get. And one of those jobs was on a project called <em>Pillow Champ</em> by Frosty Pop Games. I was telling Faisal Sethi, the founder of the studio, we were very surprised when we started working with each other, because we found in our conversations, we were the only two people who worked like each other that we had ever found.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>What I wasn't asking the industry to do was fund one game. I was asking them to believe in how I made games.</p></blockquote></figure><p>And I was telling him about my next project after <em>El Paso</em> – how it was gonna be a UI-based horror-fantasy kidnapping sim. I knew exactly how the game would work and how I'd scope it – and [I was saying] that after <em>El Paso</em> came out, if I decide to make a game ever again, here's the thing: It'd be beautiful, because no one would ever fund it, but I'd probably be able to do it without funding. And he thought about it for a second and said “I would fund that.” And that resulted in the five-game deal we've done that has now extended beyond that with games like<em> Creepy Redneck Dinosaur Mansion III</em>.</p><p>What I wasn't asking the industry to do was fund one game. I was asking them to believe in how I made games. And even when people saw our results and liked those, they didn't tend to also believe in our process, at least in a tangible way that resulted in them supporting our livelihoods. So Faisal showing up specifically for my process, and to the degree of doing a five-game deal and then going beyond that, because he believed in how I work and who I am as a creator, was [game changing]. Even if we’d gotten, say, a multi-million dollar deal for <em>El Paso</em>, that was the type of being seen that I have been waiting for my past decade working in the development side of this industry. So, yeah, Frosty Pop showing up was part of that value realignment, and finding acceptance of ego death and freedom in that was part of that.</p><p><strong>Aftermath: When you say “ego death,” what do you mean in this specific case?</strong></p><p><strong>Nelson: </strong>Ego Death is, from what I understand the term to mean, when your sense of self has been so utterly challenged or revised that you were kind of just left a blob that can start to emerge into a different shape in an ideal circumstance. So I'm in a shape that looks a lot like how I did look before, but I'm a little weirder. I'm deeply grateful, and I am unwilling to participate in any ecosystem that does not substantially allow me to perpetuate the values I believe in anymore.</p><p><strong>Aftermath: That was the first time you felt like you had really been seen in terms of your process, which seems to matter to you more, almost, than the individual games that come out of it. What do you feel sets your process apart or differentiates it from what other people in the industry do?&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Nelson:</strong> I think a lot of people have a lot of amazing processes. The more their processes align with who they are as creators, I think the better it goes. Landfall Games with the wild and amazing often multiplayer games they make like <em>Content Warning</em> and now <em>Haste </em>coming out, they make games that are totally aligned with who they are in ways that make sense for them. I don't know if you know the story of <em>Content Warning</em>, but they went for a vacation in Korea for a month to just make that game, and then they had rest and downtime afterwards. So a very focused game production process, and even some of the ways that they set up the business to enable them to come together and then rest, come together and then rest to make these games is what works for them as people and what produces games that people love.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>I'm not here to make games. I'm here to ship them. If we're not moving towards ship, I don't want to make that game.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Larian makes the giant games that it does, where other people crash against the rocks trying to handle them, because of longstanding teams that they kept together and incredible toolsets they build over time, but also [by] not working in any circumstance or with any partner that compromises their values, the values that allow them to make what they do. I don't think anything Strange Scaffold does is particularly groundbreaking, but the thing that every process echoes and supports is this constant balance between pragmatism and creativity. I'm not here to make games. I'm here to ship them. If we're not moving towards ship, I don't want to make that game. If I don't know what it would look like for a game to ship from beginning to end, we don't begin production.&nbsp;</p><p>So the discipline of Strange Scaffold – of us having the playtest where no one knows what game we're making, for me to come in as creative director and kind of set that hard limit of “This game is coming out April 22, what is the solution that fits the time we have?” – I think that's something that's really hard for a lot of people to let go. They want everything they make to be perfect. I want everything I make to be good and intentional – and to let me and everyone else make our next best thing, the next thing our players didn't know they needed, which means I can let go of individual perfection and make games happen.</p><p><strong>Aftermath: That type of timeline sounds pretty rigid, and I think that from the outside looking in, somebody who follows games would be like, “OK, they’ll definitely need to crunch at some point in the cycle.” You were talking about 2023 and all the extra work you took on at the time to keep the studio afloat. Is that kind of how it happens when things go wrong? Do you personally take on a lot of extra work to fill in the gaps? Does it splash back on the team? What do you do in a worst case scenario?&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Nelson:</strong> Sometimes there is crunch. Because we work part-time, there's not usually [all-encompassing] weeks, but we’re adding to people’s weeks. I'm very cognizant that if someone’s working 20 hours for us, if they start putting in 40 hours, that’s crunch – on top of whatever your life is, even if you do nothing else, because it's more than what we believed and scoped the game to try to be.&nbsp;</p><p>So it's taken a variety of forms, but it's part of why I've gotten more rigid in my perspective over time and more open in my solutions. So I will sometimes stand in conflict with my team to make sure that six months from now, we don't have to crunch ourselves into oblivion to make the version of the game that is being tentatively discussed, and I've tried to refine my approach to get better and better at spotting when a version of a game is being discussed that [would cause that issue]. </p><figure><blockquote><p><em>I Am Your Beast</em>, to be completely transparent, was a situation where I feel as a creative director a lot of things got away from me.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Whenever something goes wrong, it can take a variety of fashions; it has taken a variety of fashions, unfortunately. But the approach of each project we plan is in the aggressive, discipline-led way. It's aggressive positivity of, like, “I love making games – and making games that fit into our lives – so much that I won't let you put this cool thing into the game that challenges that.”</p><p><strong>Aftermath: Did anything like that happen on, for example, </strong><strong><em>I Am Your Beast</em></strong><strong>? That game seems very rigidly scoped, very clear in its vision. How did you have to pare it down in order to achieve that?&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Nelson: </strong><em>I Am Your Beast</em>, to be completely transparent, was a situation where I feel as a creative director a lot of things got away from me. A lot of those things are communication patterns that have been refined since. I thought it was very well scoped and rigid in its intention. The team was within the constraints we had. Originally, the game had you dipping in and out of stealth to do things. And we found that, the less stealth we had in the game, the better it got. So we just removed it entirely.</p><p>I thought all those things pointed towards a game that would have a smooth road to launch, but as was seen publicly, we ended up having to delay, and that was for a few reasons. One of them was people saw how busy I was across the studio; they didn't want to talk to me about what was happening in the game. And there's always other things happening in the studio; I think a term used for this is “vision attracted by movement.” I was like, “Oh, I guess everything is moving smoothly, and we're just making the game that we scoped and discussed. Cool.” I didn't realize that, outside of my field of vision, there were ways that the game was increasing in scope that weren't visible on the top level but, in the final game, I think can absolutely be seen.&nbsp;</p><p>I think that lack of context led to points where when I was told, “Hey, it's taking a long time for our horde-style levels to come together, it's going to take this or that,” [and] when I asked questions, I was like, “That still sounds like you can do it. Let's make any adjustments we need to to make sure that we can still provide this alternative mission style in the game.” What I should have done, and what I would have done with more personal attention paid to different pieces of dev process, is identify [like] “We've been trying to make this feature work alongside other work for three months. When we're making a game in nine months, we should have just cut that feature a month and a half in.” If it isn’t coming together, you will find a cool thing to do to add variety. This wasn't worth burning that time on, especially, and I should have listened more to my team members when they threw up that flag.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Strange Scaffold</figcaption></figure><p>We had, like, a midmortem on that project, because when we missed our launch date, there was a real reckoning. [Team members] were like “We trust your ability to ship so much that when you told us everything would be OK, we just kept doing it.” There was not a whole lot of communication that happened, and then some of that communication got obfuscated, and I didn't make calls to cut features or change focus as soon as I should have. That led to that game being very well scoped and knowing exactly what it is, but invisibly having both crunch and, I would say, effort that didn't tangibly result in a significantly greater experience for the player.&nbsp;</p><p>When I see something like that and see that <em>Beast </em>did great, I don't go like, “Ah well, that's fine in the future.” When I heard the rumblings of “This feature is taking a while” [on another game], I'm instantly like “What do you mean? Taking a while? I thought it would be a week. What's happening there?” Or when we get the play test results, I am more instant. Previously, I felt things would work themselves out.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>It was the risk that I wanted. The systems you set up give you the life that you live in. You can only hope it's the life that you want to live.</p></blockquote></figure><p>So starting from the place of discipline, becoming more disciplined over time, and trying to do that in a way that still allows people to feel agency and joy in their work, it's a constant collaboration. But I think if you speak to other people at Strange Scaffold, a lot of folks would say that they like the games they make. They get to make different types of games because of the scale we work at. And it's really nice to see those games ship.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Aftermath: How big is Strange Scaffold? How many people work for the studio, and how is it structured?</strong></p><p><strong>Nelson:</strong> Each team is its own individual size. But the number of people in the server is over 80. Very few of those people are working at the same time. At one point the server was over 100 people. But [by] the end of <em>I Am Your Beast, </em>a bunch of people had done, stone soup-style, their little bit, but at the end, there were, like, four or five people left in the room. It fluctuates based on project.</p><p><strong>Aftermath: How do you handle pay and crediting?</strong></p><p><strong>Nelson: </strong>We credit anyone if they do any work on the game ever. And for pay, we pay people hourly. So everyone else gets paid hourly, and I hope that the game sells so that I can also eat.&nbsp;</p><p>It was the risk that I wanted. The systems you set up give you the life that you live in. You can only hope it's the life that you want to live. I didn't want anyone to risk not being able to feed their kids because they're working on a game called <em>An Airport For Aliens Currently Run By Dogs</em>. So there’s an explicit understanding: Even if the game goes bad, you'll still get paid. It's on me. But that also means the next time we have a conversation about scope, I'm going to be bringing my every experience I've had with this to bear – to push back on even a cool thing, to preemptively make sure we never get [to a bad place] again. All of that is part of an ongoing collaborative discussion that I think is crucial to shipping games, and I would hope that all of my peers can and do have.</p><p><strong>Aftermath: On paper, it sounds like this kind of rigidity and process is almost at odds with the idea of making something weird, or even, as you said, having agency within the company – at least, if you’re not the guy in charge. Do you think that people's ability to have agency within Strange Scaffold stems from the scope of games that you make? This model of making so many that you can go through loads of different ideas, as opposed to the current triple-A model of, “OK, we've got this game we're going to create. It'll be huge. It's going to take eight years, and we've got to do things in the safest way possible to ensure we get a return on investment?”</strong></p><p><strong>Nelson:</strong> First of all, as we've seen from a lot of exposes and so on, an eight-year game is usually a two-to-three-year game that took six years to get to or find. Second thing is, creativity thrives within constraints, but there is some buckwild narrative that has emerged in games over time that if you have no constraints on you, you'll make better art. We know that this has not been the case over time. <em>Batman: Arkham Asylum</em> versus <em>Suicide Squad</em> being examples of a team with constraints and a team who is under the pressure to recoup hundreds of millions of dollars, I think, is a great example of that. So I think the creativity that people – that at least <em>I</em> – feel at Strange Scaffold comes from a freedom that’s granted by scale. You see this in film as well. You can take bigger swings on a thing when it's smaller, typically.</p><p>In full transparency, we made <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</em> in 18 months with a budget of less than $300,000. When you're making a game that's smaller than the size of a single commercial campaign for <em>TMNT</em>, you get to kill off Splinter and Shredder. You get to do a turn-based game. Whereas, if you were spending $5 million, they'd say, “Can you do something like <em>Shredder’s Revenge</em>?” You earn back the ability to be interesting the tighter and more efficient your cycle is. <em>Clickolding </em>can exist because it was a game built in a month and a half. And the world in which it doesn't exist is the world in which you need $200,000.</p><p><strong>Aftermath: And it has gacha mechanics.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Nelson:</strong> And it has gacha mechanics! I think it's something that should be paid attention to, but is because it's not, we're finding a lot of quite muddled project rights now – indie games, double-A games, and triple-A games that seem like they’re on the cusp of providing this unique experience, but by virtue of the context into which they're pressured to exist, they have to put in the gacha mechanics. They have to put in the long-term engagement things, or keep in the stealth mechanics, because, well, will someone buy this if it doesn't let you solve a problem any way [you want]? I remember that was a big conversation that we collectively were having as journalists when <em>Watch Dogs 2</em> came out, where it was like “Man, this is a game that seems calibrated in every way to have a nonviolent protagonist, but because of the context in which he exists, he has to be able to have a shotgun or assault rifle.”&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>Creativity thrives within constraints, but there is some buckwild narrative that has emerged in games over time that if you have no constraints on you, you'll make better art.</p></blockquote></figure><p>I want to pay attention to that stuff, and I want to share with audiences by talking about that stuff publicly. Yes, you don't get to play as all four Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles at the same time. But because of the limitations of our engine and the budgetary and timeline constraints of our game, you get to experience a story and a gameplay dynamic you never would have otherwise. We want to invite people to have a conversation with us on that level. And it's been so freeing and gratifying to see people embrace that. I think people do want a conversation in this time, rather than a one-sided product where they press a button to say whether they connect with it or not.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Aftermath: It occurs to me that the ecosystem in which a lot of this is happening is Steam. Back in the day, it was possible on Steam for somebody to release a big indie game and then go into the lab for, like, four years or whatever, release another game, and find success, because the field was smaller and everything was less algorithmic. Whereas now you can have this one success, and then years later, put out another game – a very good game! – and people have just forgotten you. Either they literally forgot you, or you’re encountering a new generation of players who never played your first game. It means nothing to them. And so it occurs to me that, in releasing so many games, Strange Scaffold is able to pave over some of those gaps and stay fresh in people’s minds. Your studio name – rather than a specific game or series – can be your calling card even in an era when that’s become increasingly difficult.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Nelson:</strong> One of the things, from the foundation of the studio, that I was thinking about is when I connect with a filmmaker or a film writer or a musician, not only do they have a lot of stuff I can look at, the way in which they produce things means that I can have a conversation with their wider body of work and get really nerdy about the difference between <em>After Hours </em>and <em>Killers Of The Flower Moon</em> in a way that one singular project never gives you. Games have existed in times where that's possible, but for the most part, because of the miraculous scale we're able to exist at, have moved away from that relationship and that conversation.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Strange Scaffold</figcaption></figure><p>So if we're going to talk very directly and transparently about <em>TMNT,</em> if we're going to talk about going up against <em>Shredder’s Revenge</em>, I never want to go up against<em> Shredder’s Revenge</em>. No one can beat <em>Shredder’s Revenge</em>, and I wouldn't want to try. But I would love to be in conversation with it. I would love someone to play Shredder’s Revenge and then play our game and then see that we've made a bunch of stuff, and then say, “How did all the things those developers made before translate into this thing?”&nbsp;</p><p>As you said, we exist in a world where outlier success will always occur, and it occurs for more people than it ever has, numbers wise. But there's such a higher ratio of people that <em>that </em>ratio gets smaller and smaller. You can turn this into a more complicated thing, a situation in which an artist is only allowed to say one thing ever, even as a potentiality, is desperate and sickening and sad. And when I started my studio, I knew that was not a route I ever wanted to go down. I didn't want to make one magnum opus. If even <em>El Paso Elsewhere</em> had been my magnum opus, I never would have made<em> I Am Your Beast</em>, right? Never would have made <em>Clickolding</em>. And I want to exist in a world where I produce all those other things, not the single knockout punch that gets all the awards.</p><p><strong>Aftermath: In that context, doing a sequel to anything has got to be interesting, especially in terms of refining your process. You’re </strong><a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/el-paso-elsewhere/sequel-in-the-works" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>making a second</strong><strong><em> El Paso Elsewhere</em></strong></a><strong>. How are you applying the lessons you learned while making the first game – as well as the lessons you learned on something like </strong><strong><em>I</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong><em>Am Your Beast</em></strong><strong>?</strong></p><p><strong>Nelson:</strong> One of the things that I've embraced for that is that certain parts of the game should be done before we even build other pieces to allow for a shorter dev cycle. So we're making the rap album far in advance of the levels being locked for the game. Because if we have a finished rap album already, you don't have one thing that resulted in crunch on <em>El Paso Elsewhere</em>, where a piece of music gets done, it inspires people to do a thing, which inspires the music to change again, and it becomes a loop.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>I want to be making games when I'm 60. And the world in which games are currently made and the process in which we currently make them – and frankly, the way in which even Strange Scaffold can still sometimes build games – won't allow that to happen.</p></blockquote></figure><p>I'm surprised that game launched in as stable of a state as it did. We were doing ‘round the clock days “inspiring” each other. But what I saw as a studio head was “We are crunching each other into the ground right now, and I never want this to happen again.” So we're making certain pieces of the game ahead of other processes.&nbsp;</p><p>We're making a successor to <em>Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator</em> right now as well and really digging into how this process and this rigidity that hopefully provides the constraints that enable creativity will give us a foundation to figure out what we really care about for this game to say, so that when we hit either player feedback or issues along the way, we'll be able to even more concisely address those issues without blowing our scope and causing us to have to be forced to live an unhealthy work-life balance to get the game out the door.&nbsp;</p><p>I want to be making games when I'm 60. And the world in which games are currently made and the process in which we currently make them – and frankly, the way in which even Strange Scaffold can still sometimes build games – won't allow that to happen, right? And so I'm not going to stop until I find the processes that let me still be building multiple well-scoped games joyfully when I'm 60.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/wii-sports-was-free-because-reggie-fils-amie-fought-for-it-and-he-seems-to-think-nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-should-be-free-too/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>There's a lot of uproar around the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-impressions/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> and the prices of the console and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-game-prices-go-up-to-e90/">games.</a> One particular sticking point is the price of Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour, a tech demo that features a few mini-games and a hub area that explains new features in the Nintendo Switch 2 hardware.</p>
<p>It's like how Astro's Playroom takes players through what's new about the PS5, except Astro's Playroom was free and a full-blown 3D platformer with its mini-tech-demo games weaved into a few incredibly designed platforming levels. Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour doesn't look nearly as clever in its setup, nor do the mini-games look as good as the levels you get in Astro's Playroom.</p>
<p>So why is Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour not a free pack-in game with the console? Former Nintendo of America head Reggie Fils-Amié seems to have weighed in on why players are being asked to spend $10 USD on the title, referencing&nbsp;a specific point in his time with Nintendo.</p>
<p>Fils-Amié <a href="https://x.com/Reggie/status/1910052940242620563">shared</a> a few seemingly pointed clips from an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/clip/Ugkx40RySJYPlDe2emd37x4hRE_3A0emN5ax">IGN in 2022</a>&nbsp;when he released his book Disrupting the Game: From the Bronx to the Top of Nintendo. Fils-Amié shared three clips from the nearly 50-minute long interview that centered around how, during the development of the Nintendo Wii, Fils-Amié had to fight for Wii Sports to be a free pack-in game at launch.</p>
<p>When he first suggested to Nintendo legend Shigeru Miyamoto that Wii Sports be a free game, Miyamoto pushed back against the suggestion. Fils-Amié goes even further than to say that Miyamoto just 'pushed back,' emphasizing how upset the suggestion made Miyamoto.</p>
<p>"<em>It's an understatement to say that Mr. Miyamoto pushed back</em>," Fils-Amié began. "<em>Literally, when I first made this suggestion, Mr. Miyamoto said,' Reggie, Nintendo does not give away software for free. You don't understand how hard our developers work to create compelling content like this</em>.'"</p>
<p>Fils-Amié knew that wasn't true because he knew he got free software with his SNES growing up. He continued to argue his case about why he believed Wii Sports should come free with the console, and after its success, he made the same suggestion again with Wii Play, which upset Miyamoto again. Even after the success of Wii Sports being free, he was still very resistant to giving any software away for free alongside hardware.</p>
<p>So is Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour a paid title because Fils-Amié wasn't there to convince the rest of Nintendo, Miyamoto included, that they shouldn't charge for it? That's the kind of question we'll never know the answer to. Still, the fact that Fils-Amié chose to share this now three-year-old interview when players are debating and complaining about the cost of everything Nintendo Switch 2, including Welcome Tour, seems to explain the thinking that went into making Welcome Tour a paid title.</p>
<p>It also seems to be Fils-Amié pointing to a time when he was right about Nintendo making a piece of software free with the hardware. Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour would have likely benefited the Nintendo Switch 2 by being free, instead of its cost being another addition to the list of complaints players have about Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/jeremy-crawford-game-director-of-dungeons-dragons-is-leaving-wizards-of-ghost<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A second influential figure in <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> has announced his departure from Wizards of the Coast. Jeremy Crawford, the Game Director behind the recent and most popular edition of the iconic fantasy TTRPG, will be leaving the major tabletop company.</p>



<p>According to an official report by <a href="https://screenrant.com/jeremy-crawford-chris-perkins-leaving-dnd-interview/" rel="nofollow">Screen Rant</a>, Jeremy Crawford's last day at Wizards of the Coast will be at the end of this month. This announcement coincides with <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/christopher-perkins-retires-from-wizards-of-coast-after-28-years-working-on-dungeons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Christopher Perkins</a>, another major part of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, also leaving the company.</p>

Vice President of Franchise and Product Jess Lanzillo stated that Perkins's and Crawford's departure was something the company knew about in advance. In addition, both men were leaving the company of their own accord and not part of some sweeping corporate initiative.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"<em>Both of them have been working on Dungeons and Dragons for a very long time," Lanzillo said. "It's been a point of discussion for some time and something that we've been training up everyone for. They feel really good about the teams that they have in place and the legacy that they're passing on."</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Both Christopher Perkins and Jeremy Crawford's final project with Wizards of the Coast was overseeing the production of the new <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-5e-2024-player-handbook-review-mixed-messaging-around-strong" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">2024 core rulebooks</a>. These updated versions of Fifth Edition's core rulebooks have been praised for their updated, streamlined presentation of rules, but have drawn some ire from fans for feeling more like a rules update than a new edition.</p>

<p>The influence Jeremy Crawford has had on <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> cannot be overstated. Him overseeing the design of Dungeons &amp; Dragons has sent untold ripples through the TTRPG design community. He oversaw the introduction of Advantage/Disadvantage as a game mechanic, and streamlining rules complexity, lowering the barrier of entry for new players.</p>

<p>This design ethos has gone on to influence not just the TTRPG player community, but many in the tabletop design space. In addition to being the most successful edition of the game ever, Fifth Edition's emphasis on malleable, modular design has greatly aided the explosion of the actual play space as seen in <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dimension-20-titan-takedown-combines-tabletop-storytelling-with-pro-wrestling" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Dimension 20</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-concludes-campaign-3-with-epic-8-hour-finale-new-godly-exu-announced" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Critical Role</a>.</p>

<p>In addition, other TTRPG peers like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/cyberpunk-red-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Cyberpunk Red</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/vampire-masquerade-5th-edition-review-front-loaded-lore" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Vampire: The Masquerade</em></a> have also adopted scaling back rules complexity for broader appeal.</p>

<p>With Perkins and Crawford's departure from the company, the future of Dungeons &amp; Dragons is uncertain. While the 2024 rules helped refine an iconic foundation, these departures are happening alongside the severe scaling back (and employee layoffs) of their in-house VTT, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-lays-off-90-of-project-sigil-staff" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Project Sigil</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/when-you-write-about-games-gaming-for-yourself-is-liberating.1162218/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/games-journalism-gaming-for-yourself-liberating<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Being a writer in any reliably compensated position is rare and getting rarer. Reporting and media criticism is rarer still, and the number of people who get paid to write about video games specifically for more than poverty wages is so <a href="https://aftermath.site/video-games-journalism-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vanishingly small</a> that I’m guessing you could fit us all in a single building. “Thank your lucky stars” is often the refrain, and I thank them quite often. But work is still work, and that includes anything you play for work. But when you manage to sneak in some personal gaming time, that feeling is heavenly.</p><p>There are, of course, obvious benefits to being a games writer. You get games early and often free via code supplied by the publisher for coverage. Depending on the publisher, they’ll sometimes send a few for more than one person to play. You also get to play games early under embargo, giving you time to write your review or impressions or capture whatever assets are needed for your publication.</p><p>The process of being under embargo is multifaceted. On the one hand, there is a slight glee to seeing a game before the public does. At its worst, there can be a churlish “kid whose uncle works at Nintendo” smarminess that I have seen mediocre or deeply immature games writers engage in. In ideal circumstances, however, this gives you a more neutral slate to assess the work, before broader consensus sets in about the quality of the game.</p><p>But even when it’s all working, “The Embargo Zone” is an alien landscape. You could be given anywhere from several weeks to about a day to power through a game. Any game with a deadline puts the work in a different light.</p><p>There’s also certain games where the <a href="https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki/Hyperbolic_Time_Chamber" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hyperbolic time chamber</a> of an embargo is not a fair place to assess the totality of the work. I have written about this before when it comes to <a href="https://aftermath.site/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-hard-difficulty" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FromSoft games</a>, which only develop their true flavor and notes-based metatext when exposed to the constant, creative prodding of the public. A similar phenomenon happened to me when I covered <em>Death Stranding </em>for Kotaku: The only thing weirder than not being able to talk about what the hell that game was to anyone but my coworkers was seeing it barren, only to have its roads and structures built exclusively by people I’ve seen at Nintendo events.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The Embargo Zone can get fraught quickly if you are either a video producer or, god help you, a service journalist. People who do guides work hold up half of the sky; they’re like gaming’s first responders. It can be irritating enough to be a writer and have to take notes, constantly interrogating how you feel about a game. It’s entirely another thing to painfully document every single key, item drop rate, boss moveset and puzzle solution, often taking multiple screenshots and formatting that into something readable.</p><p>Capturing video of your gameplay and formatting it into something coherent under deadline also generally sucks, and as someone who is a video editor first I’m glad I am my own boss and I mostly don’t have to do that shit any more. Oftentimes, due to how little money is allotted to pay people in this industry, a single employee (although often a freelancer) is given the task of being not just a writer, video person or guides person, but one or more of those roles at the same time. Nothing can make an activity as supposedly fun as playing a video game miserable as fast as having to wear all three of those hats at the same time.&nbsp;</p><p>And even if you don’t “have” to play a game because you are assigned to do so, your game time is often commodified by the need to have something to talk or write about. If you’re on a podcast you know what I am talking about, and I think this is a feeling that Twitch streamers, YouTubers, and even just people who feel obligated to post about games know about all too well. Keeping up with the Joneses becomes a job unto itself, and the need to sculpt everything into that wretched word “content” taints your time, making it just a little more crass and performative than it normally would be.</p><p>I am not complaining: all of this is just the compromise I made with myself and this job. A huge portion of the people reading this have likely experienced some version of it in their field. But when I finally do get to just play a game for myself, assuming I am not burned out, the experience can be liberating.&nbsp;</p><p>Just playing a game when you game for work feels like a secret you keep from the boss in your brain, the voice you cobbled together from various editors and authority figures to push your career forward in an ever dwindling field. You’re not strip mining this for its constituent parts. You’re not optimizing your run, taking notes and screenshots to share later. You’re simply gaming for the sake of it, the way you did when you were a kid. You’re experiencing a thing that cannot be sold, that same transcendent sensation that made you want to write on a <a href="https://aftermath.site/1up-forum-posting-games-journalism-neogaf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">forum</a> or blog so many decades ago.</p><p><em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://aftermath.site/baseball-week-2025" target="_blank">Inside Baseball Week</a>&nbsp;is our annual week of stories about the lesser-known parts of game development, the ins and outs of games journalism, and a peek behind the curtain at Aftermath.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/south-of-midnight-is-a-game-worth-hollerin%E2%80%99-about.1162203/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/647143/south-of-midnight-review-xbox-compulsion-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Black folks are loud. We laugh loud, we love loud, we protest loud. But when we really want to show our approval, we get quiet first. When we laugh at something funny, like <em>really</em> laugh, it sounds like a thin wheeze before sound bursts forth like a storm. And within seconds of starting <em>South of Midnight</em>, as I walked around the protagonist Hazel’s home and seeing a piece of art that was an obvious and deliberate homage to the painter Annie Lee’s <a href="https://umojafinearts.com/products/blue-monday"><em>Blue Monday</em></a>, I wordlessly put my Steam Deck down and took a quiet lap around my living room before I started <em>shouting</em>.</p><p><em>South of Midnight</em> is the latest title from Compulsion Games, a Canadian studio best known for making <em>We Happy Few</em>. It follows Hazel, a young woman who must rescue her mother after a hurricane sweeps their home away. Along her journey, she comes into her powers as a Weaver, or guardians who can see the strands that connect all life in what’s known as the Grand Tapestry and can repair it when those strands get knotted by pain and trauma.</p><p>The game is an action platformer. Hazel progresses by using her Weaver abilities to heal the blighted landscape and defeat enemies called haints – a Southern term used to describe ghosts or monsters. She’s aided on her quest by Crouton, her childhood stuffed toy come to life by powerful magic. He can take over enemies’ bodies, cause them to fight on Hazel’s side, and can squeeze into places she’s too big to reach.</p><p>I love when a piece of media talks to me as a Black person. A TV show, cartoon, or even a video game will have tiny visual references or phrases that are like a secret code. I see or hear them and know a Black person left this for me to find. What made me <em>holler</em> about South of Midnight was that its writers went for the deep cuts. They put in the kind of stuff you only know about if at least three of your four grandparents were American Black. Back in the day, <em>everyone </em>on both sides of my family had Annie Lee artwork in the house. If it wasn’t <em>Blue Monday</em>, it was <a href="https://www.blackartdepot.com/products/sixty-pounds-annie-lee?srsltid=AfmBOoq-gD85AlAumSQDqKc7Y5R7xG67e6D_Rr_NbhWJvg6UbVjmfHg-"><em>Sixty Pounds</em></a> — which my mother had hanging above the window in our kitchen.</p><div><p>What made me <em>holler</em> about South of Midnight was that its writers went for the deep cuts.</p></div><p>That kind of acknowledgement is everywhere in the game. It’s in the way Hazel and her mother, Lacey, speak to each other, the words they use, and their intonation. Hazel mutters something disrespectful, and her mother immediately calls her out: “I thought you was grown.” It’s in the way Catfish, the magical and overly large catfish who guides Hazel on her quest, reminds me of my two <em>very</em> country uncles. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/617373/south-of-midnight-preview-interview-ahmed-best">Earlier this year when I spoke to Ahmed Best</a>, the voice and motion capture director for the game, he talked about how he wanted to ensure every aspect came across as authentic — right down to the way folks stood. I saw that come through in the way Hazel fans herself <em>just so</em> to keep the Mississippi heat at bay. Instead of standing straight up, she tilts her head to the side as she waves her hand the exact same way Memphis-born aunties do. </p><p>The details were so small, but they accumulated in my heart like the waters behind a levee. Every time I discovered something new — like noticing one of the game’s chapter titles referenced Zora Neale Hurston’s novel <em>Their Eyes Were Watching God</em> — the emotion would burst forth as a flood of tears. </p><p>And it’s not just the narrative that pays homage to Black and Southern tradition and culture; the gameplay does, too. Instead of <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/yellow-paint-in-video-games-needs-to-stop">the much (and unfairly) maligned yellow paint</a> used to denote a climbable surface, <em>South of Midnight</em> uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haint_blue">a very specific shade of blue</a> — the color Black people in the South would use to paint their porches to keep evil spirits away. There was a moment when I saw blue butterflies hovering over a cliff surrounded by water that kills Hazel if she touches it. Knowing the game uses blue to show you where you can safely go, I took a leap of faith over the edge and found a secret power-up. The game spoke to me using the language of my ancestors, and I heard it. Once again, I hollered.</p><p>As much as<em> South of Midnight</em> made me yell, its combat did make me groan a little bit. Every combat encounter follows the same extremely basic formula. Enemies show up in an arena, you kill them, heal the wound causing the enemies to appear, repeat ad nauseam with particular emphasis on the nausea part. It’s so formulaic that combat feels vestigial, like it was put there as an afterthought to give players something else to do. Hazel’s abilities don’t feel particularly fun or interesting to use, and, honestly, the game doesn’t even need combat at all. The storytelling is so strong that <em>South of Midnight</em> would be just as compelling as a purely narrative experience with some light platforming action. </p><div><p>Honestly, the game doesn’t even need combat at all</p></div><p>In a lot of cases, in order for Black media to get widespread attention or critical acclaim, it must be centered on luridly depicting trauma. The opposite isn’t all that great either, wherein a piece of Black media overcorrects and completely refuses to acknowledge traumatic realities that inform our existence. <em>South of Midnight</em> deftly straddles those two schools of thought in a pointed way that I’ve never seen before.</p><p><em>South of Midnight</em> sees me. It gets me. Its creators wanted to craft a love letter to a culture not often depicted in video games, and they did exactly that. At a time when my government is trying to do everything in its power to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/jackie-robinson-army-history-dei-military-department-defense-rcna197067">erase my people</a>, <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/trump-executive-order-to-force-changes-at-smithsonian-institution-targeting-funding-for-programs-with-improper-ideology">their history</a>, and <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/national-park-service-restores-harriet-tubman-feature-webpage/story?id=120605884">their contributions to the US</a>, I cannot overstate the power that lies in being seen — especially coming from a place like video games, which is often violently hostile if it bothers to acknowledge folks like me at all.</p><p>This game came out right on time, right in the moment when a narrative like this was needed the most. <em>South of Midnight</em> is a loving and worshipful praise song of the culture and people it depicts that made it hard for me to stay quiet for long.</p><p><sub><em>South of Midnight </em>is out now on Xbox, Xbox Game Pass, and Windows PC.</sub></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Previously £54.95, that's a massive £15 saving for a critically well-received RPG that will take you at least 40 to 60 hours just to complete the main story. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you've been distracted by all the other huge games that have come out in the last few months— like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civilization 7</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/avowed">Avowed</a>,<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii"> Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</a>, or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, just to name a few—this is the perfect chance to return to the Kingdom of Bohemia with a massive bargain. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a few other UK retailers who have followed suit, with <a href="https://zdcs.link/zj4YjL?object_uuid=2a9c56b0-506c-4bd8-97a7-79f646361336&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Argos</a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/QbxBkA?object_uuid=2a9c56b0-506c-4bd8-97a7-79f646361336&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Currys,</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/QGGJ4q?object_uuid=2a9c56b0-506c-4bd8-97a7-79f646361336&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Smyths</a> bringing the price down to £39.99. TGC is still the cheapest by 4p, but if stock runs out on PS5, we'd recommend going to Currys next since it does free next day delivery and is also the Day One Edition, containing the pre-order bonus quest— "The Lion's Crest". </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Argos can do free shipping as well, but only if you collect from a store or place an online order over £100, otherwise costing you at least an extra £3.95 for home delivery. Plus, while Argos is selling the Day One Edition on Xbox Series X, it's only selling the standard version without the bonus quest on PS5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Smyths is only selling the standard version on both platforms, neither without the pre-order bonus quest. That said, it still makes a better price than those currently at other retailers. Kingdom Come: Deliverance II on PS5 at <a href="https://zdcs.link/z7EmgV?object_uuid=2a9c56b0-506c-4bd8-97a7-79f646361336&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon UK</a>, for example, currently costs £57.77 at the lowest. <a href="https://zdcs.link/a5YWB8?object_uuid=2a9c56b0-506c-4bd8-97a7-79f646361336&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ShopTo</a> has cut its prices on the game slightly, but not as much, only going as low as £47.85 for the game on Xbox Series X|S. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While you can get Kingdom Come: Deliverance II for as low as £38.49 on PC through sites like <a href="https://zdcs.link/aR3OP1?object_uuid=2a9c56b0-506c-4bd8-97a7-79f646361336&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CDKeys</a>, deals like The Games Collection's are the cheapest ways to play the game on console. KCD2 is still priced much higher on each system's digital platforms—£59.99 on both the <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation Store</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/9n4w31hsmvvd" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox Games Store</a>. If you have either console with a disc drive, The Game Collection, Currys, or Smyths are your best options.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ben Williams</strong> – IGN freelance contributor with over 10 years of experience covering gaming, tech, film, TV, and anime.

                <p>EA Sports hasn't even officially announced College Football 26, but now more details about the game have emerged from an unexpected source. The home improvement chain Lowe's has <a href="https://corporate.lowes.com/newsroom/press-releases/game-lowes-appear-multiple-ea-sports-titles-first-time-04-11-25" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced</a> a collaboration with EA Sports to feature its branding in CFB 26, along with the newest EA Sports FC and Madden NFL titles.</p><p>Lowe's branding will appear in these games "across multiple gameplay experiences," the retailer said. For CFB 26, Lowe's branding will show up on the broadcast overlay for the Stadium Pulse feature. This feature aims to replicate the pressure of playing an away game by making certain gameplay elements more difficult for a short period of time. Lowe's said this draws "meaningful parallels to the passion homeowners feel when enhancing their own spaces with Lowe's."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4475053-lowes.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4475053" data-ratio="0.56259259259259" data-width="2700" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4475053-lowes.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4475053"></a><figcaption>A render of the Lowe's interactive gaming experience that's going on a road trip.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4475053-lowes.jpg"></figure><p>In EA Sports FC and Madden NFL, Lowe's branding will show up in the popular Ultimate Team modes.</p><p>The partnership extends to real life as well, as Lowe's is debuting an "On the Road" interactive gaming experience as part of a nationwide tour for the college football and NFL seasons. More details about this are coming later this year.</p><p>Lowe's said the idea with all of this is to help reach people who might be considering a home project and remind them to shop at Lowe's instead of a competitor.</p><p>"This is such an immersive and unexpected way to introduce ourselves to the next generation of home improvers," Lowe's marketing boss Jen Wilson said.</p><p>CFB 26 has big shoes to fill, as 2024's CFB 25 was the year's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2024s-best-selling-games-in-the-us/2900-5106/" data-ref-id="2900-5106">No. 2 best-selling game in the US</a>, only beaten by Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. There was more than a decade of pent-up demand for the game following the last entry in 2013, so it'll be interesting to see how CFB 26 fares by comparison. </p>

Shin-Shibuya will be retired from the ranked play mode.</p><p dir="ltr">Season 2 also includes the new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/marvel-rivals-battle-pass-season-2-all-skins-emotes-and-other-rewards/2900-6463/">Flower of Krakoa battle pass</a>, which features several heroes all glammed up for Emma Frost's big gala event. Squirrel Girl also gets a cool punk-themed "Nut Rocker" costume, and Spider-Man has the "Spider-Oni" skin.</p><p dir="ltr">Marvel Rivals Season 2 adds a gifting feature to the game. Players can now gift all those fun cosmetics to their friends.</p><p dir="ltr">The big update makes changes for console platforms to include several sensitivity adjustments. These new options should make aiming and movement easier to customize to a player's preference. This includes additional deadzone settings for both triggers and thumbsticks.</p><p dir="ltr">On the PC side, players can now try an "experimental feature" called the Switch Shader Compilation Mode. The developer describes this as a way to potentially make Marvel Rivals run smoother by compiling shaders only when launching Marvel Rivals for the first time after an update to either the game or graphics driver. This is designed to significantly reduce memory usage and minimize in-game stuttering, but the developer warns that additional stutters can happen depending on the power of the player's PC hardware.</p><p dir="ltr">A few map improvements are included for Season 2. This update corrects terrain issues that could previously cause characters to become stuck or clip through odd locations. It also addresses several sound issues on various maps.</p><p dir="ltr">Several hero adjustments are also detailed in the patch notes. This includes Iron Fist's Floating Fumble, which could sometimes cause the hero to end up floating indefinitely. Another fixes Captain America's Shield Bounce, as the hero previously couldn't ricochet enemy projectiles while moving backward. Now, Cap can send projectiles flying no matter which way he is moving.</p><p dir="ltr">The entire list of hero improvements can be found in the patch notes below, as <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/gameupdate/20250401/41548_1223996.html" rel="nofollow ">shared by the developer</a>.</p><h2>Marvel Rivals Version 20250411 Patch Notes</h2><h2>1.

The proportion of hero-specific missions has also been reduced.</p><p><strong>Ranked</strong></p><p>1. Rank Reset: based on your final Season 1.5 rank, ranks will be demoted by 9 divisions. For example, if you ended Season 1.5 at Diamond I, your Season 2 journey begins at Silver I.</p><p>2. New rank rewards are in! A dazzling new costume for reaching Gold — Emma Frost - Golden Diamond, along with new Crests of Honor for Grandmaster, Celestial, Eternity, and Top 500.</p><p>3.

(If you have previously completed at least one valid competitive match, you can still join Competitive in Season 2.0 even if you are below level 15.)</p><p>4. Pick/ban will now come into play starting from Gold III rather than Diamond tier.</p><p>5. When a team includes players from Eternity or One Above All, only solo or duo queuing will be allowed.</p><p>6. Currently, the score you earn per Competitive match is determined by both the outcome and your individual performance. After Season 2.0 launches, we will be increasing the weight of individual performances. The better you perform, the more points you will earn in victory, and the fewer points you will lose in defeat.</p><p><strong>Tournament Updates</strong></p><p>1.

Combined, that left only $10.7 billion for full game purchases, down 2.6 percent from the year prior. Those numbers might shift in 2026 with some bigger releases like <em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, <em>Borderlands 4</em>, and more on the horizon, but the trend is pretty clear. And if the next<em> GTA Online </em>is anywhere near as big as the current one, that will only sap more money out of the ecosystem through microtransactions. </p><p>Of course, whether microtransactions are truly leeching from the system is up for debate. With video game prices (mostly) stagnant even as budgets explode and unit sales figures remain mostly flat, many publishers have opted to recoup more revenue from those in-game purchases. <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> is only $70, but includes a full suite of purchasable cosmetics and other add-ons. At the same time, games without that business model grafted onto them, especially indie releases, are seemingly left in an increasingly challenging position as a bigger piece of the pie is being absorbed by a smaller set of players. </p><p>The shift is slightly less dramatic on console, but still visible. Microtransactions only make up 32 percent of player spending there, according to Newzoo (that’s up 4.5 percent year-over-year). A plurality of all spending is still on full game purchases, though probably not for long. The growth of subscriptions like Xbox Game Pass, PS Plus Extra, and Switch Online Expansion Pack are all taking a roughly 16-percent chunk of the money (up 14 percent year-0ver-year). DLC, on the other hand, is just 5 percent of spending, or about $2.2 billion. Console players, it would seem, still have a stronger preference for moving on to the next new thing. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
