            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>After a total of 61 hours—the last dozen of which were spent grinding Job Points and <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/how-to-farm-the-best-rare-weapons-in-final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles/">farming the best rare weapons</a>—I finally wrapped up my first playthrough of Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles.</p>



<p>Though I still have the optional Midlight's Deep dungeon to clear, I had planned to take a break before returning to the epic tale of Ramza Beoulve. My plans, however, are now changing much sooner than anticipated. This is all thanks to a handful of exceptional community mods available for the PC version of the game, which are already prompting another full playthrough. These mods dramatically enhance the gameplay, promising an experience even more engaging than the last.</p>



<h2 id="h-content-restored-dark-knight-onion-knight-balthier-and-luso-are-now-part-of-the-ivalice-chronicles">Content Restored: Dark Knight, Onion Knight, Balthier, and Luso Are Now Part of The Ivalice Chronicles</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">The Dark Knight and Onion Knight Jobs are now fully functional in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Last month, I reported on <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-mod-begins-restoration-of-war-of-the-lions-content/">how a dedicated fan began restoring the content cut from the War of the Lions version</a>, which serves as the basis for the current mobile versions of the game. Not content with just bringing back Balthier with his devastating Barrage skill, which can break the 999 damage cap with ease, and the ever-useful Luso, modder Dana Crysalis has now restored for generic units the two Jobs cut from the War of the Lions: <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasytacticstheivalicechronicles/mods/34?tab=files&amp;file_id=134">Dark Knight and Onion Knight.</a></p>



<p>The implementation of these Jobs in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles is flawless. The mod also adds a paging system to the job menu, allowing the game to display more than 19 jobs. Unlocking them, like in War of the Lions, requires some effort, though.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><th>Job</th><th>Requirement</th></tr><tr><td><strong>Dark Knight</strong></td><td>Level 8 Black Mage, Knight, Geomancer, Dragoon, Samurai, and Ninja</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Onion Knight</strong></td><td>Level 6 Squire and Chemist</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>The high Job requirements to unlock the Dark Knight, in particular, are well worth it. This Job has long been infamous for being extremely overpowered, thanks to its Darkness Job Command, which grants the unit not only HP and MP restoration with Sanguine Sword and Infernal Strike, but also great damage in wide AOE with Abyssal Blade, at the cost of HP.</p>



<h2 id="h-introducing-new-jobs-blue-mage-and-red-mage">Introducing New Jobs: Blue Mage and Red Mage</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em>Alicia and Lavian now come with unique Jobs that makes them more than special generic units</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Dana Crysalis didn't stop at job restoration; they also implemented two brand-new Jobs inspired by the Final Fantasy Tactics Advance games: <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasytacticstheivalicechronicles/mods/26">Blue Mage and Red Mage.</a></p>



<p>These versatile spellcasters are available right from the beginning of Chapter 2 and are assigned to the special generic units Alicia and Lavian. This finally gives these often-overlooked units a meaningful role, allowing them to learn monster abilities and use a variety of magic spells from other spellcasting Jobs. Even in its current state, this mod is a must-download to spice up the experience, especially for players who previously struggled to find a use for Alicia and Lavian.</p>



<h2 id="h-heretic-ramza-the-story-in-the-job-title">Heretic Ramza: The Story in the Job Title</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Ramza is no longe</em><em>r</em><em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed"> a Heretic just in name</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>One of the few criticisms of the original game was that Ramza's special job, Squire, remained unchanged for the entire game, despite his significant character development. While The Ivalice Chronicles addresses this by changing his Job to Gallant Knight in Chapter 4, the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasytacticstheivalicechronicles/mods/39">Heretic Ramza mod</a> by Serbagz takes this concept to its logical and emotional extreme.</p>



<p>With this mod, Ramza’s special Job title now reflects his standing in the evolving narrative:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Chapter 1:</strong> Noble</li>



<li><strong>Chapters 2 &amp; 3:</strong> Mercenary</li>



<li><strong>Chapter 4:</strong> Heretic</li>
</ul>



<p>Once he earns the Heretic title, Ramza also gains the Fell Knight's Shadowblade and Duskblade abilities. This highlights an excellent story connection: though Gaffgarion was ruthless, he acted as a temporary mentor in Ramza's darkest days, making the acquisition of the Fell Knight's signature abilities a fitting—and powerful—bit of character growth. It offers a great contrast to Delita, the commoner who became king with the support of the church.</p>



<h2 id="h-level-scaling-necessary-rebalance">Level Scaling: Necessary Rebalance</h2>



<p>With the introduction of new, powerful Jobs and abilities, the potential for overwhelming the game is high, especially since enemy levels in story battles typically don't scale.</p>



<p>Thankfully, the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasytacticstheivalicechronicles/mods/30">Level Scaling mod</a> (also by Dana Crysalis) ensures this doesn't become an issue. By implementing enemy level scaling even in story battles, the game remains highly challenging even after you engage in heavy grinding. This gives a real purpose to those <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/fun-magic-build-to-solo-battles-in-final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles/">fine-tuned character builds </a>and ensures every story battle requires genuine tactical effort.</p>



<h2 id="h-are-you-being-pulled-back-in-i-know-i-am">Are you being pulled back in? I Know I Am</h2>



<p>After learning about all these mods, I couldn't wait to install them and see how they make Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles an even better game. Needless to say, they do. Although I had planned only for a quick test, I ended up spending a few hours exploring the new features, further condemning me to my fate: experiencing the War of the Lions again. Not a bad fate to succumb to, as <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-classic-strategy-modern-upgrades/">the game is still one of the best tactical RPGs ever released</a>, decades after its original release.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wake-of-the-water-takes-steam-supergame-enshrouded-to-incredible-new-depths-and-levels.1348543/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Every search for life begins with a search for water, and while <em>Enshrouded</em> has certainly been lively since its January 2024 launch, its new aquatic update is about to take it to entirely new levels of mindblowing gameplay.&nbsp;<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5280/"><em>Wake of the Water</em></a>, the biggest update yet to the enormously popular Steam survival RPG, adds so much depth and so many new elements and features that even seasoned <em>Enshrouded</em> players will feel like they’re playing an entirely new game.</p>


<p>Rivers flowing and waterfalls surging with dynamic voxel water are the newest features in the realm of Embervale, and they aren’t just pretty backgrounds. The new water biome is dynamic and completely interactive – swim, collect it, use it to grow food and to terraform the world around you. But, be alert — with this new aquatic element comes new amphibious enemies that you must defeat, or perish while trying.</p>
<h2>An Incredible Detailed Layer</h2>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5280/">As you explore the new world that&nbsp;<em>Wake of the Water</em> brings to&nbsp;<em>Enshrouded</em></a>, you’ll quickly learn to become one with the water. Swimming and diving will be new skills to master, long with using your grappling hooks underwater. Beneath the surface lie chests to open and plants to harvest, while back on land you’ll learn how to enhance your base with water dispensers, rain barrels, and hydro-powered mills to process food or forge new materials.</p>
<p>When you discover the new Veilwater Basin biome, you’ll be sucked in for hours of incredible exploration. Hidden ruins, valuable gold ore and aquamarine to mine, capybaras and wildbeast crabs to observe, and settlements that strange lizard people call home will be revealed. But so will the Drak, a dangerous new amphibious enemy that claims the Veilwater Basin as their own and will be all too eager to lure you into battle in the water, where their amphibious nature gives them a huge advantage that you’ll need to adjust to quickly or be defeated.</p>
<figure id="attachment_2000642184" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000642184"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000642184">© Enshrouded Wake of the Water</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_2000642187" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000642187"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000642187">© Enshrouded Wake of the Water</figcaption></figure>

<h2>Learn New Survival Skills</h2>
<p>Although the new depths of <em>Wake of the Water</em> present new challenges and danger in the form of the Drak, they are also a new source of sustenance — provided you’re able to master the rod and reel. As you encounter a new survivor selling gear and bait, soon you’ll progress through five different fishing rods and a variety of bait, including worms, moths. fireflies, and frogs. Your prizes come in the form of three common tiers of fish and 5 epic tiers, and as your talent in these mini-games grows, so do your rewards: loot bags, legendary weapons, trophies, and more. The fish themselves can be turned into meals that improve your stamina, mana, and your diving time and ability.</p>
<h2>Prepare for Battle</h2>
<p>Lest you think&nbsp;<em>Wake of the Water</em> is a peaceful and relaxing update to&nbsp;<em>Enshrouded</em> where you just hang out and fish all day, you’ll quickly find that the combat aspect of the game is turned up significantly. There are over 60 new weapons, most notably an entire new class of weapons called greatswords. Seven new armor sets and over 10 new fighting skills are unveiled in&nbsp;<em>Wake of the Water.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>The combat overhaul with this update also rebalances the fighting statistics — elemental weapons now always inflict elemental damage, gem slots are increased in importance, and the fighting user interface has been overhauled and improved. You’ll need to obtain and master these new weapons and skills quickly, because the danger from the Drak and other enemies is an ever-present peril in this new world.</p>

<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5280/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Keen Games</a></p>
<h2>A Great Game Redefined</h2>
<p>Gamers know that an “update” can mean anything from a virtually undetectable patch to a complete teardown and rebuild that can either make a middling game incredible or ruin a favorite game for good. <em>Wake of the Water</em> is the rare update that takes an already great game and adds elements and layers and features that create immersive new experiences while keeping in place the features that drew you to it in the first place.</p>
<figure id="attachment_2000642188" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000642188"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000642188">© Enshrouded Wake of the Water</figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5280/">The November 10 drop of <em>Wake of the Water</em></a> fully redefines how you’ll play&nbsp;<em>Enshrouded</em>, with features like fully submerged bases, new skills like swimming and fishing, and lethal new enemies and the all-new weapons you use against them. It’s an exciting new era of&nbsp;<em>Enshrouded</em>, leading into 2026 when the game makes the jump from Steam and PC Early Access to a console and PC launch in 1.0. The possibilities are endless as the realm of Embervale is transformed by the engrossing aquatic elements of <em>Wake of the Water</em>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-the-simpsons-boss-locations/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/where-are-the-bosses-in-fortnite-x-the-simpsons-how-to-find-boss-locations-explained.1348540/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fortnite bosses are a feature that players have become well-versed with other the years, though The Simpsons mini-season shakes things up and makes them harder to locate.</p>



<p>The Simpsons mini-season in Fortnite made a big change to bosses, which don’t have fixed spawn locations and only appear on your map when you are near them, making it harder to track them down when completing quests or on the hunt for loot.</p>



<p>For all the details on how to track down each of the bosses available in Fortnite during The Simpsons mini-season, check out our guide.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-find-witch-marge-in-fortnite-x-the-simpsons">How to Find Witch Marge in Fortnite x The Simpsons</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Haunting. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Witch Marge spawns randomly during The Simpsons mini-season in Fortnite, though she is most commonly found in the Springfield Town Center POI.</strong></p>



<p>In this area, Witch Marge can be encountered in the woods between Springfield Town Square and Kamp Krusty, though she can also appear in the POI itself, and these aren’t the only locations where she can be found.</p>



<p>You should also check out the area south of Evergreen Terrace and hunt in the Springfield Slurpworks POI, both of which are areas where Mitch Marge also spawns regularly.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-find-evil-homer-in-fortnite-x-the-simpsons">How to Find Evil Homer in Fortnite x The Simpsons</h2>



<p><strong>Evil Homer does not have a fixed spawn during The Simpsons mini-season in Fortnite, but, like Witch Marge, is often found in the Springfield Town Square POI near </strong>the courthouse<strong>.</strong></p>



<p>However, it’s not guaranteed he will spawn there, and you should check out other areas too if you’re on the hunt for him. Personally, I’ve found the east of Evergreen Terrace by Springfield Gorge to be a location where Evil Homer is often lurking.</p>



<p>Finally, the fields around Cletus’ Corn Hole are a common haunting ground for Evil Homer, so you should check this area too.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-find-krusty-the-clown-in-fortnite-x-the-simpsons">How to Find Krusty the Clown in Fortnite x The Simpsons</h2>



<p><strong>Like other bosses in The Simpsons mini-season in Fortnite, Krusty the Clown does not have a fixed spawn location. However, he can commonly be encountered at the Springfield Slurpworks.</strong></p>



<p>If you’re on the hunt for any boss to take down, Springfield Town Square is an ideal landing spot, as all three bosses can often be found here, but there are other areas to check for Krusty, too.</p>



<p>Like Evil Homer, Cletus’ Corn Hole is a good hunting spot for Krusty, along with the small island found east of Donut District—although this location is quite out of the way off the beaten track.</p>

<figure data-uuid="38971ea3a75fd"><a title="Yoshi Mario Galaxy" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/38971ea3a75fd/yoshi-mario-galaxy.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>We are still a good five months away from the release of <strong>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</strong>, but the rumour mill is already kicking into gear about Mario's next big adventure.</p>
<p>First, there was the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/a-trailer-for-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-will-debut-this-month-its-claimed">rumour</a> that an official trailer would be heading our way at some point this month, theoretically before <strong>Wicked: For Good</strong> arrives in theatres on 21st November. That was enough to get us excited, but its follow-up had us feeling a little more... mixed. Yes, we're talking about that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/images-of-yoshi-from-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-have-leaked-online">leaked Yoshi design</a>.</p>
<p>For those who haven't seen it yet, this weekend, US baking company <a href="https://shop.topsmarkets.com/store/tops-markets/products/83425108-pillsbury-ready-to-bake-yoshi-egg-sugar-cookie-dough-9-1-oz">Pillsbury</a> revealed its upcoming 'The Super Mario Galaxy Shape Sugar Cookie Dough'. A harmless enough endeavour, if a little premature, but the big talking point is the presence of the big green dino on the front and back of the box.</p>
<p>Sporting a similar Illumination sheen to the character design spotted on a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/its-official-the-mario-movie-sequel-is-based-on-mario-galaxy">tie-in Old Spice bottle</a> back in September, it's becoming increasingly likely that this is the Yoshi we'll all see in The Super Mario Galaxy Movie next year. Nothing is confirmed yet, of course, but we can only see so many pre-release promo products before we start to think that this is the real deal.</p>

<p>The big question now is, how do we all feel about this Yoshi design? The entire thing looks just about safe enough that we can absolutely believe it's true. It looks... like Yoshi, but the little scales all over his body are a nice little bit of detail, we suppose.</p>
<p>The stumbling point, and we're sure many of you will be in the same boat here, is those eyes. They are just so big. So white. So shiny. No matter which way we move our heads, it feels like those baby blues follow us around the room. How are we supposed to go about our daily lives with the knowledge that out there somewhere, Yoshi is staring at us?</p>
<p>But what do you think? Is this leaked Yoshi design everything that you would have hoped for in the Mario Galaxy Movie, or is it freaking you out a little? You can let us know your thoughts in the following poll, then head to the comments to share your full dino discussions.</p>

            <p>What were the chances Blizzard would find a way to monetise arguably the most exciting feature coming to World of Warcraft in years? High, it turns out. Blizzard will introduce a premium currency to the game, specifically for housing, called Hearthsteel.</p>
<p><a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-gb/news/24242736/developer-insight-hearthsteel-virtual-currency-and-housing-in-midnight">Blizzard announced the Hearthsteel currency in a blog on Friday evening</a>, explaining that you will be able to use it to buy items and furniture when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/world-of-warcraft-is-getting-player-housing-in-december-ahead-of-midnight-expansion-launch">the housing system arrives in December</a>. Almost immediately, the post clarified that, "The VAST majority of Housing items are (and will continue to be) earnable in-game."</p>
<p>Think of it similar to how mounts are currently handled: there'll be a few available to buy with real money, but most of them will only be earnable in the game. And those race- and class-based housing options the game will have, such as undead-themed buildings for undead characters: they won't be available to buy.</p>
<p>But as much as the blog did to pre-empt and address topics for backlash, backlash did inevitably follow. As of the time of writing, the official blog has more than 500 comments and <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/developer-insight-hearthsteel-virtual-currency-and-housing-in-midnight/2196144">the official forum post has more than 2500</a>.</p><p>"Absolutely not," wrote Uddermassage in the game's forum. "You need to go back to the drawing board. This microtransaction crap can go jump in a lake." Rambush, meanwhile (I like these names), said, "I can't believe someone seriously typed this up and thought to themselves, 'Yeah, that's reasonable, they’ll go for that!'"</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>The concern is understandable. This is the first actual premium currency World of Warcraft has had. You can already buy gold, and you can directly buy items such as mounts, but there's not a separate currency for this. The only separate currency the game has is Trader's Tender, for the Trading Post, which is entirely earned and used for a kind of battle pass-like system. This, then, is a notable change.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there are deeper suspicions as to Blizzard's intentions here - or rather, the intentions of Blizzard's owner, Microsoft. Remember, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsofts-push-for-high-xbox-profit-margins-behind-job-cuts-publishing-on-playstation-and-cancellation-of-projects-like-perfect-dark-claims-report">Microsoft is reportedly pushing its gaming division to operate with a 30 percent profit margin</a>, and there are few more reliable cash generators than the monthly subscription-fuelled World of Warcraft. Might Hearthsteel have been pushed through because of this? Perhaps the timing of the announcement is just bad.</p><p>Questions, questions; the answers will be provided when Blizzard unleashes housing in World of Warcraft in December. So far the feature looks fantastic, having spent years in development to develop ideas like neighbourhoods and groups of people living alongside each other. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-kind-of-a-sociological-experiment-for-blizzard-world-of-warcraft-neighbourhoods-azeroth-nimbys-and-curtain-twitching-drama-is-all-part-of-the-plan">"It's a kind of a sociological experiment," Blizzard told us recently.</a></p>

            <p>Yoshi's appearance along with a few other potential story spoilers for the upcoming Super Mario Bros Movie sequel - The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a> Movie - have started trending on social media thanks to, of all places, Pillsbury. Yes, the American brand of baking products has seemingly leaked a few of things we will be seeing on the film's release.</p>
<p>To paraphrase Homer Simpson - Dough!</p>

<p>While Yoshi's face is beaming away on the front of a box of pre-cut sugar cookies shaped like green spotted eggs, you can also see Nintendo's famed plumber Mario riding on his back on the other side of the packaging.</p>
<p>Along with Yoshi soaring through the air, this box of cookie shapes also features the Comet Observatory, which is the home of Rosalina and the Lumas. This one image all but confirms her appearance in the upcoming film (though, given it is called The Super Mario Galaxy Movie, this isn't exactly a surprise).</p><p>Another little image worth drawing attention to on this cookie box, meanwhile, is the graffiti tag in the upper left corner of the maze puzzle on the back of the package. Correct me if I am wrong, but that sure looks like Bowser Jr. to me.</p>
<p>You can check out images of Yoshi, Mario, Bowser Jr.'s  graffiti and the Comet Observatory below. At the time of writing, the cookies are still listed online via <a href="https://shop.topsmarkets.com/store/tops-markets/products/83425108-pillsbury-ready-to-bake-yoshi-egg-sugar-cookie-dough-9-1-oz">TopsMarkets</a>, but are currently out of stock. </p>

<p>Despite what I first thought when I saw these images last night, this isn't actually our first look at Yoshi in The Super Mario Galaxy Movie. After a spot of internet searching this morning, I also came across posts with images of Old Spice underarm and body spray, with Nintendo's green dinosaur-like creature smiling back. These images were first shared last month, but it seems no one thought they were real (until now).</p><p>While Yoshi features on a spray called Brooklyn Bounce, which is described as having a "smashed fruit" scent, Luigi also pops up on a can of Desert Detour along with a Tostarenan from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>'s Sand Kingdom. Desert Detour apparently smells like "vanilla sounds" (not sure how that works).</p>

<p>Last week, it was reported we will be getting a trailer for The Super Mario Galaxy Movie later this month, as it is allegedly attached to the upcoming release, Wicked: For Good.</p>
<p>Many have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-apparently-a-very-good-mario-themed-reason-you-should-go-and-see-wicked-for-good-this-november">now shared their hopes that Rosalina will be voiced by Ariana Grande</a>, who plays Glinda the Good in the Wicked film adaptations.</p>

<p>Primarily, the update addresses the Chinese translation issues present in the game by implementing a fan mod from Team Cart Fix. Team Cherry praises the team's work, stating that the individuals involved "are well-versed in the (quite dense) narrative and lore of both Hollow Knight games, and understand the subtle links and connections that should be retained in the text"</p><div><figure data-videoid="8PPa7JzGiQE" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8PPa7JzGiQE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt8PPa7JzGiQE" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8PPa7JzGiQE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8PPa7JzGiQE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed61a957otyjsr&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

            <p>As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> continues to grow increasingly popular this Winter, the demands for duo queue are only getting louder as pairs of players are getting a little tired of getting wiped out by teams of three.</p>
<p>As of writing, players have two supported options. You can queue up as a solo player and opt not to fill up your squad with strangers, which will match you with other solo players. Alternatively you can queue up as a team of three which will obviously slap you into games with full squads of three.</p>
<p>However, if you queue up as a party for two and opt not to fill your empty spot with a third player, you'll still be queued up against teams of three rather than other duos. This means those without a third wheel are forced to play in matches at an unavoidable disadvantage.</p>

<p>"EMBARK please make duos mode, that's in my opinion [the] only thing this game is currently missing," wrote user MediumDefinition2480 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oqta8j/embark_we_are_in_desparate_need_of_duos_mode/">on the Arc Raiders Reddit</a>. "I am really tired of playing against trios while I want to play with my friend." That post is sitting on just under 10,000 upvotes at the time of writing, and is just one of a variety of similar posts begging for official duo support.</p><p>The reason why this may <em>not</em> have official support is down to fears of splitting the player base, and not wanting to split the online lobbies into three separate groups of players: solo, duos, and full squads. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-breaks-another-concurrent-record-as-player-count-soars">While Arc Raiders is incredibly popular right now</a>, as time goes on, having a three-way-split could in theory lead to extended queue times.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-mod-night-city-traffic-overhaul-lets-you-customize-traffic/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cyberpunk-2077-mod-%E2%80%98night-city-traffic-overhaul%E2%80%99-lets-you-customize-traffic-for-each-district.1348486/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The Cyberpunk 2077 modding scene continues to improve CD Projekt RED's game in multiple areas. We previously covered mods that <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-update-third-person/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">add proper third-person</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-cyberpunk-2077-mod-combat-overhaul/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">improve combat</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-game-save-companions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">add permanent companions</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-responsive-v-mod/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">increase immersion</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-dreampunk-3-1-1-enhanced-path-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">improve path tracing</a>.</p>



<p>Now, modder cradilyex has uploaded '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/25552" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Night City Traffic Overhaul</a>' to the Nexus website. This mod's goal is to add vehicles that are present in the base game but are missing from traffic, depending on the Night City district. For example, you will see gang vehicles patrolling their turf, NCPD vehicles patrolling rich areas, taxis and buses, Delamains and big trucks in industrial areas, Militech and Wraiths in the Badlands region, and Moxes in Kabuki. What's even more interesting is that the players can tweak everything through a handy menu. You could, for instance, greatly increase Scav presence or Police presence in a district and do the exact opposite in another, depending on your vision for that district.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The mod also lets you introduce modded vehicles into regular Cyberpunk 2077 traffic by adding their entity names (such as "Vehicle.oranje3_militech_legatus" for the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/23289" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Militech Legatus SPD-10</a>) to the lists in "r6/scripts/NightCityTrafficOverhaul/NCTOmoddedVehicles.reds". </p>



<p>According to the modder, the vehicle swap itself has no impact on performance. However, depending on the chosen traffic density and your hardware, performance may decrease in certain instances. Moreover, some modded vehicles could also reduce performance.</p>



<p>Night City Traffic Overhaul is compatible with <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/15624" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Taxi Work in Night City</a>, which adds missions where you transport passengers as a cab driver, and with <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/10395" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Night City Alive</a>, which adds motorbikes to traffic, makes gang members able to drive through the city, and both civilians and NCPD more aware and reactive to what happens around them.</p>



<p>It is no doubt impressive what modders can do with Cyberpunk 2077 despite the lack of full modding tools. The Witcher 3 eventually <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-redkit-q-further-improvements-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got REDkit in May 2024</a>; hopefully, CD Projekt RED can release a similar tool for their other game, too. It would help fans tide themselves over until the sequel, which might very well feature <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-might-include-multiplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiplayer modes</a> and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-series-creator-keanu-reeves-return-johnny-silverhand/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">return of Keanu Reeves as Johnny Silverhand</a>.</p>

			<p>New Valve hardware, potentially including the highly anticipated Steam Frame VR headset and a new Steam Controller, could be announced as early as Wednesday, November 12, according to online rumors. More critically, the timing suggests this could be accompanied by a reveal for the long-rumored HLX project (Half-Life 3).</p>



<p>The rumor originates from <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley">Brad Lynch</a>, a known and highly reliable source for Valve hardware and display leaks. Lynch revealed on Discord, as reported on the <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ot28nw/sadlyitsbradley_steam_frame_information_likely/">Gaming Leaks subreddit</a>, that new hardware announcements are imminent. The announcement for the Steam Frame VR headset is expected to precede pre-orders by a week or two, giving Valve time to explain the device's technical features properly.</p>



<h2 id="h-steam-frame-a-considerable-step-forward">Steam Frame: A Considerable Step Forward</h2>



<p>The announcement of the long-rumored new Valve headset, previously codenamed <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/the-next-vr-headset-valve-might-have-entered-production/">"Deckard,"</a> is likely going to be the focus of this possible set of announcements. If its rumored features are true, the Steam Frame represents a fundamental step up from the Index headset, and a significant change in VR philosophy for the company.</p>



<p>According to leaks, the Steam Frame will introduce <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"Frames,"</em> which are visual elements like floating windows that give the user a new way to interact with applications, similar in concept to the <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/apple-vision-pro-benefiting-other-companies-in-niche-market/">Apple Vision Pro</a>'s immersive OS. The "Frames" feature is rumored to be backed up by the specifications below.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><th>Rumored Technical Specifications (Based on Proof of Concept)</th></tr><tr><td><strong>CPU:</strong> Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 (SM8650)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Display:</strong> 2160×2160 @ 120 Hz panel from JDI</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Features:</strong> SLAM tracking, eye tracking</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-the-new-steam-controller-and-capsense-feature">The New Steam Controller and Capsense Feature</h2>



<p>The headset announcement is expected could be accompanied by other hardware reveals, including a new Steam Controller. While an image of the new device hasn't been shared (Brad Lynch shared an AI-made mockup to protect his source), the controller is said to sport a capsense feature similar to the Index controllers, but without full finger tracking.</p>



<p>This capsense feature will allow the device to detect how far the user's hands are from the handle, which could have some interesting applications in terms of comfort and immersion. The lack of full finger tracking shouldn't significantly impact the experience, allowing the company to keep the controller's price as low as possible.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>The new Steam Controller will look like this when it launches</p><p>Im told that it can also detect how far your hands are from the handles using a simple capsense feature</p><p>Similar to the index controllers, but not full finger tracking in the grips <a href="https://t.co/loIqpJb0YZ">pic.twitter.com/loIqpJb0YZ</a></p></div>— Brad Lynch (@SadlyItsBradley) <a href="https://twitter.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1987644108765380813?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 9, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<h2 id="h-half-life-3-could-be-the-steam-frame-s-killer-app">Half-Life 3 Could be the Steam Frame's Killer App</h2>



<p>Even if you are not interested in Valve's upcoming hardware, the rumored announcements set for this week carry immense weight due to the potential software reveal.</p>



<p>With the<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-hlx-optimization-trailer-prepared/"> HLX project (rumored to be Half-Life 3) having reportedly recently entered a polishing phase</a> , the announcement of the Steam Frame could be accompanied by the reveal of the next entry in the legendary series. Much like Valve did with the Index and Half-Life: Alyx, the new major hardware launch could be tied to the announcement of a game that many had lost hope it would ever see the light of day. Although datamined information suggests the new entry in the series won't be a VR-only game, its reveal would transform this hardware launch into Valve's most significant event since 2019, making this Wednesday essential viewing for any fan of the popular company.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> developers FromSoftware are planning to release some DLC for the action RPG by March 2026. That's according the latest financial report of FromSoft parent company Kadokawa, which has attached a window to the add-on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-tips-tricks">Nightreign</a>'s promo material had already hinted would be in the pipeline.</p>
<p>Call out to the people who're deep in the night of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreigns-deep-of-night-is-nigh-so-heres-a-big-patch-with-more-balancing-tweaks-than-a-tightrope-walker">Nightreign's last addition</a> so they hear. Tell them to scrabble around for a light switch so they can read the info. Remind them not to accidentally fondle a big boss as they paw along the walls. Actually, I'm sure they'll remember that anyway, since it's s-oh no.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>We'll have to start without them. As spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/elden-ring-nightreign-performed-well-beyond-initial-expectations-fromsoftware-parent-company-says-and-dlc-could-take-it-even-further/">GamesRadar</a>, flip to page 16 of the <a href="https://ssl4.eir-parts.net/doc/9468/ir_material_for_fiscal_ym13/190133/00.pdf">report's presentation</a>, which covers the six month period that ended on September 30th.</p>
<p>"FromSoftware is currently developing ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN DLC (planned for release in FY2025), ELDEN RING Tarnished Edition (planned for release in 2026 for Nintendo Switch 2), and The Duskbloods (planned for release in 2026)," reads the future outlook section. While it'd be cool if The Duskbloods does end up migrating from Switch to PC in time, the Nightreign DLC's the only bit of that which is relevant to us PC folks right now.</p>
<p>Kadokawa's 2024 fiscal year ended on March 31st this year, so we can expect this Nightreign DLC out by March 31st, 2026. That's assuming everything goes to plan, with the company leaving some delay wiggle room here.</p>
<p>As to what'll be in the DLC, extra playable Nightfarers and bosses seem pretty certain. Beyond that, things get a bit more mysterious, especially given the potential for FromSoftware to lean on bosses from previous Souls games. Given the DLC has a bit more riding on it than the likes of that free <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreigns-evil-deep-of-night-mode-gets-a-release-date-but-some-people-are-already-playing-it">Deep of the Night update</a>, I'd be fairly surprised not to see new locales or modes to further spice up the loop of killing whichever new bosses arrive alongside some new boss-beater.</p><p>Maybe they'll add in a map based around Newcastle city centre, and the new bosses are large black-and-white-shirted revellers who bellow 'toon' whenever you get close. You could stick a poison swamp next to Eldon Square, it'd be brill. That's what my fingers are crossed for as the wait for next March begins.</p>

			<p>It makes me so happy to know that the Tales of 30th Anniversary project is a thing. For such a prolific JRPG franchise, so many of the games are either inaccessible on modern hardware, exclusive to Japan, or both. Seeing Bandai Namco put such a serious foot forward in remastering multiple classic entries in the series is incredible, and even more so considering the great entries they’ve chosen to remaster so far.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/15/tales-of-graces-f-remastered-review/">Tales of Graces f Remastered</a>&nbsp;earlier this year was a delight, and now it’s being followed up by&nbsp;Tales of Xillia Remastered – a gorgeous PS3-era chapter in the series that I finally get a chance to dig deeper into.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tales of Xillia Remastered - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fd0VM2d3JNU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While seeing this game’s cover while browsing game shops always piqued my curiosity, back in the day, it never made its way into my collection, so I dived into this remaster blind. The game opens with what is probably the most unfairly skewed protagonist choice I’ve encountered in a game. You’re shown two brief cutscenes, and then asked to pick which character from those scenes you want to continue the story of – Milla or Jude. The problem is that Milla’s scene is pretty vague, showing her sitting in a temple and muttering something about “the spirits leaving” before attacking a ghostly snake and walking away. Jude, meanwhile, immediately presented me with the most fascinating story setup I’ve ever seen in a traditional JRPG. He’s a busy med-student in a huge, bustling medical school – the idea of a medical school in the middle of a fantastical JRPG world of swords and magic immediately lit up my eyes.</p>



<p>I was quick to choose Jude, but the other wrinkle with this choice is that it ultimately doesn’t alter the game all that much. Jude and Milla’s paths intertwine early on, and they end up spending a vast majority of Tales of Xillia Remastered adventuring together as they try to restore the balance between modern society and the ancient mana that fuels it all. The two heroes split up from time to time, but only for brief moments, so while the solo scenes I got with Jude were incredible, I never felt like I was missing any important information by not witnessing what Milla was up to in those moments.</p>

<p>Despite originally being a PS3 game, Tales of Xillia Remastered is downright gorgeous. The game already had breath-taking visual design, with vividly colored environments and beautifully modelled characters, and the smooth frame rate and upgraded resolution of this remaster only serves to further elevate those already incredible visuals. It doesn’t totally register as a modern game, though – a lot of cutscene animations are a little stiff in that classic way. Still, I think there’s a lot of charm to that, and it’s nice to be able to experience a game from it’s era but bundled with the quality of life you’d expect from a modern release.</p>

<p>Combat in the Tales series has always been a highlight for me, and Tales of Xillia Remastered is no slouch in that department. The real-time combo-heavy battles here are a blast, and I really enjoy the more open-ended approach to upgrades and skill progression this game has. There’s a huge emphasis on using skill points to unlock new ablities across a massive web of upgrades, and you can approach it in any order you like. On top of giving you more freedom to customize a single characters build, the character-link system in this game lets certain characters chain together their Artes mid-battle meaning that customising your crew to synergise properly is really important. That link system also adds a sort of rhythm-game quality to combat that I adored. Timing and flow are key, but your AI partners will trigger their linked abilities automatically, meaning it’s less of a mechanical or input-heavy challenge and more about focus and smart character swapping.</p>
<p>While the amount of bonus costume content and customizable soundtrack options packed into Tales of Xillia Remastered are a treat, one bonus I wish was handled differently is the Grade Shop. This is a menu that lets you redeem points to unlock cheat-code enhancers for your playthrough to increase money gained, XP gained, double damage, and more boosts of the sort. These are fun tools to use for making subsequent playthroughs or challenging sections of the game a breeze, but the issue here is that this is the very first thing you see upon starting a new playthrough. Without any context for the game or time spent playing it, it feels weird to be presented with this massive cheat menu, especially when so many of them warn that they can’t be disabled once applied. I would have appreciated this menu being tucked away somewhere in the actual game, and not so front-loaded.</p>

<p>Despite that Grade Shop hiccup, Tales of Xillia Remastered is an incredible game and a wonderful remaster. It only makes me more excited to see which entries in the series get this treatment next, because so far, Bandai Namco has done an incredible job of giving these nearly-forgotten JRPGs a second lease at life.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Halo Studios has confirmed that Halo: Infinite will receive one final update next week, after which the team will move on. The primary goal will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-remake-halo-campaign-evolved-coming-to-pc-xbox-ps5-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a>, a remake of the 2001 game's campaign, powered by Unreal Engine 5 and slated for launch next year. However, the developers have confirmed that there are actually multiple Halo projects in development; <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-2-3-remakes-in-the-works-halo-7-multiplayer-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to rumors</a>, they might be remaking the campaigns of the second and third installments while also working on the next mainline entry.</p>



<p>The final Halo: Infinite update, titled Operation: Infinite, is scheduled to go live on November 18. To begin with, the developers are giving a 2x boost to the earning rate for both Career Rank and Spartan Points (SP) across all matchmaking playlists. This will make it easier to reach the max level and unlock the coveted Mark VI armor kit, the same one worn by the Master Chief in the game's campaign.</p>



<p>The update also introduces a free 100-tier Operation Pass and a 100-tier Premium Pass, both with no expiration date planned. The free Pass unlocks three new armor sets (Serpin, Seeker, Adamant), as well as coatings, visors, and stances. The Premium Pass, on the other hand, lets players unlock five additional unique armor sets (Artificer, Seedwarden, Kobold, Phoenix, First Vanguard), six weapon models, and over thirty exclusive customizations. Instant unlocks for the Premium tier include the Charged Quill Shock Rifle model and Phoenix Gold weapon coating.</p>



<p>Halo Studios also added over 200 never-before-released customization items to The Exchange, such as armor pieces, attachments, coatings, charms, and visors. Items from all previous Operations, Events, and Fractures will be available here alongside commemorative Halo 5: Guardians bundles.</p>



<p>A new festive map called Yuletide will be found in the Quick Play playlist, and a new asymmetrical map, Vacancy, is being added to the Ranked Arena, Ranked Slayer, Ranked Doubles, and select ranked rotational playlists. More Ranked Seasons are on their way and will be reset every few months, allowing the best players to claim exclusive Spartan customizations. Moreover, while Operation: Infinite is the final Halo: Infinite update, players can still look forward to a rotating selection of Daily and Weekly Challenges that offer a variety of ways to level up their Career Rank, progress through Operation Passes, and earn Spartan Points (SP).

<p>Halo: Infinite launched in December 2021 <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/halo-infinite-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to a positive reception</a>. The game's free-to-play multiplayer initially garnered acclaim among fans, but the lackluster post-launch support eventually exhausted their excitement.</p>

            <p>November goes on. The cavalcade of belles, brutes and barons that is Videogaming continues its push through the midnight forest. Spiderwebs wrap the axles of the gala coaches in which the optimates of Ubisoft, Microsoft and EA drink from lavender flutes, turning their bloodshot eyes from the QA staff powering their barrows through the ruck. The faces of the common developers are a moth-eaten ribbon of quiet striving and terrible hope. The guards form a torchlit embroidery. Every so often, a torch goes out, and the wych elms generate new fruits. The stones in the road cant against our strides. The skulls of live service games burst beneath our wheels, and the analysts in the pageant wagons moan that the future lies behind us now.
</p><!--more-->
<p>Then, the woods withdraw and we emerge among flowering graves and fallen buttresses - the remnants of a church. The wagons circle and cooking fires spring up in the transepts, as our scouts contemplate the way forward. Five onward roads fan out from a rotten signpost, each named for a day of the week. Some assuredly lead to disaster. The scouts converse in hisses and, failing to agree, turn to you for instructions. Which day do we choose? Which route is safe?
</p>
<h2>Monday 10th November</h2>
<p>The skies above this path appear to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ambrosia-sky">drip ambrosia</a>, the food of the gods, and yet the splashed soil beneath revolts with fungus. The birds creasing the frail sunlight are <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3809940/Drill_Bird/">drill-tipped</a> and the clouds appear <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2305210/Skyformer/">very changeable</a>. Our wayfinders murmur of a distant <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4122860/ZATO__I_Love_the_World_and_Everything_In_It/">closed city</a> and an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3609980/Yes_My_Queen/">imprisoned queen</a>.
</p>
<h2>Tuesday 11th November</h2>
<p>Even as we study this road, our oldest scout - a one-eyed woman in furs with a staff twice her height - is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/possessors">possessed</a> by the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3906660/Sacred_2_Remaster/">spirits</a> of prog rockers, roused from the neglected graveyard. She regresses to a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2416100/Goodnight_Universe/">state of infancy</a>, capable only of chanting "all in all, you're just another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lumines-arise">block</a> in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3467710/Wall_World_2/">wall</a>."</p>
<h2>Wednesday 12th November</h2>
<p>A hard, bare road, and yet the banks are riddled with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3008740/Winter_Burrow/">burrows</a> (pictured) that appear surprisingly welcoming, with postage stamp doormats and tinklesome chimneys. The ghosts of Pink Floyd abandon your moon-touched scout. Regaining her senses, she talks cryptically of a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2555950/Million_Depth/">million layers beneath</a> where swords fly and time stands still.</p>
<h2>Thursday 13th November</h2>
<p>This road is heavily torn and depleted by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assetto-corsa-rally-aims-to-fill-a-colin-mcrae-shaped-void-and-its-out-in-early-access-next-month">curious wheelmarks</a> that speak of some great contest, beyond the ken of our wagoneers. Their chevronned textures overlap to form the impression - or is it more than fancy? - of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3255860/Hymer_2000/">wide eyes and chattering mouths</a>.</p>
<h2>Friday 14th November</h2>
<p>Goblin <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3564740/Where_Winds_Meet/">winds</a> tussle for dominion of this road, but we should perhaps be more worried about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">the muzzle glints and skullfaces</a> that populate the bushes. Sensing your consternation, the scouts propose that we break for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2976880/Tea_for_Sana/">tea</a>.</p>
<p>Does this monstrous forest have an outside? There are rumours up and down the train that this is the final November, that the woods are expanding faster than we can travel through them, that the Maw's latest eruption will be endless. Still, keep going. Think no further than the next footfall and the comrades at your elbow. Also, pls share any images, videos or literature you may know of that concern spooky forests. I am reaching the end of my supply of synonyms for "root".</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> has received a selection of new map conditions that are mixing up the typical experience significantly for players. As part of these new conditions, an underground bunker on Spaceport has been introduced, with a mysterious puzzle that still appears unsolved.</p>
<p>First introduced over the weekend the three major map condition additions are night raids for Blue Gate, Electromagnetic Storms (across Dam Battleground, Spaceport, and Blue Gate), plus the Hidden Bunker on Spaceport. You can also now see the Harvester event on the Blue Gate map, which previously was locked to Dam Battlegrounds.</p>
<p>Now, all of these are cool, but the Hidden Bunker is the particularly intriguing one. This event requires several antennas to be turned on across the map by players, which in turn opens doors in the South West portion of the map.</p>

</figure>
<p>There's good loot in this bunker, sure. However, more intriguingly are data upload terminals and other odd objects that have a portion of the community certain that there's more to find in the Hidden Bunker. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1orwml1/hidden_bunker_mega_thread/">A Reddit Megathread on the Arc Raiders Hidden Bunker</a> started picking apart the bunker, pointing out strange machines and wiring spread across the bunker with seemingly no purpose.</p><p>As for the data terminals, people also believed that there was more to this part of the bunker. However, it's worth noting that as of this morning there's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-trials-are-the-perfect-way-to-do-ranked-in-extraction-shooters#:~:text=Rather%20than%20some%20kill%2Dfocused,world%2C%20or%20even%20gathering%20plants!">a weekly trial</a> for data uploads, so it's entirely possible that all they're for is a nice bump in XP when used and weekly challenges.</p>
<p>Whether or not players will uncover more secrets in the Hidden Bunker is something to keep an eye on. Meanwhile,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-breaks-another-concurrent-record-as-player-count-soars"> Arc Raiders broke yet another concurrent player record last weekend</a>, showing continuing growth post-release and remaining at the top of Steam's top playing charts.</p>

<p>"I won't look anymore!"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="142703ed0cc7e"><a title="Miyamoto" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/142703ed0cc7e/miyamoto.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JApUMBscKOc">Nintendo</a></em></figcaption></figure><p>It's no secret that Shigeru Miyamoto has taken a bit of a backseat when it comes to game development. The last Mario game he personally oversaw as director was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/super_mario_run">Super Mario Run</a>, and after his most recent experience as general producer on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pikmin_4">Pikmin 4</a>, the creator has largely shifted over to the world of movies.</p>
<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://casabrutus.com/magazines/issue/no308">Casa Brutus</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/its-going-to-be-fun-miyamoto-discusses-mario-galaxy-movie-and-the-future-of-mario-games/">VGC</a>), Miyamoto hints toward taking even further steps away from game development. He states that while Nintendo currently has other developers leading the charge on new Mario titles, he nevertheless endeavours to play them and deliver feedback on the overall interface.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Nowadays, I have teammates who help maintain the world of Mario, so I entrust much of it to them. Even so, I always personally play through about the first 30 minutes of the game and check the interface thoroughly — to make sure it really feels like Mario.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He then – perhaps jokingly – hints that he may not even do this in the future and simply leave everything to his colleagues, before expressing his wish to remain healthy until Mario's inevitable 50th anniversary in ten years' time:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Up through <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>, I feel we’ve done just about everything we could on the Switch. In the past, whenever a new console came out, we always released a new Mario game, so I do wonder how the current team will take on that challenge.</p>
<p>“But maybe I’ll say, ‘I won’t look anymore!’ (laughs) I just hope to stay healthy until Mario’s 50th anniversary!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Discussion also turns to the upcoming <strong>Super Mario Galaxy Movie</strong>, which Miyamoto states is in the "final stages of production" while expressing the opinion that "it’s going to be fun". Only time will tell, but the movie's introduction of Yoshi was recently revealed prematurely thanks to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/images-of-yoshi-from-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-have-leaked-online">a product listing from none other than US baking firm Pillsbury</a>.</p>
<p>The movie officially launches on <strong>3rd April 2026</strong>, and it's said that a trailer will debut later this month and play before screenings for <strong>Wicked: For Good</strong>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Obsidian's classic RPG Fallout: New Vegas is about to get an influx of players, to be sure. The second season of the critically acclaimed Fallout TV show will be available on Amazon Prime Video <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-season-2-lands-december-17-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">starting on Wednesday, December 17</a>, and its setting is indeed New Vegas, as the main characters pursue the traitorous former overseer of Vault 33, Hank MacLean, toward the city. Since the show takes place fifteen years after the events seen in Fallout: New Vegas, those who have never experienced the masterpiece game would do well to play it before the TV show airs.</p>



<p>Just in case you need further incentive, a new graphics mod has just been released, and a quest mod will launch a few days before the TV show's second season. The graphics mod, called <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/94521?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Perfect Skies</a>, was created by doodlum, the main coder behind <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-gets-true-pbr-with-community-shaders-1-0/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim's Community Shaders</a>. </p>



<p>The modder calls this 'the ultimate clouds mod' and explains that the default game and previous mods previously used clouds from real-world pictures. Perfect Skies, on the other hand, uses computer-generated clouds, avoiding issues such as pixelation and other visual artifacts. Moreover, doodlum developed a proprietary cloud baking system and boasts that it is more advanced than the one featured in Fallout 4 (which launched four years after Fallout: New Vegas and is celebrating its tenth anniversary <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-4-anniversary-edition-all-dlc-creation-club-content-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with a new edition that comes out today</a>). Perfect Skies features 30 unique cloud variations and 60 4K textures, making up nearly 1GB of cloud textures. That said, the textures are compressed, so the file size is only 220MB.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The quest mod is called Fallout: Long 15 and takes the player character into NCR territory, entering California through Interstate 15. According to the modding team (which already <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/88180" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released a similar mod</a> for the Legion faction called Dry Wells), Long 15 features a huge new worldspace, complete with new quests, factions, and towns.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s a whole new week, and that means we can kickstart the next seven days by smashing today’s NYT Connections puzzle. Today’s trickery isn’t too tough to contend with, but that doesn’t mean you don’t want to walk away with the best NYT Connections hints and solutions, courtesy of Insider Gaming.</p>



<p>Read on to get the full list of NYT Connections hints and solutions for today’s puzzle.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-november-10">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (November 10)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #883:</p>



<ul>
<li>SINE</li>



<li>CLEAR</li>



<li>PRO</li>



<li>SQUARE</li>



<li>SAW</li>



<li>AB</li>



<li>I</li>



<li>TRIANGLE</li>



<li>BELL</li>



<li>CAME</li>



<li>DRUM</li>



<li>PAY</li>



<li>SUB</li>



<li>SETTLE</li>



<li>RATTLE</li>



<li>CONQUERED</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em><em>Strike up the band!</em> These make noise when hit, shaken, or rattled.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em><em>Financial closure.</em> These words all signal that what’s owed is no longer owed.</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em><em>A swift conquest.</em> These four words form a legendary declaration of victory.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em><em>Prepositions from the past.</em> These short words helped Romans express direction, cause, and relation.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, November 10.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-november-10-883">NYT Connections Answers for Today, November 10 (#883)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– BELL, DRUM, RATTLE, TRIANGLE</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – CLEAR, PAY, SETTLE, SQUARE</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – CAME, CONQUERED, I, SAW</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – AB, PRO, SINE, SUB</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

<p>ARC Raiders is a stunning, post-apocalyptic extraction shooter with immense potential. It has become one of 2025’s most successful games and is, by numbers, the best-received extraction shooter ever made. In this guide, we’re looking at a portion of the game’s post-launch support model and determining when the next ARC Raiders season and Raider Deck are set to arrive.</p>



<p>If you’re waiting for more free rewards in ARC Raiders via the Raider Deck, read on to find out when it’s coming to the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-new-raider-deck-coming-to-arc-raiders">When is the New Raider Deck Coming to ARC Raiders?</h2>



<p><strong>The next Raider Deck will unlock in ARC Raiders in December alongside the Cold Snap update</strong>. This update is set to bring a new map condition called Snowfall, introduce a special event called Flickering Flames, close the Expedition window, <strong>and </strong>introduce new quests.</p>



<p>This supersized update will be free to download and enjoy, with Embark Studios delivering on the promise to support this game for the foreseeable future.</p>



<p>If the Raider Deck is anything like the current Raider Deck, it’ll be something special for players to chase.</p>



<p>To level up through the Raider Deck, you need to complete Feats to unlock ‘blue’ credits, which can then be applied to the pages bursting with rewards in the Raider Deck tab on the main menu. You’ll need to unlock a certain amount on one page before unlocking the next page, but it takes no time at all, as Feats are constantly refreshing as you complete them.</p>



<p>In the Raider Deck, you’ll find everything from hairstyles to outfits, and from boxes full of loot to Raider Credits. There’s a lot to unlock, which is brilliant, considering you’re not paying a penny for what’s contained in the Raider Deck.</p>



<p>Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> what you’re hoping for in the next Raider Deck in ARC Raiders.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders Peaks Again, 10 Days After Launch, and Beats Some Insanely Popular Games]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-peaks-10-days-later-beats-games/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-raiders-peaks-again-10-days-after-launch-and-beats-some-insanely-popular-games.1348426/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Despite ARC Raiders having been on the market for more than <strong>ten days</strong>, the game is still surpassing expectations and climbing on certain platforms. Hours ago, the post-apocalyptic extraction shooter managed to secure a new record on Steam, climbing to a peak of 462,488 players, beating the previous high of 416,517.</p>



<p>The constantly climbing peak is indicative of the quality of this game. The smash hit from Embark Studios continues to turn heads worldwide, and millions of players are flooding the accessible, welcoming platform.</p>







<p>ARC Raiders isn’t your typical extraction shooter. For starters, it’s a third-person shooter with heavy social aspects, and it’s designed to ideally be treated as a PvE game in <strong>many ways</strong>. It has been soaring up the charts since dropping on October 30, and it shows absolutely no signs of slowing down.</p>



<p>Yesterday, the game hit a peak user count of 416,517 on Steam, but in recent hours, that peak has climbed further to 462,488 players. It’s bucking trends, but this multiplayer-only shooter is getting stronger over time, rather than the player count inevitably dying out.</p>



<p>In terms of the record books, ARC Raiders has now beaten Helldivers 2, Sons of the Forest, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, GTA 5, and Starfield. It’s on the cusp of topping Call of Duty, Fallout 4, and Terraria.</p>



<p>This is likely because ARC Raiders still isn’t completely understood by the wider gaming community, and as these users are having their eyes opened to the game’s potential, they’re finding their way into the game.</p>



<p>Embark Studios recently revealed a stunning roadmap for ARC Raiders that promises to keep the game stoked for the time being, but the team has suggested it wants to support ARC Raiders for <strong>a decade</strong>, which is almost unheard of in this business.</p>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Mirage’s Valley of Memory update is a supersized overhaul that comes with a stack of Trophies and Achievements that you can unlock <strong>for free</strong>. It’s a sizeable expansion that takes players to an all-new region of the 2023 open-world title, presenting them with a splinter story that Ubisoft isn’t charging a penny for.</p>



<p>In this guide, learn how to unlock all Assassin’s Creed Mirage: Valley of Memory Trophies and Achievements.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-assassin-s-creed-mirage-valley-of-memory-trophies-amp-achievements">All Assassin’s Creed Mirage: Valley of Memory Trophies &amp; Achievements</h2>



<p>Fans were surprised when Ubisoft announced Valley of Memory so far after launch, as Assassin’s Creed Mirage received very little in the way of updates after launch, save for the typical New Game+ kind of content.</p>



<p>Here’s the full list of Trophies and Achievements in Assassin’s Creed Mirage: Valley of Memory:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Trophy &amp; Achievement Name</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Lost and Found</strong></td><td>Return all stolen goods to Hind</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Once Upon a Time</strong></td><td>Listen to all folktales</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Pro Musician</strong></td><td>Collect all Oud melodies</td></tr><tr><td><strong>If I Recall Correctly</strong></td><td>Replay an Animus Sequence</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Perfect Memory</strong></td><td>Complete all sequence challenges</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Playback</strong></td><td>Unlock all Animus Sequence rewards</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Taste Your Own Medicine</strong></td><td>Poison a Poisoner</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Like a Local</strong></td><td>Complete all the AlUla territories</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Make a Break</strong></td><td>Escape the AlUla prison</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Turn the Page</strong></td><td>Say goodbye to Is’haq</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Give it the Slip</strong></td><td>Escape the AlUla prison undetected</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>







<p>It’s not a huge list, but considering Valley of Memory is a completely free expansion, it’s a decent list of Trophies and Achievements to chase. Fans were mostly surprised that Ubisoft decided to tack this expansion onto Assassin’s Creed Mirage, which is more than two years old at this point.</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Mirage: Valley of Memory will be released as a free-to-download update on all platforms on November 18. Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you’ll be playing the new expansion.</p>

<p>Find out if the Switch game you want to play is compatible</p>

<p>Since the launch of the Switch 2 in June, Nintendo has released game upgrades, updates, and system firmware patches to make more games compatible with its new hybrid system.</p>
<p>It's not always been the easiest to keep track of every update, and to help make this process a little easier, a new website has now gone live.</p>
<p>It allows you to check the compatibility of Switch software on the Nintendo Switch 2. It's as simple as <a href="https://switch-software-compatibility.nintendo.com/en-US">typing a Switch game into the search bar</a>, and it will reveal if it's "supported" or not. Nintendo also notes how search results include both physical and digital versions of software.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067vspxgn&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

<p>This search functionality extends to apps, and each search may or may not include additional information such as recent patches. Other searches will result in "incompatible" or "unsupported" as you can see in the screenshots below - with Nintendo even acknowledging specific issues.</p>
<p>So, instead of having to refer to the official PDFs or other search methods on Nintendo's website, you can now simply enter the game title in the search bar and find out if the software you want to play is compatible on the Switch 2.</p>

<p>When Nintendo initially revealed Switch game compatibility for the Switch 2, it mentioned at the time how not every game would be supported at launch, but explained how the work to make more games compatible was ongoing.</p>
<p>This new search page means you can now regularly check the status of games that may not yet be compatible with the Switch 2 and see if there are any updates.</p>

What if we could dream it together?</p><p><em>Reverie in the Moonlight</em> is an action game where, with the help of your stuffed animals, you try to defend yourself from the monsters attacking you night after night.</p><p><strong>Nightly Visits</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Little Tete’s nights are restless. His dreams are full of horrible monsters attacking him. But then, one night, he meets <a title="Platforms > Luna [68 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/cloud/luna">Luna</a>, and she teaches him how to use his plushies to defend himself.</p><p><strong>Cute But Strong</strong></p><p>When faced with a monster, Tete can only do one thing: run away. His plushies, however, can actually fight and defeat monsters. Different animals play different roles, with some focusing on short-range attacks, some on long-range shots, and some on supporting their allies. There are 40 types to choose from, so find your favorites and help them protect Tete from the monsters.</p><ul><li><strong>Ham Jr.</strong> – Runs left and right, hitting monsters that get too close with a stick.</li><li><strong>Snoozy-G</strong> – Enjoys sleeping, napping, and resting. Monsters that hit it are slowed down for a while.</li><li><strong>Striped Angel</strong> – When it sees someone in trouble, it always wants to help. It heals Tete up from a distance.</li></ul><p><strong>Collect and Strategize</strong></p><p>After the monsters’ attack is over, you can shop with the gold you found. You can get new plushies and even buy special items that can make you stronger. Some of them will also give you new weaknesses, so it’s up to you to strategize and prepare for the next attack in the best way possible. There are more than 100 items in the game… Will you be able to collect them all?</p><p><strong>Change Clothes to Change Strategies</strong></p><p>So, you’ve played the game’s story to the end. Well done. But this is just the start!</p><p>You can change Tete’s clothes, choosing from more than 20 costumes. Each one makes him stronger in some ways and weaker in others. If you want to help Tete defeat his nightmares, you’ll have to find the right plushies and items to go with each costume!</p><ul><li><strong>Moonlight Wizard</strong> – Plushies with long-range attacks become stronger, but Tete can only use those. Defending yourself becomes harder, so you’ll have to defeat monsters before they can get close.</li><li><strong>Nap Cloud</strong> – Increasing attack power becomes difficult, but plushies that don’t move around attack twice as fast. Try to find as many stationary friends as you can.</li><li><strong>Doggy Friend</strong> – Tete can only use dog plushies. If you want to win, you’ll need to make good use of their fast respawn speed.</li></ul></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/11/reverie-in-the-moonlight-launches-november-25]]></content:encoded>
