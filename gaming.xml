		<p>Another set of sweeping layoffs are hitting Microsoft’s gaming business, with 650 employees being made redundant across Xbox, Bethesda and Activision Blizzard. The news comes via an internal memo sent by Xbox boss Phil Spencer to staff.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-another-650-staff-from-its-video-game-workforce-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-sends-memo-to-staff">Made public by IGN</a>, Spencer explains that the impact will mainly be felt in the corporate and support function positions, “to organize our business for long term success.” He also stated that “No games, devices or experiences are being cancelled and no studios are being closed as part of these adjustments today.”</p>


<p>All those being laid off in the US will receive severance pay, extended healthcare and outplacement services. The package will differ in other countries.</p>
<p>Following on from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/25/microsoft-is-laying-off-a-staggering-1900-people-across-xbox-activision-zenimax/">layoffs at the start of 2024</a>, Microsoft has now cut 2,550 jobs since it acquired Activision Blizzard in late 2023. That acquisition had led to the company’s gaming workforce suddenly ballooning up to around 22,000 people at the end of last year, and with years of acquisitions that had brought multiple separate publishing arms and labels together, some kind of layoffs and restructuring were pretty much inevitable. Those earlier layoffs, however, saw the announced closure of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/07/arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks-closed-by-microsoft/">Tango Gameworks</a> – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/12/tango-gameworks-is-back-as-krafton-revives-hi-fi-rush-studio/">since rescued</a> – and Arkane Austin, and the spin off of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/01/toys-for-bob-goes-independent-but-explores-partnership-with-microsoft/">Toys For Bob</a>.</p>
<p>There’s been a terrible toll taken on the staff of the games industry over the last couple years, as economic sands have shifted and company leadership decide to make job cuts. We wish all those affected by this latest round of layoffs all the best in finding new work.</p>

<p>Here’s Spencer’s full email to staff:</p>
<blockquote><p>For the past year, our goal has been to minimize disruption while welcoming new teams and enabling them to do their best work. As part of aligning our post-acquisition team structure and managing our business, we have made the decision to eliminate approximately 650 roles across Microsoft Gaming — mostly corporate and supporting functions — to organize our business for long term success.</p>
<p>I know that this is difficult news to hear. We are deeply grateful for the contributions of our colleagues who are learning they are impacted. In the U.S., we’re supporting them with exit packages that include severance, extended healthcare, and outplacement services to help with their transition; outside the U.S. packages will differ according to location.</p>
<p>With these changes, our corporate and supporting teams and resources are aligned for sustainable future growth, and can better support our studio teams and business units with programs and resources that can scale to meet their needs. Separately, as part of running the business, there are some impacts to other teams as they adapt to shifting priorities and manage the lifecycle and performance of games. No games, devices or experiences are being cancelled and no studios are being closed as part of these adjustments today.</p>
<p>Throughout our team’s history, we have had great moments, and we have had challenging ones. Today is one of the challenging days. I know that going through more changes like this is hard, but even in the most trying times, this team has been able to come together and show one another care and kindness as we work to continue delivering for our players. We appreciate your support as we navigate these changes and we thank you for your compassion and respect for each other.</p>
<p>Phil</p></blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/microsoft-gaming-to-cut-another-650-jobs-mostly-in-corporate-and-support-games-wont-be-affected/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Microsoft is cutting another 650 jobs in its gaming division, Stephen Totilo <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/microsoft-gaming-layoffs-xbox-650?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=66124&amp;post_id=148802913&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;r=5eh0e&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> in today's Game File newsletter. The article includes a quote from an internal email sent this morning to employees by Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer:</p>
<p><em>As part of aligning our post-acquisition team structure and managing our business, we have made the decision to eliminate approximately 650 roles across Microsoft Gaming—mostly corporate and supporting functions—to organize our business for long term success.</em></p>
<p>This time around, no games, devices, or experiences will be affected by the job cuts. That wasn't the case with the previous <a href="https://wccftech.com/four-months-after-the-merger-with-activision-blizzard-microsoft-is-laying-off-1900-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mass layoffs of 1,900 employees</a> across Xbox, Activision Blizzard, and Bethesda, which resulted in the cancellation of Odyssey, Blizzard's survival game based on a brand new IP.</p>
<p>It has been a year of layoffs across the whole industry. On January 22, Riot Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/riot-games-lays-off-11-of-workforce-shuts-down-riot-forge-to-refocus-on-core-projects/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that 530 staff members had been laid off. <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-lays-off-8-of-playstation-workforce-london-studio-closed-guerrilla-naughty-dog-insomniac-affected/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sony Interactive Entertainment</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-lays-off-5-of-its-employees-cancels-star-wars-respawn-fps-and-seeks-to-move-away-from-licensed-ips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Electronic Arts</a> followed suit in late February, removing 900 and 670 employees, respectively. On the occasion, Sony also shut down the London studio that was making a modern fantasy online cooperative action game.</p>
<p>In March, SEGA <a href="https://wccftech.com/sega-sells-relic-entertainment-cuts-another-240-jobs-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> Relic Entertainment and laid off around 240 employees across its European teams. The following month, it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-two-lays-off-5-of-its-workforce-cancels-some-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Take-Two's turn</a> to reduce its workforce by 5% and shut down OlliOlli developer Roll7 and Intercept Games, canceling some unannounced games in the process.</p>
<p>The bad news kept coming with Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-a-couple-more-bethesda-softworks-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shutting down</a> three studios in May, including Arkane Austin (Dishonored, Prey, Redfall) and Tango Gameworks (The Evil Within, Ghostwire: Tokyo, and Hi-Fi Rush), while Roundhouse Studios got folded into ZeniMax Online. Tango Gameworks (or what was left of it anyway, since about half of the employees had already found employment elsewhere) was subsequently <a href="https://wccftech.com/tango-gameworks-and-its-hi-fi-rush-ip-have-just-been-acquired-by-pubgs-krafton/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired</a> by Krafton in August alongside the Hi-Fi Rush IP.</p>
<p>We would like to believe this latest round of Microsoft layoffs will be the final news of this kind we report this year, but there's a solid chance that won't be the case.</p>

The adaptive charging feature, which monitors and automatically adjusts the power supplied when controllers are connected to the console’s USB ports, is being released globally starting today — but only for the latest PS5 models.</p><p>In its announcement, Sony says adaptive charging is only available on the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/10/23955005/sony-playstation-5-ps5-slim-size-comparison-photo-gallery-hands-on-impressions">PS5 Slim</a> and its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/10/24167932/ps5-pro-sony-specs-announcement">upcoming $700 PS5 Pro</a>.

Charging is adjusted based on the controller’s current battery levels, which can help save power and extend battery life.

Sometimes we play video games to plunder the silty depths of our emotions, sometimes we play them to sharpen our wits and try the alchemy of engrossing systems, sometimes we play them to mud-wrestle with questions of power and responsibility, and sometimes we just want to wear cool sunglasses, have big arms, and fly around hitting stuff very hard.</p> <!--more-->
<p>Undefeated is a free open world homage to Superman and superheroes at large, created by three students from Vantan Game Academy, Osaka. Released on Steam in 2019, it's just received <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1116960/view/4585315413748320015?l=english">a chunky-ish update</a> alongside a surprise launch on PS5.
</p>
<p>
If you missed it back in 2019, here's the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1116960/UNDEFEATED/">Steam store page</a>, and here's a quick list of things you can do in Undefeated:
</p>
<p>
- Fly real fast with streaky lines and break the sound barrier
</p>
<p>
- Do a superhero one-knee landing 
</p>
<p>
- Ricochet between big mechy things, punching them
</p>
<p>
- Lift up big rocks
</p>
<p>
- Put out fires by clapping your hands (you don't have a copyright on the concept of wind, Dr Banner!)
</p>
<p>
- Do QTE counters on supervillains, then combo them like in Dragon Ball
</p>
<p>
- Chop your hands to do energy attacks while strafing
</p>
<p>
- Pose magnificently while soldiers shoot their wimpy little bullets at you
</p>
<p>
- Fly through hoops, Superman's greatest nemesis
</p>
<p>
- Rank up and get new powers, a bit
</p>
<p>
As of the update, it looks like you can also do heat rays from your eyes. There's also a new map event to experience, possibly related to those heat rays. Undefeated Man might have all the visual flavour and idiosyncracy of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nz8ssH7LiB0">the square hole</a>, but he certainly has a few tricks up his sleeve. On the technical side, the update adds support for 4K resolution (3840x2160) and WQHD resolution (2560x1440).
</p>
<p>
I doubt Undefeated will keep you occupied for longer than, oh, let's say 10 minutes, but it's well-made for what it is, and importantly, doesn't pretend to be anything more. Those who pine for noughties superpower fantasies like Prototype might get a real kick out of it. Also, people who pine for an actually decent official Superman game, which will absolutely never happen. Sorry, Clarkies and Kenters, but this particular comicbook property is clearly cursed. The best we'll ever get is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/injustice-2">Injustice</a>.
</p>
<p>
The developers are working on a paid sequel, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2088020/">Undefeated: Genesis</a>, which transports the proceedings to a big alien world full of mutants. In a scandalous flourish, the new incarnation of the protagonist has a spiky fringe and doesn't wear sunglasses. Beyond that, it looks a bit like an early prototype for BioWare's Anthem.

<p>PS5 has just announced a new software update that will introduce a host of new features for the console. These include the Welcome Hub, Party Share, Personalized 3D Audio Profiles, Adaptive Charging and Remote Play for individual users.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Welcome Hub is a new way players can personalize their home screen on the PS5. In the United States, this Hub will replace the current Explore Tab. Players can customize the Hub with various widgets, including console storage, battery levels for accessories, online friends, trophies, and more. Additionally, the size and layout of the widgets are adjustable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Players can also set custom backgrounds for the Welcome Hub, which can be from various in-house designs or the console’s media gallery. Welcome Hub will roll out globally through a PS5 software update in the coming weeks. It is available for limited players in the United States <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/12/ps5-system-update-adds-welcome-hub-party-share-personalized-3d-audio-profiles-adaptive-controller-charging-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">starting today</a>.&nbsp;</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Party Share is another feature that will be phased in and released globally in the coming weeks. This feature allows players to share party voice chat links on any messaging or social media app, allowing them to invite friends from whichever platform they are chatting on. The friend can use the link even if they aren’t on your friends list on the PlayStation Network.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Players can create a party link through the Control Center on the PS5, generating a QR code that can be sent to friends. Along with the PS5, the PlayStation App will receive an update in the coming weeks, allowing players to create a party link from their phones.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-ps5-beta-features-releasing-today">PS5 Beta Features Releasing Today</h2>



<p>Although the Welcome Hub and Party Share will take a few weeks to roll out globally, the PS5 has some new features that players can try today. These include personalized 3D audio profiles that can be set for headphones or earbuds, an option to enable Remote Play for individual users, and adaptive charging for controllers.&nbsp;Learn more about the new PS5 features <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps5-beta-rolls-out-tomorrow-with-personalized-3d-audio-new-remote-play-settings-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Grand Theft Auto VI Is Unlikely To Run At 60 FPS On The PlayStation 5 Pro If Rockstar Is Targeting 30 FPS On the Base Model]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-60-fps-playstation-5-pro/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-unlikely-to-run-at-60-fps-on-the-playstation-5-pro-if-rockstar-is-targeting-30-fps-on-the-base-model.978780/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-60-fps-playstation-5-pro/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Despite its increased power over the original mode, the PlayStation 5 Pro may not be able to run the highly anticipated Grand Theft Auto VI at 60 frames per second for a few reasons.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/will-ps5-pro-run-gta-6-at-4k60-probably-not-say-the-experts">IGN</a>, Digital Foundry's Richard Leadbetter revealed that the new console's CPU, which is the same one that powers the base PS5, could prevent the system from running the game at 60 frames per second if Rockstar Games is targeting 30 FPS on the base model. Most entries in the series have always run complex simulations that push the CPU hard, and this is why each one of them initially ran at 30 FPS or lower.</p>
<p>This is not to say that Grand Theft Auto VI won't look better on the PlayStation 5 Pro than on the base model. According to the Digital Foundry expert, the console will offer higher-quality visuals thanks to its considerable GPU improvements over the base model and could definitely deliver more stable performance, as the console's CPU, while the same as that of the regular PlayStation 5, received a 10% bump to clock speeds.</p>
<p>As Rockstar Games has only briefly discussed Grand Theft Auto VI and shown it off in only one trailer, it's definitely too early to say if the game will target 30 FPS on the base PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, and it may be a while before we hear more about the matter. As of now,<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-not-delayed/"> the game hasn't been delayed</a>, but its scale and complexity may cause a delay down the line and make it slip to 2026, something that could delay future reveals as well.</p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto VI launches late next year on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

<p>Xbox’s Phil Spencer has announced in an internal email to staff that Microsoft will lay off approximately 650 people from its gaming team.</p>



<p>The news comes from Stephen Totilo from <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/microsoft-gaming-layoffs-xbox-650" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game File</a>, which Insider Gaming has been able to independently verify.</p>



<p>The full email reads,</p>



<p><strong>Subject: Changes to Microsoft Gaming</strong></p>



<p>“For the past year, our goal has been to minimize disruption while welcoming new teams and enabling them to do their best work. As part of aligning our post-acquisition team structure and managing our business, we have made the decision to eliminate approximately 650 roles across Microsoft Gaming—mostly corporate and supporting functions—to organize our business for long term success.</p>



<p>I know that this is difficult news to hear. We are deeply grateful for the contributions of our colleagues who are learning they are impacted. In the US, we’re supporting them with exit packages that include severance, extended healthcare, and outplacement services to help with their transition; outside the US packages will differ according to location.</p>



<p>With these changes, our corporate and supporting teams and resources are aligned for sustainable future growth, and can better support our studio teams and business units with programs and resources that can scale to meet their needs. Separately, as part of running the business, there are some impacts to other teams as they adapt to shifting priorities and manage the lifecycle and performance of games. No games, devices or experiences are being cancelled and no studios are being closed as part of these adjustments today.</p>



<p>Throughout our team’s history, we have had great moments, and we have had challenging ones. Today is one of the challenging days. I know that going through more changes like this is hard, but even in the most trying times, this team has been able to come together and show one another care and kindness as we work to continue delivering for our players. We appreciate your support as we navigate these changes and we thank you for your compassion and respect for each other.</p>



<p>Phil”</p>



<p>Earlier this year, Microsoft announced that it would be&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-microsoft-layoffs-affect-1900-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">laying off 1900 employees at the company</a>. In May 2024, it was also announced that Xbox would&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-shutting-down-four-studios-including-tango-game-works-and-arkane-austin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shut down four of its game studios</a>, including Tango Gamewords and Arkane Austin.</p>

            <p>Microsoft has laid off a further 650 Xbox staff, though no games have been cancelled or studios have been closed this time.</p>
<p>The news was shared by CEO of Microsoft Gaming <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> in an internal memo obtained by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-another-650-staff-from-its-video-game-workforce-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-sends-memo-to-staff">IGN</a>, with changes made to "organise our business for long term success".</p>
<p>The layoffs <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-to-lay-off-1900-people-across-xbox-and-activision-blizzard">follow the 1900 people who lost their jobs at the company in January</a> this year. It means Microsoft has now laid off 2,550 staff in the last year.</p>

<p>The roles affected are "mostly corporate and supporting functions," said Spencer</p>
<p>"For the past year, our goal has been to minimise disruption while welcoming new teams and enabling them to do their best work. As part of aligning our post-acquisition team structure and managing our business, we have made the decision to eliminate approximately 650 roles across Microsoft Gaming - mostly corporate and supporting functions - to organise our business for long term success," reads Spencer's email.</p>
<p>"I know that this is difficult news to hear. We are deeply grateful for the contributions of our colleagues who are learning they are impacted. In the US, we’re supporting them with exit packages that include severance, extended healthcare, and outplacement services to help with their transition; outside the US packages will differ according to location."</p>
<p>Spencer stated now the company's "corporate and supporting teams and resources are aligned for sustainable future growth", but confirmed "no games, devices or experiences are being cancelled and no studios are being closed as part of these adjustments today".</p>
<p>On top of those 1900 layoffs in January, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-shuts-slew-of-bethesda-studios-including-redfall-hi-fi-rush-developers">Microsoft shut down three studios in June</a>: Arkane Austin, Tango Gameworks, and Alpha Dog.</p>
<p>Back in March, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-concerned-over-layoffs-due-to-lack-of-industry-growth">Spencer discussed the waves of layoffs affecting the industry</a>, and said he was "most concerned" about its overall "lack of growth".</p>

			<p>How, in the name of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, do you turn the delightfully inconsistent nature of Quidditch into a coherent sport for online multiplayer? Well, after many hours with Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions, I’m still not entirely sure of the answer. I don’t think developer Unbroken Studios knows either, though they’ve had a ruddy good go of it.</p>
<p><iframe title="Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions - Official Launch Gameplay Walkthrough Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EMJpa5uyugw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Quidditch is a fantastic sport for scripted storytelling, be it in a novel or a film. Big, bombastic, dramatic, spectacular and a bit weird, those broomstick riding daredevils have been thrilling fans of the Wizarding World for years now. When it comes to a video game though, the narrative-led nature of Quidditch prove to be a bit messy. Unbroken Studios have attempted to bring order to the chaos with some clearer and more consistent rules.</p>


<p>Each team consists of six team members: three Chasers, one Beater, one Seeker, and one Keeper. As a solo player you can switch between the four roles at will, swapping to each character with the stab of a button, but in the 3v3 online, all players are assigned a Chaser and one of the other three classes. It’s a smart mechanic adapted other sports games, because when it comes to Quidditch, some positions are far more fun and meaningful to play in than others.</p>


<p>Being a Beater is terrific fun. Your job is to beat up opposing players and eliminate them from the match for a brief, but vital, period. You do this by summoning a Bludgeon – thankfully you don’t have to go find the Bludgeon, and instead you bring into existence with magic – and then launching it with wanton abandon at a teenager’s delicate and still developing skull.</p>
<p>Everyone wants to be a Beater, so chances are you’ll get to do this the least. Instead, judging by my experience, you are more likely to end up being the mostly pants Keeper and Seeker.</p>
<p>Being a Keeper is rubbish. Hanging out around the three hoop like goal posts, you can attempt to tackle player’s heading your way or intercept the ball – sorry, Quaffle. Controls are haphazard and the whole endevour feels fumbly. You’ll succeed and fail by accident, with skill or intention having little impact on proceedings. You can call plays, but it’s so ineffective on the outcome of a game – plus all the other players ignore you anyway – that it’s not worth your while.</p>

<p>Being a Seeker is slightly more enjoyable. You’ll spend most of your time doing nothing until a little flying ball called a Snitch is released. Then you need to leap into action, tracking the Snitch down, then chasing and catching it. Smartly, instead of securing your team 150 points and ending the match, you instead net 30 points and the game continues until 100 points is reached. Thing is, chasing a snitch, according to the Harry Potter books at least, should be thrilling and dangerous. Here it’s just a chore. You fly back and forth along the pitch, unable to fly particularly high due to restrictive invisible walls, waiting for a meter to fill until you finally are allowed to catch the snitch.</p>
<p>Finally, the Chaser is the more generic role that all players share in. Here you’ll throw and pass the Quaffle, launch tackles, and try to be a good team player. I say try, because teamwork doesn’t often happen in Quidditch Champions. Did you ever play in a football team when you were eight or nine years-old? You know the way that wherever the ball gets hoofed, every child, in every position, runs like their possessed after the ball? Well, Quidditch Champions is like that. You all chase after the Quaffle, passing and tactics be damned. The game just isn’t built for it. Maybe you get lucky, get the Quaffle and score, but you won’t get much satisfaction, there’s just too much random flukiness in this sport for that.</p>

<p>And yet, despite all these issues, there’s something occasionally oddly engaging about Quidditch Champions. Sometimes, not often, you get a decent match and everything makes sense. Plus, the visuals are lovely, the charming cartoon versions of Harry, Hermione, Ron, and co are filled with character. The voice over work is superb too, everyone sounding exactly as you imagined when reading the original books.</p>
<p>Then there’s the speed. This game plays fast, and boosting along on your broomstick feels just the right amount of punchy.Sadly, the camera can’t keep up. Rarely can you see where you want to go, following the action being near impossible. The HUD is weak too, failing to enable you to easily tell where the Quaffle even is, let along identify friend from foe – likely part of why everyone just flies from one end of the pitch to the other, refusing to pass. I mean, how can you pass if you can’t tell who’s even on your team?</p>
<p>At this stage of its release, with limited match options, arenas, characters, and outfits, you’ll likely have seen everything that Quidditch Champions has to offer in a few days. There is something here, a spark of a great game waiting to be, but Unbroken Studios are just going to have to put their collective broomsticks into overdrive to get there before their player base moves on.</p>

			<p>A new <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-system-software-update-24-05-09-60-00-performance-improvements/">PlayStation 5 system software update</a> is now live worldwide, introducing some new features, including those that were under testing the past few weeks with the latest beta firmware.</p>
<p>System software update 24.06 introduces the Welcome hub, a new personalized space on the console's home screen that players can customize with different widgets that display console storage, battery levels for accessories, online friends, trophies and many others. The size of each widget, as well as the background of the hub, can be changed at will. The Welcome hub will start rolling out for select users in the U.S. today, and support will be gradually expanded over the coming weeks starting in Japan and select European countries.</p>
<p>The new PlayStation 5 system software update also introduces a new Party Share feature that allows users to share party voice chat links on any messaging or social media app. This feature allows even users who haven't been added to the PlayStation Network friends list to join a voice chat. A PlayStation App update coming in the next few weeks will introduce a similar feature to the app.</p>
<p>Alongside these features, as already mentioned, the new PlayStation 5 system software update introduces new features that some users already got to try out with the latest beta firmware, such as personalized 3D audio profiles for headphones and earbuds and a new Remote Play setting that allows individual users to enable Remote Play. More information on everything the new system software update brings can be found on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/12/ps5-system-update-adds-welcome-hub-party-share-personalized-3d-audio-profiles-adaptive-controller-charging-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Official PlayStation Blog.</a></p>

            <p>
Every man has his breaking point, and mine is the DP motion, aka the D-pad input used to perform Ken's Shoryuken uppercut in Street Fighter, and moves like it in other <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fighting-games">fighting</a> games. I've never been able to perform it consistently. It's one of many moderately fiddly moves - written down for posterity in a small tear-stained journal I keep sorrowfully beneath my pillow - which have walled me out of enjoying fighting games, much as I love thinking about them. 
</p>
<p>
That wall grows ever higher as I age and my digits turn to dust and my dreams of launching Ryu like a sack of potatoes fade into the twilight. Still, at least I can still play and have fun with shooters, right? All you have to do in shooters is press a button once to make stuff go boom. Wait, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nightmare-operator">Nightmare Operator</a>, what are you doing? Nightmare Operator, no!

<p>
Nightmare Operator is a third-person "action-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a>" game in which you play Misha, a trigger-happy exorcist hunting folkloric abominations in a sumptuous low-poly, low-res Tokyo. Misha has a fancy modular gun, with modules inflicting different types of elemental damage and status effects. "Learning when your next shot is going to send a Youkai reeling or freeze them solid is key to survival," notes <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2957360/NIGHTMARE_OPERATOR/">the Steam blurb</a>, and yes, I am on board with this. I do like me a modular gun. I still think fondly of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rogue-trooper-remaster">Rogue Trooper</a>. But there is a twist: the game uses a Clutch system whereby you "rapidly switch between Weapons Modules using command inputs inspired by fighting games".
</p>
<p>
Please, DDDistortion. I can get my head around a Power Reload, but do not ask me to nail the fingering for a Zangief Screw Piledriver in order to plug in some ice bullets. From the looks of the just-released Tokyo Game Show trailer, above, Misha also gets a parry and melee counters. You'll need to keep a "level head". It's all so <em>technical</em>, ugh. And yes, they've got my old nemesis the DP motion in there.
</p>

</figure>
<p>
The enemies themselves are a characterful bunch. They're inspired by yokai stories, but I don't know much about yokai, so will paraphrase them in the clunky lingo of the Clueless Westerner. You've got Wizard Dog, who throws X-shaped bursts of energy balls. There's also Knife-Wielding School Girl With Wonky Face, who likes to slink behind shelves and pounce on you. Stretchy Neck Dude seems fond of peeking around corners - he reminds me of those stampeding necromorphs from Dead Space 2. And let's not forget Floating Cyborg Head, who charges up an energy beam that seems easy to dodge, but will probably prove vexing when you're battling several spectres. 
</p>
<p>
Its an impressive line-up, honestly. And I'm sure the fighting game gimmick adds flair. I look forward to hearing about how fun these creatures are to battle from Brendy, our resident Tekkenite.
</p>
<p>
The game's PSX-styled setting is wonderfully crisp and dingy and full of cyber-90s detailing - glitching holograms, piles of boxy TVs broadcasting weird sigils, the sunken radiance of vending machines. There's a slice-of-life hangout element to wash down the exor-shooting. "Between missions, Misha and her team have nomikai at a local izakaya in the Quarantine City," explains the Steam blurb. These sections will allow players to explore archives from the broken world of Nightmare Operator, interact with the inhabitants of the Quarantine City, and drool over low-poly izakaya fare." 
</p>
<p>
It sounds reminiscent of cooling off in the back alleys of Yakuza Zero. Again, thoroughly on board with this as a concept if not at the level of my thumbs. Still, perhaps if I play it and master it I'll be able to enjoy Street Fighter?

            <p>A fresh PS5 system software update is on the way that adds a new customisable Welcome Hub to the home screen.</p>
<p>The Welcome Hub will be a tab on the home screen - like the store or individual games - which players can customise with widgets for a personalised experience. Essentially, it's a reworked version of the Explore tab previously only available in the U.S.</p>
<p>Players in the U.S. will receive the Welcome Hub today, with Japan and select countries in Europe following "over the coming weeks", and then a full worldwide release.</p>

<p>Widgets include the likes of console storage, controller battery levels, online friends, trophies, and more. Widgets can be resized and the background can be altered to preset designs with animated effects, or your own screenshot.</p>
<p>Another addition in the system update is a phased release of Party Share, which will allow players to share a party voice chat link on any messaging or social media app via QR code. It means you can add any player to your voice chat without needing to be friends on PlayStation Network.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, some features included in a previous beta will roll out globally today. That includes personalised 3D audio profiles, the ability to adjust remote play settings for individual users, and adaptive charging for your controllers.</p>
<p>The latter helps save power by adjusting the length of time power is supplied to a controller when charging. However, this is only available for the PS5 Slim and newly announced PS5 Pro.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, Sony finally announced the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-announces-digital-only-playstation-5-pro-costs-700">digital-only PS5 Pro</a>, which comes with a £700 price tag. It also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-quietly-increases-price-of-playstation-5-dualsense-controller">quietly increased the price of a PS5 DualSense controller</a> before the announcement.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-families-is-out-of-beta-letting-you-share-games-with-up-to-five-others<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  

        <p>and you call them that despite the fact they are obviously grilled</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Steam’s family sharing feature Steam Families is now available to everyone on the platform, letting up to six total people share games from a single library, with each individual having access to their own saved games, achievements, and workshop files.</p>
<p>This means that, yes, when you all sit down together in the evening, you can enjoy a hearty family meal in the knowledge that between you, you technically own six copies of the Cities Skylines <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2248517364">Big Butt Skinner Balloon</a>.</p>
<p>Each person on the account will have one of two roles: adult or child. Adults can manage parental controls, set hourly or daily playtime limits, approve purchase requests, and control store access. Valve appear very proud of making it easier for parents to spend money, streamlining the “time-consuming” task of buying games for their kids.</p>

<p>Game sharing itself is the main improvement from the platform’s previous family sharing feature, and now works like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Let's say that you are in a family with 4 members and that you own a copy of Portal 2 and a copy of Half-Life. At any time, any one member can play Portal 2 and another can play Half-Life. If two of you would like to play Portal 2 at the same time, someone else in the family will need to purchase a copy of the game. After that purchase, there are two owned copies of Portal 2 across the family and any two members can play at the same time.</p></blockquote>
<p>Wait a second, Valve. Those are both Valve games! I see what you’ve done here. I suppose they couldn’t go picking favourites.</p>
<p>Whether a game is eligible for family sharing or not, however, is up to the developer:</p>
<blockquote><p>A game's developer controls whether a game is eligible for sharing with Steam Families. All developer settings for the previous Steam Family Sharing feature are being brought forward to Steam Families. So, if a game is currently eligible for Family Sharing, it will remain so in the new system unless the developer chooses to opt-out later.</p></blockquote>
<p>There are a few more details in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/4605582245626919823">accompanying blog post</a>. This one stood out to me:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>What happens if my brother gets banned for cheating while playing my game?</strong></p>
<p>If a family member gets banned for cheating while playing your copy of a game, you (the game owner) will also be banned in that game. Other family members are not impacted.</p></blockquote>
<p>I enjoy the fact that they specified “brother” here. We all know dad’s furiously googling aimbots as soon as everyone’s left the room. If you fancy swallowing a time capsule with a fresh glass of morality awareness (with bits in), here’s Nathan Grayson (RPS in Peace) covering the previous incarnation of the feature <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/all-in-the-steam-family-sharing-available-to-everyone">ten actual years ago</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Sony has officially unveiled the PlayStation 5 Pro, a powerful console with a hefty price tag. It’s so expensive that it has immediately started turning gamers off, but it has been suggested that it’s by design, as the console will typically be marketed towards enthusiasts and <strong>not </strong>casual gamers.</p>



<p>With the lack of games on the horizon, talk has turned to GTA 6 being the ‘only title’ that would sway people to invest in a PS5 Pro. However, in a recent interview with Digital Foundry, it was suggested that even the might of the Pro wouldn’t be enough to push GTA 6’s frame rate up to 60 FPS.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-it-s-a-cpu-problem">‘It’s a CPU Problem’</h2>



<p>It has almost been a year since the first Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer was released, and fans are waiting patiently for another update. When the trailer was published in December 2023, it broke viewership records, but then Rockstar Games was plunged back into silence and shadow, setting about completing what might be the fastest-selling game ever.</p>



<p>Following the reveal of the PlayStation 5 Pro, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/will-ps5-pro-run-gta-6-at-4k60-probably-not-say-the-experts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN sat down with Digital Foundry</a> to grill tech experts on the expectations of the console running Grand Theft Auto 5.</p>



<p>To that end, Richard Leadbetter, the technology editor at DF, explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Grand Theft Auto games have always run complex simulations that push the CPU hard, which is why every GTA game has initially launched on their target platforms at 30 FPS or lower. The PS5 Pro uses the same CPU as the PS5 and it would be extremely challenging to hit 60 FPS if the base PS5 version is targeting 30 FPS.</p>



<p>This isn’t a GPU problem, it’s a CPU problem.</p>



<p>Of course, all bets are off if Rockstar is targeting 60 FPS on the standard PS5 – but we’ve seen no evidence so far to suggest it is.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Rockstar Games always tries to produce living, breathing worlds in Grand Theft Auto, and what we’ve seen from the development of GTA 6 suggests that concept will be taken to epic proportions. We can expect intensely realistic AI behaviour, the type which leads to random encounters and unique events occurring around every turn.</p>



<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro’s boost in power will inevitably make games look better and run more smoothly, and the 8K capabilities are sure to be leant on by some more high-end developers, but we’re not sure yet how it’ll impact Grand Theft Auto 5.</p>



<p>Is it a deal breaker for you if GTA 6 doesn’t run at 60 FPS on the PS5 Pro?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/12/wild-bastards-review-12-09-24/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>The Wild Bastards are all dead. Worse still, their corpses have been scattered across the galaxy, hidden away behind a multitude of evil robot cowboys and hordes of insidious giant insects. Which is a problem. Thankfully, it’s a problem that the two remaining Wild Bastards, Casino and Spider Rosa, are more than happy to solve; especially if it means blowing away thousands of cyborg outlaws in a cavalcade of bullets. Our two plucky bastards must roam the galaxy in a sentient spaceship, recovering and resuscitating their deceased posse as they go, until the gang are assembled and ready to take on big bad puritanical magnate Jebediah Chaste.</p>
<p><iframe title="Wild Bastards - Release Date Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rMaG157j92s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>How best to describe the innovative gameplay experience that Wild Bastards offers? A Turn-Based Rogue-like First Person Shooter doesn’t quite cut it, but it’s close enough. The turn-based bit plays out like a board game, where you guide the good ship Drifter around a galaxy filled with randomised planets. At the end of each galaxy, you’ll rescue a member of the Wild Bastards to add to your burgeoning crew. Encounter a planet on your travels and you’ll descend to the surface with a small team of Bastards. Here’s the second turn-based bit, as you guide each of your three duos around the procedurally generated environment: gathering loot, temporary buffs, and permanent level-ups. It’s best not to dawdle to find everything though, as one of Jebediah’s family (think rock-hard bosses) will be loitering on the planet-surface to chase you down.</p>


<p>You enter the first-person action element when you encounter a moving gang or roadblock on your travels. Your two outlaws, who you can instantly switch between, run and shoot their way around a small environment, having to wipe out the set number of critters they meet. The action is solid and slick; the enemy refuses to meet you head-on and instead opts for cowering behind cover and shooting you in the back whenever they can. As such, it plays out like a deadly version of hide-and-seek rather than an out-and-out shoot‘em up, and is all the more tense because of it.</p>


<p>If your entire cadre of Bastards are incapacitated, the roguelike portion of the game kicks in. At this point the Drifter rewinds time to the start of the galaxy – not to the start of the game, thankfully – losing all of the perks you gathered in the process. Fortunately, all the infamy you have earned through killing baddies and clearing planets earns you a treasure chest stuffed with weapon boosts, gadgets, and health tonics to help you on your next playthrough.</p>
<p>It all adds up to quite the eccentric mix of gameplay mechanics, so it’s a credit to developers Blue Manchu that this strange hodgepodge totally works. The experience is thrilling, with the feeling of being a gang on the run from the law perfectly encapsulated. In every moment you are constantly at the risk of being caught, be it by a boss chasing you down on a planet, or your life meter slowly ebbing away as you try to find that one remaining outlaw, tucked away in some sneaky corner of the map.</p>
<p>The game also holds together so tightly because the Wild Bastards themselves are such an engaging and charismatic bunch. It’s a genuine delight to unlock a new gang member and discover the intricacies of their playstyle. Indeed, the repetitive elements of the gameplay structure are significantly eased simply through the joy of blasting baddies with a new weapon set and range of abilities. Take Casino by way of example – a shot-gun wielding card-hand android who, upon finding a power-up canteen, can randomly eliminate any enemy in the environment – and how much he differs to Judge – a mean and nasty sniper rifle-toting bot who can make everything move in John Woo slow-mo for a limited period. Then there’s Roswell, an alien with a charging energy gun who can jet pack around a stage, and Hopalong, a lasso-wielding lizard who favours a stealth approach. A fan-favourite will soon surely be Preach though, a chaingun-toting zealot who uses the potent power of her faith as armour. It’s like having thirteen brilliant first-person shooters bolted together.</p>

<p>Well, almost. Unfortunately, not every Bastard is a hit. Smoky will likely find himself left behind more often than not, due to the horrible inaccuracy of their fire attacks, and how they can inexplicably be harmed by the very same fire they leave behind. Still, twelve out of thirteen is darn good doing.</p>
<p>Varying up your teams, seeing how their disparate abilities complement each other (or not), is all part of the fun. The presentation of the gang is top notch too, the pop-art comic book visuals accentuated by the pitch-perfect over-the-top voice work. It’s like a Saturday-morning carton brought to life; like the space-western 1980’s carton BraveStarr, but on steroids. Indeed, BraveStarr must have been an inspiration for Bule Manchu, as horse-faced Sarge is a dead ringer for the kid’s show’s iconic horseman Thirty/Thirty.</p>
<p>The environments themselves continue the BraveStarr tone, with space canteens, underground mines, and abandoned hamlets to conduct your shoot-outs in. Though there’s something of Tron in the aesthetic too, with plenty of holograms and glowing lines smattered about. In short, this is a distinctive and visually compelling game.</p>
<p>Not everything is a success, characters teleport up the ladders in each level rather than climbing them, making it easy to be discombobulated as you clamber onto a rooftop. All the more galling when a bad guy gets a couple of cheap shots in while you figure out what you are looking at. Whilst the building and maintain of relationships between the Wild Bastards is underexplored, amounting to little more than collecting beans to earn a temporary ability boost. Also, once the, admittedly very enjoyable, campaign is wrapped up in around twelve hours or so, there’s not much left to do. Sure, a challenge mode offers opportunities to tinker and modify the play experience, but without the intrigue of unlocking a new Bastard hanging in the air, it pales in comparison to the main game.</p>

			<p>BioWare continues to&nbsp;<span>show off new parts of Dragon Age: The Veilguard. Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-shown-in-new-22-min-gameplay-video-with-bioware-commentary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">combat</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-progression-systems-get-fully-detailed-by-bioware/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">progression</a> showcases, the developer has now <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard/news/exploration-across-thedas?isLocalized=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> a new blog post and a series of flyover videos about</span> the exploration and regions that players will encounter in the game. To begin with, the studio detailed five major locations in Dragon Age: The Veilguard, including the Arlathan Forest, the Hossberg Wetlands, the city of Minrathous, Rivain, and the city of Treviso.</p>
<p><em><strong>Arlathan Forest</strong> <strong>-</strong> Ancient magic and powerful artifacts are reawakening, and the reality is thinning in the forest that was once the heart of the elven empire. The Veil Jumpers, masters of ancient elven magic, seek to stabilize the region and keep reality from crumbling.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Dragon Age: The Veilguard | Arlathan Forest" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CdOZ1XZDaOM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><em><strong>Hossberg Wetlands -</strong> Much of this once-peaceful marshland has been consumed by the Blight. The dreadful Darkspawn roam the swamps with impunity, but the Grey Wardens mount a valiant defense of the last safe haven - Lavendel.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Dragon Age: The Veilguard | Hossberg Wetlands" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SsHNqHvU4a4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p><em><strong>Minrathous -</strong> In the capital of the Tevinter Empire, the Venatori wield corruption as they seek to turn the heart of the Empire to their own dark purposes. But the people resist, led by the rebel faction known as Shadow Dragons.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Dragon Age: The Veilguard | Minrathous" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g6vBsHJUtgI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p><em><strong>Rivain -</strong> An ancient fortress of the Grey Wardens sits amidst the sparkling waters and lush greenery of the Rivain Coast; the Lords of Fortune call this paradise home. But the servants of the gods have plans of their own, and threaten to turn this sanctuary into a battleground.</em></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Dragon Age: The Veilguard | Rivain" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vgokq8jNbgs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p><em><strong>Treviso -</strong> A trading city known for its beautiful canals and the lethality of its assassins, Treviso is under Antaam occupation, a state of affairs that does not sit well with the Antivan Crows.</em></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Dragon Age: The Veilguard | Treviso" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VtNBIwafql0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The blog post also confirms that exploring these regions will award not only loot but also lore tidbits for the Codex unlocked by discovering ancient statues, letters, and artifacts. Moreover, Dragon Age: The Veilguard includes puzzles, some of which may be solved with the help of Rook's Companion Abilities. Players may even find non-grouped Companions out there in the world doing their own thing. Traveling through these regions happens thanks to the network of Eluvian gates known as the Crossroads. Here, BioWare said we can expect more puzzles and side missions.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more Dragon Age: The Veilguard coverage ahead of the launch scheduled for October 31 on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-now-season-3-goes-live-with-new-details<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Monster Hunter Now</em> is making the rounds with another wave of new content as part of their newest season: Curse of the Wandering Flames. Capcom and Niantic have dropped a bunch of new information alongside its release - including a new cooking feature - which is live as of this posting.</p>
<p>For those versed in the Monster Hunter series, cooking is a known staple of those games. It's finally made its way over to <em>Monster Hunter Now</em> as a feature that lets you cook using Raw Meat, which can be obtained as a supply item in the in-game shop. Cook up some Raw Meat to make Well-Done Steaks, which can be consumed to let you start a hunt with the Special Gauge at maximum for up to five minutes.</p>
<p>That said, if you mess up during your cooking session, you might end up with Raw Meat, Rare Steak, or Burnt Meat, the latter of which can still be used to hunt with a max gauge for at least one minute. Two pieces of Raw Meat can be collected daily from the in-game shop, so keep that in mind. You can also hold up to ten pieces of Raw Meat, Well-Done Steak, Rare Steak, and Burnt Meat.</p>
<p>Another addition this season in <em>Monster Hunter Now</em> is the introduction of the heavy bowgun, which includes Heavy Bowgun Training Quests. Complete these quests to earn Heavy Bowgun Training Tickets, which can be used to forge and upgrade the Bone Shooter.</p>
<p>This particular event will last from September 12 through November 30, 2024 at 2:59PM UTC. Other rewards include gatherable materials such as the Monster Bone+, Zenny, and Season Tier points.</p>

For a limited time, they can also claim an additional 1000 Item Box Expansion slots, 10,000 Zenny, and three Ultra Hunting Tickets through September 22.</p>
<p><em>Monster Hunter Now</em>'s new season will also introduce new monsters on the field. By completing urgent quests, players can unlock Aknosom, Magnamalo, and Rajang. These quests will also unlock Mizutsune and Nightshade Paolumu, who have only appeared in events until now. Some monsters will temporarily disappear from the field once Season 3 begins, but they can be unlocked once more by completing the accompanying story quests.</p>
<p>The new season will also feature some social activities, including a campaign on X (Twitter). Simply check out the official account over there, help it reach 5,000 reposts and unlock an offer code. This will include a number of items such as Potions, Machalite Ore, Dragonite Rre, earth crystals, Monster Bone+, and Weapon Refining Parts.</p>
<p>There's a new streamer mode too that'll let players stream <em>Monster Hunter Now</em> gameplay online without giving away sensitive information such as location data. Simply enable this mode in Settings and your ID and location information will be restricted.</p>
<p><em>Monster Hunter Now </em>is currently available for iOS and Android platforms. More information can be read over at the official <a href="https://monsterhunternow.com/news/season3announce">blog</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-returns-have-diminished.978609/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/ps5-pro-price<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For most of the history of console gaming--and we're talking decades here--generations of and updates to machines tended to mean something. Each new batch of consoles offered substantial upgrades over those that came before. When companies began releasing updates mid-generation, those updates--from Sony especially--used to mean price cuts.</p><p>But during the Xbox One and PS4 years of the past decade, console updates became less and less noteworthy. The leaps in visuals weren't as vast, "old gen" games would stick around for longer than they used to and controller innovation became, Nintendo aside, virtually non-existent. The term we used to use with sincerity for new generations of consoles was "next gen". For the past ten years it's been more like "<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=consoles+diminishing+returns&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_en-GBAU1030AU1030&amp;oq=consoles+diminishing+returns&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIHCAEQABiABDIHCAIQABiABDIHCAMQABiABDIHCAQQABiABDIHCAUQABiABDIHCAYQABiABDIHCAcQABiABDIHCAgQABiABDIHCAkQABiABNIBCDI2MzZqMGo3qAIAsAIA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">diminishing returns</a>".</p><p>The PS4 and Xbox One offered only marginal improvements over their predecessors, and the PS5 and Xbox Series X have offered even less. Even the last mid-cycle refresh, the PS4 Pro and Xbox One X,<a href="https://www.lukeplunkett.com/welcome-to-the-last-generation-a-look-back-at-seven-years-of-video-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> proved a limited proposition</a>. But the term "diminishing returns" doesn't just suggest we get less and less with each new offering; it suggests that at some point we'll stop getting anything at all.</p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/ps5-pro-700-dollars-looks-bad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The PS5 Pro announcement sure feels like we're pretty close</a> to that point. In the middle of an inflationary and cost-of-living crisis, when the proposition of expensive AAA gaming has never looked worse, along comes Sony with a console that is...hundreds of dollars more expensive than the machine currently on sale? And offers so little of value to the vast majority of gamers, their human eyes and regular TV sets?</p><figure><figcaption>What are we even doing here</figcaption></figure><p>Like, what is the point here? Surely now, given the market and the climate, would have been the perfect time for a cheaper, more accessible PlayStation. Instead this is a console designed, priced and marketed solely at the kind of person who makes six figures, watches Digital Foundry videos then argues about them on Reddit.</p><p>The PS5 Pro reveal comes less than a year after the PS5 Slim's announcement; the word "slim" used to mean a price cut, a practice pioneered by Sony with the PS2, but that particular console was actually...the same price as the old one. Actually, if you went with the discless edition,<a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-ps5-slim-all-digital-disc-drive-price-1850914803" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> it was <em>more expensive</em></a>.</p><p>Christopher Dring<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-problem-with-ps5-pro-isnt-the-price-tag-opinion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> wrote in GI.biz earlier today</a> that the problem with the PS5 Pro isn't the price itself, and he's right. The problem is the strategy behind it, that this entire console generation hasn't yet got itself up to "full speed", with too many PS4 ports and too many big studios still on the sidelines because it costs so much money and takes so much time to make a PS5 game. Releasing a machine like this, at this time, is a move representative of a company that is caught in the same technical death spiral that<a href="https://aftermath.site/big-budget-game-development-is-not-sustainable" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> led to <em>Spider-Man 2</em> costing twice as much to make as <em>Spider-Man</em></a>.</p><p>There are barely enough games out there making full use of the existing PS5 as it is. There will be even fewer making full use of the PS5 Pro, so the fact Sony saw this console as a need, committed resources to it and are now releasing it to market is <em>wild</em>. But it's also the only place left for companies like this to go! Hyperinflated GPU prices and the death of disc drives have killed off any chance of a cheaper console--<a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-playstation-5-price-rise-raising-hike-increase-sony-1849455516" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the PS5 getting price <em>hikes </em>instead of cuts is testament to that</a>--so the super-consumers are the only market left for Sony to reach. Or, in this case,<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/platforms/ps5/former-blizzard-boss-says-the-dollar700-ps5-pro-is-really-more-like-a-dollar350-upgrade-because-its-aimed-at-people-who-can-trade-in-their-ps5s-at-places-like-gamestop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> reach again</a>.</p><p>I don't think there's been a console and price announcement this disastrous since<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/when-599-was-probably-too-cheap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> PlayStation's notorious $599 PS3 reveal back in 2006</a>. This is a machine totally at odds with the time of its release, and if the concept of diminishing returns implies that consoles (from Sony and Microsoft at least) are on a trajectory, then we're dangerously close to the flatline. If this is what Sony is offering in 2024 I can only dread what the next actual consoles will look like, and what little they'll offer. Or worse, what they'll be priced at.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/11/24242377/valve-steam-improved-family-sharing-out-now<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Valve’s new Steam Families feature is <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F593110%2Fview%2F4605582245626919823">now available for everyone</a> following a beta launch earlier this year. With Steam Families, parents are able to share games with their families, manage parental controls for their kids, and approve requests from their kids to buy Steam games.</p><p>The big improvement with Steam Families over Valve’s previous Family Sharing setup is that multiple people can play games from a shared library at one time. So if I’m playing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24082252/balatro-review-poker-roguelike-videogame"><em>Balatro</em></a>, and my partner, who is part of my Steam Family, wants to play <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24206836/arranger-puzzle-game-review-netflix-summer-game-fest"><em>Arranger</em></a><em>, </em>we can both play those games at the same time. However, if my partner wants to play <em>Balatro</em> while I’m already playing it, she’ll need to buy an additional copy. With Steam Families, you can play shared games offline, too.</p><p>Valve says that Steam Families are “intended to contain your immediate family” and that they can include “up to 6 close family members.” Each member of a Steam Family will have their own save games and earn their own achievements. Adults can leave a Steam Family at any time, but if they do, they’ll have to wait a year before they can start or join a new Family. Children can only be removed by a Steam Family by an adult or with the help of Steam support.</p><p>In <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Db248W74jcFc">a video</a>, Valve says that the old Family Sharing feature will be retired “eventually,” so if you’ve been using that, you might want to set up Steam Families instead.</p><p>You can start using Steam Families by updating Steam. The newest Steam client update has <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/4599952112537386541?utm_source=SteamDB">a handful of other updates</a>, too, including a redesigned screenshots manager.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Both Willits and Hollenshead spent many years at id Software, joining in 1995 and 1996 respectively, which was the heyday of games like Doom 2.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-the-final-preview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I find the word “cozy” to be dreadfully overused when assigning genres to video games these days, but it’s hard to find another adjective that so perfectly captures what I love about Dragon Quest. Straightforward but rewarding turn-based combat paired with a classic hero’s journey told in a picturesque fantasy world result in a wonderfully traditional RPG experience I’ve always found so comforting. So when I was given the choice at a recent preview event to try out Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake on either PlayStation 5 or Nintendo Switch, the choice to settle in on the couch in the Switch’s handheld mode was an easy one.</p><p>And rest assured, Switch owners, Dragon Quest 3 looked and ran great on the aging Nintendo system. Square Enix’s other HD-2D games like Octopath Traveler and Live A Live were perfect for playing in short bursts before bed, and Dragon Quest 3 is looking to fit that mold as well. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Dragon Quest 3 HD 2D Remake Screenshots - Nintendo Direct June 2024</h3></div></output><p>Unlike our first look at Dragon Quest 3’s remake which showed off how faithfully it’s sticking to the roots of the 30-plus-year-old NES RPG, the hour I played Dragon Quest 3 was spent with some of the remake’s brand-new additions. And so far, I’m extremely pleased with the new content that spruces things up without unrecognizably transforming the original experience. </p><p>First, I hung out in the revamped Monster Arena, where you can send monsters you’ve defeated and recruited throughout the game to do battle against other teams of creatures. In the original Dragon Quest 3, you could simply bet on the outcome of fights in the Monster Arena, but this remake lets you get in on the action yourself. Monster collecting has been a big part of both the main Dragon Quest games and the Monsters spinoff series for decades, and it’s great to see that legacy continue here.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>I entered the arena with a preset team of a Slime, Healslime, and Spiked Hare, but this side mode is clearly set up for me to make my own teams with monsters I recruit across the main game. You don’t directly command your team in the Monster Arena tournament, but rather set how they should act in battle from four distinct options: Show No Mercy, Fight Wisely, Focus on Healing, and Don’t Use MP. </p><p>For the first few rounds, I instructed my Healslime to focus on healing its allies while the Slime and Spiked Hare dealt all the damage, but once I realized I had this fight in the bag, I had my whole team go all out. This monster auto battler seems like a fun distraction from the main adventure, and I can see myself swinging by regularly to fine-tune my team and enter them in tournaments. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>While watching my team do battle I found myself mesmerized by the enemy character models. I’ve felt that Dragon Quest and the HD-2D art style were a match made in heaven since this remake’s initial reveal, and seeing it in action confirmed how much I love seeing these classic enemies in Square Enix’s enticing art direction. The killerpillar (an evil caterpillar, if you couldn’t guess) I faced in my first fight had a very detailed idle animation where it bounced back and forth, and the way it wriggled its entire body when gearing up for an attack made the whole turn-based fight feel so much more dynamic. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I’ve felt that Dragon Quest and the HD-2D art style were a match made in heaven since this remake’s initial reveal, and seeing it in action confirmed how much I love seeing these classic enemies in Square Enix’s enticing art direction. </p></div><p>The same can be said of the awesome character models for Robbin' 'Ood and his set of Robbin' 'oodlums, the boss fight I faced at the top of Skyfell Tower. Ascending the tower was a classic, atmospheric dungeon experience filled with random encounters. Here, I was impressed with how flexible Dragon Quest 3’s combat system is. Remember those four preset orders I could assign to my team in the Monster Arena? In Dragon Quest 3’s core combat, those presets are still available to you, with the added option of “Follow Orders”. This means you can rip through the low-stakes random encounters in a dungeon by telling all four of your party members to Show No Mercy, but when a challenging boss fight begins, you can take control of every decision to ensure you emerge victorious. This, combined with the ability to crank up the battle speed whenever you like, adds to that cozy, relaxing game feel I mentioned earlier.

                <p>If you don't have kids, it's quite possible you've never heard of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/gorilla-tag/" data-ref-id="5000-580058">Gorilla Tag</a>, and if you <em>do </em>have kids, there's a good chance Gorilla Tag is all you've been hearing about for a few years now. Originally developed by one person, Kerestell Smith--known to fans by his online handle Lemming--Gorilla Tag is <em>the </em>game of a generation. It hosts a million unique players daily, up to three million monthly active users, and has been played by over 12 million people since it released in 2021. While many older players have sometimes already written off VR, players of a particular age, approximately 7-14, have flocked to a game that is simple in its gameplay loop but sneakily complex in its design.</p><p dir="ltr">As both a writer in this space and the parent of a Gen Alpha kid who's been shimmying through his bedroom as a virtual great ape for a few years now, I was excited to meet Smith and hear the complete Gorilla Tag origin story, learning why and how he believes Gorilla Tag overtook a generation, and what it means for the future of the platform.</p><p dir="ltr">"What's really funny is that I didn't set out to make a game that kids like. I just thought to make a game that <em>I</em> like," Smith told me through a laugh as part of a sit-down conversation in Seattle during PAX West earlier this month. "So I don't know what that says about my sensibilities for, like, what I want to do in VR."</p><p dir="ltr">For the uninitiated, Gorilla Tag is an aptly named game. In it, players inhabit the bodies of gorillas and join a multiplayer world with others where they--you guessed it--play tag. Due to the playground-like nature of the world, however, players have branched out to make their own games, foster urban legends about the world, and use it as an online hangout space where the loose structure lets them join up and chat. Smith even told me his team holds meetings inside the game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4366059-ss_c449098748fc6891d4bc337b0465df4fd9cc9fb3.600x338.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4366059" data-ratio="0.56166666666667" data-width="600" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4366059-ss_c449098748fc6891d4bc337b0465df4fd9cc9fb3.600x338.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4366059"></a><figcaption>Gorilla Tag has become Gen Alpha's preferred virtual hangout in recent years.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4366059-ss_c449098748fc6891d4bc337b0465df4fd9cc9fb3.600x338.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Because of several factors--its novel gameplay intentions, its low-poly (and now heavily memed) art style, its immense popularity despite being trapped in a VR bubble--Gorilla Tag has fascinated me for years, so I asked Smith to give me the game's origin story. What I didn't expect was a nearly 40-minute answer that ate up most of our initially allotted interview time. But his lengthy answer was illuminating, and we were able to stick around long after the scheduled end point so I could get in another dozen or so questions I still wanted to ask.</p><p dir="ltr">"I always just did [VR gaming] kind of as a hobby," Smith told me, explaining that he never really had strong intentions to be a game developer. "I was just super into VR. I was playing all sorts of stuff. And then <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/lone-echo/" data-ref-id="5000-458484">Echo Arena</a> came out, and I remember thinking, 'Oh, I'll check it out, because it's got zero-G.' It seemed more like a sports-style game. And I don't really care about sports-style games, but after I checked it out, it was like a switch was flipped." Smith said his opinion went from "VR is the coolest video-game thing that's come out in who-knows-how-long" to realizing "there's something special about this," and that "it's not just gonna be a video-game thing."</p><p dir="ltr">As he grinded to the top of the Echo Arena competitive leaderboards, Smith discovered that the game's zero-G movement was so much like what he imagined the real thing to feel like that he became obsessed with ideas of virtual worlds that abide by their own internal logic, and do so consistently to the extent that they can immerse you in an experience unlike any other.</p><p dir="ltr">"If you have this really strong connection with your environment, if you push on the world, and the world pushes back, if it's built in a way that feels real, has this subset of rules, internally consistent rules that the game follows, that you can learn and then just be immersed in the space, because you understand it, and then you put other people there, so you feel like you're there, and you feel like other people are there," Smith said. "That kind of connection you can have is second only to what you can form in real life.</p><p dir="ltr">"And that, to me, [is] the key power of the medium. That's the thing that VR can do, that nothing else can do: give you that feeling that you're in the same place as another person. It feels like you're actually with somebody else. And those were the things that I focused on in Gorilla Tag. I tried to just cut out as much as I could and just focus on those things. Because it was like, 'I want to build something and I want to release it, so I need to make it as small as I can,' but what are the important parts? What are the things that can't be left out?"</p><p dir="ltr">This led to the formation of what he calls the Three Axioms for his studio, Another Axiom. Smith explained this conceptual trio as the direct relationship between the player and the environment, building a plausible alternate reality with consistent internal rules that players can understand, and forming a connection to other people in-game. These axioms, Smith suggested, will also help shape the team's next project, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx_4U75G3D8">Orion Drift</a>, which looks to build on Gorilla Tag's social structure with massively expanded multiplayer worlds.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4366060-ss_9bb0c13a216ed014c7a999c68694fd4e0e03c25b.600x338.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4366060" data-ratio="0.56166666666667" data-width="600" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4366060-ss_9bb0c13a216ed014c7a999c68694fd4e0e03c25b.600x338.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4366060"></a><figcaption>Where older players tend to see VR as a hassle, many younger players have adopted it as must-have tech.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4366060-ss_9bb0c13a216ed014c7a999c68694fd4e0e03c25b.600x338.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"I had been playing a lot of these different VR experiences and doing all these things, and I didn't feel like I was seeing the kinds of things that hit on the aspects of the VR experiences that I was really connecting with. It was this sense of, 'I don't think the industry is moving forward as fast as I hoped it would have,' but I saw these different developers doing these different pieces. Like, all these different experiences that are awesome in all these different ways, but they weren't being pulled together and focused on. So I had this sense of, 'Okay, well, if I think I'm so smart, I'm not just gonna post on internet forums and complain and be annoying or whatever. I have to put my money where my mouth is and try and make something.'"</p><p dir="ltr">Smith said he set out to make what would become Gorilla Tag "because I cared really deeply about VR and the medium, and my hope was, maybe if I make something really cool, then a real developer might try it out and be like, 'Oh, there's some cool ideas here.'"</p><p dir="ltr">Smith's thoughts on his design intentions for Gorilla Tag were incredibly detailed, to an extent I found intriguing given how all of his purposeful planning surrounding the game's locomotion mechanic, its refusal to embed the game in immersion-breaking menus, how he determined it would work best if avatars had no legs, and more are all ultimately experienced by a young playerbase generally lacking the vocabulary to express any of it, but they likely feel it as they play, and that's why it works.</p><p dir="ltr">"Gorilla Tag, I can say very confidently, doesn't have [avatar] legs, specifically because of my experience playing Raccoon Lagoon," Smith told me. "It was a resource-gathering game, so you have the problem of, 'Okay, I chopped down the tree, and I want to collect the logs, and the logs are on the ground, so I have to bend over to pick up the logs,' and it's kind of a pain in the butt to constantly have to do that. So [developer Hidden Path] just put you at torso height, so you chop a tree down, and you can just reach your arm out and pick it up.</p><p dir="ltr">"And I played it, and I noticed it didn't feel weird that I was at torso height on the ground, and the ground was right there. It felt totally fine. So it got me thinking about how we have these preconceived notions of [how] a VR game should map to your body, but because you don't have your legs as a controller, removing that actually makes it easier to interact with that virtual world." This led to Gorilla tag's arm-based mechanic where you pull yourself through the world similar to how a real gorilla moves. For those who have never seen it, it's kind of like walking on stilts, only the skill ceiling is incredibly high, which Smith discovered months after the initial concept was pieced together, at a time when he'd added a multiplayer component that wasn't initially there.</p><p dir="ltr">"I had this idea for tag, and I just threw it in there. And then all of a sudden, when you could see other people, and when you're <em>it </em>and you're chasing somebody, and your feeling is just, 'I gotta get that guy,' that's such a primal thing, right? Tag is something that all mammals play, and it felt it was the exact same feeling. I have to move quickly to catch that person. If someone's chasing you, you get kind of worried, so you end up moving a little bit more erratically, so you end up not being as fast, you're easier to catch. Like, all these different aspects just kind of came together."</p><p dir="ltr">This, Smith feels, points to the axiom of internal logic that, if made consistent, can allow players to adapt quickly. A VR world doesn't have to be like real life. It doesn't even have to look like real life, Smith said, recalling the platform's early obsession with high-fidelity visuals. Targeting the original and underpowered Oculus Quest headset, Smith knew he would need to work within his limitations for Gorilla Tag, and he told me he was inspired by a YouTube channel called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@AlphaBetaGamer">Alpha Beta Gamer</a> that's dedicated to playing under-the-radar indie games, many of which featured PS1-style visuals.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4366061-ss_efe8aa03e6b9f7c968e762952baac623243c7ab8.600x338.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4366061" data-ratio="0.56166666666667" data-width="600" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4366061-ss_efe8aa03e6b9f7c968e762952baac623243c7ab8.600x338.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4366061"></a><figcaption>Smith told GameSpot that launching Gorilla Tag without monetization nearly tanked his financials early on because it was so popular and yet free to play.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4366061-ss_efe8aa03e6b9f7c968e762952baac623243c7ab8.600x338.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"I wanted to make everything for this game myself [and] that was an art style that was kind of accessible [to me], but it's almost easier to buy into the world when it has this clear visual style that is not meant to look like real life," Smith said. "It's easier to buy into this other world that looks totally different and has this completely different feel to it, but you can still invest yourself in it because your brain doesn't have this [feeling of], 'Oh, sorry, this is too pixely to be real.'"</p><p dir="ltr">It was clear, when Smith finally took a breath, that he firmly believes in VR, not just as a current tech toy or a development tool for his sudden change of career, but as a platform with a foundation already sturdy enough today that he no longer worries about its future prospects.</p><p dir="ltr">"There's so much work that's been done to really flesh out what is valuable about the medium," he said, "and now there's this path forward to say, 'Okay, let's build on what's been made before.' It's not just, 'Let's just keep trying new things and see what works.' There's enough of a body of work there that there's really stuff to build on now.</p><p dir="ltr">"Video games are kind of hitting a renaissance right now, in some ways. You're seeing all these new ideas come out. The tools are powerful enough that indie game developers can make these things that become mega, super hits out of nowhere. You know, Vampire Survivors, Palworld, all these things that are enabled by building off of what came before [...] And I'm excited because, I think for VR, we don't have to imagine anymore. You can see what's happening with the industry, and you can see what things are building towards and what people are connecting with."</p><p dir="ltr">With years of success behind him and his team's next game coming soon, Smith acknowledges a VR bubble but feels it's only a matter of time until it pops. "The way I think about it is, you know when we were really young and our parents were telling us, 'I don't get why you kids are playing these games,' right? And we're like, 'You just don't understand.' It was kind of generational, right? It's not because they wouldn't be able to have fun playing games, but they just didn't even think of themselves as people who <em>would </em>play these games.</p><p dir="ltr">"And then, as we've gotten older, everybody in our generation plays video games, right? Video games are for everybody. It's bigger than music, and movies, and TV, and all these things. Our parents didn't understand that exactly, but it wasn't that people of a certain age couldn't get it. It was just people who didn't grow up with it, who didn't understand it, who were maybe not quite as open to these new experiences. And I think it's a similar thing with VR. I think that the kids who are playing VR now are going to be playing it their entire lives." Anecdotally, I told Smith I agreed. Kids in my son's school play VR games much more often than people my age do. Most of the people I know in the games media industry don't regularly play VR games, but it seems like younger generations are much more enthusiastic about it. As headsets get less bulky and more powerful--and these kids eventually have expendable income--it does seem like there is still a future for this tech that many wrote off years ago.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4366062-ss_8f004c8e4332c7c041c5089ed2f962079c28405c.600x338.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4366062" data-ratio="0.56166666666667" data-width="600" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4366062-ss_8f004c8e4332c7c041c5089ed2f962079c28405c.600x338.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4366062"></a><figcaption>A Gorilla Tag plush recently broke sales records on Makeship, surpassing its funding goal by nearly 27,000%.

One is because of that aforementioned foundation that he feels VR now benefits from; it's found its footing, and from there, it can only improve. The second, which he returned to more often and fervently than any other in my 70-minute chat with him, is VR's unique social dynamics.</p><p dir="ltr">"I really, truly believe in that social aspect," he said. "That ability to create communities and spaces that is becoming more and more difficult these days. It seems like it's really tough to raise kids, especially right now, compared to when we were younger. It's harder for kids to just ride their bike to their friends' houses, right? There are fewer spaces where it's okay for teenagers to hang out together outside.</p><p dir="ltr">"But VR allows people to create these communities and spaces that they can just exist in and just hang out together. One of the things that I want people to feel about the games that we make is not like, 'Gorilla Tag is really fun.' It's the feeling of being in that world with other people. It's the same way that you can picture what it's like to just hang out with your friends, or go and spend time at their house, or go visit the beach and just, you know, soak up the waves."</p><p dir="ltr">A VR game, if done well, is not just an activity, Smith believes. In a manner unique to the platform, it can deliver on a feeling of "community," he said, "and that is really powerful [...] so powerful that I don't see a way for VR to fail at this point."</p>
