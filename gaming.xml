            <p>Nintendo is keeping tight-lipped on what studio is developing Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership.</p>
<p>When asked by journalist <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/nintendo-direct-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-metroid">Stephen Totilo</a> who was leading the development of the resurrected action RPG series, Nintendo wouldn't confirm who was involved, even though the original studio behind the series, AlphaDream, closed down in 2019.</p>
<p>It did, however, concede that "some of the original developers" were involved.</p>

<p>"Some of the original developers who worked on the franchise are involved in the development of Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership," Nintendo told Totilo (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-wont-reveal-mario-luigis-new-developer-but-says-original-staff-are-invovled/">VGC</a>). "For more information about the developers, please stay tuned to the game credits at release."</p>
<p>Who those "original developers" are remains unclear, although plenty of former AlphaDream devs joined Nintendo-adjacent teams when the studio shuttered.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-luigi-brothership-bringing-the-action-rpg-series-to-switch-this-year">Nintendo unveiled Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</a> last week, and confirmed it's heading to Switch on 7th November this year.</p>
<p>Brothership marks the Switch debut of Nintendo's long-running action-RPG series, and the first brand-new entry since Mario &amp; Luigi: Paper Jam appeared on 3DS in 2015. The reveal didn't offer much in the way of specifics, but the game is described as a "sea-faring adventure that unfolds across mysterious islands", and there's promise of "evolved moves" for the Mario brothers when it arrives.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24183692/hidetaka-miyazaki-interview-shadow-of-the-erdtree-difficulty<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><div><p>As I <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24180536/shadow-of-the-erdtree-review-elden-ring-dlc">work my way through <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a>, the new DLC for <em>Elden Ring</em>, I can’t help but think that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18272238/hsekiro-shadows-die-twice-idetaka-miyazaki-interview-dark-souls">game director Hidetaka Miyazaki</a> is trolling the shit outta me.</p></div><p>Speaking with him<em> </em>at Summer Game Fest two weeks ago<em>,</em> Miyazaki said that <em>Erdtree</em> is “by far the biggest in scale in volume” than any other FromSoftware DLC before it. But he also said <em>Erdtree </em>is “about the same volume as the Limgrave part of the base game,” the starting area of <em>Elden Ring</em>, containing “slightly more content.”&nbsp;</p><p>I don’t buy it. While it’s impossible to accurately compare scale in game, I’ve played the game for 30 hours and have already found the new areas in the DLC to be more expansive than Limgrave. Not only is the map itself large, it’s layered, with huge areas propped up on plateaus above, in deep valleys below, and on islands that take some creative platforming to reach.</p><p>I’d say it’s far, <em>far</em> larger than Limgrave, with plenty more to do as well. <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> honestly feels like it’s big enough to be its own game with its own story — one that was originally intended for <em>Elden Ring</em> but wound up being cut for time before being added back as DLC content.</p><p><em>Erdtree</em> follows the story arc of Miquella, brother of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/11/23066977/elden-ring-let-me-solo-her-defeats-1000th-malenia">uber boss Malenia</a> and one of the demigods important to <em>Elden Ring </em>lore. To focus on Miquella was, Miyazaki told me, born of the desire to honor George R. R. Martin’s contributions to the game. “[He] gave us all this great mythology to work with,” Miyazaki said. Packaging Miquella’s story as a standalone DLC was essentially “closing the loop” on Martin’s involvement in the game. “It’s really about completing <em>Elden Ring</em>’s circle,” he said.</p><p>But understating the size of <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> is just one of the ways it feels like Miyazaki is misleading me. I know he’s trolling me when it comes to difficulty.</p><p>I cannot beat <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24182436/rellana-location-weakness-strategy-how-to-beat-sote-dlc">Rellana, Twin Moon Knight</a>, the boss ensconced in Castle Enis that players can face five or 50 hours in depending on their exploration choices. (I met her after about 15.) None of my strategies nor any of the game’s built in assistance features — using Mimic Tear Ashes, summoning help from an NPC, changing my weapons or spells, inflicting damaging status effects — seem to work. My best attempt got her down to half of her health and I cannot seem to progress further. And she’s only major boss number two.</p><p>According to Miyazaki, this is by design. He said that <em>Erdtree</em> contains “10 plus boss encounters” — honestly, another hilariously absurd understatement, I’ve seen estimates of <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-bosses/">55 bosses</a> and up to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-boss-order">80</a>. Thankfully only a small handful of those bosses are necessary to progress the story, while the rest are optional.</p><p>“And the ones that [are optional] are especially difficult,” Miyazaki said.</p><p>Whenever a new FromSoftware game releases, there’s nearly always a discussion of difficulty. With the DLC, other reviewers have suggested that its difficulty is too extreme. “It’s true that this distinct type of FromSoft-engineered frustration is an indispensable part of the <em>Souls</em> experience,” <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review">wrote Alexis Ong in <em>Eurogamer</em></a><em>.</em> “This, however, feels like difficulty for difficulty’s sake, turned up to eleven.”</p><p>I agree. But while I think <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> could better straddle the line between pleasantly challenging and frustratingly impossible, the game was tuned to Miyazaki’s intentions, representing the lessons the development team learned from the original game’s feedback.</p><p>“Traditionally we’ve always liked the higher difficulty curve type of games and experiences, but I think that nature in and of itself alienates a good portion of the game playing audience,” he said.&nbsp;</p><p>A contradictory thing to say considering <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/article/2024/jun/21/hidetaka-miyazaki-fromsoftware-elden-ring-shadow-erdtree">his comments in a recent interview with <em>The Guardian</em></a>: “If we really wanted the whole world to play the game, we could just crank the difficulty down more and more, but that wasn’t the right approach. Turning down difficulty would strip the game of that joy, which, in my eyes, would break the game itself.”</p><p>He’s not wrong. <em>Elden Ring</em> ceases to be the game of the year it was if it lacks the kind of difficulty FromSoftware is known for. So <em>Erdtree</em> must be hard, but not so hard that it’ll turn players off. But it also can’t be too easy because that will break the game. What to do? The answer, according to Miyazaki, is freedom.</p><p>“The amount of freedom that we give players helps offset that difficulty curve and makes the game more accessible and engaging,” he told me.</p><p>I think that worked for <em>Elden Ring</em>, less so for this DLC. In the base game, difficulty could be circumvented with leveling up — the player freedom, as it were. But with the addition of the new DLC-exclusive consumables that increase your attack and defense, becoming more powerful is now dependent on your ability to find those scarce items. As a result, I’ve often found myself fearful of the simplest enemies as encountering more than one at a time will kill me outright.&nbsp;</p><div><p>“I try to imagine different ways I would want to die as a player or be killed.”</p></div><p>In addition to ensuring that players die a lot,<em> </em>Miyazaki also said that <em>how</em> players die is just as important.</p><p>“I try to imagine different ways I would want to die as a player or be killed,” he said, explaining that those thoughts manifested in <em>Elden Ring</em> and in other FromSoftware games <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/elden-ring-has-multiple-poison-swamps-because-i-cant-help-myself-miyazaki-says/">as his signature poison swamps</a>. But for <em>Erdtree</em>, he confessed to cutting back on that indulgence — “In the original <em>Elden Ring</em>, I went a little too far.”</p><p>There are still poison swamps in <em>Erdtree</em>, “but in other parts of gameplay, there are still many ways to die.”</p><div><figcaption>One of Hidetaka Miyazaki’s signature poison swamps in Shadow of the Erdtree.</figcaption> <p><cite>Image: FromSoftware / Ash Parrish</cite></p></div><p>Too many it seems. I’ve been bludgeoned, exsanguinated, frostbitten, and burned. I’ve fallen off cliffs, had cliffs fall on me — beware the fiery rocks the Furnace Golems spew — and I’ve even accidentally killed myself eating an item that refilled my HP while also inflicting poison.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite my tribulations, Miyazaki, like a benevolent god, has faith in me and his players, only giving us trials he believes we can bear.</p><p>“We’ve really pushed the envelope in terms of what we think can be withstood by the player,” Miyazaki said.&nbsp;</p><p>He clarified that one of the biggest lessons brought forward from <em>Elden Ring</em> into <em>Erdtree</em> was what the audience found fun over what was stressful. “ We tried to make that the foundation of the boss encounters of the DLC, so hopefully players will find it much more engaging and fun,” he said.</p><p>“But if that is not the case,” he added. “Then I’m sorry.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Former Arkane Austin studio head, Harvey Smith, says hearing fan feedback after playing the "cleaned up, final version" of Redfall has given him "a burst of energy".</p>
<p>After reflecting on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/redfalls-final-patch-is-here-marking-the-end-of-an-era-for-arkane-austin">Game Update 4</a> – which introduced offline mode, "ReVamped" neighbourhood and nest systems, and the ability to pause amongst other things – Smith also teased that he was "looking forward to talking about" his plans post-Arkane Austin's sad closure.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24183338/elden-ring-dlc-shadow-erdtree-birds-loud-jumpscare<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="21pdmf"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough"><em>Elden Ring</em></a> players are being jumpscared in the recently released <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24180113/dlc-walkthroughs-guides"><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a> expansion, but not by a terrifying new enemy or deadly environmental trap. No, the source of this fear is a simple, screeching bird.</p>
<p id="R5yKpM">A sparse forest located southeast of the expansion’s initial <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24182490/site-of-grace-locations-all-where-to-find-sote-dlc">site of grace</a> checkpoint on the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/c/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24182329/interactive-map-dlc-sote-shadow-realm">Gravesite Plain</a> is one of the earliest landmarks you see (and can reach) in <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>. It’s there you’ll find a few of the expansion’s new crafting materials, a difficult human foe named Logur, the Beast Claw who drops <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24180256/all-new-dlc-weapon-locations">his eponymous weapon</a> upon defeat, and a variety of ruined stone structures just begging to be investigated.</p>
<p id="lTSEVO">Some of these landmarks are home to eagle-like birds who don’t take kindly to a player’s approach. And while they don’t attack, they do make an awful shriek when disturbed that’s apparently catching some people off guard. Messages dot the ground around these areas, cautioning fellow Tarnished to “listen carefully ahead” and “be wary of sound.” The ghostly emotes attached to the warnings depict brave-looking adventurers assuming the fetal position and raising their hands to the sky in defensive terror.</p>

<p id="ZTifxj">Similar stories have been shared on real-world social media.</p>
<p id="KX6wKE">“The jumpscare noise birds in this <em>Elden Ring</em> DLC might be the most insane thing they’ve ever done,” <a href="https://twitter.com/cosgrove300/status/1804116432541622272">said one player</a> on X (formerly Twitter). “It’s not even an enemy you fight, they’re just part of the local fauna.”</p>
<p id="K2Q0yb">“Dude, the bird sounds are literally making me crap my pants,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1dl445c/the_birds/">another Redditor said</a>.</p>
<p id="0Ph7vg">“Damn jump scares!” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1dl3vmu/damn_jump_scares/">said a third</a>. “Got me twice within 20 minutes of starting the DLC. Need to get an <em>Elden Ring</em>-brand defibrillator.”</p>
<p id="wQyzeL">Soulsborne vets may remember developer FromSoftware pulling the same trick in <em>Dark Souls 3</em>’s Irithyll Dungeon, where picking up certain items would elicit <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGWM_ngpY1w">a loud, horrifying scream</a> from an unseen creature. The birds aren’t quite as bad, but there’s an argument to be made that their tranquil surroundings make for a more effective scare.</p>
<p id="Nz0f8L">It’s far too early for me to have an educated opinion on <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>, but if anything, it’s nice to see FromSoftware continue to mercilessly mess with players. </p>

  <p id="rojhAZ"><strong>Hornsent </strong>is an NPC you’ll meet at the Three-Path Cross <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24182490/site-of-grace-locations-all-where-to-find-sote-dlc">Site of Grace</a> early on in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough"><em>Elden Ring</em></a>’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24180113/dlc-walkthroughs-guides"><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a><em> </em>DLC.</p>
<p id="Y5hlIX">He’s got a couple maps to give you, but his questline gets a lot more intricate once you reach the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24180868/shadow-keep-walkthrough-dlc-sote">Shadow Keep</a>.</p>
<p id="3OGZw5">Hornsent is also not to be confused with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24183155/hornsent-grandam-questline-steps-sote-dlc">Hornsent Grandam</a>, who is another NPC you’ll find locked away in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24179181/belurat-tower-settlement-walkthrough-sote-dlc">Belurat</a>.</p>
<p id="3dIGrn">Our <em>Elden Ring</em> DLC guide will walk you through <strong>where to find Hornsent</strong>, and all the steps you’ll need to take to complete his questline, including the <strong>Hornsent or Leda</strong> choice.</p>

<h2 id="rMyjkp"><strong>Hornsent locations</strong></h2>


<p id="YVj8kz">You’ll meet Hornsent for the first time not too far into the Gravesite Plain. He’ll be hanging out with Redmane Freyja at the Three-Path Cross Site of Grace.</p>

He’s hanging out with Needle Knight Leda there. Their questlines interweave for a bit until Hornsent gets involved in your journey into Shadow Keep.</p>
<p id="0bxcpP">The final location is an invasion outside of the Church of the Bud in the Rauh Ruins region.</p>

<ul>
<li id="vEyTQG">
<strong>If you choose Leda,</strong> you’ll (try to) kill Hornsent and, unsurprisingly, end his quest then and there. You’ll still get his drops, though, so it’s an option.</li>
<li id="hjjgJZ">
<strong>If you choose Hornsent</strong>, you’ll be summoned to another world and have to fight a spectral version of Leda (she doesn’t actually die here).

            <p>The Witcher developer CD Projekt Red – which long held the record for the best-reviewed RPG expansion for Blood and Wine – has congratulated FromSoftware for its "stellar work".</p>
<p>Acknowledging that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> DLC Shadow of the Erdtree has stolen the accolade after eight years of riding high, The Witcher team said that whilst it had "the honour of being the best-reviewed expansion for a role-playing gaming", "Elden Ring gets to wear that crown now".</p>

<p>In other news, FromSoftware's Soulsborne games are notoriously difficult to beat, but creator Hidetaka Miyazaki recently said it would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/turning-down-elden-rings-difficulty-would-break-the-game-itself-says-miyazaki">"break the game itself"</a> to turn down the challenge.</p>
<p>"If we really wanted the whole world to play the game, we could just crank the difficulty down more and more. But that wasn't the right approach," he said. "Had we taken that approach, I don't think the game would have done what it did, because the sense of achievement that players gain from overcoming these hurdles is such a fundamental part of the experience. Turning down difficulty would strip the game of that joy - which, in my eyes, would break the game itself."</p>
<p>"I am still impossibly fond of Elden Ring and my time spent in its grasp, but I'm just not sure if I can share the same fullness of warmth with Shadow of the Erdtree," contributor Alexis wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review">Eurogamer's Elden Ring DLC Shadow of the Erdtree review</a>.</p>
<p>"Despite its strange dispersion of 'active' areas, and uncharacteristically infantilising hand-holding for encounters that should be learned through repeated failure, Shadow still has its share of Elden Ring's brilliance – weird little dudes and obscure secrets and goofy cheesing and all. But perhaps trying to combine the inherent focus of a largely self-contained DLC, with the narrative flexibility and open-world freedom of Elden Ring – the concept that set it apart from its Souls brethren – was always going to make for an incongruous match."</p>

  <p id="5QR2GT">It’s officially summer, and boy is it <em>hot</em>. Some might call it sweltering, even. It’s enough to make you want to plunge into a swimming pool or, barring that, stay home on the couch and crank the air conditioning up before settling into a good movie. There’s plenty of great movies this weekend that you should watch before they leave streaming at the end of June, and we’ve pulled together a list of our favorites.</p>
<p id="HYUODM">We’ve got a underappreciated cult classic by <em>The Exorcist</em> director William Friedkin, a brilliant noir drama starring Denzel Washington, arguably <em>the</em> best Die Hard sequel, and more.</p>
<p id="vn3lPN">Here are the movies new to streaming services you should watch this month.</p>

<p id="kkhSNj"><strong>Director:</strong> William Friedkin<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Roy Scheider, Bruno Cremer, Francisco Rabal<br><strong>Leaving Criterion Channel: </strong>June 30</p>
<p id="qv6S3f">There was <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23823309/william-friedkin-death-french-connection">no one else quite like William Friedkin</a>. The proudly Chicago-born and notoriously foul-mouthed director of <em>The Exorcist</em> and <em>The French Connection</em> was a master of his craft, capable of conjuring breathtaking performances and bone-chilling scares in equal measure. Though not a horror movie per se, his underrated 1977 remake of Henri-Georges Clouzot’s 1953 thriller <em>The Wages of Fear</em> is a striking depiction of human fear at its most raw and  elemental.</p>
<p id="gLf5Cp">Set in a remote village in South America, <em>Sorcerer</em> follows four men: a disgraced French banker, a Palestinian militant, a Mexican hitman, and an Irish mobster. All of them are exiled from their respective homes, on the run and quickly running out of time. Their chance at earning their passage back to civilization comes in the form of a deadly job in which they are tasked with transporting loads of unstable dynamite through a harsh jungle to stop an oil rig explosion. </p>
<p id="EOX8Mi"><em>Sorcerer</em> is not a pleasant film. The humidity of the rainforest and the rising tensions of the men radiate off the screen, as does the pain of their precarious attempts to avoid fatal injury. How far would you go to reclaim everything you’ve ever loved? Friedkin opened a portal into the dark, roiling heart of human desperation in a way that few other directors of his caliber could, and that even fewer directors after him have accomplished since. <em>—Toussaint Egan</em></p>

<p id="RthgGf"><strong>Director: </strong>Carl Franklin<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Denzel Washington, Tom Sizemore, Jennifer Beals<br><strong>Leaving Netflix: </strong>June 30</p>
<p id="v3CGhM">This scintillating neo-noir captures Denzel Washington as he was ascending the mountain of movie stardom, all in a brilliant story of postwar racial tensions in Los Angeles, featuring some of the best cinematography of the 1990s.</p>
<p id="ugPlVB">Denzel is Easy Rawlins, a vet in between jobs just looking to make enough money to keep paying his mortgage. When he’s recruited by a seedy PI for what seems to be a simple job, Easy gets pulled into a tangled web of lies and deception that proves to be very difficult to break out of. With incredible supporting performances by Don Cheadle, Tom Sizemore, and Jennifer Beals, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24086727/devil-in-a-blue-dress-movie-denzel-washington-netflix-thriller-sexy"><em>Devil in a Blue Dress</em></a><em> </em>is a gem of a mystery thriller that does the excellent original novel justice. —<em>Pete Volk</em></p>

<p id="kZqEg0"><strong>Director:</strong> Mike Nichols<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Jack Nicholson, Candice Bergen, Arthur Garfunkel<br><strong>Leaving Prime: </strong>June 30</p>
<p id="dH1DWe">Fans of 1970s cinema, Richard Linklater’s Before<em> </em>trilogy, and the recent comedy <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23852654/bottoms-emma-seligman-queer-high-school-sex-comedy-review"><em>Bottoms</em></a> will all find pleasure in Mike Nichols’ frank rumination on sex, which was controversial enough at the time to <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/1973/73-557">demand a Supreme Court ruling</a>. <em>Carnal Knowledge</em> picks up with two college seniors: Jonathan (Jack Nicholson), who’s stuck in a DTF vortex, and his best pal, Sandy (Art Garfunkel, of Simon &amp; Garfunkel fame), currently flailing over his inability to connect with women on a physical level. Depicting milestone moments in the two’s boys-to-men postgrad life, the script by Village Voice cartoonist Jules Feiffer pairs bursts of intimacy with squirm-worthy introspection on male failure. Nichols traps the pair in rooms with the likes of Candice Bergen, Ann-Margret, and Rita Moreno for barbed sex talk that technically puts <em>Carnal Knowledge</em> in the comedy category, but no one gets away unscathed. <em>—Matt Patches</em></p>

<p id="F90Iot"><strong>Director:</strong> Oz Perkins<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Emma Roberts, Kiernan Shipka, Lucy Boynton<br><strong>Leaving Max: </strong>June 30</p>
<p id="zypSAs">If you’re as excited for Oz Perkins’ new horror movie <em>Longlegs </em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/24055798/longlegs-horror-movie-trailer-teaser-release">as we are</a>, then it’s probably about time you start your homework for it. Sure, you should probably watch <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24168219/longlegs-director-preview-nicolas-cage-serial-killer-movie"><em>Seven</em>, <em>Zodiac</em>, and <em>The Silence of the Lambs</em></a> ahead of the new Nicolas Cage-led serial killer movie, but one film that might slip through the cracks is Perkins’ directorial debut, <em>The Blackcoat’s Daughter</em>. </p>
<p id="B0b7eN"><em>The Blackcoat’s Daughter</em> takes place largely at a prestigious boarding school while it’s closed over winter break. Two girls, Rose (Lucy Boynton) and Kat (Kiernan Shipka), are stuck there during vacation and each dealing with their own problems. Rose thinks she might be pregnant, and Kat is having visions of her parents dying horribly and suffers from bizarre hallucinations. Meanwhile, a second storyline in the movie follows Joan (Emma Roberts), a young woman who has escaped from a mental institution and is picked up by a kind old man (James Remar). </p>
<p id="7VqQWs">The empty boarding school is a criminally underused setting for modern horror, and Perkins makes the most of it here. The still hallways, vast, isolating forests, and dense snow give the entire movie a terrific caged-in atmosphere that only makes Rose’s and Kat’s plotlines creepier and heightens the mystery of Joan’s. Shipka, Boynton, and Roberts are all fantastic in their roles, particularly as the movie reaches its over-the-top and terrifyingly bleak conclusion. </p>
<p id="IZfVcq"><em>The Blackcoat’s Daughter</em> is a remarkable debut for one of the most interesting horror filmmakers around right now, and it’s even better knowing <em>Longlegs </em>is right around the corner. <em>—Austen Goslin</em></p>

<p id="SQsXES"><strong>Director: </strong>John McTiernan<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Bruce Willis, Jeremy Irons, Samuel L. Jackson<br><strong>Leaving Hulu: </strong>June 30</p>
<p id="u51RU5">After skipping the first sequel, John McTiernan returned to one-up <em>Die Hard</em> with a movie that asks: What if Nakatomi Plaza, but all of Manhattan? Folks, he nailed it. Despite not sparking annual debate over its Christmas-movie-canon worthiness, <em>Die Hard with a Vengeance</em> goes hard, smashing Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson together for a high-speed investigation across New York (with minimal exposition — McTiernan knows how to get to the good stuff). The game of cat and mouse finds Jeremy Irons mostly cackling over the phone in his over-the-top German-accented Simon Gruber and Willis and Jackson sweating as they complete puzzles worthy of the Riddler. McTiernan risked going too big for a small-scale hungover hero like John McClane, but the director hand-waves away any concerns through set-pieces; <em>Vengeance</em> features one of the most astounding car chases of all time, set in Central Park, and we simply do not talk about it enough. <em>—MP</em></p>

<p id="u67JVz">Fortnite<em> </em>Reload launches today, <strong>Saturday, June 22</strong>, at the same time around the world, rolling out following the first <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/12/24176228/metallica-fortnite-concert">Metallica concert</a> at 2 p.m. EDT.</p>
<p id="tQzFQ6">This means the Fortnite Reload release time in your time zone is:</p>
<ul>
<li id="hRirtL">
<strong>11 a.m. PDT</strong> for the west coast of North America</li>
<li id="Prdg5A">
<strong>2 p.m. EDT</strong> for the east coast of North America</li>
<li id="ifpyl6">
<strong>7 p.m. BST</strong> for the U.K.</li>
<li id="BZSPRs">
<strong>8 p.m. CEST</strong> for western Europe/Paris</li>
<li id="TI0AFn">
<strong>3 a.m. JST</strong> on Japan/Tokyo (on Sunday, June 23)</li>
</ul>
<p id="Qu64cZ">Something to note is developer Epic Games said it will launch “shortly after” the above times — so be patient if it doesn’t appear right away. If you prefer to keep busy while you wait, perhaps tuning into the aforementioned concert is a good way to pass the time.</p>
<hr id="Vt4bPg">
<h2 id="HwO1KL"><strong>What is Fortnite Reload?</strong></h2>
<p id="2Z0gDJ">Fortnite Reload is a new mode featuring a smaller map composed of locations from the game’s earliest chapters — including Tilted Towers, Retail Row, and Pleasant Park, and several other yet-to-be-confirmed locations.</p>

<p id="yyWTqQ">The reduced landmass comes with a lower player count — 40 players in each lobby — with each player automatically respawning until there’s just one team left standing. The time it takes to respawn starts at 30 seconds, and can be sped up if your teammates manage to eliminate other players.</p>
<p id="jNnaBY">Fortnite Reload offers both Battle Royale and Zero Build options, but note that it’s Squads only. That said, you will have the option to not fill your party if you prefer to take on groups of players with less than a party of four. (Best of luck to all the solo players out there!)</p>

<p id="IOUrSW">While Fortnite Reboot is focused on locations and loot from the first few seasons, Victory Crowns — a feature introduced in Chapter 3 — will be rewarded to winning players from their previous match. There will also be a number of introductory quests rewarding 20,000 XP each, and a Victory Royale Glider (the Rezzbrella) up for grabs if you become victorious.</p>

		<p>After many months of rumours, a <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/beyond-good-evil">Beyond Good &amp; Evil</a> remaster has been officially announced by <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/ubisoft">Ubisoft</a>. Not only that, the game will be launching next week – on June 25th – for “all platforms”. This will include PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/red-faction-guerrilla-sequel-reportedly-canceled-by-embracer/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new report published <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-embracers-cuts-killed-a-potential-red-faction-sequel-and-gutted-a-promising-studio" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by Rock, Paper, Shotgun</a> reveals that the Embracer Group recently canceled a sequel to 2009's third-person shooter game Red Faction: Guerrilla.</p>
<p>The game was not in development at Volition, the original creator of Red Faction, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/volition-games-the-studio-behind-saints-row-red-faction-has-been-shut-down-by-embracer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was shut down last year</a> following the disappointing sales of the Saints Row reboot. It was instead being made by Fishlabs, the Hamburg-based developer behind 2021's space combat game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/chorus-review-silent-cry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chorus</a>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, before the Red Faction pitch, Fishlabs also pitched a new Lord of the Rings game to fellow Embracer Group colleagues at Middle-earth Enterprises. However, they never really got a proper response, so the studio moved to the next pitch: a new Red Faction game that would have followed the events of Guerrilla around a hundred years later, featuring a more terraformed and colorful Mars. A female protagonist would have been leading the underground workers' revolution. An internal source told RPS:</p>
<p><em>We were trying to look at what did Guerrilla do right, what did Armageddon do wrong, and how can we marry the two and continue on with it.</em></p>
<p>While the original goal was to focus on what worked with Guerrilla (chiefly the excellent destruction enabled by the GeoMod engine), the team also had hoped to implement some immersive sim elements, vehicle customization, and even dynamic dialogues.</p>
<p>Plaion's initial reaction to the pitch was positive, but in late November, an internal vote from the publishing label decided that the Red Faction project would be canceled. Fishlabs was also forced to lay off around 50 employees as a result. According to the report, the German studio now essentially lives on as a support team, helping other Embracer Group studios develop their games. It is unclear whether Fishlabs will ever get another shot at making their own game, and if so, when.</p>
<p>If this article made you itch to play Red Faction: Guerrilla again, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/red-faction-guerrilla-june-15th/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Re-Mars-tered</a> version is available for $20 on PC and consoles.</p>

		<p>A new update for the <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/star-wars-battlefront-classic-collection">Star Wars Battlefront Classic Collection</a> is now available across all platforms, developer <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/aspyr">Aspyr</a> has announced. The remastered collection, which launched back in March, bundles together the first two original <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/star-wars-battlefront">Star Wars Battlefront</a> titles.</p>
<p><iframe title="Star Wars: Battlefront Classic Collection - Announce Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1Zko_8h8qzc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Ready to download on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PC, and Nintendo Switch, there are more fixes than you could wave a double-ended lightsaber at, targeting everything from server issues and crashes to map-specific glitches.</p>
<p>Despite some technical problems, we were pretty positive about the game in our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/29/star-wars-battlefront-classics-collection-remastered-review/">Star Wars Battlefront Classic Collection</a> review, scoring it a 7/10 say that: “at the end of the day that’s the chief purpose of these remasters: to offer fans a way to play these older Star Wars Battlefront titles on current consoles, with slightly spruced up visuals, and the option to play online. They’re still inherently rough around the edges and play a little clunky, but the Classics Collection does what it says on the tin, giving these beloved games a quick dip in the Bacta tank instead of attempting to forge them anew.”</p>
<p>You can review all the latest changes via the official patch notes below.</p>

<p>We’ve now had XDefiant firmly in our hands for one month, but how is Ubisoft’s free-to-play first-person shooter doing on the open market? Following several delays that pushed the game’s launch date back by several months, Ubisoft finally pushed the product live and shooter fans worldwide poured onto the platform, but with some teething issues hampering initial reviews, many were put off.</p>



<p>In an effort to continually optimise the game, Ubisoft has already released a few patches to address key concerns, and the game’s first season is on the way and due to arrive on July 2. </p>



<p>How’s it doing, though?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-big-numbers">Big Numbers</h2>



<p>Our exclusive report revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-player-numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">XDefiant hit one million players worldwide</a> in just 2.5 hours, which made it the most successful Ubisoft launch <strong>ever </strong>by sheer numbers. In a couple of days, XDefiant had secured three million players and staggering concurrent player numbers across all platforms. It was considered a success at launch even if most players were dabbling in the game ‘just to see what was on offer’. </p>



<p>In terms of what XDefiant now offers, it’s appropriate to describe it as a run-of-the-mill first-person shooter. It has guns, it has abilities, and it has a diverse array of maps and modes that will satisfy the appetite of the average gamer. There are more casual unranked modes that don’t use SBMM mechanics, and there’s a more regimented ranked platform that’s perfect for the more skilled competitor. It’s the kind of content you’d expect from any shooter these days, and the offering aligns it quite nicely with Call of Duty.</p>



<p>Recently, Ubisoft added Team Deathmatch to the game, which was well received, but players are still requesting more ‘tactical’ modes like Search and Destroy – or something similar.</p>



<p>XDefiant’s unique pull is the faction-based model that sees players assume control of a character from one of Ubisoft’s franchises. From Rainbow Six to The Division and from Splinter Cell to Watch Dogs, Ubisoft is leaning on the concepts it has created over the last two decades or so to populate the multiplayer platform. It adds a nice tweak to the expected standard and gives players the ability to find their feet in one of many roles in the game.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="XDefiant Season One Reveal Trailer | Ubisoft Forward 2024" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bHJtbmKxsbY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>With the game’s first official season on the horizon, fans are expecting good things, and as a live service title, it’ll be steadily and regularly updated by Ubisoft as time goes on.</p>



<h2 id="h-but-how-is-xdefiant-doing">But How Is XDefiant <em>Doing?</em></h2>



<p>XDefiant feels nice enough to play, and a month after launch, Ubisoft has targeted some key areas for improvements without disrupting the overall feel of the game. For instance, the team tweaked movement mechanics that were allowing users to ‘exploit’ bunny-hopping, which ticked a box for many players – but they ticked said box without ruining the relatively fluid movement in the game.</p>



<p>We don’t have updated player numbers, but it’s easy to see how XDefiant’s popularity has dipped considerably since being released on May 21. On Twitch, XDefiant went from a peak concurrent viewer count of 203,586 in May to a (current) peak in June of just 57,000 – <a href="https://twitchtracker.com/games/780302568" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">and it’s declining</a>. Even with some of the most popular Call of Duty pro players ever being attracted to XDefiant, the audiences just aren’t there, which suggests the game might be more fun to play than it is to watch.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>From my experience in XDefiant, there’s a solid skill gap, a low learning curve, and enough variety to keep the average player occupied for hours on end. The maps are well-designed and, for a Ubisoft fan, the theme is quite enjoyable. Combat feels satisfying, and while the modes are nothing special, they’re entertaining enough to play. It’s a bit of a gut punch coming out of the ‘welcome playlist’ and moving into the standard playlists (which don’t have SBMM), but once you’ve warmed up, you’ll be enjoying yourself in no time</p>



<p>Amazingly, in all the time I’ve played, I haven’t come across a single player who I’d class as ‘suspicious’, which is a <strong>massive </strong>win.</p>



<p>The criticisms are few and far between:</p>



<ul>
<li>There aren’t enough weapon camos to unlock, with users needing to rely on the battle pass or the store to gain skins</li>



<li>Loading in and out of a match is clunky and results in blank screens while the lobby refreshes, which disrupts the pacing</li>



<li>Some of the spawn locations on maps are poorly thought through, often placing you too far from the action or too close to enemy spawns</li>



<li>The kick-off in Escort is irritating, with camping occurring right off the bat (but I get it)</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s probably not going to win awards, but for a free-to-play first-person shooter with this amount of depth, what is there to really complain about? It’s <strong>fun</strong> and that’s the most important thing for many users.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-new-reload-mode/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fortnite%E2%80%99s-new-reload-mode-is-basically-warzone%E2%80%99s-resurgence-mode.908535/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-new-reload-mode/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Epic Games has revealed the all-new game mode in Fortnite – <em>Reload</em>. It’s effectively a mimic of Warzone’s Resurgence mode, which has been one of the most popular rotations in Call of Duty’s battle royale game for years. In Reload, players get free respawns so long as at least one member of their team is still alive. When they’re killed, there’s a countdown, and then they simply drop back in and rejoin the fight.</p>



<p>That’s exactly how it works in Resurgence – but it’s very popular in Call of Duty, so it’s sure to be a hit in Fortnite.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-but-that-s-not-all">But That’s Not All</h2>



<p>To join Reload, Epic Games has brought back a ‘new map’ that’s not<strong> really </strong>a new map – it’s OG (kind of).</p>



<p>Taking elements from the original Fortnite map, this new and skewed environment has been built to be ‘tighter’ than the traditional large map, and that’s to accommodate fewer players fighting more aggressively based on the fact that they can now respawn after every death. In the closing circles, you’ll see intense combat erupt as users keep constantly reappearing in the sky. Here’s the trailer to showcase how it all works:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Fortnite Reload Launch Trailer - New Mode" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hkze-xcMN6A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>With your teammates, you can now head to Tilted Towers or Retail Row and slay out, securing team wipes to ensure that you’re fully clearing a squad from the running. If even one player is left alive, the entire team has the right to respawn and land on your head – so keep your eyes on the skies.</p>



<p>Reload is available in both build and Zero Build formats, so there’s something for everyone.</p>

<p>Hours ago, severe allegations surfaced online against Guy ‘Dr Disrepect’ Beahm from a former Twitch employee. These allegations concern the super-sized streamer’s permanent ban from the streaming platform in 2020. This event has never been openly explained by either Twitch or Dr Disrespect himself. At the height of his career on Twitch, ‘The Two Time’ received a sudden and permanent ban – but nobody ever knew <strong>why</strong>.</p>



<p>According to the allegation made by one former Twitch employee, Dr Disrespect was <em>‘banned because got caught sexting a minor in the then existing Twitch whispers product. He was trying to meet up with her at TwitchCon.’</em></p>



<p>Dr Disrespect has already refuted these claims.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-devastating-allegations">Devastating Allegations</h2>



<p>Even if they’re found to not be true, these types of claims can be devastating for anyone on the receiving end of them. Presently, there’s solid ground for Dr Disrespect to pursue legal action against Cody Conners, the former Twitch employee, but he seems content with simply posting his counterclaim on social media:</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Jake seriously… I get it, its a hot topic but this has been settled, no wrongdoing was acknowledged and they paid out the whole contract.</p>— Dr Disrespect (@DrDisrespect) <a href="https://twitter.com/DrDisrespect/status/1804337822415097955?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 22, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>In the hours that followed the allegation breaking on Twitter, several sources came forward to either support the claim or to back up Beahm. Rod ‘Slasher’ Breslau, a prolific insider who first addressed the news back in 2020, posted something cryptic, simply stating, <em>‘I didn’t lie’</em>. </p>



<p>He is of course referring <a href="https://x.com/Slasher/status/1276742960286183424?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">to what he said four years</a> ago when The Doc was banned:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>look: for several hours now I have been told from credible sources the reason DrDisrespect has been banned. however due to the importance and sensitivity around the subject I have refrained from going on it. i don’t feel comfortable with it currently</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Another Twitch employee, Zach Diaz, wrote <em>‘so glad it’s finally out there’</em>. </p>



<p>Many have proposed that the news is only surfacing now because those ‘in the know’ at Twitch were subject to an NDA that prevented them from talking about the ban on pain of legal action. The general assumption is that the NDA has now expired and former employees have nothing restricting them from talking about these claims.</p>



<p>Dr Disrespect is no stranger to controversy. In 2019 he was banned from Twitch for streaming at E3 and walking into a bathroom while a teenager was urinating. In 2017, he took to the internet out of character to admit that he’d been unfaithful to his wife, following which he took a brief break from streaming. He has also wrestled in the past with accusations of racism.</p>



<p>Whatever happens now, there’s a rocky road ahead for Dr Disrespect.</p>

<p id="JqBuiK">If you’re short on time or Poké Balls, you can pop an <strong>Incense</strong>, then quickly <strong>tap each Cyndaquil </strong>to check for shiny ones, running from any that aren’t shiny. Notably, any Cyndaquil you’ve already tapped will face where your player is standing, so that should help identify which ones you may have already checked.</p>
<hr id="fCZXnK">
<h2 id="Rck3HW"><strong>What Community Day move does Cyndaquil’s evolution learn?</strong></h2>
<p id="P33K1t">If you evolve Quilava into Typhlosion from 2 p.m. until 7 p.m. in your local time, it will learn the charged move Blast Burn.</p>
<p id="pcrxXf">If you miss out on evolving it during this period, you will likely be able to evolve it during a Community Day weekend event in December to get Blast Burn. If you don’t want to wait, you can use an <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-go-guide/22557832/tm-elite-fast-charged-best-use-how-to-get-technical-machines">Elite TM</a> to get the move.</p>
<hr id="sJ5mE8">
<h2 id="PRBqBQ"><strong>How does Typhlosion do in the meta?</strong></h2>
<p id="UnfEw0">Typhlosion is pretty outclassed at this point by many other fire-type attackers, like Reshiram, Heatran, Volcarona, and Darmanitan, just to name a few (and that’s not getting into Megas and shadows, which push it even further down the list). <strong>Shadow Typhlosion</strong> holds its weight pretty decently as a fire-type attacker if you manage to snag one, if you set it up with Incinerate and Blast Burn.</p>
<hr id="wsHYws">
<h2 id="rVGJO4"><strong>How do I make the most of Cyndaquil Community Day?</strong></h2>
<p id="VP2Yku">The following bonuses will be active during Cyndaquil Community Day:</p>

<li id="IH0sir">Doubled XP for catching Pokémon</li>
<li id="PF2Fbg">Incense lasts three hours</li>

<li id="Kt1oY9">Cyndaquil special photobombs when taking snapshots</li>
</ul>
<p id="kOd6mO">That said, you should definitely pop a Star Piece, a Lucky Egg, and an Incense and try to nab some powerful Cyndaquil.</p>
