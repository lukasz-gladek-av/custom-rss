            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Following some controversy, the developers at <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> creator Larian Studios have further clarified their use of generative AI. CEO Swen Vincke and other Larian developers held an AMA on Reddit where they answered users’ questions about the team’s next title, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxzyVeAG00w"><em>Divinity</em></a>. They also fielded questions related to reports that the studio was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/845713/larian-ceo-divinity-ai-swen-vincke">using generative AI in its development process</a>.</p><p>“So first off - there is not going to be any GenAI art in Divinity,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/comment/nyl9tdz/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Vincke wrote</a> in response to a question on Reddit. Last month, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-12-16/-baldur-s-gate-3-maker-promises-divinity-will-be-next-level?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2NTg5MzY2NSwiZXhwIjoxNzY2NDk4NDY1LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUN0Q4ODFLSVAzSTkwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.D26Cs7X_5kH5HuJT2frcX_AMIXyuXWefzz5NK2VlXEI">in an interview with <em>Bloomberg</em></a>, Vincke stated that while they weren’t using AI-generated assets in <em>Divinity</em>, the team was experimenting with AI tools “to explore ideas, flesh out PowerPoint presentations, develop concept art and write placeholder text.”</p><p>His comments were immediately and fiercely criticized online by gamers, developers, and former Larian employees. In response, Vincke <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/larian-ceo-responds-to-divinity-gen-ai-backlash-we-are-neither-releasing-a-game-with-any-ai-components-nor-are-we-looking-at-trimming-down-teams-to-replace-them-with-ai">issued a statement</a> clarifying that they were not using the tool to generate concept art, but as something artists could use to iterate on ideas faster.</p><p>Now, in the Reddit AMA, he says they won’t use it for concept art at all. “We’ve decided to refrain from using genAI tools during concept art development,” he wrote. “That way there can be no discussion about the origin of the art.” But Vincke did leave room for the possible use of gen AI assets in the future.</p><p>“If we use a GenAI model to create in-game assets, then it’ll be trained on data we own,” he wrote.</p><p>In addition to art, Larian also clarified gen AI usage with text. “We don’t have any text generation touching our dialogues, journal entries or other writing in Divinity,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/comment/nylh1fm/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">wrote writing director Adam Smith</a>. He said text generation was only for research, not development purposes, and that the results were too low-quality when compared to a human writer and Larian’s own standards.</p><p>“We had a limited group experimenting with tools to generate text, but the results hit a 3/10 at best,” Smith wrote. “Even my worst first drafts ... are at least a 4/10 ... and the amount of iteration required to get even individual lines to the quality we want is enormous.”</p><p>While these comments might reassure players that at least gen AI assets won’t be in the final product, Vincke reaffirmed that gen AI would still play some role at Larian.</p><p>“Our hope is that it can aid us to refine ideas faster, leading to a more focused development cycle, less waste, and ultimately, a higher-quality game.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/859551/baldurs-gate-3-larian-studios-gen-ai-concept-art-reddit-ama]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/steam-machine-price-leak-division-3-fable-ps5-2000658489</link>
            <guid>1401889</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Valve is supposed to reveal pre-order options for the <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-machine-valve-console-price-ps5-pro-2000643554">Steam Machine</a> in early 2026 but PC gaming prices are getting out of control. Ubisoft is already hyping up <em>The Division 3</em>. And a mystery game is set to appear at the first Xbox showcase of 2026. <em>Pentiment 2</em>? It’s another edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture.</p> <p>While it’s been the case for years now that physical games come with almost nothing inside the case but the disc, I still feel a brutal pang of disappointment <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1q7a7rg/the_excitement_of_opening_up_a_video_game_sure/">every time I encounter it</a>. I recently bought a handful of discounted games <a href="https://kotaku.com/rpg-sale-cheap-ff12-kingdom-come-2-ps5-switch-2000653958">over the holidays</a> and while their presence on my shelves pleases me, I can’t totally shake the disturbing void hiding within. It makes the rare game that does come packed full of inserts <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-binding-of-isaac-on-nintendo-switch-has-a-gorgeous-1793423566">all the more special</a>.</p>

 <h2>A Czech retailer has placeholder pricing for the Steam Machine starting at $950</h2> <p><a href="https://clawsomegamer.com/retailer-leak-puts-steam-machine-price-at-over-1000/">Clawsomegamer discovered</a> the detail in the source code for the web listing at Smarty.cz. That’s not an official retail partner for the device, making it extra unlikely that this is actually reflective of Valve’s pricing strategy rather than retailers just inserting placeholder guesstimates (Smarty.cz has $1,070 for the 2TB version). Still, it does have people worried about what kind of sticker shock they might eventually see as recent RAM shortages propel PC gaming component prices <a href="https://kotaku.com/asus-rog-ally-price-increase-nvidia-amd-ai-ps6-delay-2000656448">through the roof</a> at the start of 2026.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Big grain of salt:</p> <p>A Czech retailer (<a href="https://t.co/XIPdLHBOif">https://t.co/XIPdLHBOif</a>) has already put up a preliminary listing for the upcoming Valve Steam Machine (512GB) 👀</p> <p>The product page doesn't display a public price yet, but checking the site's source code via browser developer tools reveals a… <a href="https://t.co/QRqJxbnT6x">pic.twitter.com/QRqJxbnT6x</a></p> <p>— Clawsomegamer (@Clawsomegamer) <a href="https://twitter.com/Clawsomegamer/status/2009619612280017118?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 9, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Valve previously promised to reveal more information about its new living room console early this year, but those plans could be pushed back if the current supply chain issues are making it harder to get the first wave of devices manufactured at an affordable price point. While Valve has hinted that Steam Machines would be priced more like a gaming PC than a $500 console, no one knows if that means closer to $700 or closer to $1,000. The company <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-machine-price-console-linus-skillup-valve-2000646965">did hint that it’s not going to be</a> using profits from Steam to subsidize the price.</p>

 <h2>An Xbox showcase later this month hides a mystery game reveal</h2> <p>A fourth game at the Dev Direct taking place on January 22 was first teased <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-game-studios-bethesda-abk-ot36-oops-all-obsidian.1310962/page-215#post-149812867">by Shinobi602</a>.&nbsp;VGC corroborated the hint and <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-xbox-developer-direct-will-feature-a-secret-unannounced-fourth-game/">reports</a> that the mystery release is “a smaller-scale original game from one of Xbox Game Studios’ first-party developers.” That suggests it could be a side project in the mold of Obsidian Entertainment’s <em>Pentiment</em>.</p>

 <h2><em>Fable</em> will come to PS5, too</h2> <p>But there’s more! Alongside<em> Forza Horizon 6</em> and Game Freak’s <em>Beast of Reincarnation</em>, both already confirmed for PS5, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-xbox-developer-direct-will-feature-a-secret-unannounced-fourth-game/"><em>VGC</em> also reports</a> that <em>Fable</em> is in development for the Sony platform as well. Xbox exclusivity is dead, yes, but the question remains whether Microsoft will push to start getting these multiplatform releases out day-and-date or still stagger them where it sees fit.</p>

 <h2><em>Helldivers 2</em> kicks off its deadliest year yet</h2> <p>Strange new Illuminate structures <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1q7mfl4/new_squid_structures_23_seconds_into_star_of/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=post_title&amp;embed_host_url=https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/after-helldivers-2-boss-teased-death-and-destruction-in-upcoming-update-new-illuminate-structures-ominously-appear-in-a-blink-and-youll-miss-it-moment-in-super-earth-media/">are popping up</a> in the extraction shooter after Arrowhead Game Studios promised players that 2026 would be even bloodier for the forces of space fascism. “A lot of Helldivers will die,” CEO Shams Jorjani recently teased on the game’s Discord when talking about the studio’s upcoming plans. Arrowhead will have its work cut out for it after fans spent the early part of last summer <a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-eos-prosperity-china-steam-reviews-1851782983">beating back an invasion of Super Earth</a>.</p>

 <h2><strong><em>Where Winds Meet</em> starts 2026 off strong</strong></h2> <p>The surprise open-world hit on console and PC has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfrGu8nZ3i8">dropped its 1.2 update</a> that adds a new boss fight, Guild Battles, and other activities ahead of additional chapters coming later this month and next.</p> <h2><em>The Division 3</em> is shaping up to be a “monster”</h2> <p>That’s according to executive producer Julian Gerighty. “It’s shaping up to be a monster,” he told fans in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCiMJQkjV2M">new Ubisoft vidoc</a>. “I can’t really say anything more than that. But within these walls [at] Massive, we are working extremely hard on something that I think will [have] as big an impact as <em>The Division 1</em> was.” There’s no release date in sight for the sequel and Massive is still producing new content for <em>The Division 2</em>. Finding a way to combine the innovation and novelty of the first game with the gameplay polish and scope of the second could be a recipe for something special. Also something that takes a long time to make.</p> <h2>Warner Bros.

              <p><span>The companions who join you on </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-bg3-review-dungeons-dragons-rpg-larian-1850726491"><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3</span></i></a><span>’s </span><i><span>epic journey along the Sword Coast</span></i><span> are a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-best-video-game-characters-of-2023-1851085884"><span>wonderful bunch</span></a><span>, but one character definitely got the short end of the stick: Wyll. The Warlock was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-character-creator-bear-romance-wyll-1850616671"><span>famously rewritten</span></a><span> ahead of the game’s launch in 2023 when developer Larian decided his story in the early access release wasn’t quite working. Some things stayed the same, such as his character design, Warlock status, and where the player would ultimately recruit him, but his story was completely revamped, his voice actor was changed, and he was given ties to other characters, such as Tiefling party member Karlach.</span></p> <p><span>In </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/comment/nylf1wn/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=comment_embed&amp;utm_content=whitespace&amp;embed_host_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thegamer.com%2Fbaldurs-gate-3-lack-of-wyll-content-larian-response%2F"><span>an ongoing Reddit AMA</span></a><span>, the team at Larian provided some insight into the process and also explained why Wyll has notably less content than other party members as a result. It turns out Wyll’s story was finally coming together right when most other members of the player’s traveling party were being solidified, and some storylines the team planned on implementing him into ended up being cut. Senior writer Kevin VanOrd also explains that he had health issues during some of those iteration phases, which meant that he lost precious time that was meant to be spent fleshing out Wyll’s role. Overall, it sounds like VanOrd loves the character but wishes he could have done more with him.</span></p>

 <blockquote><p><span>As you probably know, we weren’t connecting with Wyll’s Early Access recruitment and initial questing, so we started over at a point when most of the other companion stories were fairly solid. A lot of decisions came later in development than was ideal – and there was a key situation near Baldur’s Gate that I intended to heavily involve Wyll in (the Red War College) that got cut. That meant back to the drawing board again. We eventually tied him to Duke Ravengard and started to work on that element of his arc just in time for me to get unexpectedly ill. I was out of the office for quite a while, and again after the epilogue’s release.</span></p> <p><span>I think that Ansur’s lair was Swen’s idea – we did have the resources for a standalone dungeon, so we got to work on tying Wyll to the Wyrmway, but I couldn’t get more than a dungeon boss out of it. Once the situations were in place, that was that – I had to start writing them.</span></p> <p><span>Wyll’s content is sparser than I’d have liked as a result. He’s also split into two stories, really – the Mizora story and the Ravengard story, and that might have been a mistake in hindsight. I also wish I could [have] given him a stronger endpoint – it always bugged me that he can end up just as he started, as the Blade of Frontiers, without any meaningful difference. All that said, I love the Blade and I am really proud of him, his sincerity, his good nature, and his eager heroism. I’m truly sorry I didn’t give you more quality time with him.</span></p></blockquote> <p><span>In the years since </span><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3</span></i><span>, Larian has patched in some new content for Wyll and other companions, but he has always felt like he was a few steps behind the rest of the crew. But based on VanOrd’s explanation, it sounds like the character was mostly a victim of circumstance, though that may not satisfy his diehards who have watched other characters get more scenes, interactions, and love over the course of the game.</span></p>

<p>Intel integrated graphics seem to be getting a significant upgrade with the next generation. One known leaker has gone online to give insight into just how big of a boost they’ll be getting.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, known hardware leaker <a href="https://x.com/OneRaichu/status/2008504896476348601" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">OneRaichu</a> spoke about the in-development Intel Nova Lake CPUs and what it entails from the integrated graphics perspective.</p>







<p>They say that the new architecture, Xe3P, which is expected to launch with the new CPU lineup in 2027, will see a performance uptick of “20-25%” with “even more [performance] uplift for the Xe3P-12C.”</p>



<p>Currently, Intel is preparing to launch its Panther Lake Core Ultra 300 series processors. Those will feature the Xe3 architecture that is also expected to be the main architecture behind the Intel Celestial graphics card line up. Those aren’t expected to be seen, however, until late 2026. </p>







<p>As with all rumors and leaks, until it’s made official or confirmed by Insider Gaming, take the information with a grain of salt. Even from leakers that have been reliable in the past.</p>



<p>What do you think about the rumored performance jump for Intel’s integrated graphics? Does it really matter to you?

Towerborne comes from Stoic, the studio behind The Banner Saga series.</p><p>The news was announced during yesterday's New Game+ Showcase. Towerborne first entered Steam Early Access in September 2024 and Xbox Game Preview in April 2025. It is a co-op fantasy action RPG in the vein of a classic beat ‘em up. Players control an immortal warrior named Ace who must defend the land against a deadly corruption while solving the mystery of a crumbling city. The side-scrolling combat emphasizes combo-heavy melee action, and Ace can be customized with gear that alters your playstyle.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V304dd9HZj0"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V304dd9HZj0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>When Towerborne first launched in Early Access, it was billed as a free-to-play, always-online title. Stoic has since reworked the game into a traditional paid experience that can be played offline, though it supports online co-op. Additionally, paid cosmetics have been removed; players now unlock cosmetics for free by playing, and new items will be added in the 1.0 version.</p><p>The 1.0 update also features a completed main story, two new bosses, new gear/player abilities, a reworked difficulty system including a new Brutal difficulty setting, and an updated world map. The final version of Towerborne also boasts new music from famed composer Austin Wintory</p><p>Towerborne launches in full on February 26, and it will debut on PlayStation 5 alongside Xbox Series X/S and PC. The Standard Edition is $24.99. The Deluxe Edition, which includes two cosmetic sets, crafting materials, and more, is $29.99.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/09/towerborne-the-action-rpg-by-the-makers-of-the-banner-saga-launches-out-of-early-access]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> developer Larian "will certainly consider" getting its upcoming release Divinity onto <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>This small nugget of hope for Nintendo users comes from today's AMA with Larian, which the developer hosted over on Reddit. Here, the studio was asked about releasing Divinity - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-announces-new-game-takes-ownership-of-desert-statue">which it announced at The Game Awards last month</a> - on Switch 2.</p>

<p>To this, the studio's technical director <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Bert_Larian/">u/Bert_Larian</a> noted Larian had just recently released <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/days-after-larians-big-the-game-awards-announcement-2017s-divinity-original-sin-2-receives-current-gen-upgrade-for-switch-2-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs">Divinity Original Sin 2 on Nintendo's latest console</a>, saying: "We love the platform." The developer then assured the community that Larian would of course also keep the Switch 2 in mind for Divinity.</p>
<p>During this same AMA, the developer was also asked about Divinity being playable on Steam Deck, because who doesn't enjoy that welcome portability. Again, Bert was very enthusiastic about the platform, and just like the studio loves Switch 2, it also loves Steam Deck.</p>
<p>"Since [Baldur's Gate 3] was one of the most played games on the platform, we will do our best to again release on the platform," Bert said.</p>

<p>Following Divinity's announcement last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-is-using-generative-ai-confirms-ceo-but-divinity-wont-contain-anything-ai-generated">Larian's CEO stated the studio was using generative AI to explore ideas, expand on internal presentations, develop concept art, and write placeholder text</a>. It then faced its fair share of backlash following this comment, and Swen Vincke responded, stating: "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/holy-fck-guys-were-not-pushing-hard-for-or-replacing-concept-artists-with-ai-larian-ceo-responds-to-genai-backlash">Holy **** guys we're not 'pushing hard' for or replacing concept artists with AI</a>."</p>
<p>He then announced the AMA, and today the studio head said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/change-of-mind-larian-says-it-will-not-use-gen-ai-at-all-in-relation-to-divinity-concept-art">Larian had changed its stance on generative AI following the backlash</a>.</p>

            <guid>1401847</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Hooded Horse</strong>, a publisher that made a name for itself when it picked up <a href="https://wccftech.com/manor-lords-indie-hit-160k-concurrent-steam/">Manor Lords</a> and has since been known to have a keen eye for strategy and city-building games, has drawn its line in the sand on GenAI tech. In an interview with <a href="https://kotaku.com/hooded-horse-gen-ai-art-ban-4x-strategy-steam-2000658179">Kotaku,</a> Hooded Horse's chief executive officer, <strong>Tim Bender</strong>, made it clear that the publisher will not sign studios that use GenAI.</p>



<p>The studio has even gone so far as to add a <strong>"<em>no f***ing AI assets"</em></strong> line into its contracts, banning any studios that work with it from using generative AI technology in the process of developing their game. "<em>If I sound frustrated, it's because, like, honestly, all this thing has done is made our lives more difficult</em>," said Bender.</p>



<p>"<em>I f***ing hate GenAI art, and it has made my life more difficult in many ways,</em>" Bender continued. "<em>Suddenly it infests s**t in a way it shouldn't. It is not written into our contracts if we're publishing the game, 'no f***ing AI assets.'"</em></p>



<p>It's a strong stance for the publisher to take, though not a surprising one when you consider the amount of <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-will-refrain-from-using-genai-tools-to-develop-concept-art-will-use-it-elsewhere/">backlash studios like Larian</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/amidst-arc-raiders-success-embarks-use-of-gen-ai-voices-bubbles-over-even-epics-ceo-joins-the-fray/">Embark Studios</a> have received with their admittance of using GenAI tech, and even non-gaming companies like <a href="https://wccftech.com/dell-pulls-back-ai-first-push-after-admitting-customers-arent-interested/">Dell admitting that consumers are "<em>not buying based on AI</em>,"</a> signifying that people do not want to hear that AI and GenAI is at the forefront of new products.</p>



<p>That said, Bender goes on to say that simply including the ban on GenAI in the contract and drawing its line in the sand is what's easy. Actually ensuring that developers follow through with the ban is a different story. </p>



<p>"<em>We've gotten to the point where we also talk to developers and we recommend they don't use any GenAI anywhere in the process because some of them might otherwise think, 'Okay, well, maybe what I'll do is for this place, I'll put it as a placeholder,' right? Like some, people will have this thought, like they would never want to let it in the game, but they'll think, 'It can be a placeholder in this prototype build.' But if that gets done, of course, there's a chance that that slips through, because it only takes one of those slipping through in some build and not getting replaced or something</em>. <em>Because of that, we're constantly having to watch and deal with it and try to prevent it from slipping in, because it's cancerous</em>.<em>"</em></p>



<p>It's clear that GenAI is going to continue to be a controversial topic in the video game industry when it comes to its use in game development. Some studios, like the aforementioned Embark, will continue to use it without shame or fear, especially when you consider that Embark's latest release,<strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/arc-raiders-everything-we-know-about-the-latest-hot-extraction-shooter/"> ARC Raiders</a></strong>, is arguably <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-helped-push-steam-to-have-highest-grossing-december-yet/">one of the biggest recent commercial successes in games</a>.</p>



<p>But for Hooded Horse, it's not so much a question of using GenAI being bad PR; it's that the team firmly does not believe in the technology and takes an ethical stance against it. "<em>When it comes to GenAI, it's not a PR issue, it's an ethics issue,</em>" Bender added. "<em>The reality is, there's so much of it going on that the commitment just has to be that you won't allow it in the game, and if it's ever discovered, because this artist that was hired by this outside person slipped something in, you get it out, and you replace it. That has to be the commitment. It's a shame that it's even necessary, and it's a very frustrating thing to have to worry about</em>."</p>



<p>Ultimately, Hooded Horse is just one indie publisher in a sea of publishers. We can't say if another company will take the same approach, but as conversation and controversy around GenAI continue to rise, it wouldn't be a surprise if we start seeing more companies draw their own line in the sand on GenAI.</p>

            <p>With <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a> and its gang of rowdy adventuring mates in the rear view mirror, Larian are hoping to improve a couple of aspects of how they handle companions going forwards - a process that'll likely kick off in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/divinity-larian">Divinity</a>. In particular, the development of deeper relationships between party members and a more subtle build to the moment when the player's relationship veers into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-is-a-relentlessly-horny-video-game">deeply horny territory</a> are on their list of learnings.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>That's the answer senior writer Kevin VanOrd game when asked what narrative improvements he's keen to pull off in today's Larian AMA, which also saw the studio <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-will-no-longer-use-genai-for-divinity-concept-art-and-any-genai-used-for-other-games-will-be-trained-on-data-we-own">provide an update</a> on how they plan to handle using generative AI.</p>
<p>"Firstly, to have more interaction between companions - not just with more and better banter, but to have them develop deeper relationships with each other, just as they do with players," he wrote. "Secondly, to ramp up player friendship and romance more subtly, so relationship building feels natural."</p>
<p>It's nice to see the studio not simply hand-waving the first part away, especially given all the praise Baldur's Gate 3 rightly got for the regular little chats its companions have at various points throughout your roaming with them. While that banter's great, it can still sometimes feel like the distances between each of your buddies' tents in camp aren't bridged all to often, unless <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/G8-dxmsnVsQ">Minthara fancies having some fun with Gale</a> while the two are out and about.</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="280"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/comment/nyljdr7/">Comment</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Wombat_Medic/">u/Wombat_Medic</a> from discussion<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/larian_studios_divinity_ama/"></a><br> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/">Games</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>Then there's the sometimes rapid progression of the player's relationships to seriously sexy states perhaps a tad too quickly. It's not something I recall being too bothered by, possibly because I was keen to spend hours giggling at bear sex after seeing clips of that cutscene or because I'm a bloke and therefore the concept of such things lasting more than two minutes is beyond me. There's also the matter of BG3 sex speedruns taking off as their own form of bonkers entertainment, something that might not have happened if you had no choice but to still be courting deep into the final act.</p><p>On the other hand, having such bonds feel as genuine and human as possible is something I can't knock people for desiring, and Larian for striving to deliver. Who knows, maybe the luxuriously-rendered lovemaking BG3 boasted will become even more beloved if you've got to work a bit harder to reach such points of climax.</p>
<p>There we go. I've lowered the tone last thing on a Friday. Merry weekend.</p>

                <p>The publisher behind strategy games Endless Legend 2, Terra Invicta, and Against the Storm has officially banned the use of AI-generated assets in all its products. Hooded Horse has had a significant presence in the strategy game space over the last few years, thanks to hits like Manor Lords. Now, when many publishers and developers are evaluating (or touting) their relationship to generative AI, Hooded Horse is rebuking its use for art generation.</p><p dir="ltr">Hooded Horse CEO Tim Bender discussed the ban in an interview with <a dir="ltr" href="https://kotaku.com/hooded-horse-gen-ai-art-ban-4x-strategy-steam-2000658179" rel="noreferrer nofollow ">Kotaku</a>, emphasizing that restrictions on AI art are part of every contract Hooded Horse signs. He said, "It is now written into our contracts if we’re publishing the game, 'no f**king AI assets.'" He also expressed personal exasperation with how GenAI has made his job harder. He said, "If I sound frustrated, it’s because, like, honestly, all this thing has done is made our lives more difficult."</p><p dir="ltr">This frustration comes from the fact that GenAI usage can be difficult to catch. Even if the intention is to use a generated asset only as a placeholder, those assets can easily make their way to the final product. "We’ve gotten to the point where we also talk to developers and we recommend they don’t use any gen AI anywhere in the process," Bender elaborated.</p><p dir="ltr">Still, preventing these slip-ups requires constant vigilance. As Bender put it, "We’re constantly having to watch and deal with it and try to prevent it from slipping in, because it’s cancerous." Bender's concerns have precedent. <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-just-lost-its-indie-game-of-the-year-awards-over-ai-concerns/1100-6537129/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 lost its Indie Game of the Year award</a> over "placeholder" AI assets, which were removed after players spotted them.</p><p dir="ltr">Generative AI has become a ubiquitous and controversial feature of game development and tech culture in general. Developers and fans alike criticized <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/larian-ceo-says-a-lot-has-been-lost-in-translation-amid-divinitys-ai-blowback/1100-6537085/">Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian's usage of generative AI</a>, prompting clarification from Larian CEO Swen Vincke. <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-dev-defends-use-of-ai-yet-again/1100-6537166/">Arc Raiders developers Embark</a> has continued to defend its deployment of AI text-to-speech models. <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lies-of-p-publisher-is-excited-about-ai-to-maximize-player-engagement/1100-6537198/">Lies of P publisher Neowitz</a> has touted its incorporation of AI to enhance productivity.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/roblox">Roblox</a> has begun its global rollout of facial age verification onto the popular gaming platform starting today, in an attempt to improve child safety following a deluge of criticism. This comes after a partial rollout of the technology back in December.</p>
<p><a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2026/01/roblox-age-checks-required-to-chat">In a blog post on the official Roblox website</a>, chief safety officer Matt Kaufman and VP of user discovery Rajiv Bhatia explained how these new age checks will work. Over the next week, users will find this new security measure added to Roblox as a barrier between them and the gaming platform's chat feature.</p>
<p>The blog post states: "As the first large online gaming platform to require facial age checks for users of all ages to access chat, this implementation is our next step toward what we believe will be the gold standard for communication safety. It enables age-based chat, which promotes a positive, age-appropriate experience for all users globally, and limits communication between adults and children younger than 16."</p>

<p>The post also features statistics <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-continues-efforts-for-child-safety-by-expanding-age-estimation-to-all-users-by-end-of-the-year">from its earlier partial rollout</a>. It claims that following the facial age verification implementation in Australia, New Zealand, and the Netherlands more than 50 percent of daily active users had completed the process.</p>
<p>For Roblox users younger than nine-years-old, parental permission will be required to use the chat functionality. Those aged 13 or older will be able to chat with those from a wider age group ranging from nine to seventeen thanks to what Roblox is calling their "Trusted Connections Feature". This age group will not be able to speak to those above or below that range, and similar restrictions are present for different detected age groups. Those over the age of 13 can instead verify their age using ID.</p><p>Roblox claims that user privacy is paramount, and that images taken to verify the age of users are deleted immediately after the security check is completed. <a href="https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/37725513985812-Unlocking-Trusted-Connections-Expressive-Chat-Features-Party-Voice-chat-without-filters">On a Roblox help page dedicated to this Trusted Connections feature</a>, it states that occasionally users may have to redo this age verification process. In the event that the age verification software places a user into an age bracket that's incorrect, an appeal process is available where real-world ID or parental controls can manually circumvent the user's assigned age.</p>
<p>These age verification checks come following a period of intense scrutiny aimed at Roblox in regard to what many believe to be subpar efforts in child safety. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/louisiana-sues-roblox-for-allegedly-choosing-profits-over-child-safety-claiming-its-basically-open-season-for-sex-predators-on-this-app">The platform was sued by the state of Louisiana</a> last year over child safety, with Roblox's CEO previously <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/parents-worried-about-childrens-safety-shouldnt-let-them-play-roblox-company-boss-says">stating that parents not comfortable with their children playing the game shouldn't let them Roblox</a>. Months later, he would return to the forefront of this debate in a trainwreck interview, in which he stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-boss-says-problem-of-predators-is-an-opportunity-for-the-platform-in-disastrous-interview-following-latest-child-safety-measures">the game's predator problem was an "opportunity" for the platform</a>.</p>
<p>While undoubtedly a step in the right direction, this type of facial recognition technology has been circumvented by younger users in recent months. When the UK rolled out its online safety bill requiring larger websites to verify the ages of users, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/brits-can-get-around-discords-age-verification-thanks-to-death-strandings-photo-mode-bypassing-the-measure-introduced-with-the-uks-online-safety-act-we-tried-it-and-it-works-thanks-kojima/">many used Norman Reedus in Death Stranding 2 to trick the facial recognition software</a>. Whether or not this is a great stride towards a safer Roblox for kids remains to be seen.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Conspiracy That Todd Howard Hates Fallout: New Vegas Is Absurd]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/todd-howard-doesnt-hate-fallout-new-vegas-season-2-canon-rumors-true-2000657238</link>
            <guid>1401805</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Recently, the topic of <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-new-vegas-things-never-say-fan-bethesda-xbox-1851467599">2010’s <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em></a> and Bethesda creative director Todd Howard came up during a New Year’s Eve party I attended. During the conversation, a few people, myself included, joked about how Howard doesn’t like <em>New Vegas</em>, a <em>Fallout</em> game developed not by Bethesda but by Obsidian. Look around online, and you’ll see plenty of others joking and suggesting the same thing. Howard hates <em>New Vegas.</em> Or is at least annoyed by its success.</p> <p>Here’s the thing: There’s no evidence this is true, and in fact, Bethesda’s famed creative director has stated multiple times publicly that he thinks <em>New Vegas</em> is great. And yet, this myth is so persistent that even I have to remind myself that it ain’t true.</p>

 <p>So what’s up with that? Why is this rumor so popular and so widely believed, to various degrees, by so many <em>Fallout</em> fans and gamers? And exactly how and when did it start?</p> <h2>The history of the Todd Howard hates <em>New Vegas</em> rumor</h2> <p>Looking around online, it doesn’t seem like this was a topic until a few years after <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em> arrived. Specifically, after the launch of <em>Fallout 4</em> in 2015, you started to see discussion of this topic pop up online.</p>

 <p><a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/959557-fallout-new-vegas/72818844">Here’s a November 2015 GameFAQs thread</a> in which someone asks if Howard hates <em>New Vegas,</em> because he doesn’t talk about it much, and people complaining about <em>Fallout 4</em> being worse than Obsidian’s spin-off. And I think this is a key part of this myth. A lot of people were disappointed by <em>Fallout 4 </em>for&nbsp;feeling less like an RPG and more like an open-world shooter. And at this point, enough time had passed that 2010’s<em> New Vegas</em> was more fondly remembered as a cool RPG and not a buggy mess.</p>

 <p>Over time, this opinion that <em>New Vegas</em> was good and <em>Fallout 4</em> was bad has solidified online and helped convince many that Bethesda and Howard must surely be mad or jealous over the perception that their latest big installment in the franchise pales in comparison to Obsidian’s rushed-out spin-off. This belief even helped fuel the idea that season one of the TV show was removing<em> New Vegas</em> from the canon. (It wasn’t.) <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/orc0n5/does_bethesda_actually_resent_new_vegas/">And now it’s easy to find people</a> <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/22380/discussions/0/7625232196037861261/?l=greek">claiming Howard hates <em>New Vegas</em> online</a>.</p>

 <p>But if you look back over the last 15 years, there’s zero evidence that Howard and co. hate <em>New Vegas</em>. &nbsp;You can, however,&nbsp; find plenty of evidence that Howard doesn’t hate <em>New Vegas.&nbsp;</em></p> <h2>All the evidence that Howard likes <em>New Vegas&nbsp;</em></h2> <p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/fallout_new_vegas/b/pc/archive/2010/05/04/what-you-should-know-about-fallout-new-vegas.aspx#:~:text=While%20we%20wouldn%E2%80%99t,I%20don%E2%80%99t%20care.%E2%80%99%E2%80%9D">All the way back in 2010,</a> in a <em>Game Informer</em> preview of the then-upcoming<em> Fallout: New Vegas,</em> Obsidian boss Feargus Urquhart and game director Josh Sawyer were speaking pretty positively about working with Howard. Here’s what Urquhart told the outlet:</p>

 <blockquote><p>“Todd [Howard] was awesome. I would say sometimes I was more resistant to some of the things [Josh] wanted to do than Todd was. Todd has a great way of looking at games. It’s all about the player. If we had ideas that we could all see would make it a lot more fun for the player, he was like, ‘Go kill that sacred cow—I don’t care.’”</p></blockquote> <p><a href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Joshua_Sawyer_Formspring_posts/2011#:~:text=JESawyer%20responded%20to%20larzma,He%27s%20a%20great%20guy.">In 2011,</a> while answering fan questions about <em>Fallout: New Vegas,</em> Sawyer once again mentioned that Howard was a “great guy.” Then, in 2013, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/and-heres-obsidians-idea-for-fallout-new-vegas-2">Howard told <em>RPS</em> </a>that he thought<em> New Vegas</em> was great and he was open to doing more with Obsidian.</p>

 <p>In 2018, <a href="https://youtu.be/QKn9yiLVlMM?t=2937">a small moment from NoClip’s excellent Bethesda documentary</a> likely helped add more fuel to all this. The doc takes a small detour to talk about <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em> and categorizes it as a corporate-mandated decision, says there aren’t many <em>New Vegas</em> posters around the Bethesda offices, and seems to imply that the studio was mostly hands-off on the project.</p> <p>But also, in that same year, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/jul/18/bethesda-games-interview-todd-howard-pete-hines-elder-scrolls-starfield">while speaking to <em>The Guardian</em></a> about <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em> and whether Bethesda would ever let another studio make a <em>Fallout</em> game, Howard said this:</p> <blockquote><p>“I wouldn’t say never. [But] now that our company is so big, it’s always better to keep stuff internal…it becomes less likely, but I could never say never. I thought the Obsidian guys did a fabulous job.”</p></blockquote> <p>In 2019, <a href="https://youtu.be/nPttE_fvjZM?t=3523">Howard reiterated in an interview with <em>IGN</em></a> that it was unlikely an outside studio would ever get to make <em>Fallout</em> again, but once more praised <em>New Vegas</em> and clarified that the only studio they trusted to make the game was Obsidian.</p>

  <p><a href="https://youtu.be/ygTFeCWOEZU">Jump forward a bit to 2024</a>. During an appearance on <em>Kinda Funny</em>, Howard was jokingly asked by host Greg Miller about how much he allegedly hates <em>New Vegas</em> and how Bethesda was removing it from the franchise’s canon via the show. Howard rolled his eyes and then said this:</p> <blockquote><p>“First, I’ll say, they did an amazing job with <em>New Vegas</em>. We see some of that, and I’ll say to everybody, that’s a game that we published, right? I will say Feargus, who runs Obsidian, is absolutely one of my favorite people in the video game industry…<em>New Vegas</em> is a very, very important game to us and our fans. We think [Obsidian] did an incredible job.”</p></blockquote> <p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fallout/huge-respect-to-the-folks-at-obsidian-todd-howard-invited-obsidian-devs-onto-fallout-season-2s-set-so-they-could-see-new-vegas-in-the-flesh/">In December 2025,</a> ahead of <em>Fallout</em> season two on Amazon Prime, Howard told <em>PC Gamer</em> that he had invited the Obsidian devs onto the New Vegas set to let them see it in person. He added:</p>

 <p>“When we went to do [<em>New Vegas</em>], we were coming off of <em>Fallout 3.</em> We knew we were going to do <em>Skyrim</em>. We know the folks at Obsidian well, love their work, and so we reached out to them and said, ‘Hey, would you like to do this? We see something else coming off of <em>Fallout 3.</em>‘ This is what we asked them to do, right? And they just did an incredible job on <em>New Vegas.</em>”</p> <p>And most recently, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fallout/not-only-does-todd-howard-not-hate-obsidian-it-was-his-only-choice-to-take-up-fallouts-reins-in-the-wake-of-fallout-3/">in January of 2026,</a> Howard reiterated that Obsidian was “the only choice” for <em>New Vegas</em>. It was also revealed that the only mandate Bethesda put on the game was that it needed to include factions.</p> <p>Even after reading through all of this, I imagine there will still be people who will keep believing that Howard and Bethesda despise <em>New Vegas</em> or are jealous of its success.</p>

 <p>The thing is, I get why so many people will keep repeating this rumor. It is a very compelling story. Bethesda works really hard on <em>Fallout 3</em> and <em>Fallout 4</em>, spending years and years on each entry, but it’s Obsidian’s scrappy <em>New Vegas,</em> made in just 18 months, that has gone on to be the fan favorite. There is something almost David and Goliath about it. But just like that story, the idea that Howard hates <em>New Vegas</em> is a myth.</p>      </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/todd-howard-doesnt-hate-fallout-new-vegas-season-2-canon-rumors-true-2000657238]]></content:encoded>

<p>Quarantine Zone: The Last Check is a unique hybrid as it features puzzle, strategy, and action elements rolled into one. You need to be a detective one second, and a tough decision-making zombie killer the next. If Quarantine Zone: The Last Check has piqued your interest, this guide will break down its platforms.</p>



<p>Gaming would be infinitely easier if every new title were released on every available platform. Obviously, this is never going to happen for various reasons, but it means we always have platform problems and console conundrums. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/quarantine-zone-the-last-check-release-date-demo-status-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Quarantine Zone: The Last Check</a> is the perfect example, as it’s a promising indie title, but the audience doesn’t know where to seek shelter.</p>



<p>Time to see if PlayStation and Xbox owners have missed the quarantine period.</p>

<p><strong>For the time being, Quarantine Zone: The Last Check is aptly being quarantined away from all PlayStation consoles.</strong></p>



<p>Despite the interest and polish of the product, there will be no PlayStation port of The Last Check for now. The PS4 and PS5 consoles are powerful beasts, but any infected beasts are being kept on PC for now.</p>



<p>This isn’t to say a PS5 (or PS4) port won’t happen in the future. It’s happened many times in recent memory where a game does really well on PC and Steam, and later commissions a console release—REPO being a great example of this.</p>



<p>Stay tuned for future updates on The Last Check coming to PS4 or PS5.</p>

<p><strong>If you’re an Xbox One or Xbox Series X|S owner, you also have to miss out on Quarantine Zone: The Last Check’s initial launch, with no Xbox port being talked about.</strong></p>



<p>There will be no console launch for The Last Check: PlayStation, Xbox, and even Nintendo Switch 1 and 2 owners need to hang fire at the checkpoint for now. Brigada and Devolver need to see how Quarantine Zone: The Last Check pans out on PC first. If it sells well, it’s reviewed well, and its player numbers can be sustained, an Xbox launch down the line is not out of the question.</p>

<p dir="ltr">"The amount of players playing together will be depending on the final party size," van Semmertier responded. "But since modding is planned for this project as well, player[s] will be essentially free to extend this. There is no hard limit to the amount of co-op players."</p><p dir="ltr">Co-op wasn't the only topic broached by Larian on Reddit. CEO Swen Vincke waded right in regarding the lightning-rod issue of generative AI, stating that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/larian-studios-draws-harder-line-on-ai-clarifies-stance-in-reddit-ama/1100-6537296/">Divinity wouldn't feature "any GenAI art."</a> Larian might still use forms of AI during development, but that will be trained on previous work by the team, according to Vincke. This comes after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-divinity-dev-reveals-how-it-uses-generative-ai/1100-6537001/">backlash to comments Vincke made last month about generative AI at Larian</a>.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-mystery-of-the-game-awards-monolith-appears-to-have-been-spoiled-by-a-trademark-filing/1100-6536822/">Divinity was unveiled at The Game Awards</a> last month, after a mysterious monolith teased the game beforehand. This is the next big game from the Baldur's Gate 3 creators, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/divinity-devs-feel-more-pressure-after-baldurs-gate-3s-massive-success/1100-6537029/">Vincke admits there's "more pressure"</a> now. That said, Vincke still believes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/divinity-better-than-baldurs-gate-3-larian-ceo-swen-vincke/1100-6536981/">Divinity will be better than Baldur's Gate 3 "on all fronts." </a></p><p>There is no release window for Divinity, but it probably will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/divinity-will-likely-be-an-early-access-game-just-like-baldurs-gate-3/1100-6537011/">an early-access game like Baldur's Gate 3</a>.</p>

This includes behavioral challenges such as her loss of impulse control, withdrawal symptoms, irritability, anxiety, and difficulty disengaging from gameplay. The lawsuit also alleges that MA suffered addiction, social isolation, depression, loss of friends and relationships, and damage to her grades, leading to "an academic dismissal from school."</p><p>According to <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/add.70195" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a February 2025 study</a> reported on by <a href="https://www.aboutlawsuits.com/roblox-lawsuit/internet-gaming-disorder-1-in-10-adolescent-boys/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">About Lawsuits</a>, IGD is described as a pattern in which gaming negatively impacts a person's daily activities, including school, work, relationships, and family life. The symptoms tend to include nonstop gaming, irritability when access to games is restricted, and continued use despite its negative consequences. The research suggests IGD affects one in 10 adolescent boys, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/" data-ref-id="5000-73990">Minecraft</a> and Roblox often the culprits of the disorder.</p><p>Jackson alleges that MA played games like Fortnite and Roblox for years (primarily on Xbox consoles), resulting in a compulsive gaming behavior largely driven by reward-based features designed to exploit the dopamine pathways of a young brain that's still growing. Citing neuroimaging studies linked to IGD, Jackson claims that MA's developing brain has undergone similar structural changes in her prefrontal cortex, the region of the cerebrum responsible for decision-making, emotional regulation, and reward processing.</p><p>While the lawsuit states that the plaintiffs--Jackson and MA--knew of the effects that prolonged exposure to online gaming can have on adolescent brains, the filing still alleges that MA, as a minor, lacked the legal knowledge and understanding to agree to the terms and conditions within the agreements found in those very games. As such, the complaint claims that those contracts are invalid and unenforceable, specifically because games like these are designed to maximize engagement and screen time through systems like in-game currencies, progression loops, social-pressure mechanisms (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/5/7/18534431/fortnite-rare-default-skins-bullying-harassment/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">remember the "default skin" debacle</a>?), limited-time events, and reward schedules.</p><p>"MA never agreed to be harmed or exposed to an addictive Product," according to the lawsuit. "Neither Plaintiff nor MA ever entered into a contract with any of the Defendants, and/or to the extent that any Defendant claims MA attempted to accept an electronic terms and conditions clause by clicking buttons on a screen which included language Plaintiff did not understand, read, or language which was conscionable, and has been made void by virtue of its unconscionability and the power of disaffirmance. This unconscionability and disaffirmance is demonstrated and secured by the filing of this Complaint."</p><p>Raising issues around negligence, design defects, failure to warn, and fraud, the lawsuit seeks general and punitive damages--as well as injunctive relief--for 10 counts.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Another GameCube game has been added to the Nintendo Switch Online library, and this time, it's the turn of classic turn-based strategy epic <em>Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</em>.</p><p>Just like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wario-world-nintendo-switch-online" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6472b9f8-3b35-41d5-9c98-1ffee343faf2" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">every other</a> GameCube <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/luigis-mansion-nintendo-switch-online" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="559128f7-0f60-43f5-a4e0-64e6a9d1d5b0" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">game</a> on the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/chibi-robo-switch-online" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5eda1a19-710c-4126-8f24-86dd16fbc1ae" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">service</a>, <em>Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance </em>is only available if you're a Switch 2 owner with the Expansion Pack addon for your Switch Online membership, but if you do fulfil those criteria, you can check it out right now.</p><p><em>Path of Radiance </em>was released all the way back in 2005 (and, incidentally, was my introduction to the <em>Fire Emblem </em>series, as I'm sure it was for many).

<p>Much like its predecessors (and, indeed, its successors), <em>Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance </em>is a turn-based strategy RPG in which you'll be issuing commands to your characters and trying to keep them alive throughout various combat scenarios.</p><p>The game features permadeath, so if any of your troops fall during a battle, they're gone for good. Even plot-critical characters can fall in this way, although they'll be gravely wounded rather than dead, so you'll still see them during cutscenes.</p><p><em>Path of Radiance </em>is the first <em>Fire Emblem </em>game to feature fully-rendered 3D graphics, as well as voice acting and FMV cutscenes, but it's not the first title to come to the West; that honor goes to 2003's eponymous <em>Fire Emblem </em>(which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fire-emblem-nintendo-switch-online" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a7f1d4bf-fa55-4e28-a6da-a9eb0190b12d" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">also on Switch Online!</a>).</p><p>You can check out a trailer for <em>Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</em>'s Switch Online release right here. The trailer's in Japanese, but the game is available across the world, so you won't exclusively be playing the Japanese version.</p>
<p><em>Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance </em>is available right now to Nintendo Switch Online subscribers with a Switch 2 and the Expansion Pack addon. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Larian Studios, the team behind </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-bg3-review-dungeons-dragons-rpg-larian-1850726491"><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3</span></i></a> <span>and the upcoming </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/divinity-turn-based-rpg-larian-studios-early-access-date-2000653845"><i><span>Divinity</span></i></a><span>, is holding a Reddit AMA right now in which it talks about everything from its </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/divinity-gen-ai-larian-bg3-reddit-ama-2000658429"><span>highly publicized use of genAI</span></a><span> to the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-larian-studios-switch-2-port-reddit-ama-2000658454"><span>likely-dead dream of a Switch 2 port</span></a><span> for </span><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3</span></i><span>. It is also talking about lessons it’s learned in its 30 years, and one thing it took away from </span><i><span>BG3 </span></i><span>is clear: Companions should ease into </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-romance-sex-scene-bear-shadowheart-gale-1850771533"><span>being horny</span></a><span> rather than professing their love for you very quickly.</span></p> <p><span>In the AMA, senior writer Kevin VanOrd responded to a question about what Larian would like to improve on, and he gave two encouraging answers: companions having deeper, more complex relationships with each other, and a much slower lead-in to romantic relationships than in previous games.</span></p> <p><span>“Companion relationships,” he wrote. “Firstly, to have more interaction between companions – not just with more and better banter, but to have them develop deeper relationships with each other, just as they do with players. Secondly, to ramp up player friendship and romance more subtly, so relationship building feels natural.”</span></p> <p><span>Putting aside the horny ramp for a second, the distinction VanOrd makes between deeper companion relationships and more banter is an important one. I’ve been replaying </span><i><span>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</span></i><span>, and one thing BioWare really cooked with in that game is that your party is very clearly establishing their own relationships and dynamics with each other, regardless of your input and presence. Some of those result in romantic relationships, others solidify platonic ones with shared interests that go beyond the ambient dialogue you’ll hear running through the world.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>I just stumbled upon an early cutscene of the detective Neve and the elven archeologist Bellara bonding over their shared love of detective stories, and </span><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3 </span></i><span>could have definitely used more moments like that to help dispel the feeling that party members are living on islands and largely separate from each other.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>New information continues to trickle out about Larian Studios’ next RPG thanks to a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/larian_studios_divinity_ama/">January AMA</a> held with some of the development team’s leads on Reddit. The game is in full production and the <a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-bg3-review-dungeons-dragons-rpg-larian-1850726491"><em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em></a> maker is exploring timing around when to show off the first snippets of actual gameplay. In the meantime, we have plenty of morsels to chew on from the latest Q&amp;A, including comments on co-op, companion romances, and a possible Switch 2 port. Here’s everything new we just learned <a href="https://kotaku.com/divinity-larian-trailer-turn-based-rpg-release-date-2000653105">about <em>Divinity</em></a>.</p> <h2>Hand-crafted loot could return</h2> <p>Loot in<em> Divinity: Original Sin 1</em> and <em>2</em> was random, but Larian wants to do something more like <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> for<em> Divinity</em>. “The <em>BG3</em> approach of handcrafting every magic item worked well, and it’s something we’ve always wanted to do for&nbsp;<em>DOS2</em>,” head of design Nick Pechenin wrote. “Something we realized when working on randomized loot for <em>DOS1</em> and <em>DOS2</em> is that fully random loot is frequently confusing, so we added more and more rules and premade patterns to make it feel more intentional. In the end randomization did not save us much time.”</p>

 <h2>It’ll be made in the same engine as <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em></h2> <p>Larian will continue iterating on its existing Divinity Engine for the next game. It’s not suddenly moving to Unreal like some other RPG studios.</p> <h2>Native keyboard movement controls?</h2> <p>Head of gameplay Artem Titov simply wrote “no.”</p> <h2>Of course <em>Divinity</em> will be co-op</h2> <p>Following in the footsteps of previous games, the next RPG will also be multiplayer at release. “The amount of players playing together will be depending on the final party size,” wrote scripting director Bert Stevens. “But since modding is planned for this project as well, player[s] will be essentially free to extend this. There is no hard limit to the amount of coop players.”</p>

 <h2>The goal with gameplay is to “embrace the chaos”</h2> <p>For players who love doing quests out of order and blazing their own path through a game, <em>Divinity</em> will continue Larian’s reputation for accommodating the weirdest player idiosyncrasies. “The first thing we tend to do when playtesting our own situations is run them out of sequence, break them in every conceivable way, and see how far we can push the boundaries of what’s possible,” wrote writing director Adam Smith. “The greatest joy I get is seeing somebody go so far off the beaten path that they assume we’ll have lost track of them, and then they stumble across something that we put there just for them.”</p>

 <h2><em>Divinity</em> might have swimming?</h2> <p>One fan asked Larian which new <em>Divinity</em> mechanic it was most proud of and Pechenin gave a cryptic answer. “There was something that bothered me when I explored the starting areas of <em>DOS1</em>, <em>DOS2</em> and<em> BG3</em>,” he wrote. “It stares you right in the face if you think about it. In <em>Divinity</em> I can finally do the thing I wanted to do in every previous game.” Considering all three games start near a beach, some players think he’s talking about finally being able to hop into the water.</p>

 <h2>It’s ditching the magic armor system</h2> <p><em>Divinity: Original Sin 2</em> introduced a new mechanic to the series by which armor for physical and magic damage were separate. That will, thank god, not be returning in <em>Divinity</em>. “There will be ways to protect your characters from harm, but you will not have to wait before you can use your fun skill on enemies,” Pechenin wrote. “We are still cooking a system that makes sure that you have to work harder to stunlock solo bosses with level 1 skills, but it won’t be tied to damage.”</p>

 <h2>What about the tone?</h2> <p>The debut cinematic trailer was extremely grim and R-rated. Will the rest of the game follow in that vein? According to Smith,<em> Divinity</em> definitely aims to be more “grounded” and embrace some “folk horror vibes,” but will also still have plenty of humor, tragedy, and other emotional beats. “I laughed out loud reviewing a dialogue this morning!” he wrote. “I mentioned in the answer to another question that a game this size needs lots of tonal diversity.”</p>

 <h2>How will the camera work in&nbsp;<em>Divinity</em>?</h2> <p>“The camera will work very similar as in <em>BG3</em>,” Stevens confirmed. “So a hybrid of top-down and 3rd person camera!”</p> <h2>Will<em> Divinity</em> finally let you look up at the sky?</h2> <p>Probably not. “There is no real engine limitation to allow looking at the sky,” Stevens wrote. “How the camera works is entirely a design choice. Alternative camera angles are always considered. If they benefit the game, we will for sure add it.”</p> <h2><em>Divinity</em> is a standalone story rather than a direct sequel to <em>Original Sin 2</em></h2> <p>While <em>Original Sin 2</em> retconned some of the series’ previous lore, the new game will take place in that world but tell a separate story. “It’s in the same continuity, but it’s a standalone story,” Smith confirmed. “Long-term <em>Divinity</em> fans will find lots of familiar things but it’s never just fanservice – it has to serve the story we’re telling.”</p>

 <h2>Companions will have deeper relationships with each other this time around</h2> <p><em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> was great at deep relationships between the player and their party, but less so between the individual companions. More interesting relationships between party members is a priority for <em>Divinity</em>. Senior writer Kevin VanOrd wrote that the team wants “to have more interaction between companions – not just with more and better banter, but to have them develop deeper relationships with each other, just as they do with players.”</p> <h2>And be less aggressively horny…</h2> <p>He wrote that the other main goal with the companion writing this time around is “to ramp up player friendship and romance more subtly, so relationship building feels natural.”</p>

 <h2><em>Divinity</em> on Switch 2 is being considered but not promised</h2> <p>“We love the platform and we will certainly consider Switch 2 for the next <em>Divinity</em> game,” Stevens wrote.</p> <h2>Lizard romance?</h2> <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/comment/nylpp1p/">Confirmed</a>.</p>

                <p>Larian Studios CEO Swen Vincke, as well as creative directors, recently <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/comment/nyl9tdz/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">participated in an AMA on Reddit</a> to set expectations for the studio’s <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/divinity/">upcoming Divinity game</a>, particularly about its stance on generative AI--a hot-button topic in the industry right now. Responding to a fan question about the role of generative AI in game development, Vincke was rather blunt: "There is not going to be any GenAI art in Divinity."</p><p>His comments arrive amid wider debate over how and whether AI should be used in creative processes, especially as some high-profile games have faced backlash for such use. One notable example is Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, the acclaimed RPG that had two Indie Game Awards (including Game of the Year and Debut Game) rescinded <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-just-lost-its-indie-game-of-the-year-awards-over-ai-concerns/1100-6537129/" data-ref-id="1100-6537129">when it was revealed the title had included AI-generated assets</a> during development, violating strict no-AI rules--even though those assets were patched out later.</p><p>In the AMA, Vincke acknowledged that previous discussions about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/larian-ceo-says-a-lot-has-been-lost-in-translation-amid-divinitys-ai-blowback/1100-6537085/" data-ref-id="1100-6537085">experimenting with AI tools for concept-art had been confusing</a>. To make its intentions clear, the studio has elected to avoid generative AI entirely in concept-art creation for Divinity. As Vincke put it, there should be no doubt about where the art came from.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz5lWeGhq2o" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Kz5lWeGhq2o" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"We've decided to refrain from using genAI tools during concept-art development. That way, there can be no discussion about the origin of the art," Vinke replied. "Having said that, we continuously try to improve the speed with which we can try things out. The more iterations we can do, the better, in general, the gameplay is. We think GenAI can help with this, and so we’re trying things out across departments. Our hope is that it can aid us to refine ideas faster, leading to a more focused development cycle, less waste, and ultimately, a higher-quality game."</p><p>Vinke did note that the creative assets will not be generated from outside. If an AI model is used to create something, it will be trained on data or art that Larian itself owns.</p><p>Fans weren't done there, though: A follow-up question asked whether the no-AI stance applied only to concept-art, or if it extended to other creative areas such as writing. They also pointed out previous mentions of using AI for placeholder text and wondered whether such use could undesirably influence final content. Larian's writing director, Adam Smith, responded: "The stance applies to writing as well. We don't have any text generation touching our dialogues, journal entries, or other writing in Divinity."</p><p>Smith went further in explaining that using AI to generate placeholder text offered no real benefit after working with a model. "We had a limited group experimenting with tools to generate text, but the results hit a 3/10 at best, and those tools are for research purposes, not for use in Divinity.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>If you plan on staying out for longer than five hours with a cell phone, you have a power bank. For the most part, these things are boring bricks. Though they keep trying to add new features (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/856225/power-banks-are-the-latest-victims-of-feature-creep?ref=aftermath.site"><u>many of I will concede are useless</u></a>), the most exciting features are “will it charge my phone?” followed by “how much?” and maybe “how fast?” But, being me, I asked myself “how far can these things be pushed?”, which is how I ended up purchasing the humorously named Cuktech 15 Ultra, an attractive and modestly priced little brick that unfortunately has one incredibly sick feature that has now ruined me forever.&nbsp;</p><p>Cuktech, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UsbCHardware/comments/1nru4ev/cuktech_visit/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>which I believe is named</u></a> after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%86uk_converter?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Ćuk converter</u></a> and is pronounced “chook tech,” makes well-made gear. The Cuktech 15 Ultra boasts a capacity of 20,000 mAh, has a bright and beautiful screen that displays the charging speed of each port, and claims to have 140w output which is generally overkill but nice if you have a MacBook Pro (The highest end iPhone currently caps out at 40w tops, which is fairly fast for most people.). USB-C charging standards are annoying to keep straight and are only interesting if you have a bizarre obsession. What makes the 15 Ultra interesting is not that it has a high output, but that it has a mode dubbed “Beast Mode” that it claims allows for two simultaneous inputs of up to 165 watts (the internal meter capped at around 160w for me) for the majority of the time plugged in before it starts ramping down.</p><p>What this means is that, given adequate cables and bricks, the Cuktech 15 Ultra charges fast. Like, concerningly fast.</p><figure><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:k6kg5ccozcphfcmp4zyx3s64/app.bsky.feed.post/3mbwmhtwh222z" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreigen5agpgbecr4bfrjoeo4ucn4xftpujlvrtgcyywj7jj6khe5gs4"><p lang="en">Currently testing how fast I can charge my USB-C power bank.</p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:k6kg5ccozcphfcmp4zyx3s64?ref_src=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">Chris Person (@papapishu.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:k6kg5ccozcphfcmp4zyx3s64/post/3mbwmhtwh222z?ref_src=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">2026-01-08T18:30:49.217Z</a></blockquote><figcaption><p><span>Let's see how fast this bad boy can go.</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>It should be noted that other power banks do actually do this, albeit at a way higher price point. Anker has a power bank that will take two inputs at a claimed maximum input of 240 watts, but that bank costs $200. I don’t know about you, but I don’t make $200 power bank money, but I do make $60 power bank money on a good day, which is what the 15 Ultra costs as of this writing. You will also need a few sufficiently fast chargers and cables if you wanna make the most of it. That’s an additional cost, but one that’s easier for me to swallow because I need those anyway for my various gadgets and gizmos. Having a spare GaN charger or two that can handle a total output of 100w or 140w is always useful.</p><figure><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:k6kg5ccozcphfcmp4zyx3s64/app.bsky.feed.post/3mbwn3yaggk2z" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreihjld5eyzj2pwqv3m3rsfa2jwj72sjw3scamrngtmjltptwyxzrje"><p lang="en">12 minutes later.</p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:k6kg5ccozcphfcmp4zyx3s64?ref_src=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">Chris Person (@papapishu.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:k6kg5ccozcphfcmp4zyx3s64/post/3mbwn3yaggk2z?ref_src=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">2026-01-08T18:42:04.827Z</a></blockquote><figcaption><p><span>Woooooooo.</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>What makes the Beast Mode or any disarmingly fast charging mode so refreshing is that it completely saves your ass if you are a deeply lazy or neurologically distractible person. Repeatedly I find myself in the following situation: my phone is hovering at like 36 percent, my power bank is empty, and I have to leave in 15-20 minutes. Once I get the correct number of chargers going, 15-20 minutes is precisely as much time as I need to dump a huge amount of juice into the power bank along with my phone. It is not that the charging feature saves a lot of time, but the time it saves is in the exact right place.</p><p>I should stress that this is not a rigorous testing of the parameters of the required charging cables, power adapters, safety and advertised battery duration of the Cuktech 15 Ultra. Lithium Ion batteries are complicated and that is long, tedious work that I respect. I do know the exact power testers to buy on Aliexpress if I ever decide to make that a thing for Aftermath, and maybe I will down the line.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>I actually kinda dig the display! It's not bad.</span></figcaption></figure><p>I do, however, regularly visit the blogs of guys who consistently do this kind of testing. <a href="https://www.chargerlab.com/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Chargerlab</u></a> and its more consistently updated Chinese language site <a href="https://www.chongdiantou.com/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Chongdiantou</u></a> do teardowns and regular updates about new charging gear coming out of China, and it’s a fun way to see what’s on the horizon. There’s a German person named <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChargingSheet/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Chargingsheet who has their own subreddit</u></a> devoted to USB chargers and cables who was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChargingSheet/comments/1ii7vse/cuktech_15_ultra_210w_20000_mah_powerbank_mit/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>impressed by the 15 Ultra</u></a> (although found it to be a little large). <a href="https://www.tinkervault.com/usb-cables?ref=aftermath.site"><u>TinkerVault’s</u></a> testing of <a href="https://www.tinkervault.com/usb-power-sources?ref=aftermath.site"><u>chargers</u></a> and <a href="https://www.tinkervault.com/usb-cables?ref=aftermath.site"><u>cables</u></a> is useful when trying to find good gear, and it was very useful when trying to find enough juice to max out the Cuktech 15 Ultra.</p><p>This blog is not simply me endorsing the Cuktech 15 Ultra specifically – it’s well made enough, a very good deal for the features and comes with a nice cable. But there’s like five million charger brands out there right now. What I am marveling at is a feature that I expect will become standardized more and more in the future: the ability to crank as much juice as you can into a battery pack in the shortest time possible. Is charging a personal battery pack that fast a good idea? Is that hubris? Who can say. All I know is I have a learning disability that this helps with and the battery pack makes a really cool warp speed animation when you <em>really </em>get that sucker goin’.</p>
