			<p>In September 2025, insider <strong>Nate the Hate</strong> (who just won the <strong>'Leaker of the Year'</strong> award as voted by Reddit's GamingLeaksAndRumors) <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-rumored-launch-2026-xbox-series-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared the rumor</a> that <strong>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</strong>, the second installment in the Final Fantasy VII remake trilogy, would launch this year on Microsoft's Xbox Series S and X and Nintendo Switch 2. It seems <strong>Square Enix</strong>'s plan in this regard hasn't changed, at least according to the insider, who <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/2013735117735313739" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed it on X</a> in response to a follower's question.</p>



<p>If true, it would mean that Xbox and Nintendo gamers are getting both released games in the trilogy in the same year. The first one, <strong>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</strong>, is launching today on both platforms. Last month, the publisher <a href="https://wccftech.com/this-is-an-incredible-port-final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-nintendo-switch-2-demo-leaves-community-stunned-with-near-ps5-visual-fidelity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released a free demo</a> that stunned gamers particularly for its great visuals and performance on the Nintendo Switch 2, which <strong>almost looked on par with the PlayStation 5 version</strong>. The developer had previously also <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-s-actually-solid-spec-wise-ffvii-remake-developer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spoken well of the Xbox Series S</a>, saying they had no problem porting FFVII Remake Integrade to the platform, except for a few memory-related challenges. </p>



<p><strong>Porting Final Fantasy VII Rebirth will undoubtedly be more challenging</strong>, though, especially for the Xbox Series S and Nintendo Switch 2. The more recent game has a far larger scope and open world-like environments that will be quite taxing on the CPU, unlike the first game's fairly linear maps. Because of this, a 2026 launch would be all the more impressive, provided it is decently optimized. For comparison, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-playable-steam-deck/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is playable on the Steam Deck</a>, but only with some major performance and graphics caveats.</p>



<p>Series aficionados are also waiting with bated breath for news about <strong>Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3</strong>. Last month, director <strong>Naoki Hamauguchi</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/were-almost-at-the-point-when-we-can-share-more-information-about-it-will-final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-be-announced-at-the-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teased</a> that it was almost time for its unveiling, and fans thought it would happen at The Game Awards 2025, but it didn't. That said, it could be shown at the next State of Play, whenever that will be. As with previous games, the game will likely launch on Sony's PlayStation 5 first.</p>

<p>Forza Horizon 6’s release date has been confirmed just hours before the upcoming Xbox Developer Direct, with the game releasing on May 19, 2026. </p>



<p>A little over a week ago, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/alleged-screenshot-reveals-forza-horizon-6-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">screenshot had appeared</a> revealing details about Playground Games’ upcoming title, Forza Horizon 6. The screenshot provides essential details, including the release date, early access information, and what you can get with the Premium Edition.

            <title><![CDATA[BF Labs Players Will Get First Crack at Testing Battlefield 6’s New Season 2 Map and a BF4 Map That’s Being “Rebuilt for Today’s Battlefield”]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/bf-labs-first-crack-testing-battlefield-6-new-map-bf4-map-rebuilt-for-todays-battlefield/</link>
            <guid>1412734</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>After an <a href="https://wccftech.com/physical-video-game-sales-hardware-sales-november-2025-lowest-in-the-us-since-november-1995/"><strong>extremely strong launch</strong> that carried it</a> to become <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-schedule-i-hollow-knight-silksong-battlefield-6-steam-best-selling-new-games-2025/">one of the <strong>best-selling games of 2025</strong></a>, <strong>Battlefield 6</strong> could not have gotten off to a worse start to 2026 than by <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-2-release-date-january-update-ea/">delaying the arrival of Season 2.</a></strong> If you can't wait for the entire extra month it'll now take to arrive, then the clear answer is to do everything you can to get into <strong>Battlefield Labs</strong>, as <strong>EA</strong> announced that players participating in BF Labs will get to test out Season 2's new map, <strong>Contaminated</strong>, and everyone's favourite mini helicopter, <strong>Little Bird</strong>.</p>



<p>Those are just two of the main additions coming in Season 2 that BF Labs players will get their hands on first, as EA and <strong>Battlefield Studios</strong> continue to test and tweak things for the upcoming season. In <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/battlefield-6-community-update-battlefield-labs-season-2-testing-and-beyond">a blog post on the game's official website,</a> the BF Studios team outlined that the new map falls somewhere between the size of <strong>Eastwood</strong> and <strong>Mirak Valley</strong>. To give you a potentially better idea of how big it is, the team adds that it's "<em>comparable</em>" to maps like <strong>St. Quentin Scar</strong> from <strong>Battlefield 1</strong> or <strong>Arras</strong> from <strong>Battlefield V</strong>.</p>



<p>Contaminated and Little Bird are all that BF Labs players will be testing in the next session EA hosts, but the BF Studios team is quick to point out it'll be doing a lot more testing, and that future tests will be "<em>more exploratory</em>," including testing out different aircraft and vehicle systems. There are also adjustments to RPGs and vehicle interactions incoming, to potentially re-tune how vehicles can respond to RPGs and TOW launchers, and how those weapons impact vehicles.</p>



<p>There are other changes not outlined in the blog post that EA and BF Studios say will arrive in time for Season 2, and there are even more changes that won't arrive until after Season 2. Including the return of a <strong>Battlefield 4</strong> map that EA and BF Studios call a "<em>fan-favorite</em>" map: <strong>Golmud Railway</strong>.</p>



<p>"<em>Golmud Railway is being rebuilt for today’s Battlefield, not simply ported forward," </em>the blog post reads.<em> "Our goal is to preserve what made the map so memorable in Battlefield 4, particularly its combined arms gameplay, while improving how it plays and supports Battlefield 6 systems. Golmud is planned to be the largest Battlefield 6 map to date, giving us the opportunity to expand gameplay on a larger scale.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>We’re bringing Golmud into Battlefield Labs early as this will be a multi-session project. Through Labs, we want to test changes such as larger flight space, increased cover for aircraft, and other adjustments as the map evolves over time.</em>"</p>



<p>Lastly, EA and BF Studios did bring up the popular topic of a <strong>Solo Queue</strong> for its battle royale mode, <strong>REDSEC</strong>. While there's no indication that it'll be testing Solos in REDSEC anytime soon, the team is still testing it internally to help the team understand "<em>where Solo play can best fit within the broader battle royale roster, including how it affects match flow, survivability, and long-term engagement when featured alongside other battle royale experiences</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>These tests are part of our ongoing effort to make informed decisions about how Battle Royale is structured and presented over time, rather than committing to a single permanent configuration. Any future player-facing testing would be approached with the goal of learning and validation, and we’ll share more details ahead of time if and when those tests are planned.</em>"</p>



<p>Upsetting as it is that we'll have to wait longer than expected for the arrival of Season 2, it's at least good to know what EA and the BF Studios teams are looking to test in the meantime. Now that we're more than a few months into Battlefield 6 being in players' hands, it's also interesting and encouraging to see BF Studios lean on BF Labs like this, so that players get the chance to try out what's coming to the game, and provide feedback that could, realistically, help EA avoid a season so collectively hated that it kills any momentum the game had.</p>

Mario's companion Yoshi was teased at the end of the first movie, and since then, the official trailers for the <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-release-date-cast-trailers-everything-we-know-so-far">Super Mario Galaxy Movie</a></strong> have introduced Bowser Jr. and Rosalina.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/animation-movies/after-rosalina-and-bowser-jr-s-appearances-in-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-trailer-chris-pratt-hints-at-a-couple-more-character-surprises-people-should-be-excited/">GamesRadar+ recently</a>, Mario's movie voice actor Chris Pratt has apparently hinted there are at least "a couple more" characters not featured in the official trailers for the new movie that should excite fans. Here's the full exchange:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Oh, yes, there are," Pratt tells GamesRadar+ when we ask if there are any new characters he's looking forward to seeing in the finished film. "I'm not allowed to say what they are, but yes, there are some really incredible… Well, I think some of them have been released in the trailer – Rosalina, Bowser Jr. – and then there's even a couple more that are not in the trailer that people should be excited to see."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If Pratt is teasing a bigger cast of characters, there are plenty of friendly and not-so-friendly characters from the Mario video game universe that could pop up. One rumoured leak, <a href="https://gonintendo.com/contents/52847-rumor-more-characters-revealed-for-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie">dating back to last September</a>, has led to speculation that Wario could be making an appearance.</p>
<p>You can see the current cast for the Super Mario Galaxy Movie in our guide. Nintendo and Illumination have also confirmed Rosalina will be voiced by Brie Larson and Bowser Jr. will be played by Benny Safdie.</p>

ARC Raiders was actually <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-a-free-to-play-coop-shooter-is-embarks-debut-game/">intended to be Embark's debut game</a> before the team decided <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-is-now-a-pvpve-extraction-shooter-closed-alpha-test-starts-this-summer/">to rework it entirely</a> and focus on The Finals first, a bet that seemingly paid off now that ARC Raiders is <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-sold-more-than-12-million-copies-neared-1-million-concurrent/">one of the most popular games on the market today since it arrived in October 2025</a>.</p>

<h2 id="h-gameplay-overview">Gameplay Overview</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ARC-Raiders-Overview-Hub-1-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>ARC Raiders will be familiar to extraction shooter fans, while still accessible for those new to the genre.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>If you've played an extraction shooter before, the core concepts of ARC Raiders will be familiar to you. You jump into a large, expansive map, scavenge for resources and materials, raid and take down enemy players, and extract back to Speranza, the underground city you and every other raider call home.</p>



<p>Beyond enemy players, you'll also have to be wary of ARCs, the hostile machines that are the cause of the dystopian nature of the world. There are several different kinds of ARCs, and you can find out more about them below in the 'Know Your ARCs' section.</p>



<p>You can also find out more about ARCs and the gameplay in ARC Raiders in our upcoming Tips and Tricks, First 5 Things to Do, and Most Annoying ARCs - And How to Deal With Them guides.</p>



<h2 id="h-getting-started">Getting Started</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ARC-Raiders-Overview-Hub-2-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>You'll hit the character creation screen after you complete the tutorial.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>When you first log into ARC Raiders, you'll go through a short tutorial that shows you a couple of gameplay basics, like how to move, shoot, breach doors, and search for resources. It's all very basic and seems to end very abruptly with one major lesson: you have to be aware of other Raiders. You learn this lesson when two unknown Raiders catch you by surprise, though, unlike in a regular match, because this is just the tutorial, you wake up after the screen fades to black and fades back in, and the tutorial continues.</p>



<p>From there, you continue until you reach an exit elevator and make your first trip to Speranza, the underground city that becomes your home. You'll be given what looks like a storage closet as your place to live, which you'll slowly build out into your ultimate post-apocalyptic home, and meet the first of the vendors you'll get quests and buy resources from.</p>

<h2 id="h-building-your-raider">Building Your Raider</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ARC-Raiders-Overview-Hub-3-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>Upgrading your stats and your gear is key to buildcrafting in ARC Raiders.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Creating the aesthetic of your character is, of course, a key part of the experience in any game. But what's really going to impact you in gameplay is your stats and what you take with you when you go up top. </p>



<p>You don't want to take anything with you that you would really regret losing, and you can't just keep rolling the dice with free loadouts. You need to figure out how to put a build together, particularly with where you put your early stats and what weapons you put stock in. </p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ARC-Raiders-Overview-Hub-4-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>You've got to know how to navigate Speranza.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Speranza is your home base of operations in ARC Raiders. It's where you look at and upgrade your Raider's stats, change your loadout, your outfit - it's where you do everything.</p>



<p>You cycle through the main lobby screen, your Workshop, your Raider, the Traders, Decks, and the in-game Store with the left and right bumpers. Your inventory, however, is always available on its own dedicated button. If you don't know what that button is, look to the bottom left of your screen.</p>



<p>When you're in your inventory menu, make sure to pay attention to the '<strong>Actions'</strong> button. That's where you'll be able to decide on what to do with everything you find and store in your <strong>Stash</strong>. You also need to pay close attention to a small '<strong>Expand</strong>' option that sits just above your inventory stack. That's where you upgrade your Stash, so it can hold more things.</p>

<h2 id="h-going-topside-and-coming-home">Going Topside and Coming Home</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ARC-Raiders-Overview-Hub-5-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>Going up is only half the job, you have to come home safely too.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Of course, you can't upgrade your Raider, your gear, build out your home in Speranza; you can't do anything, if you can't survive a raid. Once you choose where to go, when you arrive you'll have approximately 30 minutes to grab what you can and make it back to an elevator to reach Speranza safely.</p>

<p>You should always be on the lookout for other players. Even with the reputation ARC Raiders has gained where plenty of players choose to play a more passive, PvE style, they're technically always a danger. But ARCs, the robots that stalk every inch of the map, those are the biggest danger of all.</p>



<p>That's why it's important to know your enemy; not just how to defeat it, but how to avoid it, and how to ensure you're always making it back home.</p>

<figure data-uuid="c7c6076c5421f"><a title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c7c6076c5421f/pokemon-legends-z-a.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> has received its first update of the year today for the Switch and Switch 2. When you download it, your copy will be updated to Version 2.0.1.</p>
<p>It focuses on some adjustments for obtaining certain items (including an increase to the maximum number of Mega Shards) and also applies a whole bunch of fixes to previously confirmed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_legends_z-a_mega_dimension">Mega Dimension</a> expansion issues. You can read more about this in a <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/71193/kw/pokemon%20legends%20z-a%202.0.1">separate post</a> on Nintendo's support site.</p>
<p>Here's the rundown of this latest update:</p>
<h2>Pokémon Legends: Z-A: Ver. 2.0.1 (Released January 21, 2026)</h2>
<p><strong>Adjustments Applied for Obtaining Items:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>When purchasing Berries from a food stall, you can now purchase multiple Berries at once.</em></li>
<li><em>After beginning the story of the Pokémon Legends: Z-A – Mega Dimension DLC, you will be able purchase Berries from the clerk at Nouveau Café’s Truck No. 3.</em></li>
<li><em>The maximum number of Mega Shards you can carry has been increased from 999 to 9,999.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fixes Applied for the Following Confirmed Issues Related to <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A – Mega Dimension</em> Content:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>When using moves in certain pockets of hyperspace, Pokémon may sometimes have faced a different direction from the intended target.</em></li>
<li><em>There were cases in which the weather remained sunny and did not change.</em></li>
<li><em>Shiny Pokémon obtained prior to the release of Pokémon Legends: Z-A – Mega Dimension may not have been registered to the Mega Evolution Pokédex, even if their Mega Stones were obtained after becoming available in the DLC.</em></li>
<li><em>During missions, images from unrelated scenes may occasionally have been displayed.</em></li>
<li><em>Players may not have been able to complete side mission 188 “Start Special Scanning!” even after earning the maximum number of survey points. (Players who are already experiencing this issue should be able to progress after entering and exiting hyperspace.)</em></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>In case you missed it, the Mega Dimension expansion DLC for Pokémon Legends: Z-A released at the end of last year. Unfortunately, it didn't exactly live up to our expectations here at Nintendo Life, with repetitive Hyperspace dimensions and bland level design, but it's hard to resist the lure of an expanded Pokédex.</p>

<p>Ubisoft's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/prince_of_persia_the_sands_of_time">Prince of Persia: Sands of Time</a> remake will no longer see the light of day after the company announced a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/ubisoft-cancels-6-games-in-major-organisation-restructure">major organisational restructure</a> this week.</p>
<p>Alongside this news, the team working on the game has issued a message explaining the reason behind this "difficult decision". Although the project had "real potential", it seems the developer was unable to reach a certain "level of quality" that would meet player expectations.</p>
<p>And while Ubisoft is done with this particular project, it doesn't necessarily mean it's leaving the Prince of Persia universe or legacy behind. Here's the message via social media (<a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2026/01/prince-of-persia-remake-team-shares-final-message-following-games-cancellation">thanks for the heads up, Pure Xbox</a>):</p><div><figure data-videoid="bhK3W_3CW7w" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bhK3W_3CW7w?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytbhK3W_3CW7w" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bhK3W_3CW7w?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bhK3W_3CW7w?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38e97flgrkou&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>To the Prince of Persia community, we want to share this with you directly.</p>
<p>We've made the difficult decision to stop development on Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake. We know this is deeply disappointing. The game carries enormous meaning for fans and for the team who worked on it.</p>
<p>While the project had real potential, we weren't able to reach the level of quality you deserve, and continuing would have required more time and investment than we could responsibly commit. And, we didn't want to release something that fell short of what The Sands of Time represents.</p>
<p>Prince of Persia as a universe and legacy continues to matter deeply to us, and this decision does not mean we're stepping away from the franchise.</p>
<p>Thank you for your passion, patience, and love for Prince of Persia.</p>
<p>- The Prince of Persia Team</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As we've already highlighted, Ubisoft's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/ubisoft-cancels-6-games-in-major-organisation-restructure">new operating model will focus on five "creative houses"</a>, which are responsible for key franchises. CH4 will work on narrative adventures, and listed here is the Prince of Persia series alongside IP such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/rayman_2_the_great_escape">Rayman</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/beyond_good_and_evil_20th_anniversary_edition">Beyond Good &amp; Evil</a>.</p>
<p>So, the Prince of Persia series is back on ice for now, but it could still return at some point in the future, in some way or form. If you are eager to experience <em>something</em> in this series, you could always try out the excellent roguelite sidescroller <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/rogue-prince-of-persia">Rogue Prince of Persia</a>, which was released on the eShop late last year.</p>
<p>The Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake was originally announced at an Ubisoft Forward event in 2020 and suffered multiple delays up until its cancellation.</p>

In their <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/solinfonat.bsky.social/post/3mcxfxwczwk2z" rel="nofollow">post</a> they call the reorganization plan "disastrous announcements" citing the cost-cutting plan, cancellation of projects, and end of remote working. They also issued demands for what they want for the employees:</p><ul><li data-list-item-id="e7737b53e138805cdc82eae6fa08c9855">The end of the cost-cutting plan,</li><li data-list-item-id="e44ef8cd911974bea45cf873a69c267e9">Maintaining and extending the teleworking conditions,</li><li data-list-item-id="eec8f920725ed9fbd9fd1977e4b4738c7">Decent pay raises this year.</li></ul><p>They go onto state that this is merely their initial reaction, and that they are discussing other strikes, presumably for longer periods or at other Ubisoft studios in France.</p><blockquote><p>It is out of the question to let a boss run wild and destroy our working conditions. Perhaps we need to remind him that it is his employees who make the games.</p></blockquote><p>This is the latest bit of difficulty for Ubisoft who is attempting to rebuild following some difficult fiscal periods. Only a couple days ago former <em>Assassin's Creed</em> boss Marc-Alexis Côté announced he was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-assassins-creed-boss-suing-ubisoft" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="da42bb57-e4f1-4a65-91eb-9ce61dfcfee5" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">suing Ubisoft </a>for over $1.3m following his 'constructive dismissal', which caused him to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-boss-leaves-ubisoft-report" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="bedd26ab-2db9-443d-9a58-5d57561ce134" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">leave the company in October of 2025</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>That was tied to their organization into 'creative houses' which seems to have been partially done to get investment in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-creative-houses-q1-financials" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="acd9f3a1-9a63-4e42-9b91-122a243964e9" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Vantage Studios</a>, which will be managing Ubisoft's largest three IPs: <em>Assassin's Creed</em>, <em>Far Cry</em>, and <em>Rainbow Six</em>.

<p>The co-lead designer of Starfield is sharing his thoughts on the problems the game encountered.</p>



<p>Kurt Kuhlmann, once known for his work on the Elder Scrolls series for Bethesda, was also co-lead designer of Starfield. Now, he’s discussing some of the difficulties the team faced during the production and development of Starfield and comparing them to his work on The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim.</p>







<h2 id="h-kuhlmann-feels-starfield-failed-to-come-together-as-a-cohesive-game">Kuhlmann Feels Starfield Failed to Come Together as a Cohesive Game</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-elder-scrolls/skyrims-co-lead-designer-says-starfields-main-problem-is-that-it-never-fully-cohered-as-a-game-it-was-a-releasable-game-but-it-wasnt-the-best/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Speaking with PC Gamer</a>, Kurt Kuhlmann explained that, when the game released, he felt it was a good game and suitable for release, but not a great one. He mentions that within Bethesda, some were surprised the game failed to win over players.</p>



<p>One advantage Starfield had was its smoother launch compared to Fallout 76, and Kuhlmann says that difference is why Bethesda gave it so much development time.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“When it came out, I thought it was a good game,” says Kuhlmann. “It was a releasable game, but it wasn’t the best.… </p>



<p>“We had tried to take this huge leap into this new genre with all these new systems and things … I don’t know that you should expect that if you jump into the space combat genre that you’re going to be better or as good as games that just do that, and have maybe been doing it for multiple iterations, right? Like, it was good enough. It wasn’t, like, embarrassing.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Kurt Kuhlmann also recently discussed his decision to leave Bethesda and his vision for the sixth Elder Scrolls game.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-2-movie-remake-theater-release-january-2026-1851784778"><em>Return to Silent Hill,</em></a> a live-action film adaptation of Konami’s beloved <em>Silent Hill 2</em>, hits theaters later this week. Early reviews for the horror flick are as scary as any monster from the games.</p> <p>First announced in 2022, <a href="https://kotaku.com/return-to-silent-hill-pyramid-head-first-look-1851482793"><em>Return to Silent Hill</em></a> releases on January 23. It isn’t connected to the past two <em>Silent Hill</em> movies, even though it was directed by the first film’s Christophe Gans, and is instead a loose adaptation of the PS2-era survival horror classic<em> Silent Hill 2.</em> Marketing for this film has been minimal to say the least, partially because it seems the executives involved realized it wasn’t great back when it wrapped filming in 2023, and the movie is only seeing the light of day after that recent <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake did so well. But after the delay and the lack of marketing, perhaps this is a very good horror film? Nope. Doesn’t seem like it.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000661969" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000661969"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000661969">©Rotten Tomatoes / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/return_to_silent_hill">As of January 21, there are 15 reviews for <em>Return to Silent Hill</em></a> on critic aggregator Rotten Tomatoes. And the new movie has an abysmal seven percent Tomatometer score. For those not familiar with Rotten Tomatoes, that ain’t a great score. In fact, if this seven percent score holds, <a href="https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/guide/worst-movies-of-all-time/"><em>Return to Silent Hill</em> will go down as one of the worst-reviewed movies ever</a>. Yikes.</p>

 <p>The general consensus from critics is that while parts of <em>Return to Silent Hill</em> look great, the film is a boring, sloppy, confusing, and (perhaps worst of all for the genre) not-very-scary movie about a main character that is hard to relate to and who seems more confused than terrified.</p>  <p>“This powerful survival horror story has been turned into an ugly, laughable adaptation that proves that maybe we should’ve never gone back to Silent Hill,” said Ross Bonaime over at <em>Collider</em>.</p>

 <p>“Christophe Gans’s film does away with all the psychosexual nuance of <em>Silent Hill 2</em>,” claims Justin Clark at <em>Slant Magazine.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>“I found the experience difficult to sit through and nonsensical from moment to moment, with its confounding story and shoddy CGI matched only by its lack of entertainment value,” said critic Brian Eggert.</p>

 <p>At the moment, there is only one non-rotten score, from Dominic Baez at the <em>Seattle Times</em>, and it doesn’t read like a loving endorsement of the movie. Instead, it seems like Baez found most of the movie bad, but enjoyed the ending. The end credits are apparently very “stylish.” When critics are praising your credits and not much else, that’s a bad sign.</p>

<p>Three classic Far Cry games are now officially playable at 60 frames per second, thanks to a new update on January 21.</p>



<p>A trailer for Far Cry 3: Classic Edition, which received a 60FPS update, had previously surfaced, and the team behind the game teased similar updates for Far Cry Primal and Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon. Now, <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/4MfNeJwzHOgosbS4JfJZ39/3-far-cry-classics-now-run-at-60fps-on-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ubisoft has announced that </a>updates enabling all three games to run at 60FPS are available on all current-gen consoles. </p>



<p>Additionally, all three games are heavily discounted on the PlayStation Store until February 4. Far Cry 3 and Far Cry Primal (Apex Edition) are 75% off, while Blood Dragon is 60% off.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Far Cry 3, Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon, and Far Cry Primal will now run at 60 frames per second (FPS) on PS5, PS5 Pro, and Xbox Series X|S, thanks to a slate of free updates delivered today. As chaos erupts in the Rook Islands, the dystopian future of 2007, and across the Stone Age, the updated frame rate gives players a smoother experience and allows the beautiful (or desolate) locations to shine all the brighter.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In addition to being available for purchase, all three titles are playable on PC with Ubisoft+, on Xbox via Ubisoft+ Premium or Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, and on PlayStation through PlayStation Plus Premium or Extra.</p>

    <p><span>Wrestling star Kenny Omega revealed as motion capture actor.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><em><a title="Games > Street Fighter 6 [53 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a></em> downloadable content character Alex will launch on March 17, <a title="Companies > Capcom [2,648 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/capcom">Capcom</a> announced. <a title="Genres > Wrestling [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/wrestling">Wrestling</a> star Kenny Omega is the motion capture actor behind Alex’s signature moves. <span id="more-1020231"></span></p><p>Get the latest details below.</p><blockquote><p>Alex kicked off his fighting career as the protagonist of <em>Street Fighter III: New Generation</em> in 1997. Since then, his brash disposition has earned him the moniker The Man with No Allies whenever he steps into the ring. After more time refining his technique, Alex has added a new stance, over 10 throws, and new moves that transition seamlessly into one another to make him a fighting force whether he’s in the ring or on the streets.</p><p>As shown in the gameplay trailer, Alex’s fierce wrestling techniques include:</p><ul><li><strong>Flash Axe</strong> – A rapid attack with light and medium options. The light version is a great combo ender whereas the medium can transition into Prowler Stance upon hit.</li><li><strong>Flash Chop</strong> – When this bodacious heavy strike hits on the ground, the opponent will be opened up to a follow-up grab like Power Bomb or Oblique Stomp for some wicked damage. The <a title="Games > OD [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/od">OD</a> version allows Alex to transition to Prowler Stance on hit.</li><li><strong>Aerial Knee Smash</strong> – A fantastic anti-air technique as Alex jumps into the air and slams his opponent into the ground with his knee.</li><li><strong>Power Bomb</strong> – Alex’s signature move comes with light, medium, and heavy variations, which all deal the same damage while offering other unique benefits.</li><li><strong>Prowler Stance</strong> – Alex forfeits the ability to block while in this stance, but gains 11 different follow-up options to mix-up his opponent. For example, if you land Sweep Combination (Target Combo), Hyper Takedown (Throw), or Dangerous Armbar (Throw) on a Punish Counter, they’ll transition into Flying Suplex, Death Valley Bomb, and Spiral DDT respectively.</li><li><strong>Raging Spear</strong> – Alex’s Level 1 Super Art has him spring forward with a devastating tackle. This move is invincible on start-up to both strikes and throws and can also be used in combos.</li><li><strong>Sledgecross Hammer</strong> – Alex’s Level 2 Super Art crushes opponents with a devastating lariat that can wall splat if it hits an airborne opponent and has some invincibility from projectiles.</li><li><strong>Omega Wing Buster</strong> – Alex has another Level 2 Super Art following a successful OD Power Drop where Alex can transition into Omega Wing Buster. If this move looks familiar it might be because wrestling superstar Kenny Omega performed this move’s motion capture for Alex!</li><li><strong>The Final Prison</strong> – Alex’s Level 3 Super Art The Final Prison has four different animations! The wrestler chokes the opponent out with a series of phenomenal grappling moves. There’s the normal Level 3 version, the Level 3 version that results in a K.O., the normal CA version, and a CA version that ends in a K.O.</li></ul><p>Alex will be unlocked and ready to throw down for players who own or purchase the Year 3 Character Pass or Year 3 Ultimate Pass on March 17. Alex’s Outfit 1 reflects his role as the Dark Devil of the ring, while Outfit 2 reflects a more classic look from <em>Street Fighter III</em>. Stay tuned for the full release of Alex’s theme song “GO! ALEX! Hope is Born!” composed by anime song super band JAM Project, which can be heard in the gameplay trailer.</p><!-- AD: content -->

            <p>
You ever accidentally find out that you're the sovereign of an entire nation as dictated by a prophecy even though you're technically just random nobody, and so you wind-up being the one to have to make all the decisions about how your nation is run? No? Well, that's fine, but if you'd like that to be you, I'll introduce you to Sovereign Tower, a management <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> where you send off your knights of the round table to deal with all manner of quests.
</p>
<p>
From the devs behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rally-point-the-wonderful-vibes-of-aetheris-are-a-hint-about-its-design-goals">Aetheris</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2447980/Crown_Gambit/">Crown Gambit</a>, Sovereign Crown is a funny little game (I've had a taste of it through its demo on <a href="https://wildwits.itch.io/sovereign-tower">itch.io</a>, which you can try out for yourself). It's not quite like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/reigns">Reigns</a>, but it bears some similarities. In your throne room, you attend to the requests of your people, neighbouring nations, and prospective knights, having to make careful decisions about the quests offered by the first two. These range from a stinky jester too terrified by a goose terrorising the local baths, or a blacksmith who's misplaced her hammer.
</p>

<p>
When a quest is accepted, you can then send off one of your knights to attempt to complete it, each with their own unique stats (and personalities) that may be better suited to more tasks than others. One knight is an ostentatious bellend who constantly shimmers gold, another is a nervous, accident prone woman, and the other just kind of straight up a goth, but medievally so, all of which are differently socially awkward in a charming way. There's a lot of tongue-in-cheek, sarcastic, irreverent humour to be found here, sold all the better by an art direction that you kind easily find in some French comic book you've never heard of that's just absolutely gorgeous.
</p>
<p>
You also don't have all that long to wait for it! As it's slated for an August release later this year, which is quite nifty. While you wait, you can also wishlist it on Steam right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4113940/Sovereign_Tower/">here</a>.

<p>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 continues to make headlines as the longest-in-development title ever, having been in development since its reveal on May 30, 2008, with a total of 6445 days at the time of writing, or, for those who hate math,&nbsp;17 years, 7 months, and 22 days. </p>



<p>However, the current version of the game has been in development since around 2017, which still means a good 8-9 years of development.</p>



<p>Regardless of records and long-ass development timelines, though, Ubisoft still thinks that Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 has something to give. Despite the recent restructuring that has seen six games cancelled, including the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake</a>, sources tell Insider Gaming that Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 is still in active development, at least for the time being.</p>



<p>In 2023, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/beyond-good-and-evil-2-studio-sees-major-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 saw significant changes</a> with Ubisoft Montpellier being under investigation “over an unprecedented number of developers experiencing burnout and going on sick leave.”</p>



<p>According to sources, constant changes, pushbacks, and the lengthy development time have likely cost Ubisoft $500+ million in development costs. But, at least for the time being, Ubisoft feels like it’s a cost that is justified.</p>







<div><p>As for when Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 will release, it’s anyone’s guess, but it’s possible the game still won’t be seen for a number of years.</p><p>What do you think of Beyond Good and Evil 2 still being in development after so long? &nbsp;Leave your thoughts down below, and join the discussion in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord</a>.</p></div>

<p>The Sonic the Hedgehog team has unveiled a new audio drama that leans into a noir-inspired atmosphere.</p>



<p>On January 20, the Sonic the Hedgehog YouTube channel <a href="https://youtu.be/BftIr01R0uU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">released a trailer</a> for a new audio drama titled “The Chaotix Casefiles,” launching on January 27 on various podcast platforms. The series centers on Vector the Crocodile, Espio the Chameleon, and Charmy Bee, who run the Chaotix Detective Agency. The series also teases appearances from Sonic and Dr. Eggman.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The world of Sonic the Hedgehog has been thrust into a not-so-dark, not-so-stormy, hard-boiled detective story that probably nobody saw coming. This show has it all. Massive mystery, investigative intrigue, and saxophone. Lots and lots of saxophone.</p>



<p>Follow Sonic and the intrepid Chaotix Detective Agency as they take on their biggest case yet. This high-flying, action-packed adventure will take them across the world, fighting for every clue they can find. It’s one heck of a tale. Which is good, because this story might be the only thing that can save their lives.</p>



<p>All will be revealed in Sonic the Hedgehog Presents: The Chaotix Casefiles. Coming soon to wherever you get your podcasts.</p>

<h2 id="h-sonic-the-hedgehog-is-celebrating-its-35th-anniversary">Sonic the Hedgehog is Celebrating its 35th Anniversary</h2>



<p>The brand management team behind the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise kicked off the year with a trailer revealing that 2021 would be a big celebration of the 35th anniversary of Sonic the Hedgehog’s debut on the Sega Genesis in 1991. It appears that this audio drama is the first of much more content to come.</p>



<div><p>As for the Chaotix Detective Agency, the Chaotix first appeared on the Sega 32X in a game helmed by Knuckles the Echidna in 1994. However, beginning with Sonic Heroes in 2004, the trio began making more regular appearances as fan-favorite auxiliary characters in the series.</p><p>Now, they’re getting their own hard-boiled spotlight in this upcoming podcast, beginning January 27.</p></div>

<p>On January 20, 2026, Nintendo shadow-dropped a free update to Donkey Kong Country Returns HD.</p>



<p>Donkey Kong Country Returns originally launched on the Nintendo Wii over a decade ago, was later ported to the Nintendo 3DS, and an updated version of the game arrived on the original Nintendo Switch in early 2025. However, the new free update went live this week, adding new game modes, enhanced visuals, and a new playable character. </p>







<h2 id="h-dixie-kong-finally-arrives-in-donkey-kong-country-returns">Dixie Kong Finally Arrives in Donkey Kong Country Returns</h2>



<p>When Donkey Kong Country Returns first arrived on the Nintendo Wii in 2010, it was heralded as a return to the glory days of the Donkey Kong series on the Super Nintendo. However, while Diddy Kong was originally a playable sidekick, Dixie Kong was absent from the games until Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze was released on the Nintendo Wii U.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/a-free-update-is-out-now-waitaminute-is-that-dixie-kong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Now, the new free update</a> to Donkey Kong Country Returns HD for the Nintendo Switch family of consoles adds a playable Dixie Kong for the first time. Instead of using Diddy’s jetpack to fly through the air, players will be able to use Dixie Kong’s Helicopter Spin.</p>



<p>Additionally, the free update boasts enhanced visuals and resolution, as well as faster load times, specifically for the Nintendo Switch 2. GameShare is also supported on the Nintendo Switch 2, allowing players to play with a friend who doesn’t have the game via a local wireless connection. There’s also a new Turbo Attack Mode that serves as a time trial.</p>







<h2 id="h-donkey-kong-s-moment-in-the-sun">Donkey Kong’s Moment in the Sun</h2>



<p>Ever since the release of the Nintendo Switch 2, Nintendo’s oldest mascot and the leader of the bunch, Donkey Kong, has been back front and center in the first year of the new Switch. Donkey Kong Bananza was the first standout 3D platformer of the new console, featuring DK’s redesign and the return of King K. Rool.</p>



<p>DK is also featured in Mario Kart World and is slated to be a major focal point of the campaign mode in Mario Tennis Fever. That game is slated to feature<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-unveils-new-features-and-characters-in-mario-tennis-fever-gameplay-overview-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> the largest roster in series history</a>. Learn more about that here. While players are still await news of the next major Mario game, there’s plenty of Donkey Kong to hold Nintendo fans over.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-dlc-sees-surge-of-negative-steam-reviews-thanks-to-its-baffling-new-map-full-of-bottomless-pits</link>
            <guid>1412551</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Elden Ring: Nightreign's DLC, The Forsaken Hollows, has been out for a month and a half now, which means players have had plenty of time to get used to its two new Nightfarers, two new end bosses, and numerous new night bosses. But one element of the new content that everyone is still really struggling with, even after weeks of practice: the new DLC map. It's really difficult, <em>really</em> confusing, and seemingly no one likes it that much, leading to a rash of negative Steam reviews and a lot of failed runs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The new map is technically not even a new <em>map</em>, though it may as well be. It's a Shifting Earth event, meaning it may or may not be active at any given time when you're playing a DLC boss, with other options being the default map or one of four other Shifting Earths available. However, unlike the other Shifting Earth events, which only transform one part of the map significantly, the Great Hollow shifting earth essentially is a totally different area. <em>Nothing</em> is the same. There's no castle at the center, no ravine running down the middle, no lake in the south or cliffs up north.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Instead, the Great Hollow is centered around a giant crystal in the middle which seems to have crashlanded, splitting the land around it into broken up cliffs separated into multiple levels. Built into and scattered around the cliffs and canyons are various ruins full of enemies, alongside the more familiar structures such as churches, forts, and mines. The actual in-game map of the Great Hollow has multiple levels with different points of interest on each level, and it's necessary to use the game's spirit springs carefully to fall down to lower levels and shoot back up to higher ones so you can actually get around effectively.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, the Great Hollow's center crystal contains a major buff for the party that can be seriously clutch for a round's final boss fights. But in order to obtain it, you need to find and break several smaller, colored crystals scattered around the map, whose locations change on each attempt.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So why is this causing everyone so much pain? Well, for one, because of the multi-level map, it's far more difficult to tell at a glance what route you should take on a given run. Normally, as you're flying into a new game, you'll pop the map open and give it a brief scan, mentally planning out a route that will ideally give your team a few extra flasks, a mine for a smithing stone, and a gradually more challenging line of boss encounters so you can collect runes and weapons and level up. In the Great Hollow, there are so many different vertical levels to account for, plus multiple map levels to swap between, that it's even more difficult to route a run and make a plan that will actually see your team effectively get stronger over the course of two nights. And that's only exacerbated by the need to account for breaking crystals as you go, without knowing where they're going to end up until the second day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But by far the worst thing about Great Hollow is the giant, gaping chasm running through the middle of it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlike Elden Ring, Nightreign doesn't have fall damage. This was a big point of difference in gameplay style when it first launched, as Nightreign encourages players to sprint across maps, leap off ledges, and even climb up the sides of cliffs. Elden Ring, by contrast, favors a somewhat slower, more cautious playstyle. So over the last year, a lot of Elden Ring players have slowly adjusted to Nightreign's rhythm of running and jumping without a lot of hesitancy, and by and large, that's worked out well for them, because there really aren't many places where falling in Nightreign is dangerous. You can technically fall off the outside edge of the map, and the Crater Shifting Earth does have a big lava pit that's not great to fall into, but both of those are fairly simple to avoid.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Great Hollow, by contrast, has a death pit running down parts of the middle of the map, and it's <em>annoyingly hard to see.</em> Because of how the ledges are positioned, it's easy to look over a ledge, think you're good to jump down, and end up falling to your death. What's worse, for some reason Nightreign doesn't treat death falls the same way it treats deaths to enemies. If an enemy kills you, you just spawn back at the last Grace you tapped, and your leftover Runes are either dropped near where you died or picked up by a nearby enemy. But when you fall, Nightreign will seemingly randomly drop you somewhere along a ledge near your death point, which could be above, below, or across from where you jumped off. But then it leaves your Runes back on the ledge where you started. Which means it's possible (and even likely) that you'll spawn on a far ledge, with your Runes somewhere behind you across a death pit, and no easy route back.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whew! All this is to say that the Great Hollow, while aesthetically beautiful and thematically cool, is kind of a pain in the neck, and Steam reviewers are trying to let FromSoftware know. While Elden Ring: Nightreign itself has mostly positive reviews, Forsaken Hollows is currently sitting at Mostly Negative reviews for the last 30 days, with only 30% of 1,347 reviews this past month being positive. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Elden Ring Nightreign Review Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"The new map is poorly designed, overly difficult and boring," reads one review from today. "Takes forever to traverse, interesting points of interest are often too deep into the edge of the map to get through completely, boss battle tower is a damage-sponge time-wasting chore. New dlc pois in new and old map are full of enemy encounters designed to cheese you like it's darksouls. Spend hours learning and memorizing crystal locations from youtube videos just so you can try to not lose in a bad map. Underground ruins filled with a dozen rot kindred that homing one shot you."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another reads: "The characters and bosses are great but the new "map" is absolutely horrible and is ruining the experience of the game as a whole."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And a third: "Love the bosses and new classes but the new map is just trash. There was Zero NEED to add gaps in the map to kill YOU. You might as well add fall damage to the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"That map is NOT FUN!!! It's a freaking chore. I avoided it completely until I am forced to play it to compete certain story lines.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I am now forced to spend hours memorising the bloody thing because you will literally end up locations you cannot get out because the only bridge is light years away.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"An otherwise great DLC ruined by this nonsense map. EITHER GET RID OF THE MAP, MAKE IT OPTIONAL OR COVER THE GIANT HOLES."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I also spotted a recent positive review that simply read, "the new map is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ terrible but everything's so good."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not everyone hates the map, and some FromSoftware fans are pointing out that this may be a bit of a skill issue. A recent Reddit thread about the Steam reviews states, "The more I play, the more I feel like it was fantastically designed." And the replies themselves seem divided between acknowledging its flaws and celebrating what they love about it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As someone who spent last night falling into chasms on this map, I can see both points here. Great Hollow really is beautiful and unique, requiring a very different gameplay flow and better team coordination so you don't all end up separated and confused. But it's pretty challenging to learn, and the only way to learn really is to fail at it a lot. After already putting over 100 hours into Nightreign, I'm not having the best time simultaneously trying to learn all the new bosses, two new characters, <em>and</em> the new map simultaneously - though, I guess you could argue, that's just the FromSoftware experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Probably a fix for where the game places you after you fall, and maybe a little bit more clarity on the minimap would solve some of this. We'll keep an eye out for a Nightreign patch to address it. But in the meantime, just keep practicing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This isn't the first time Nightreign players have used Steam reviews to express their displeasure. Last November, a wave of review bombs <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fromsoftware-parent-company-confirms-elden-ring-nightreign-dlc-by-end-of-march-2026-as-frustrated-players-leave-negative-steam-reviews">complained about the lack of DLC content</a>, just weeks before <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-gets-its-first-dlc-next-month">Forsaken Hollows was announced and released</a>. A <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-1032-buffs-all-the-worst-nightfarers">more recent patch last week</a> has given some of the Nightfarers who were struggling much-needed buffs.

            <title><![CDATA[Following Layoffs And Cancellations, Ubisoft Announces More Layoffs And Cancellations]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/ubisoft-layoffs-prince-of-persia-remake-canceled/</link>
            <guid>1412542</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>We’ve just crested the hill of 2026’s third week, and <a href="https://aftermath.site/ubisoft-halifax-closed-weeks-after-unionizing-cwa-canada/"><u>once</u></a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/meta-ubisoft-unity-layoffs-2026/"><u>again</u></a>, it’s time for another helping of dire Ubisoft news. Making previous weeks’ layoffs look like mere throat clearing, the company today announced a “major organizational, operational and portfolio reset” that will result in more layoffs, as well as delays and cancellations – most prominently of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-delay-ubisoft-1850470554?ref=aftermath.site"><u>long-embattled <em>Prince of Persia</em> remake</u></a>, which is now dust in the wind. But on the bright side, we’re also getting something no one asked for: a greater investment in "player-facing Generative AI.” Oh, and more live service swings from the publisher that has repeatedly failed to get out of its own way with <a href="https://aftermath.site/ubisoft-xdefiant-shutdown-studio-closure-layoffs/"><u>games like <em>XDefiant</em></u></a><em> </em>and <em>Skull and Bones</em>.</p><p>In <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/59b4Z0RNls45UDTVV6gBNR/801a91a599b337779106af51cf08e539/Ubisoft_Jan_PR_draft_vF.pdf?ref=aftermath.site"><u>a release published today</u></a>, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot – who remains in charge despite demonstrably no longer being the man for the job – announced the formation of five “creative houses” that will each focus on specific genres and series. These sound significantly more self-contained than the global, multi-studio efforts that defined Ubisoft’s previous era. They will break down as follows:</p><blockquote>- CH1 (Vantage Studios), focused on scaling and extending Ubisoft’s largest and established franchises to turn them into annual billionaire brands; Brands: <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, <em>Far Cry</em>, <em>Rainbow Six</em></blockquote><blockquote>- CH2 dedicated to competitive and cooperative shooter experiences; Brands including <em>The Division</em>, <em>Ghost Recon</em>, <em>Splinter Cell</em></blockquote><blockquote>- CH3 designed to operate a roster of select, sharp Live experiences; Brands including <em>For Honor</em>, <em>The Crew</em>, <em>Riders Republic</em>, <em>Brawlhalla</em>, <em>Skull &amp; Bones</em></blockquote><blockquote>- CH4 dedicated to immersive fantasy worlds and narrative-driven universes; Brands including <em>Anno</em>, <em>Might &amp; Magic</em>, <em>Rayman</em>, <em>Prince of Persia</em>, <em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil</em></blockquote><blockquote>- CH5 focused on reclaiming position in casual and family-friendly games. Brands including <em>Just Dance</em>,<em> Idle Miner Tycoon</em>, <em>Ketchapp</em>, <em>Hungry Shark</em>,<em> Invincible: Guarding the Globe</em>, <em>Uno</em>, Hasbro</blockquote><p>Each creative house will have “end-to-end responsibility for its portfolio, overseeing the full creative and brand scope from development to publishing (brand, marketing and sales go-to-market strategy)” and “will also be financially accountable, both in terms of [profit and loss] and cash generation.” Ubisoft believes this still-convoluted-sounding structure will “sharpen strategic focus, reinforce execution discipline, and ensure that investment decisions will be taken closer to where value is created.” I guess we’ll see!</p><p>Vantage, you’ll remember, was formed last year in conjunction with Tencent, from which Ubisoft <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-tencent-assassins-creed-far-cry-rainbow-six-1851772796?ref=aftermath.site"><u>received a $1.25 billion bailout</u></a>. One of its co-CEOs is Guillemot’s son, who is <a href="https://aftermath.site/ubisoft-tencent-subsidiary-ceo-charlie-guillemot/"><u>definitely not a nepo baby</u></a>. All of this reshuffling will come at a steep cost – to people who are not part of the Guillemot family, of course.</p><p>“To put the Creative Houses in the best conditions to succeed, we decided to refocus our portfolio with a meaningfully revised 3-year roadmap and accelerate our cost reductions initiatives to rightsize the organization,” Guillemot wrote. “We will discontinue several projects currently in development and provide additional time to certain games, to ensure enhanced quality and maximize long term value. We will also selectively close several studios and continue restructurings throughout the Group. While these decisions are difficult, they are necessary for us to build a more focused, efficient and sustainable organization over the long term.”</p><p>A total of six games have been canceled, including <em>Prince of Persia</em> and four unannounced games, three of which were new IP. Definitely a sign of a company with <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-layoffs-franchises-ip-sony-ea/"><u>a bright, bold future</u></a> ahead of it! Four new IPs remain in development, while seven games have been delayed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It’s not clear yet how many people will be laid off – in addition to those who already lost their jobs earlier this month – but the damage will likely be significant. As <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/stephentotilo.bsky.social/post/3mcxcxiwki22r?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Game File’s Stephen Totilo pointed out</u></a>, a previous €300 million cost reduction plan has resulted in a total headcount decline of over 3,000 at Ubisoft. Now the company is planning for €200 million more in cuts by March 2028.&nbsp;</p><p>Employees who manage to dodge the scythe might still end up leaving of (what could charitably be called) their own accord, as Ubisoft is also largely putting an end to remote work.</p><p>“To support the effective implementation and operation of this new model, the Group also intends to return to five days per week on site for all teams, complemented by an annual allowance of working-from-home days,” Ubisoft wrote. “This evolution is intended to strengthen collaboration, including constant knowledge sharing, and the collective dynamic across teams.”</p><p>Game workers at other companies have referred to this approach as a form of “<a href="https://aftermath.site/activision-workers-speak-out-against-return-to-office-mandate-that-they-see-as-soft-layoffs/"><u>soft layoff</u></a>” that disproportionately targets disabled and immunocompromised people, but maybe things will be different at Ubisoft, a company that has repeatedly <a href="https://aftermath.site/ubisoft-ai-teammates-im-so-tired/"><u>stepped on rakes</u></a> while trying to follow the rest of the industry. That in mind, I’d like to close out with a selection of recent headlines about Ubisoft.

            <guid>1412539</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Three of game studio That's No Moon's co-founders are suing another co-founder for allegedly hijacking the company’s website domain name—taking the website offline and disabling employee access to email accounts, <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/985076973/That-s-No-Moon-Ex-CEO-Hijacked-Domain-Other-Founders-Say-In-Lawsuit-via-Aftermath?ref=aftermath.site"><u>according to a new lawsuit</u></a>.</p><p>Tina Kowalewski, Taylor Kurosaki, and Nick Kononelos filed a complaint against co-founder and former CEO Michael Mumbauer on Tuesday in a California court. That's No Moon, which was founded in 2020 by veterans of Infinity Ward, Naughty Dog, and other AAA studios, said in its complaint that Mumbauer is looking to "cripple" the studio after being fired in 2022. "[Mumbauer]—resentful about his termination—has waged a harassment campaign that has included threatening a TNM executive and their family and sporadic but persistent efforts to cripple TNM's business."</p><p>Mumbauer, according to the complaint, purchased the domain name, and several others, when the studio was founded; it said both parties agreed these would be controlled by the studio. Mumbauer allegedly still has access to the domains, and That's No Moon said he took control over the website on Jan. 6, disabled the studio's access, and turned off employees’ ability to email external addresses. The team was locked out for two days as a four-person IT team worked to get the services back online.&nbsp;</p><p>On the public-facing side, the website briefly redirected to the Travel Switzerland page, according to the complaint. That's No Moon's lawyers said the co-founders sent Mumbauer a letter on Jan. 7 demanding he "relinquish his unauthorized access." That's when, according to the compliant, the website started redirecting to a GoDaddy Auction site, where the domain was priced at $6,666,666; That's No Moon remarked in the complaint: "A number that [Mumbauer] may well have selected for its Satanic connotation."</p><p>As of Wednesday, Aftermath was able to access a public-facing That's No Moon website using both the original domain and the new one. That's No Moon did not respond to Aftermath's request for comment by time of publishing.</p><p>"Business partners, gamers, and employee candidates were left wondering whether TNM had simply shut down, or whether the company had fired executives who were suddenly unreachable by e-mail," lawyers wrote in the complaint. That's No Moon also said in the complaint that the email lockout interrupted communications with HR providers, "resulting in missed payroll reminders and invoices."</p><p>That's No Moon immediately created a new domain (ThatsNoMoon.co) and moved its website over, per the complaint. This whole debacle, allegedly, cost the company more than $1 million in January—and, as of the complaint's filing on Tuesday, Mumbauer allegedly still has control over the domain. That's why the studio is asking to get back access and for damages related to the costs of the new domains and other harm. Per the complaint, the original domain names cost around $2,836, which That's No Moon said it reimbursed Mumbauer for.</p><p>That's No Moon fired Mumbauer in 2022, it said, because he "leaked confidential and sensitive information to the media and to competitors." After leaving That's No Moon, Mumbauer allegedly denied requests from the That's No Moon IT team to hand over the domain access. The company tried to get access from an arbitrator in 2023, but was denied because of a lack of trademark registrations.</p><p>Lawyers said Mumbauer had been harassing the company and its executives for years, and that they and their families "fear for their safety." From the complaint:</p><p><em>Following his termination from TNM in 2022, Defendant posted disruptive comments on social media alluding to the company and team members. He threatened litigation against TNM over fabricated claims about his termination. Even more significantly, he threatened a member of the TNM leadership team whom he blames for his departure through text messages. In one instance, Defendant texted the executive, “This is not going to end well for you. Trust me.” Defendant has continued to send threatening texts as late as last year—over three years after his termination. On information and belief, Defendant used an unknown phone number to contact the executive on April 24, 2025, texting, “Hope your family is well. They deserve all the stability you can provide Brute,” followed by a winking emoji. Moreover, Defendant revealed TNM’s confidential business information on multiple different occasions, violating the NDA he had signed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p><p>The charges listed as part of this lawsuit are trademark infringement, cybersquatting, computer fraud, conversion, trespass to chattels, and breach of contract. That's No Moon also asked a judge for a temporary restraining order to prevent Mumbauer from continued access to the domains.</p><p>Mumbauer has not responded to Aftermath's request for comment. Mumbauer said, in an email to That's No Moon attorney Amit Rana published as part of the lawsuit, that he intends to file "a wrongful termination countersuit and will be seeking extensive damages."</p><p>That's No Moon was founded in 2020 <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/why-smilegate-poured-usd100m-into-thats-no-moon-and-its-aaa-veterans?ref=aftermath.site"><u>and formally announced in 2021</u></a>. It billed itself as a triple A studio from veteran developers from studios like Infinity Ward, Bungie, Sony Santa Monica, and Naughty Dog developers. That's No Moon hasn't yet announced its first game, but has said the game is led by creative director Taylor Kurosaki and game director Jacob Minkoff. South Korean publisher Smilegate invested $100 million into the company, That's No Moon announced in 2021. The company said, in its announcement in 2021, that it hoped to reach 100 employees by 2022. It’s listed as having 51 to 200 employees <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/thats-no-moon-entertainment/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>on LinkedIn</u></a> and, though it’s been publicly quiet for several years, appears to be hiring.</p><p><strong>Update: </strong>This story has been updated to include additional details.</p>

A new Kickstarter will transform your Switch 2 dock into an old-school GameCube. And two people who worked on <em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em> argue about what’s to blame for modern VFX looking dull and lifeless. It’s a very late edition of Morning Checkpoint,<em> Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news, rumors, and culture.</p> <p>Who’s ready for more bad news for PC gaming?

That could mean even more expensive SSDs. Bad timing for me to replace the PC I built back in 2015 with an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960.</p>

 <h2>No online multiplayer for <em>Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</em></h2> <p>Following in the footsteps of all the previous Lego games, the new<em> Lego Batman</em> won’t have online co-op. “Fans of all generations will be able to enjoy the game solo or team up with a friend or family member through two-player local couch cooperative gameplay only,” <a href="https://legobatmangame.com/faq/">reads the FAQ</a> (via <a href="https://primagames.com/featured/lego-batmans-new-game-once-again-skips-online-co-op">Prima Games</a>).</p> <h2>Turn your Switch 2 into a GameCube</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Battle Dock coming soon! <a href="https://t.co/hRdu7zI6IV">pic.twitter.com/hRdu7zI6IV</a></p> <p>— Retro Fighters (@retrofightersco) <a href="https://twitter.com/retrofightersco/status/2013382477923111083?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 19, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>A new dock <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1247448559/battledock-for-switch-2">on Kickstarter</a> promises to do exactly that. It’s going for $40 with a January ship date and attaches directly to your existing Switch 2 dock. It comes in various old-school GameCube colors like silver, indigo, and orange, and has connectors for up to four of the retro console’s controllers.

 <h2><em>Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties</em> gets a free demo</h2> <p>It’s out today on PC and console, including Switch 2, and lets players experience a bit of the Ryukyu district in Okinawa as Kiryu and the series’ familiar Kamurocho setting in Tokyo as Mine.

I can guarantee that the artists working on big blockbuster VFX films like <em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em> 10-15 years ago could only dream about having a tool as powerful as Unreal Engine on their desks to help them get the job done.

<p>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is his final game</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="11af1244f7a70"><a title="Samus" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/11af1244f7a70/samus.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Kensuke Tanabe, veteran producer at Nintendo who became known for his work on the <strong>Metroid Prime</strong> series, has reportedly announced his retirement.</p>
<p>As covered by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/veteran-nintendo-producer-kensuke-tanabe-known-for-metroid-and-paper-mario-reportedly-confirms-retirement/">VGC</a>, Tanabe's announcement comes via an interview with the Japanese magazine <a href="https://www.ndw.jp/category/news/">Nintendo Dream</a>, which has been uploaded online by a user on <a href="https://weibo.com/ttarticle/p/show?id=2309405257646218805574">Weibo</a>. Tanabe states that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> was to be his final game at the company, with his protégé producer Risa Tabata succeeding him should another Prime game be made in the future.</p>
<p>Tabata's first game with Nintendo was, coincidentally, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metroid_prime">Metroid Prime</a> on the GameCube. She has since worked as an assistant producer on titles such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/donkey_kong_country_returns">Donkey Kong Country Returns</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/paper_mario_color_splash">Paper Mario: Color Splash</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/paper_mario_the_thousand-year_door">The Thousand-Year Door</a> on Switch.</p><div><figure data-videoid="6TAq6m9hxyY" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt6TAq6m9hxyY" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed76f4cezpiqng&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>As for Tanabe, he reportedly states in the interview that he had wanted to create a Metroid title focused on Samus and Sylux since dropping subtle hints in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/metroid_prime_3_corruption">Prime 3: Corruption</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/metroid_prime_federation_force">Federation Force</a>. Realising that Prime 4: Beyond might be his last shot to do this, he decided to make it the first entry in the Sylux saga.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I envisioned Sylux as a dark, resentful villain who resorts to underhanded tactics. After this game, Samus would realize that a direct confrontation with him is inevitable – she must defeat him completely.</p>
<p>“That’s why the final showdown between Sylux and Samus remains unfinished. However, completing this game took far longer than anticipated.</p>
<p>“Furthermore, I have confirmed that I will no longer be involved in the production of the series moving forward. Whether a sequel will be made is still uncertain, but I sincerely hope that one day, Ms Tabata and Retro Studios will be able to tell this story completely and bring it to a close.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tanabe leaves behind a remarkable legacy at Nintendo. His first game with the company was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros_2">Super Mario Bros. 2</a> in 1987 during which he served as director. Since then, he's transitioned into one of the most prominent producers at the company, working on everything from <strong>Luigi's Mansion</strong> to <strong>WarioWare</strong> and beyond, and we're certain he will be sorely missed.</p>
<p>Thanks for everything, Tanabe-san.</p>

This is probably the umpteenth time I've said I'm not someone who plays many shooters, but here I am saying it again, because an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> has rocked up that has clocked my interest. It's called Firestarters, an arena shooter that's a bit like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/quake">Quake</a>, a bit like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rollerdrome">Rollerdrome</a>, and looks like good, bloody fun.
</p>
<p>
To start with, the setting. Set some time in the future, everyone's favourite livestreamed event is known as STEEL, a "gladiator bloodsport owned and operated by the nation's most notorious crime syndicate." You play as former street delinquent Kera who has to fight for her friends' freedom and to make up for her own past mistakes in said bloodsport. Classic protag stuff!

Mechanically, the shooting looks to be exactly what you'd expect from an FPS, there's guns, you point 'em at some enemies, bada bing, bada boom. There are a few guns available by the looks of things, like dual wielding pistols, a shotgunny thing, and also a not-a-gun-but-a-baseball bat, which can deflect bad guy bullets. The real fun comes from the skate park adjacent level design that sees the arenas dotted with ramps, half-pipes, and grind spots for you to enact some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jet-set-radio">Jet Set Radio</a> roller skating shenanigans on, all while trying to take down the androids you're fighting.
</p><p>
In between matches the story itself is relayed through visual novel style cutscenes, with an appropriately animey look to them. There are two disclaimers I'm thrilled to see in the about section too, one being that no generative AI tools were used to make it ("This game is a specialty product hand-crafted by humans," it notes), and that "This game does not promote smoking or the use of cigarettes. It's only cool when anime girls do it." So true, developer Studio Kerosene.
</p>
<p>
No release date attached to this one apart from sometime this year, but you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3733710/FIRESTARTERS/">wishlist it on Steam</a> in the meantime.
