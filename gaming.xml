			<p>Recently, members of the Spiders game studio spoke out about the mistreatment they were experiencing in a <a href="https://wccftech.com/members-of-spiders-go-on-strike-due-to-issues-within-the-company/">20-page open letter</a> written with the help of a <a href="https://www.stjv.fr/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Open-letter-to-Spiders-management-public-version.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Video Game Workers Union (STJV)</a>. Spiders management has contested these statements, saying they are false and defamatory, potentially damaging the company's interests.</p>
<p>For several months, Spiders' management has consistently discussed negotiations with staff representatives to reach an agreement. However, the dialogue between management and STJV has reached a standstill due to "the radical positions expressed by the STJV." However, today, management gathered all the staff to share the outcome of the discussions and decisions.</p>
<p>First and foremost, wages have been increased. While they received a 6.1% increase in fixed salaries in 2023, new increases will take effect in September 2024. The minimum salary at Spiders was raised by 11%, which did meet the union's request, as the average increase is 3%. Regarding 2025's wages, the negotiations for next year will begin at the end of the year.</p>
<p>Secondly, the agreement between management and the union has established new rules that will apply to most employees and align with the practices that already occur at Spiders. They've stated that "there is no intention to change the working arrangements of employees who are currently working remotely full-time. The management has committed to improving its initial proposal."</p>
<p>In addition to these rules, Spiders' management has announced that they will launch an audit on the working conditions and environment, including an assessment of psychosocial risks. This topic and assessment will be added to the management agenda for the next plenary meeting of the Works Council.</p>
<p>Additionally, management wrote in the statement to remind all Spiders employees that they "are on permanent contracts and that the studio experienced growth in its workforce in 2023, demonstrating its attractiveness within the industry." In 2023, Spiders achieved a score of 94/100 on the gender equality index, with management claiming to ensure that every employee or candidate is treated equally.</p>
<p>To conclude the statement, Spiders management "emphasizes that the working conditions prevailing within the studio do not correspond to the portrayal made by some in the media in an attempt to destabilize the company." According to the statement, the strike call was only followed by a very small minority and in a partial amount. "The management relies on everyone's sense of responsibility to ensure that the quality of dialogue it values and has maintained in the last days is preserved in the future."</p>
<p>Now that Spiders has released this open letter, it remains to be seen whether the union representing the Spiders workers will respond publicly or if they feel that all of their necessary needs have been met.</p>

Often, we’re talking about subscription services such as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-netflix-price-hikes-are-only-part-of-the-problem"><u>Netflix</u></a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hulu-and-disney-plus-price-hikes-are-coming-soon-and-subscribers-arent-happy"><u>Hulu, Disney+</u></a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-raises-price-of-playstation-plus-12-month-subscriptions-across-all-tiers"><u>PlayStation Plus</u></a>, or <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-appears-to-be-getting-another-price-hike"><u>Xbox Game Pass</u></a>. But we’ve also written about multiple price increases on gaming hardware in recent years. The PS5 pricing <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-5-is-getting-a-price-increase-in-europe-canada-mexico-asia-and-australia"><u>jumped everywhere except the United States in 2022</u></a>, and the Xbox Series X <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-series-x-and-game-pass-are-about-to-get-a-little-more-expensive"><u>followed suit one year later</u></a>. Now, we’re watching hardware prices rise yet again – <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-5-gets-steep-price-hike-in-japan-sony-confirms"><u>this time on the PS5 in Japan</u></a>.</p><p>Common as it has become to see costs tick up and up this console generation, Sony’s Japanese price hike comes at a surprising time. Rumors have been swirling for months that the company is on the cusp of announcing and releasing an <em>even more expensive</em> console in a PS5 Pro. Assuming those rumors are founded (and they do seem to be), what’s Sony thinking jacking up console prices before releasing something even more expensive? Will ever-increasing sticker prices impact sales of either box?</p><p>Once again, I asked professional analysts to explain the situation. Here’s what I learned.</p><h2><strong>Why did Sony raise the price of the PS5 in Japan?</strong></h2><p>The answer here is a fairly simple one: economics. I spoke to Kantan Games’ Dr. Serkan Toto, Michael Wagner from Newzoo, and Daniel Ahmad from Niko Partners, and all three agreed that the PS5 price increase in Japan isn’t some sort of harbinger of global price increases to come. “Japan is coming out of literally decades of deflation, prices are generally going up for consumer goods over here, and Sony is simply jumping on that bandwagon.“ Toto explained.</p><p>Ahmad offered more detail in a lengthy post on X/Twitter. He noted that since launch, the cost of a PS5 with a disc drive has increased by 60% and the cost of the all-digital edition has increased by 82.5% in Japan.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>After its launch in 2020, the cost of a PS5 (Disc) has increased by a total of 60% and the PS5 (Digital) has increased by a total of 82.5% in Japan. </p><p>Sony cites a challenging external environment, including fluctuations in the global economy, for the reason behind the three… <a href="https://t.co/uDT32SjkIp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/uDT32SjkIp</a></p></div>— Daniel Ahmad (@ZhugeEX) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZhugeEX/status/1828893834891407695?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 28, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>“Sony cites a challenging external environment, including fluctuations in the global economy, for the reason behind the three price increases,” he continued. “Japan is on the extreme end, but other markets have seen 1 or 2 price increases too, which is unique for console hardware. </p><p>“The weakened yen against the dollar is certainly one reason. In 2020, the PS5 launched for what was the equivalent of $480. Today, that would be equal to $345, hence price increases to what is essentially $550.”</p><p>Ahmad added that crackdowns on exports of Japanese consoles to other markets, especially China, was another likely factor.</p><p>As for what this means for everyone else, Toto and Ahmad confirmed that the price increases were likely limited to the Japanese market for the foreseeable future. And while no one was willing to speculate as to whether we’d see a comparable Xbox console price increase in Japan anytime soon (Xbox <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-series-xs-prices-raised-in-japan"><u>raised the price on the Xbox in Japan already in early 2023</u></a>), Toto and Ahmad both acknowledged that both companies were under economic pressure, and would adjust strategy accordingly.</p><h2><strong>What does this mean for the PS5 Pro?</strong></h2><p>Though there’s been no official announcement yet, there are <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-pro-everything-we-know"><u>a lot of good reasons to believe</u></a> a PS5 Pro upgrade of some sort is imminent. The analysts I spoke to are confident, too. Toto in particular said he has “no doubt” a PS5 Pro is coming. And everyone agreed that a PS5 Pro would obviously be priced higher than the current PS5. As Ahmad said:</p><p>"One, production and shipping costs are not declining in-line with previous generations, especially for components such as SSDs. This was especially notable during the early COVID-19 period which severely impacted supply chains and led to shortages for chips, paired with an increase in demand for at-home entertainment, which led to increasing costs. Two, console platform holders are struggling to maintain gross profit margins across the board. This has led to price maintenance (or even price increases in some markets) to ensure hardware remains profitable. Three, the Xbox Series S and PS5 Digital Edition were already sold at a significant loss on day 1. The increased focus on profitability for disc models is to try and offset losses, maintain margins, and weather external factors that may impact spending on games such as cost of living increases."</p><p>But the other two analysts differed slightly on how Sony might make the higher PS5 Pro price palatable. Toto doesn’t believe there will be a price cut on the PS5 base model. “We can expect the PS5 Pro to cost $600 to $650 in the US,” he said. “Now, I am curious what Sony will do in the Japanese market where the current model costs 79,980 yen. For that price, you can get two Switches and almost an additional Switch Lite here. Will they dare to offer the PS5 Pro for 100,000 yen or even more?”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I am curious what Sony will do in Japan where the PS5 costs 79,980 yen...Will they dare to offer the PS5 Pro for 100,000 yen?</p></div><p>Wagner has a different take: “While we do not collect revenue on hardware, when the PS4 Pro version came to market, we saw a decrease in the cost of the base model. If a PS5 Pro is on the horizon, we have no reason to believe Sony will change their pricing strategy for this generation.”</p><p>Toto and Wagner also differed in their perspectives on how effective a PS5 Pro release would be for Sony. Both analysts pointed out that its projected timing ahead of the release of Grand Theft Auto 6 would certainly help bolster sales. Toto recalled that by the end of the life cycle, the PS4 Pro accounted for 10-15% of overall PS4 hardware sales. He believes a PS5 Pro can reach the same percentage.</p><p>But Wagner believes that the PS5 Pro “may not move the needle for this generation in the same way that a price decrease in the base model may,” and while GTA 6 might be a hardware sales driver, it might not be as significant as some would expect.</p><p>“We have also shown that many players are playing more mature titles that do not require hardware upgrades (Fortnite, Minecraft, etc.). Due to this, it will be interesting to see how Sony positions a Pro version to drive console sales for players who are not already interested in the base model.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Ahmad didn’t explicitly take either position, but he did have an interesting addendum on a different console entirely.</p><p>“It's also worth noting that [a PS5 Pro release] will likely impact the successor to the Nintendo Switch's price in Japan too. As it's unlikely Nintendo will be able to price it as low as the original Switch was at launch.”</p><p>The recent PS5 price increase in Japan may almost certainly be nothing more complex than a reaction to larger economic factors, especially given its limitation to one region and Xbox’s corresponding increase last year. But we’re coming off of a generation of price increase after increase on subscriptions, games, and hardware amid widespread inflation. And with a PS5 Pro seemingly imminent, a Switch successor almost certain <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-confirms-it-will-announce-switch-successor-console-within-this-fiscal-year"><u>to follow</u></a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-next-gen-console-confirmed-business-update"><u>whatever Xbox is doing</u></a>, the question of what companies can reasonably ask of consumers for a new game box is becoming an increasingly spicy one.</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

                <p>A new, more powerful version of the PlayStation 5 is reportedly primed for an announcement soon, and while the rumored <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-release-date-specs-price/1100-6523695/" data-ref-id="1100-6523695">PS5 Pro</a> system hasn't been officially confirmed, video game industry analysts are weighing in with their thoughts about it.</p><p>Serkan Toto of Kantan Games told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-will-ps5-price-increases-in-japan-impact-the-ps5-pro-price-what-the-experts-are-saying" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that there is "no doubt" that a PS5 Pro is on the way. What form it takes and what upgrades it might offer over the existing PS5 remain a mystery. But it will be more expensive than the PS5, the analysts noted.</p><p>Toto said the PS5 Pro is likely to cost $600 or $650 when it releases, and that the existing PS5, which costs $500, will not receive a price cut. Michael Wagner of Newzoo said history suggests that the PS5 will receive a price cut when the PS5 Pro launches, citing the precedent of the PS4 getting a price cut when the PS4 Pro came out. Daniel Ahmad of Niko Partners said this generation isn't the same as past ones in part because production and shipping costs are not declining like they did with previous generations.</p><p>Toto and Wagner also talked about how they believe the PS5 Pro would be released in time for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>'s debut in 2025, and that PS5 Pro sales could benefit as a result. Toto also mentioned how the PS5 Pro won't be a very significant contributor to overall PS5 unit sales. He noted that the PS4 Pro only made up 10%-15% of total PS4 sales by the end of the platform's lifecycle, and that trend should continue with the PS5 Pro.</p><p>An unsubstantiated rumor suggests the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-coming-this-year-could-be-600-playstation-showcase-in-september-report/1100-6526118/" data-ref-id="1100-6526118">PS5 Pro could be announced during a State of Play this month</a> or even at the Tokyo Game Show, which is also set for this month. Other reports suggest the PS5 Pro was an "open secret" during Gamescom in August.</p><p>Leaked specs for the PS5 Pro suggest it may have a "High CPU Frequency Mode" that reportedly increases the PS5 CPU by 10% to 3.85Ghz. The system could also have a new GPU that is said to be capable of up to 45% faster rendering and dramatically improves ray-tracing effects. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-spec-analysis-playstation-5-pro-the-most-powerful-console-yet" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Digital Foundry</a> has also corroborated these claims and posted a list of the reported the PS5 Pro specs back in March.</p><p>Recently, Hideo Kojima's assistant uploaded a photo of Kojima playing Death Stranding 2 with what looks to be a device cloaked under some kind of covering, with many suggesting this might be the PS5 Pro or a developer's version of the system.</p><p>For what it's worth, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-series-x-digital-only-mid-gen-refresh-has-been-leaked-in-court-documents/1100-6517813/" data-ref-id="1100-6517813">mid-generation Xbox Series X refresh is also rumored</a>, but there isn't much to go on.

            <p>
Way back in March, Ubisoft's shared its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-roadmap-includes-boss-rush-permadeath-story-dlc">post-launch roadmap</a> for the excellent <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</a>, and six months later we're almost at its end. Its final content drop - the paid Mask of Darkness story DLC - launches on 17th September, and Ubisoft's has now <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-gb/article/gruqIEXvoTx23RRPtHBLJ">revealed</a> at least some of what players can expect to see when it arrives.
</p>
<p>
Mask of Darkness introduces a "sizeable" new biome known as Radjen's Mind Palace, promising "fresh traversal elements, traps, enemies, and more". It'll unlock once players have escaped the Depths and acquired the Shadow of the Simurgh time power, meaning players will need to have a decent amount of playtime under their belts before they can get stuck in.
</p>
<p>
Radjen's Mind Palace - a "surreal landscape" of floating blocks and caverns lit by ghostly flame - is accessed by teleporting from a hidden room in Mount Qaf's Lower City. While inside, Sargon is stripped of all his amulets and powers, most of his arrows and healing items, plus all but two of his time powers - the Rush of the Simurgh air-dash and Shadow of the Simurgh.

<p>
That means players will need to get creative when dealing with new enemies including spider-like mechanical Sentinels, spinning birds with bladed wings, and acrobat dark wraiths. As for new environmental hazards and traversal methods, these include bumper-style floating metal orbs that launch Sargon in specific directions when hit, red saw blades that materialise in thin air and hurtle toward his position, plus horizontal pillars that spit out cannonballs.
</p>
<p>
And then, of course, there's Radjen - one of Persia's elite Immortals, who players can learn more about as their journey through her Mind Palace continues.
</p>
<p>
Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown's Mask of Darkness story DLC launches for Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC (via Steam, the Ubisoft Store, and Epic) on 17th September.

            <p>Every week of late I seem to pop up here with another new arcade racer to talk about, and well, I wouldn't want to break the streak. This week's new hotness is Parking Garage Rally Circuit, which is about powersliding around multi-storey car parks and is designed to look like a lost Sega Saturn game. It now has a release date: September 20th.

<p>Chunky polygons? Check. Halftone effects to make those pixels pop? Yep. Anti-aliasing? No way. 
</p>
<p>Set in a future where American parking garages have been, for some reason, turned into race courses, you drift around corners and chain together "Mario Kart-style boosts" to win races and time trials. There are 8 cars to unlock, three car classes of increasing difficulty to drive, and online leaderboards to climb. 
</p>
<p>It's also got online multiplayer for up to 8 players. Most of these arcade racers lack that, favouring split-screen if anything, so for that reason alone I'll give Parking Garage a shot.
</p>
<p>Parking Garage Rally Circuit is mainly the work of indie dev Walaber, a name that caused a sort of cerebral itch when I heard it. That's because he was responsible for a number of beloved early physics games in the '00s, such as JellyCar and Trampoline. Walaber's own site has a <a href="https://www.walaber.com/history">history page that runs down some of his old work</a>.
</p>
<p>My only problem with the look of Parking Garage Rally Circuit so far is that powersliding around parking garages gives me terrible flashbacks to trying to pass the tutorial in Driver one the PSone. Kids these days don't know the terrible shame and anger of renting a game from the video store for two days with your pocket money and spending <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iCPzDEkkII">the entire time just trying to get to the first mission</a>.
</p>
<p>I'm sure Parking Garage Rally Circuit won't do me dirty like that. It'll be out  <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2737300/Parking_Garage_Rally_Circuit/">on Steam in two weeks</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

For reference, the actual Bechdel Test, meant to illuminate patterns and biases in media, poses a few questions: Does a given work have two or more female characters in it? And do they ever have a conversation about something other than a man?<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197209" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Boys Star Karen Fukuhara On Kimiko’s Character Arc, Karate, And More" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="319" data-playlist="197209,196923,196922" data-current="197209"><div><p>The Boys Star Karen Fukuhara On Kimiko’s Character Arc, Karate, And More</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197209/197209_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197209/197209_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197209/197209_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197209/197209_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22759.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>“Have a conversation with a woman,” reads a prompt that pops up at the start of the clip. “I’m looking forward to speaking to a fellow woman,” says the character on-screen, with the kind of wooden affectation you’d expect from an older video game. Within seconds, she’s beeped at while crossing the street, and realizes it’s a woman driver who’s chastised her. “Hey girl!” she shouts, waving like a broken-down robot. “GLASS CEILING SHATTERED,” the game announcer shouts triumphantly. </p><p>But when the protagonist tries to walk through a door, a warning that it’s a male-dominated space pops up on-screen. “I don’t think I’m supposed to go there,” she says cheerily.<br></p><p>The video then cuts to the “game’s” developers, who—of course—are male. “We wanted to make a game for women, by us,” they say in unison. “Because we had to. Our last game, <em>Jerk It 3: Crankfest 2K24</em> got us in legal hot water—and jail.” Our cheery protagonist then encounters another woman, who says she’s not doing too great because her brother is missing. “Ow,” she says, as the screen flashes red and an alarm wails, indicating she’s taking damage. “Discussing a man,” the game warns. “Tap B to change topic.”<br></p><p>The rest of the video is more of this: pitch-perfect <em>GTA</em> rip-off mixed with searing social commentary. It’s hilarious and one of several video game knock-off videos the NYC comedy duo (composed of Kandel and Joe Miciak) have made, including one based on the FX series <em>The Bear</em>. “<em>The Bear</em> video game actually looks pretty cool,” Kandel wrote in the post sharing the video. I see the pattern.<br></p><p>I reached out to Hotel Art Thief via email to learn about their video game inspiration, what kinds of games they like to play, and to confirm if it was possible to get past that level where two women discuss a man without dying. Here’s what they had to say:</p><p><strong>How did you guys get into making videos like The Bechdel Test game and The Bear game? </strong></p><p><strong>Joe:</strong> We originally got into it with a sketch we did last year called “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@hotelartthief/video/7263466150674091310?is_from_webapp=1&amp;sender_device=pc&amp;web_id=7373464539852244526&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@hotelartthief/video/7263466150674091310?is_from_webapp=1&amp;sender_device=pc&amp;web_id=7373464539852244526" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">user:Brian(box)</a></span>,” which was a retro futuristic VR chatroom. It was our first sketch playing with first person, POV-style comedy in a video game environment, and we liked the immersive feel it allowed. I learned a little bit of Blender to animate it, and we used ambient moments from the N64 game <em>Perfect Dark</em> for the background. We got a kick out of creating a surreal world that combined the absurd with tedium. <em>The Bear</em> was a continuation of that, once I had learned how to animate a little better.<br></p><p><strong>Mike:</strong> For “Bechdel Test,” we had always wanted to do a <em>GTA</em>-like sketch where the character had more mundane objectives, but could still break out a golf club and beat people up. It was just a matter of finding the right home for the idea.<br></p><p><strong>Are you both gamers? What are some of your favorite games?</strong><br></p><p><strong>M:</strong> I’m not much of a gamer. I mostly played <em>Madden, 2K</em>, and <em>Mario</em> growing up. I’m a sore loser and bad at video games, so you can imagine my predicament.</p><p><strong>J</strong>: I’ve played a lot of <em>Smash</em> and <em>Mario Kart,</em> some <em>Zelda</em> and <em>Pokémon</em>. I have fond memories of watching my friends play <em>Halo</em> or <em>Call of Duty</em> growing up. I’d usually lose or die early and would watch the rest of the game play out like a TV show.</p><p><strong>What games do you find are easy to parody/use as reference in your videos?</strong></p><p><strong>M</strong>: As comedians, we try to choose games and visuals that heighten the idea we’re working with and go from there.</p><p><strong>J</strong>: Yeah, we usually come up with the idea first—like<em> The Bear</em> came about because I liked the idea of a stressful cooking game like <em>Cooking Mama</em> being presented as meditative and calm. And then from the kernel of the idea we look for other ideas from games with similar settings, tones, or characters. Like we got some ideas from<em> Watch Dogs </em>because it was set in Chicago like <em>The Bear.</em>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What do you think about the current state of games? Are you plugged into all the culture warring stuff?</strong></p><p><strong>M</strong>: We are not very plugged into the state of video games.</p><p><strong>J</strong>: I heard things got super egalitarian and no one harrasses anyone anymore.</p><p><strong>How did the women involved feel about the Bechdel Test game?</strong></p><p><strong>M</strong>: I refused to talk to them on set, but maybe Joe knows.</p><p><strong>J</strong>: Mike is kidding!! We had a great day filming with them (Rachel Coster, Danielle Clarke-Fisher, and Whitley Watson). We did a read-through with them to see how it read, and they helped us edit it into a version we were all happy with. Then we recorded all the VO first, which was mostly scripted, but they all improvised and added some great lines. I think a lot of, if not all, the exclamations from Rachel were ad-libbed. Then filming the gameplay outside was a blast. They all coalesced on really funny hand/body movements that looked eerily game-like. We were all pretty tired from filming <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/K_A_N_D_E_L/status/1796540383796535339&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/K_A_N_D_E_L/status/1796540383796535339" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another sketch</a></span> earlier that day so we moved pretty quickly. All the women loved how it came out, and were thrilled about the reception.</p><p><strong>Tell me more about the expansions and add-ons—they’re obviously for laughs, but they point to how the games industry continues to keep players paying with new content.</strong></p><p><strong>M</strong>: I’m not a gamer, but just about every media/software company these days will force you to buy a monthly subscription or a never-ending series of add-ons that you don’t even want. We thought having our characters create “feminist” add-ons would be a funny escalation in our sketch.</p><p><strong>What’s the next video game parody you’re working on? </strong></p><p><strong>J</strong>: We haven’t written it yet, but I really want to do a side-scrolling game where you’re navigating through a party where you don’t know anyone.</p><p><strong>M</strong>: We’re actually debuting our next video game parody at our upcoming live show, so we don’t want to spoil too much. But you can come see it September 13th at Union Hall.</p><p><strong>What do you hope people take away from your video game videos?</strong></p><p><strong>M</strong>: I hope people laugh and enjoy themselves.</p><p><strong>J</strong>: I hope people are exhorted to take radical political action. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<!-- cache hit 1:single/related:cbb18d5f6f88fc5f02ef5e9db73b6690 --><!-- empty -->
<p>LocalThunk, the pseudonymous lead developer of the surprise smash hit deckbuilding/roguelike/poker-math-simulation game <a href="https://www.playbalatro.com/"><em>Balatro</em></a>, has long given the impression that he understands that his game, having <a href="https://x.com/BalatroGame/status/1821184859974344853">sold 2 million copies</a>, might be a little <em>too&nbsp;</em>good.</p>
<p>To that end, LocalThunk has made the game specifically&nbsp;<em>not</em> about actual gambling, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24216323/balatro-update-2025-details-new-jokers-iphone-android-version">or microtransactions</a>, or anything of the kind. Shortly after it arrived in February 2024 (but after it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/steam-next-fest-eight-game-demos-that-stood-out-from-the-crowd/">already got its hooks into one of us</a>), some storefronts removed or re-rated the game on concerns about its cards and chips themes, causing him to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/balatro-devs-argue-poker-roguelike-does-not-encourage-gambling-as-it-vanishes-from-some-stores">explain his line</a> between random number generation (RNG), risk/reward mechanics, and actual gambling. He <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/roguelike/i-hate-the-thought-of-balatro-becoming-a-true-gambling-game-localthunk-is-making-sure-casinos-cant-get-their-hands-on-his-game-even-after-he-dies-by-literally-writing-it-into-his-will/">literally wrote it into his will</a> that the game cannot be used in any kind of gambling or casino property.</p>
<p>So LocalThunk has done everything he can to ensure&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em> won't waste people's money. Time, though? If you're a <em>Balatro</em> fan already, or more of a mobile gamer than a console or computer player, your time is in danger.</p>
<p><em>Balatro</em> is coming to iOS, both in the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/balatro/id6502451661">Apple Arcade</a> subscription and as <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/balatro/id6502453075">a stand-alone title</a>, and the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.playstack.balatro.android">Google Play Store</a> on September 26. The <a href="https://x.com/BalatroGame/status/1831695226886300045">pitch-perfect reveal trailer</a> slowly ratchets up the procrastinatory terror, with the word "MOBILE" punctuating scenes of gameplay, traditional businessmen crying, "Jimbo Stonks" rising upward (Jimbo being the moniker of Balatro's joker), and a world laid to waste by people chasing ever-more-elusive joker combos.</p>

<p>Please note in the trailer, at the 36-second mark, the "Trailer Ideas" for <em>Balatro</em> on Mobile, including "Announcing <em>Balatro</em> is now a Soulslike," "Romanceable Jimbo Reveal," and "It's like that apocalypse movie with the meteor but instead Jimbo is in the sky."</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<figure><figcaption><p>Playstack</p></figcaption></figure>
<h2>Even more <em>Balatro</em> content is coming</h2>
<p>The mobile version of&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>is one of three updates LocalThunk has planned for 2025. A gameplay update is still due to arrive sometime this year, one that will be completely free for game owners. It won't feel like a different game, or even a 1.5 version, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24216323/balatro-update-2025-details-new-jokers-iphone-android-version">LocalThunk told Polygon last month</a>, but "extending that vision to, I think, its logical bounds instead of shifting directions … [M]ore about filling out the design space that currently exists, and then extending that design space in interesting directions that I think people are going to love.”</p>
<p>What else is coming? Perhaps "Friends of Jimbo," <a href="https://x.com/BalatroGame/status/1831695244007559553">teased today on Balatro's X</a> (formerly Twitter) account, tells us something. Notably, LocalThunk says that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/balatro/comments/1bebf1g/comment/kutxwa3/">he developed the mobile ports himself</a>.</p>
<p>As we noted in our attempt to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/04/why-there-are-861-roguelike-deckbuilders-on-steam-all-of-a-sudden/">explain the ongoing popularity of roguelike deckbuilders</a>,&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em> is LocalThunk's first properly released game. He claims to have not played any such games before making <em>Balatro</em>&nbsp;but was fascinated by streams of&nbsp;<em>Luck Be a Landlord</em>, a game about "using a slot machine to earn rent money and defeat capitalism." That game, plus <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/balatro-dev-gives-look-at-first-prototype-joker-poker">influences of Cantonese game Big Two</a> and the basics of poker (another game LocalThunk says he didn't actually play), brought about the time-melting game as we know it.
</p><p><em>Balatro</em>, in turn, took off with streamers, who would <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5lHsMrBFtg">break the game with seeds</a>, hit <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQyaOLqfmJs">scores of 30 quintillion</a>, or just keep <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFPH7flo-Pw">coming back with everything they've learned</a>.</p>
<p>A number of Ars writers have kept coming back to <em>Balatro</em>, time and again, since its release. It's such a compelling game, especially for its indie-scale price, that none of us could really think of a way to write a stand-alone "review" of it. With its imminent arrival on iPhones, iPads, and Android devices, we're due to re-educate ourselves on how much time is really in each day and which kinds of achievements our families and communities need to see from us.</p>
<p>Maybe the game won't sync across platforms, and the impedance of having to start all over will be enough to prevent notable devolution. Maybe.</p>

Guardians of the Galaxy leads this month’s selection, but you also get seven other games, including SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake, all for just $11.99. It’s a great deal, since you get $269 worth of games for just $12. If you’ve had your eye on any of these, you’re basically losing money if you <em>don’t</em> join.</p><h2>Humble Choice Games for September 2024</h2><div catalogid="d1208fa6-3558-4161-92a8-68ad38073d0d" id="207022"><div id="207022" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Humble Choice - September 2024</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li>Guardians of the Galaxy</li><li>SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake</li><li>Coral Island</li><li>Stranded: Alien Dawn</li><li>Lost Eidolons</li><li>You Suck at Parking</li><li>Infraspace</li><li>Astrea: Six-Sided Oracles</li></ul><p>All of the games are yours to keep forever, regardless of your Humble Choice subscription status. You can skip a month or cancel your subscription at any time, so there’s no commitment or lock-in. You can always rejoin later if a future month’s offerings spark your interest. The games are delivered in the form of Steam codes that you can redeem yourself, or pass off to friends or internet strangers if you don’t want a particular game.</p><p>As for this month’s selections, the big Marvel game is well worth $11.99 all on its own. From our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvels-guardians-of-the-galaxy-game-review">Guardians of the Galaxy review</a>:</p><p>“Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy nicely balances a goofy, action-filled adventure with some genuinely heartfelt story moments, and the choices you’re given can add some surprising personal twists to your particular playthrough. Its combat and level design are relatively simple if still consistently entertaining, but it’s the relationships and banter between its characters that keep everything fresh as they evolve. It isn’t going to set the world on fire, but Guardians of the Galaxy is still another convincing example of how much fun a linear, no-frills, single-player campaign can be.” </p><p>In addition to free games each month, Humble Choice subscribers save up to 20% off other games in the Humble Store. And 5% of your subscription purchase goes to charity.

        <p>These people should move to a nicer town</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>The second season of animated show Arcane is due to arrive on Netflix this November. After an initial teaser trailer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arcanes-second-season-will-be-its-last-says-its-first-trailer">back in June</a>, Netflix have now released a more substantial two-minute trailer that you can watch below.

<p>That looks like the beautifully animated melodrama I remember.
</p>
<p>It was also announced alongside the first trailer in June that Arcane's second season would be its last. I think its admirable, given the popularity of the first season and of League Of Legends in general, that they're driving towards a specific ending to the story.
</p>
<p>Arcane is produced by French animation studio Fortiche, who Riot Games <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/riot-games-buy-big-part-of-arcane-animation-studio">bought a big part of</a> in 2022. Riot also apparently have plans for a lot <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/riot-games-outline-five-year-strategy-including-plans-for-more-tv-movies-and-music">more TV and movie projects still to come</a>.
</p>
<p>Watching the trailer above got me excited for season two, but also made me realise how little I remember of season one, despite loving it, outside of the broad strokes of its A plot. What's Kate's deal again? What happened to that... other guy? Was someone inventing magic or rediscovering it or...? I'd watch season one again to refresh my memory, but I'm not sure I can face its emotionally intense plot beats again, so instead I'm hoping season two begins with a really meaty recap. 
</p>
<p>Season two will arrive in November, but there's no specific release date yet.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Well, almost everything. The neat thing about summer is that it’s prime time for deals on video games,, and this narrow window between the end of summer vacation and the actual beginning of autumn is the last bit of time for stores to squeeze some sales out before the heavy-hitting releases of the year start dropping every other week. In other words, here are a bunch of great games to check out on the cheap before <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-multiplayer-beta-weekend-1851638800&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-multiplayer-beta-weekend-1851638800"><em>Black Ops 6</em></a></span><em> </em>rolls around and ruins your productivity and spending habits.</p></div><div><p><em>Untitled Goose Game </em>has the benefit of being the most straightforward game included here. In it, you play as the titular fowl as they go about terrorizing the neighborhood. Rather than being some kind of freewheeling, open-world sandbox for chaos like <em>Goat Simulator</em>, <em>Untitled Goose Game </em>is actually secretly a stealth game. The goal is to get away with causing as much mayhem in the little English village as possible without getting caught. This includes ruining someone’s backyard, an avenue full of storefronts, and all manner of otherwise quiet, domestic settings. All the while, your rampage is set to classical music that quiets and loudens based on the current state of emergency. The whole thing feels much more elevated and elegant than it first appears, and I think that’s part of <em>Untitled Goose Game</em>’s appeal. Nowadays, you can even play it cooperatively, and two geese simply sounds like too much for this poor little town to deal with. <strong>Terrorize the locals and become untethered in </strong><em><strong>Untitled Goose Game</strong></em><strong>, which is going for $10 on the Epic Games Store.</strong><br></p></div><div><p>The first few <em>Mega Man X </em>games are among the most cherished games of my childhood, and anything in that vein has immediately earned my attention and admiration. <em>Gravity Circuit</em> is one such game, but it’s even more interesting because it actually strips you of your blaster and focuses on melee combat and combos. It took me a while to wrap my head around that pretty drastic change, but once I did, <em>Gravity Circuit </em>really opened up, and just thinking about it now makes me want to pick it back up and actually finish the game. <strong>If you like games that love to throw twists on tried-and-true formulas, </strong><em><strong>Gravity Circuit </strong></em><strong>is well worth picking up for $8.49.</strong><br></p></div><div><p><em>Remnant 2 </em>is the pulpiest sci-fi action game you’re going to get. Often described as “<em>Dark Souls </em>with guns,” <em>Remnant 2 </em>is some of the most unabashed fun you can get out of a game. Shoot and satisfyingly dodge-roll your way through dark fantasy and sci-fi settings in a world-hopping adventure that feels ripped from the covers of schlocky novellas from another era. In the meantime, you’re also constantly earning new loot and progressing your class, which includes archetypes like the tank as well as one loadout that gives you a great dog as an AI companion. Its story has a sci-fi B-movie feel to it, being just coherent enough to propel you through its beats, but not enough to have tremendous staying power. In short, <em>Remnant 2 </em>is just the right amount of nonsense, and I loved playing it. It’s probably even better in co-op and now that most of its DLC is out, you’ll likely have even more sick-looking plant aliens to blast to bits. <strong>You can get the deluxe edition of </strong><em><strong>Remnant 2 </strong></em><strong>for $30 on EGS.</strong><br></p></div><div><p>Despite my best efforts, I have not been able to shake <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>since playing it for the first time last year. It had one of the messiest launches ever, and is no doubt still <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-fixed-re-review-2023-impressions-saved-1850143200&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-fixed-re-review-2023-impressions-saved-1850143200">riddled with blemishes and imperfections</a></span>, and yet everywhere I turn, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-night-city-new-york-city-1850879791&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-night-city-new-york-city-1850879791">I still see Night City</a></span>. I see Afterlife and Rogue sitting in the back of it. I see Johnny Silverhand and a view of the city from the outskirts of town. I see Santo Domingo, a neighborhood named after the capital of my mother country, and how rundown it is. I see the dilapidated ruins of Dogtown and the glow of the Heavy Hearts Club’s massive pyramid jutting out of it. I miss it all the time. I miss my V, and I miss his friends and his partner. Warts and all, <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>is one of the most unforgettable games I’ve played, and I still haven’t been able to place my thumb on exactly why.<strong> If getting lost in a world filled with people making the best of a shitty situation sounds like something that </strong><em><strong>could </strong></em><strong>mean a lot to you, you can pick up </strong><em><strong>Cyberpunk 2077</strong></em><strong> for $30 and its ultimate edition (which packs in the </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-update-review-idris-elba-1850852291&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-update-review-idris-elba-1850852291"><strong>phenomenal <em>Phantom Liberty </em>expansion</strong></a></span><strong>) for $53.59.</strong><br></p></div><div><p>I’ve only ever watched people play <em>RoboCop: Rogue City</em>, but from that alone, I’ve been able to glean that it’s actually a decent game that captures the spirit of the original movie. In it, you’re the eponymous character and you do exactly as he would do: you shoot, kill, and otherwise maim criminals. If this sounds simplistic, it’s because it is, and <em>Rogue City </em>thrives on that. It doesn’t have huge aspirations, and because the developers appeared to keep the game’s scope in check, they were able to make a competent AA-quality shooter with modest depth that adapts the original movie’s grisly violence pretty faithfully. You are a walking, talking tank who blasts and punches enemies to literal bits. You can grab enemies by the neck and fling them around. It’s a game that just nails the power fantasy of being RoboCop, and you can be him by picking up the game for $25. </p></div><div><p>Don’t Nod is most famous these days for making the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure-max-endings-chloe-1851538397&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure-max-endings-chloe-1851538397"><em>Life Is Strange</em></a></span><em> </em>series, but it has spent the last few years taking the goodwill and resources from the massive success of those games to make a ton of markedly different games. One such game is <em>Jusant</em>, a game about a boy with the singular goal of climbing an impossibly high mountain. There is no combat and I’m pretty sure there’s no dialogue either. All you do is climb. I love games that focus on a thing and make it the most entertaining, challenging, and all-consuming version of it possible, and that’s how I feel about climbing in <em>Jusant</em>. After decades of playing through video game setpieces, it’s pretty easy to see through the artifice of scenarios designed to rouse me. I’m rarely, if ever, on the edge of my seat, muscles and jaw tightened due to the sheer exhilaration of a sequence. I was in that state for the entirety of my time with <em>Jusant </em>though. <strong>You can feel the thrills of surmounting the highest peak, too, by picking up </strong><em><strong>Jusant </strong></em><strong>for $16.24.</strong><br></p></div><div><p>Haters be damned, the newest <em>Saints Row </em>game was good. Maybe even great. It is not some ambitious and fundamental rework of the series that people grew to love, and it definitely isn’t the politically correct “woke” shit that certain people accused it of being. It was a fresh new skin on the exact same formula that made the series so widely loved in the first place. It’s maybe a bit more earnest than its predecessors, but that didn’t stop it from also being crass and inane, which are key tenets of what made <em>Saints Row </em>click for most of its audience. People just kind of <em>wanted </em>to hate this game and barely gave it a chance. If you played and loved the earlier games like I did, and just want another one of those with even more customization tools and a fun new setting in the American Southwest, there’s no reason not to pick up the new <em>Saints Row</em>. <strong>Crucially, it’s also only $9, and you can get the gold edition with the expansion pass for just one more dollar.</strong></p></div><div><p>Until the next <em>Skate </em>comes out, you may as well pick up the best possible skating simulator out there. <em>Session </em>is perhaps the most technical of all the skating games on offer, but it is alsothe most freeing. There’s no scoring, and there’s no real story there either. All you do is make your character, hop on your board, and cruise around real-life locales. The only goal is whatever you want out of that session. It’s beautiful and relaxing. Whenever I picked up skating as a teenager, I really just wanted to glide. Tricks and races were cool, but skating has always been about a vibe to me, and that’s what <em>Session </em>is built upon. <strong>You can chase that vibe down by picking up </strong><em><strong>Session: Skate Sim </strong></em><strong>for $12.</strong><br></p></div><div><p><em>System Shock </em>is one of the most stunning remakes of a game there is. It’s a complete visual overhaul of the 1994 original, but one that manages to maintain what made that game so legendary and profoundly influential. All of the friction of it is still there, and it is one the most densely textured games I’ve ever seen. It even features the return of the original voice for <em>System Shock</em>’s villain, SHODAN. If you’ve ever wondered about the history of immersive sims (a genre of game I’m obsessed with), there’s no better way to experience the moment where it all clicked into place than buying this very sensible and very faithful recreation of one of the genre’s formative texts.<strong> You can dive into </strong><em><strong>System Shock </strong></em><strong>for just $18. </strong></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The next major Helldivers 2 update is coming this month, and Arrowhead Studios is promising “significant changes” for the game.</p>



<p>“We see the steam reviews and we hear you loud and clear,” Arrowhead said in a blog post outlining the next Helldivers 2 update. This update, which is scheduled to release on September 17 for all players, is aimed at “ensuring Helldivers 2 meets the high standards we all expect.”</p>



<p>As far as what this update will include, there’s plenty. Some of the bigger changes include boosts to weapons like the heavy machine gun and autocannon as well an overhaul to a number of enemies. There’s no mention of any additions, such as new enemies or additional content. Instead, everything seems to be focusing on fixing a game that many fans believe to be broken after various nerfs over the months.</p>



<p>Ahead of the release of the update, the studio held multiple closed beta tests for players in order to “ensure everything runs smoothly”. They also mention expanding the tests before full release to help find any “issues and missteps”.</p>



<h2 id="h-helldivers-2-update-details">Helldivers 2 Update Details</h2>



<p>Below is what <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/4613462911400573371" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Arrowhead is promising</a> with the next update:</p>



<ul>
<li>We are reworking Armor Penetration, Anti-Tank weapons and enemy armor and health values. As a key part of the rework we have done an initial balancing pass on over 30 weapons and stratagems.</li>



<li>We are overhauling a number of different enemies to make them feel more rewarding to kill when you use the proper tools to handle them but ensure they still feel formidable. Enemy bots, including Hulks, will have lower armor, and the number of rockets fired by enemies like the Devastator and Gunship will be limited, making combat more balanced. The armor values of particularly tough bug enemies like the Charger, Impaler, and Bile Titan will also be reduced.</li>



<li>Weapons such as the Autocannon, Heavy Machine Gun, and Anti-Material Rifle will be more effective, providing greater loadout versatility. We are also working towards additional improvements for the flamethrower weapons.</li>



<li>We’re taking this opportunity to consider new player fantasies and design goals for these weapons and stratagems based on the feedback we’ve received and the trends we’re observing during gameplay.</li>
</ul>



<p>Helldivers 2 is available for PlayStation 5 and PC.</p>

The patch notes include a few helpful bug fixes, and it also corrects a broken conversion kit that was added for the BAL-27 assault rifle.</p><p dir="ltr">For Modern Warfare 3's multiplayer, the update fixes an issue on the Celship map that previously caused split-screen players to encounter crashes with Dev Error 12744. It's also disabled the game's infil sequences on the Skidrow and 6 Star maps for Season 5's Cyber Attack mode, which the developer says were removed to prevent mixed team spawns.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Last week's new JAK Deathmarch aftermarket part for the BAL-27 assault rifle arrived broken, with an issue allowing the gun to have an infinite reserve ammunition.

            <p>
As of earlier this week, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a> is officially, and slightly alarmingly, ten years old. And coinciding with that impressive milestone, EA has unveiled the life sim's latest seasonal roadmap, which includes a life-and-death-themed new expansion arriving this Halloween.
</p>
<p>
EA's roadmap is admittedly pretty light on specifics right now, with more to be share as each release nears, but we do know The Sims 4's latest content season - collectively presented under the name To Be Continued - kicks off on 19th September with two new Kit packs.
</p>
<p>
"Give your little nooboo a sophisticated start with the Storybook Nursery Kit," teases <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/the-sims-4-season-of-to-be-continued">EA's blog post</a>, "or build an inspiring retreat to help your Sim’s creativity flow with the Artist Studio Kit."

<p>
That'll be followed by the Reaper's Rewards Event, coming to The Sim 4's base game on 24th September, which sees players helping out Death in order to earn rewards.
</p>
<p>
And there's still more busywork for the Grim Reaper starting on October 31st, when The Sim 4's Life and Death Expansion Pack arrives. This will enable players to embark on an "endless journey through life and beyond" - which could mean anything from the introduction of funerals to an new afterlife realm - and more is set to be revealed on 31st October.
</p>
<p>
All this follow a rather steamy summer for The Sims 4, which introduced the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4-is-getting-ready-for-a-summer-of-sexy-updates-starting-with-swimsuits">sexy new swimwear</a>, new love retreats, and features such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4-is-turning-up-the-heat-with-its-super-sexy-lovestruck-expansion-pack">Romantic Boundaries and new romatic interactions</a> across a range of free and paid updates.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-out-now-on-pc-adds-mod-tools-manager-evil-endings-and-more/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-update-7-is-out-next-week-adding-mods-and-new-cinematics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promised</a> recently, Larian has <a href="https://x.com/baldursgate3/status/1831688936281739295" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> Baldur's Gate 3 Patch 7 on PC. This heavy update (11.6GB in size, but you'll actually need 160GB of free space on your drive to install it) was highly anticipated mainly because it finally adds those evil endings players have been waiting for. There are 13 of those that include cinematics, as well as unique endings for Origin characters.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>The other major addition of Baldur's Gate 3 Patch 7 is undoubtedly the public release of mod tools. The editor is a separate app that can be downloaded via Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2934770/Baldurs_Gate_3_Editor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at this URL</a>. You'll have to make sure that DLC is enabled through the store page and that ‘Tools’ is checked in your Steam Library to make the application visible once installed.</p>
<p>For those interested in Baldur's&nbsp;Gate 3 modding, Mod.io offers a series of tutorials and guides. The game now also officially supports some scripted mods using Osiris, Larian's in-house scripting language. This means that mod authors can load their own scripts, handle build errors, and even do some basic debugging. Mods can be published straight from the toolkit, making it seamless.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Furthermore, Baldur's Gate 3 Patch 7 introduces a built-in mod manager. This allows users to easily browse mods made with the toolkit, install them without having to move out of the game and check that everyone has the same mods installed in a multiplayer party.</p>
<p>The game itself also received some improvements. Honour Mode, for instance, has seen the introduction of new Legendary Actions and other fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><em>If Dror Ragzlin finds himself inside the spider pit, he'll try his best to befriend the spiders residing there with a new spell called Arachnid Compulsion so they can band together to fight the real enemy - you.</em></li>
<li aria-level="1"><em>The Bulette has a new condition called Diamond Scales and a new Legendary Action called Shredding Scales.</em></li>
<li aria-level="1"><em>Malus Thorm has a new Legendary Action called Grasping Appendage.</em></li>
<li aria-level="1"><em>Added a new aura and spell for Spectators: Panicked Sentinel and Ocular Nightmare, respectively.</em></li>
<li aria-level="1"><em>Ch'r'ai Tska'an, the leader of the githyanki ambush in Act II, has a new Legendary Action called Soul Sacrifice.</em></li>
<li aria-level="1"><em>Ch'r'ai Har'rak, the githyanki leader at the Knights of the Shield Hideout, has a new Legendary Action called Tu'narath's Embrace.</em></li>
<li aria-level="1"><em>Ptaris has a new Legendary Action called Ptarian Dogma.</em></li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<p>While Baldur's Gate 3 Patch 7 is live on PC, Mac and console players must wait until October. After this update, there will be two major features left on the roadmap: cross-play and photo mode. Beyond that, fans of the game can only expect small fixes while the bulk of Larian is busy with their <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-larian-studios-2-new-original-projects-best-work-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new projects.</a></p>

Every time you load up Agentia you are reincarnated as a different creature. "Creature" is perhaps too narrow a word - the game's "playable characters" range from geese, microscopic life and triceratops to menhirs and small rocky islands. Each forms the heart of a diamond of delicately drawn, isometric grid terrain with a baby mobile canopy of clouds and sun. It looks like an illustration from an old botanical or geographical textbook, although the inviting emptiness around the visible area also dimly reminds  me of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exile_(1995_video_game_series)">certain elder RPGs</a> I used to play on Macintosh.

<p>
There are no dungeons or fell beasts to wrangle with, however. You exist here simply to explore, or be explored, roaming the landscape using the arrow keys (the angled perspective is a little unwieldy) or staying put to witness the passage of other entities such as birds and sailboats. There are snatches of music against a steady wash of animal and mineral noise. As you and the world move through each other, encounters produce or modify lines of poetry along the bottom of the view, with underlined text you can click to develop or sometimes, reduce the possibilities of a phrase - it feels a little as though you're asking somebody to repeat themselves, to be a little more specific.
</p>
<p>
The game's tilesets are based on the <a href="https://withering-systems.itch.io/city-game-tileset">city game isometric asset pack</a> created by <a href="https://withering-systems.neocities.org/">withering systems</a>, while the main theme is George Georgia's Solemn Solstice. The verbal elements were algorithmically extracted from a range of mostly "vintage" texts in the public domain, then organised by hand. These sources include manuals of astronomy, accounts of mountaineering expeditions, and works of philosophy such as Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari's <a href="https://files.libcom.org/files/A%20Thousand%20Plateaus.pdf">A Thousand Plateaus</a>. The latter tome begs to be navigated in a similarly pliant and loosely connected way.
</p>
<p>
"Each entity featured in Agentia experiences, senses, or simply witnesses the world in ways very different to that of the human mind and body," explains <a href="https://richardacarter.com/agentia/">the project's web page</a>. "Rather than suggest their being can be expressed directly through language, Agentia (Medieval Latin for agency, ability, to act, perform, broadly construed) uses found language excerpted from related works of literature, creating a collage of registers (often strange and enigmatic), that can hint at such more-than-human stories - including, inevitably, their entangled relations with our own. 
</p>
<p>
"Plants and stones, of course, do not move through the world in the same way," it continues. "Readers are invited to be still with them, reading vignettes from time and space as they flow by, and so consider a distinctly non-human mode of being."
</p>
<p>
I enjoyed Agentia, which you can <a href="https://richardacarter.com/agentia-content/index.html">play in a browser for free</a>. It has opened a small space in my head, and I'm not sure what, if anything, I should put there yet. The creator, Richard A. Carter, is a UK-based academic who "investigates the material and ecological dimensions of technical artefacts, activities, and environments". I know him a bit via Xitter, and always like hearing about his experiments. His <a href="https://richardacarter.com/work/">other works</a> include Signals, a book of algebraic poems written in a mathematical language designed for extra-terrestrials, and Dark Mode, a "minimal meditation on the rogue-like / adventure game genre, stripped to its bare essentials: a labyrinth, varied "encounters", and numerical stats".

<p>Mike Rufail, the prolific founder of Envy Gaming, which merged with OpTic Gaming in 2022, has been named CEO of TradeOff, an all-new virtual trading and gaming platform. This fantasy stock trading platform is set to launch soon, and earlier today, the organisation announced Rufail’s appointment, dubbing him a ‘gaming and esports expert’.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-from-gaming-to-gaming">From Gaming to <em>Gaming</em></h2>



<p>TradeOff is preparing to launch worldwide, but in the meantime, it’s busy assembling a corporate structure, assigning Mike Rufail as CEO. In 2009, Rufail joined the Envy team and ultimately became the company owner, managing it effectively until it merged with OpTic Gaming in 2022, scrubbing the Envy Gaming branding from the esports industry.</p>



<p>TradeOff is a platform that allows users to earn real money by competing in online contests ‘similar to fantasy sports or fantasy sports betting’. It’ll feature leaderboards, community-based elements, and partnerships with top traders when it launches. </p>



<p>In a statement on the fresh appointment, Mike Rufail said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Today, there is no accessible entry point for learning how to trade stocks and crypto without putting personal capital at risk, which can be intimidating and prohibitive. TradeOff is going to change how financial brands reach and connect with new audiences, borrowing the best elements of what made playing and streaming video games widely popular and give people opportunities to explore trading, learn, practice and compete in fun new ways with low-risk, high-reward potential.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>At TradeOff, Rufail will be focused on product design, testing, corporate strategy, partnerships, and marketing. Also on the team are fintech experts, entrepreneurs, and even a ‘patents expert’ with time served at HP, Intel, and Wells Fargo. </p>



<p>Sarne Lightman, a member of TradeOff’s leadership team and the managing director of GG Poker, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Mike’s passion as a self-taught trader paired with his roots in building communities around emerging forms of entertainment, social connection and competition make him the ideal leader for TradeOff. We believe TradeOff can be to stock trading what fantasy sports, mobile betting and online poker were to sports and gaming: an invitation to new audiences to participate and emotionally invest in and learn about the game.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Is this how you thought Mike Rufail would resurface after two decades in the gaming and esports industry?</p>
