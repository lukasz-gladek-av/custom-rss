			<p>The Early Access period of Path of Exile 2 was due to start earlier today, but due to some internal issues, no one has been able to access the game yet. It was originally scheduled to launch at 2 PM EST / 11 AM PST, but the developer, Grinding Gear Games, decided to do some last-minute database upgrades, as there were a ton more players eagerly queued up to play the game, and they didn't expect as many as there were. So, they did the database upgrades to try and be able to handle the influx of players. However, the upgrades didn't go as planned, with the team working on the database saying that it would only take a "half-hour" to get access to Path of Exile 2. However, that wasn't the case.</p>
<p>As they were trying to upgrade the database, they found another issue within the game. It started with a crash that "would have affected a majority of users," which was promptly fixed, with the developers saying that the game was ready to be deployed and that the Early Access release was "relatively imminent." However, it was not to be, as the team ran into yet another issue with configuration, and said that they needed to restart the realm. All of this is being updated on<a href="https://x.com/pathofexile" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> their social media</a>, where they are giving those who are interested a play-by-play on how they are running into issues and what they are doing to resolve them.</p>
<p>While they did manage to fix that issue, they said that the ran into the same symptom again, but with a different problem, where multiple characters had the same character ID. They have followed up by saying:</p>
<p>"We've run into the same symptom again with a different problem. We are working on fixing it again but regrettably every time this happens we have to restart and wipe the databases to prevent them getting into bad or corrupted states. We'll have a fix out as soon as we can!"</p>
<p>They have assured the audience that they will be kept updated during this time, as they have a rocky Early Access launch ahead of them. However, it's already more popular than World of Warcraft and New World on Twitch and is <a href="https://x.com/nugiyen/status/1865125378781569460" target="_blank" rel="noopener">currently more popular than Diablo IV</a> in terms of live viewers.</p>
<p>In addition to the live servers of the game being down, the official Path of Exile 2 website is also down, with the website just taking you to a blank page that says "temporarily unavailable..."</p>
<p>We will continue to update you as there are changes and fixes made by the developers who are hard at work.</p>

			<p>Xbox Game Pass already had a ton of brilliant games to get stuck into, and it's now been announced by Crytek that Hunt: Showdown 1896 will also be joining <a href="https://wccftech.com/crash-team-racing-nitro-fueled-launches-on-game-pass-tomorrow/">the roster of games</a> available to play. For those who are subscribers, you'll be able to play Hunt: Showdown 1896 from 12 December 2024. This is only a couple of days away. On the same day the game is coming to Xbox Game Pass, Post Malone's collaboration with the game will be arriving, called Post Malone's Murder Circus. You can watch a trailer for his event below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Post Malone's Murder Circus Trailer | #HuntPartner | Hunt: Showdown 1896" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ooh5BxMHwhE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>For those interested in taking part in Post Malone's event in-game, it will be running from December 12 through February 10, 2025. The event will transport you to a different place in time where you will get to experience a supernatural carnival that makes its mark on the bayou, gulch, and more. At the circus, you'll find Post Malone, the Deposed King and former Ringmaster, who leads you through the horrifying show. The circus is corrupted by the cursed HelioStone, which is a supernatural artifact, bringing horrifying threats to the game in areas like the bayou and the Mammon's Gulch.</p>
<p>This event will introduce new horrifying creatures, such as the Ursa Mortis, which is a strong, two-headed bear. Along with them, you'll see plenty of Circus Grunts floating about, especially while you're inside the Circus compound. To be able to combat these new enemies, you'll be given weapons like the Shredder, which fires sawblades, and Chu Ko Nu, a repeating crossbow.</p>
<p>That's not the only thing added to be able to survive the circus, as you'll also be given the chance to use new weapon variants, such as the 1865 Carbine Aperture, Krag Silencer, Maynard Sniper Silencer, and Sparks Pistol Silencer. This update is a pretty big one, as there is new equipment to use, such as the Recovery Shot consumable and Subsonic Ammo type.</p>
<p>New content isn't the only thing coming to Hunt: Showdown 1896 with this update, as they have also added enhanced silencer mechanics, tweaks to animations, bug fixes and quality-of-life changes to make the game enjoyable for new and returning players of the game.</p>
<p>If you want to know more about Post Malone's update, you can check out the <a href="https://www.huntshowdown.com/news/post-malone-s-murder-circus-coming-to-hunt-showdown-1896-on-dec-12th" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website</a>, which has all of the details for the horrifying circus event, as well as the gory details about what you can expect to contend with while you're there.</p>
<p>This update will be available on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

            <p>The protagonists of two of my all time favourite <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/genres/rpg">RPG</a>s share something in common. Both (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-final-fantasy-games-pc">the best Final Fantasy game</a>) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-viii">Final Fantasy 8</a>’s Squall and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3</a>’s Geralt simply cannot get enough of leaving their friends and the entire world in mortal peril while they sneak in a quick round of cards, and I love them for it. Way back when the Wild Hunt released, there was a special edition kicking about that gave you a few decks for Gwent - the fleshed-out, playable card distraction that ended up being responsible for some of the game’s best moments. I pined for those decks, but I never acquired them. Now, Hatchette Board Games is putting out a full physical edition of Gwent next year.</p>
<p>The set contains "over 400 cards and a playmat" for £44/$39.99. I’m still recovering from various Fantasy Flight LCGs, so my value sense for this stuff might be a bit skewed, but that strikes me as incredibly reasonable. A good Gwent deck consists of only about 25 cards. They’re not bad cards, either! I’ve got a real pet hate for tabletop versions of videogames that just use in-engine screenshots for the cards, but these ones look to have the proper artwork from the game on them:</p>

<p>Gwent itself has seen a few iterations over the years. There was a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gwent-the-witcher-card-game">standalone online game</a> that I had some fun with for a bit, even if it shattered CDProjekt’s image as the ‘No Microtransactions, Free DLC and a Back Massage’ studio by having the most nefarious loot box animation I’d ever encountered. Then there was the rather good <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/thronebreaker-the-witcher-tales">Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales</a>, which wove Gwent into a single-player story. Brendy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/thronebreaker-the-witcher-tales-review">quite liked it</a>.</p>
<p>You can read the full press release <a href="https://www.hachetteboardgames.co.uk/gwent-announcement">here</a>, if you’d like. This one is supposed to be out Q3 of next year.

But there are some things the game doesn’t tell you, and a few lessons I’ve learned from playing it. So here are some adventuring tips to help you succeed in Indy’s latest adventure.</p><h2 id="h52148"><a id=""></a><strong>Follow the main quest</strong></h2><p>You’ll unlock important features, outfits, and more that will help you explore the large maps more thoroughly. And don’t worry, you can return to maps and finish up exploring once the credits roll. </p><h2 id="h52149"><a id=""></a>Turn down the music and turn up the voices</h2><p>The default audio mix in <em>Great Circle</em> is very music-heavy and while I enjoy the game’s soundtrack, I had trouble hearing Troy Baker’s Indy when playing. So I dropped the in-game music down about 10 points and upped the voice acting level by around 10. </p><h2 id="h52150"><a id=""></a><strong>Always be eating!</strong></h2><p>Food is very important in <em>Great Circle</em>. Bread can give you extra health, letting you take more hits in a fight. Fruit, meanwhile, gives you extra stamina, helping you throw more punches or climb for longer, so always eat a ton of it.

You can whip enemies to stun them or even remove their weapons. If you get surprised by an enemy, whip them, steal their dropped weapon, and then beat them with it. </p><h2 id="h52153"><a id=""></a><strong>Also, crack that whip to scare dogs</strong></h2><p>You don’t have to kill dogs in<em> Great Circle. </em>Instead, just crack the whip near them and they’ll run away scared. </p><h2 id="h52154"><a id=""></a>Thoroughly look at all items when solving puzzles</h2><p>There are a lot of puzzles to solve in <em>Great Circle, </em>and a few times I found myself stumped. In these instances I found the answer, or a clue at least, by checking out the notes and items associated with the puzzle a bit more thoroughly. Indy can examine these things and even spin them around. Do that! </p><p>I’ve found notes, markings, and other clues on the backs of many objects, and that helped me solve hard puzzles. </p><h2 id="h52155"><a id=""></a><strong>Don’t go alone, always bring a weapon</strong></h2><p>Whenever possible, try to carry a weapon. These are very useful as you can knock out enemies with one hit if you sneak up behind them, but you can also use them in fistfights to gain an advantage. </p><figure id="" data-id="149d94f6788c9bd068da9be9f7dc1dc7" data-recommend-id="image://149d94f6788c9bd068da9be9f7dc1dc7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Xbox / Bethesda</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="149d94f6788c9bd068da9be9f7dc1dc7" data-recommend-id="image://149d94f6788c9bd068da9be9f7dc1dc7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h52156"><a id=""></a>Sneak around, don’t fight</h2><p>While you might want to punch and shoot your way through the game, you’re better off sneaking around.

Sometimes you’ll make a mistake and everyone will come running to kick your ass. Don’t fight them off; instead just run away and find a bush or room to hide in. Within a few moments, they’ll give up and you can walk back out and continue adventuring. </p><h2 id="h52158"><a id=""></a><strong>Use fast-travel signs</strong></h2><p>While it’s a lot of fun to explore the big maps in the game, don’t be afraid to use fast travel when hunting around for the last few secrets or side quests. To use fast travel, look for signposts found in  the map (they sparkle a little) and click where you want to go. Keep in mind you need to have been to a spot at least once to fast-travel there.</p><h2 id="h52159"><a id=""></a><strong>Walk around with your journal out</strong></h2><p>Indy’s journal  is very useful, as when you have it open in map mode the game will put objective markers in the world. This will help you get to where you need to go. </p><h2 id="h52160"><a id=""></a>Don’t forget to actually buy those upgrades you collect</h2><p><em>Great Circle</em> lets you find books that will help improve Indy’s abilities and stats. However, remember that just picking up and collecting a book isn’t enough. You still need to open your journal, flip over to upgrades, and use Adventure Points to buy and unlock the collected upgrade. It’s a bit odd, but worth remembering. </p><h2 id="h52161"><a id=""></a>Also, use your camera to get extra Adventure Points</h2><p>While you earn upgrade points by completing missions and quests, you also score some from taking photos of important people, places, or events. Keep an eye out for the camera icon in the top left of the screen and pull yours out whenever it pops up. Then look around for whatever special thing can be photographed and snap a pic for points.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p><strong>LATEST UPDATE 4:25pm EST:</strong> Path of Exile 2 still isn’t available for players hoping to enjoy the start of early access  as more issues have come up for the developers.  The game’s official social media account posted, “We’ve run into the same symptom again with a different problem. We are working on fixing it again but regrettably every time this happens we have to restart and wipe the databases to prevent them getting into bad or corrupted states. We’ll have a fix out as soon as we can!”</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>ORIGINAL</strong>: The early access launch of Path of Exile 2 has been delayed due to database</p>



<p>The game was originally scheduled to launch at 2pm EST. Just before that time, and with a larger than expected number of players eager to jump into the game, developer Grinding Gear Games decided to do “last minute database upgrades” in order to allow the game’s servers to handle the influx of players. </p>



<p>The delay comes hours after the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/path-of-exile-ii-queue-warning-issued/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">developers warned of long queue times</a> for players on launch day.</p>



<p>After the database configuration was deployed, the <a href="https://x.com/pathofexile/status/1865098006934229066" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">team said</a> that it would only take a “half hour” to get access restored to the game. Unfortunately, that wasn’t the case after another issue was found within the game.</p>



<p>First, there was a crash that “would have affected a majority of users” that was fixed and being deployed before final checks. Following stating that the release was “relatively imminent”, yet another problem arose for the game.</p>



<p>“We’ve run into a configuration problem and need to restart the realm,” they said. “The problem we ran into was due to adding more database shards in the last minute to try to support the massive player numbers. Unfortunately there was an issue which caused multiple characters to have the same character id.”</p>



<p>As of publishing, not only is the early access launch delayed but the <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3594080" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">game’s website</a> has been going offline due to players looking for updates.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming will provide an update when Path of Exile 2 is functioning and available.</p>

The PS5 Pro doesn't seem to offer any different options, rather just combining the target resolution and frame rate of the two options on the base PS5.</p><h2>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 PC Specs</h2><ul><li>Average performance: 1080 @ 30fps</li><li>Processor: Intel Core i5-8400 / AMD Ryzen 5 2600</li><li>Memory: 16GB RAM</li><li>Graphics: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 (6GB) / AMD Radeon RX 580</li><li>Storage: 100GB SSD</li><li>OS: Windows 10 64-bit or newer</li></ul><h3>Recommended 1080p (medium)</h3><ul><li>Average performance: 1080p @ 60fps</li><li>Processor: Intel Core i5-13600K / AMD Ryzen 5 7600X</li><li>Memory: 24GB RAM</li><li>Graphics: Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 / AMD Radeon RX 660 XT</li><li>Storage: 100GB SSD</li><li>OS: Windows 10 64-bit or newer</li></ul><h3>Recommended 1440p (medium)</h3><ul><li>Average performance: 1080p @ 60fps</li><li>Processor: Intel Core i5-13600K / AMD Ryzen 5 7600X</li><li>Memory: 24GB RAM</li><li>Graphics: Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti / AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT</li><li>Storage: 100GB SSD</li><li>OS: Windows 10 64-bit or newer</li></ul><h3>Recommended 1080p (high)</h3><ul><li>Average performance: 1080 @ 30fps</li><li>Processor: Intel Core i5-12600K / AMD Ryzen 7 5800X</li><li>Memory: 32GB Ram</li><li>Graphics: Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 Super / AMD Radeon RX 5700</li><li>Storage: 100GB SSD</li><li>OS: Windows 10 64-bit or newer</li></ul><h3>Recommended 1440p (high)</h3><ul><li>Average performance: 1440 @ 60fps</li><li>Processor: Intel Core i7-13700K / AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D</li><li>Memory: 32GB Ram</li><li>Graphics: Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 / AMD Radeon RX 7800 XT</li><li>Storage: 100GB SSD</li><li>OS: Windows 10 64-bit or newer</li></ul><h3>Best (ultra)</h3><ul><li>Average performance: 1440 @ 60fps / 2160p @ 30fps</li><li>Processor: Intel Core i7-13700K / AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D</li><li>Memory: 32GB Ram</li><li>Graphics: Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 / AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT</li><li>Storage: 100GB SSD</li><li>OS: Windows 10 64-bit or newer</li></ul><h2>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 console details</h2><h3>Xbox Series S</h3><ul><li>Resolution: 1080p</li><li>Target performance: 30fps</li><li>Upscaling technology: N/A</li></ul><h3>Xbox Series X (performance)</h3><ul><li>Resolution: Upscaled 1440p</li><li>Target performance: 60fps (unlocked with VRR)</li><li>Upscaling technology: AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution</li></ul><h3>Xbox Series X (fidelity)</h3><ul><li>Resolution: Upscaled 2160p</li><li>Target performance: 30fps</li><li>Upscaling technology: AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution</li></ul><h3>PlayStation 5 (performance)</h3><ul><li>Resolution: Upscaled 1440p</li><li>Target performance: 60fps (unlocked with VRR)</li><li>Upscaling technology: AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution</li></ul><h3>PlayStation 5 fidelity (performance)</h3><ul><li>Resolution: Upscaled 2160p</li><li>Target performance: 30fps</li><li>Upscaling technology: AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution</li></ul><h3>PlayStation 5 Pro</h3><ul><li>Resolution: Upscaled 2160p</li><li>Target performance: 60fps (unlocked with VRR)</li><li>Upscaling technology: PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution</li></ul><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-preorder-guide/1100-6522984/" data-ref-id="1100-6522984" data-mce-href="/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-preorder-guide/1100-6522984/">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</a> is a first-person action game taking place in a medieval setting, and is the follow-up to 2018's Kingdom Come Deliverance.

            <p>Where were you during the Summer of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doronko-wanko">Doronko Wanko</a>? Why, I remember it like it was March, and not actually Summer, when the delightful <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doronko-wanko">free game</a> about a mucky pomeranian was unleashed into the world. Yep, yep. It was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bandai-namco-would-like-you-to-have-a-free-dog">definitely March</a>. Roughly translating to ‘covered in mud doggy’, the game set you the task of racking up tangible financial damage to your owner’s house by getting mud everywhere - first by normal dog means, and then with giant mud cannons. You can grab it for free on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2512840/DORONKO_WANKO/">here</a>.</p>
<p>It stole our hearts, it did. And talking of stealing things and having a good time doing it, it’s also releasing on the Nintendo Switch soon, which means the Steam version of Doronko Wanko is getting some free DLC to celebrate. It isn’t arriving until next Spring, but it’s bringing three new mystery dog breeds with it when it does.</p>

<p>There’s not much information outside that so far, I’m afraid, although it has been nice to see such a lovely reception to such a fun free offering. It shot up to ‘overwhelmingly positive’ quite quickly on Steam. My current favourite review on there describes it as a “reverse <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/powerwash-simulator">PowerWash Simulator</a>”.</p><p>The game was released with two other freebies as part of Bandai Namco’s 2023 New Employee Training Project, which lets new hires get experience and support releasing smaller projects before moving them up to bigger games. It felt like the rare ‘entirely depressing caveat free’ bit of gaming news, basically. Although I’m sure one of you bastards will find a way to ruin it for me.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

We saw how a rebellion erupted in a separate Silo—Silo 17—resulting in people defiantly venturing to the outside world only to be killed by the noxious air. Since then, we’ve seen Juliette Nichols (Rebecca Ferguson) walk through what could be the future for Silo 18, the Silo she left: dead bodies strewn outside, “Lies” scrawled across the monitor the Silo people use to see the outside world, and darkness. </p><p>Ever since the people of Silo 18 watched Juliette become the first person to successfully walk outside and survive at the end of the first season, the Silo’s mayor, Bernard Holland (Tim Robbins), has been using every manipulative tactic at his disposal to prevent an uprising among people who have been told their entire lives that life outside the Silo isn’t safe. He’s arrested individuals for painting Juliette’s initials on the walls as a sign of reverence, lied about her using new tape his team developed to block the poisonous air from entering her suit, hired actors to publicly challenge him so he can dismiss their opinions as ramblings compared to his deceitful proclamations of hope, and coerced Judge Mary Meadows (Tanya Moodie) into supporting his lies to pacify the people with false promises of this new tape ushering in a new day. </p><p>What he did in episode four might be both his most dastardly deception and his most effective one. </p><h3 id="h113566"><a id=""></a>What happened to Judge Mary Meadows?</h3><figure id="" data-id="d1fa2a75cc32f69ba886fe790532d79b" data-recommend-id="image://d1fa2a75cc32f69ba886fe790532d79b" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="1606" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Tanya Moodie waiting for her suit" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Tanya Moodie waiting for her suit" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Apple</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d1fa2a75cc32f69ba886fe790532d79b" data-recommend-id="image://d1fa2a75cc32f69ba886fe790532d79b" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="1606" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Tanya Moodie waiting for her suit" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>After Bernard’s brooding enforcer Robert Sims (Common) questions Judge Meadows’ fidelity to the lie, he attempts to remove her from her place of influence with Bernard by having people call for her impeachment. While he simply wanted her sidelined, Bernard saw a more vile opportunity to both silence her and distract people from looking for the truth about the Silo.</p><p>Meadows only went along with Bernard’s plan in exchange for a suit designed to keep her safe when she exits the Silo, a promise he dangled in front of her until the end. Under the guise of a friendly dinner before handing her over her suit, Bernard poisoned the food she ate in an effort to “unite the Silo.” How her death would help accomplish that wasn’t clear until he offered Knox (Shane McRae) and Shirley (Remmie Milner), the two people leading the silent rebellion against Bernard, the chance to come see Judge Meadows. When they arrive in her office to see her dead with a knife in her chest, they quickly realize they’ve been set up to be pinned as the murderers of the Silo’s judge. </p><p>Soon after, Sims incited a manhunt for the accused killers, telling an angry mob that the two had killed Meadows for refusing to open the Silo’s air lock, and proclaiming it the duty of every Silo member to find them. That’s one way to bring people together.</p><p>With Juliette trying to assemble a suit so she can get back to Silo 18 and stop a rebellion that would lead to the deaths of its residents, the embers of fiery hatred have already been stoked, and there might not be much time left to prevent the inevitable.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Meanwhile, in the same 12 months, Konami also released <em>Silent Hill: The Short Message</em>, a first-person horror game that wasn’t very good and which most people likely forgot about within weeks of playing it. At least it was free and short. </p></div><div><p>The original <em>Test Drive Unlimited</em> was awesome and was in many ways the predecessor to <em>Forza Horizon</em>’s big open worlds.<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/test-drive-patch-notes-free-car-unlimited-solar-crown-1851689819&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/test-drive-patch-notes-free-car-unlimited-solar-crown-1851689819"><em>Solar Crown</em></a></span>, on the other hand, is a buggy disaster that players don’t enjoy and which wasn’t even playable for a few days at launch due to server problems.<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/paid-early-access-pre-order-madden-star-wars-outlaws-1851596675#:~:text=I%20also%20want,2024.%20It%20sucks.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/paid-early-access-pre-order-madden-star-wars-outlaws-1851596675#:~:text=I%20also%20want,2024.%20It%20sucks."> It also had three different release dates based on how much you paid</a></span>. Bleh. </p></div><div><p><em>TMNT Mutant Mayhem</em> is a fantastic movie with one of my favorite fight scenes from recent memory. <em>Wrath of the Mutants</em>, on the other hand, is just a quick and barebones port of the 2017 arcade game that has a title that sort-of-sounds like the popular movie. So yeah, this is just a bland cash grab. There are much better <em>TMNT </em>games to play instead of this. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/walking-dead-destinies-new-game-bad-kong-game-mill-1851032588?_gl=1*1v0d7zk*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMzUwMTEyNS44NS4xLjE3MzM1MTI2NzMuNS4wLjA.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/walking-dead-destinies-new-game-bad-kong-game-mill-1851032588?_gl=1*1v0d7zk*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMzUwMTEyNS44NS4xLjE3MzM1MTI2NzMuNS4wLjA.">Another high-quality title from publisher Game Mill</a></span>. </p></div><div><p>This horror game was made by one person, so credit to them: They shipped a mostly working game. That’s not easy. But <em>Pneumata </em>isn’t very good, with poor level design, bad enemy AI, and not many scares. </p></div><div><p>This is a very pretty-looking game that lets you drive around Barcelona as a taxi driver. Sadly, it’s not much fun to drive, offers little depth, and there are much better transportation sims out there. Also, as a <em>Crazy Taxi</em> fan, this game lacks Offspring music and big jumps. Boo. </p></div><div><p>The good: <em>Looney Tunes</em> characters are still funny and charming in <em>Wacky World of Sports</em>. The bad: Everything else. This co-op sports game plays poorly, has only four sports to choose from, and looks like it fell out of 2015. Avoid and watch some clips of Bugs and Daffy on YouTube instead. Oh hey, look, this game was also published by Game Mill. Hmmm.</p></div><div><p>If you Google<em> Jujutsu Kaisen: Cursed Clash, </em>you’ll find a lot of people calling it the worst anime game released in years and bragging about how they refunded it quickly. Others are warning people to not buy it. I’ll quote one negative Steam review: “<em>Roblox JJK</em> games are more worthy of your time.” </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Weeks before its launch, technical director Yukata Ito shared a photo of the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/YutakaIto_RGG/status/1745050214476677561">game's source code</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.

He noted the hurdles aspiring developers can face when they try learning from their established peers, and hoped his thread would help future devs see how programming can be "surprisingly simple."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Programming manager Tomoaki Nakamura similarly acknowledged how common secrecy is in game development, and how people assumed there was "some kind of special programming" used for the Like a Dragon games. He hopes that by showing RGG uses "ordinary" C++, it proves the language "is enough for anyone to be able to make a game."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Ito, graduates who apply at Sega don't know C++. However, he believes they </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>should, </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">since a "lot of high-end titles" are made in the technical language. "If you want to be involved in console game development," he suggested, "it’s a good idea to gain experience creating games in C++ while you’re still a student."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">By his own admission, that thread "pushed the limits" on what RGG is allowed to make public. But he stressed the move was made with consultation from each team before showing the source code, including the programmer who wrote it. The parts he chose were "relatively clean," which he hoped would make for good reactions, and be intentionally beginner-friendly.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Like a Dragon, like a programmer">Like a Dragon, like a programmer</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Like a Dragon games release on a near-yearly basis, and sometimes two games per year. To help onboard newcomers and "resolve issues as soon as they come up," RGG veterans (programming and otherwise) are often placed next to newer staff to foster easier communication.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I always tell our new programmers to respect people in other teams," Ito explained to Automaton. "I instruct them to...try to to be considerate towards the other party. This kind of reliable attitude makes the designers and planners more inclined to consult with the programmers, and I believe this is very beneficial for interpersonal relationships in the studio."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We require our programmers at RGG to not only work as instructed," he continued, "but to form and voice their own opinions on the game’s design and contribute towards improving the game, so we train them in this area as well."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To aspiring programmers, Ito said the profession is for anyone "as long as they have learned the basics of programming. [It's] not only for those who have studied it professionally.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/digital-extremes-soulframe-devstream-showcases-companions-new-social-hub-more/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Digital Extremes did a <a href="https://wccftech.com/digital-extremes-double-devstream-confirmed-warframe-1999-soulframe-pre-alpha/">devstream</a> that revealed some of the features that players can look forward to in Soulframe Preludes (Pre-Alpha) in December. The features contain companion summoning, a social hub for players, environmental hazard mechanics and more. For those interested in the full devstream, you can watch it below, where they go into detail about the features that you can expect in December. If you don't want to watch the whole thing, there is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXOinkXxJrs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">small teaser trailer</a> that showcases some of the features you can expect, such as a new Omen Beast and a rideable wolf mount.</p>
<p><iframe title="Soulframe Devstream #3" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dvLYxzGtfNc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Diving into the devstream content, they've mentioned some of the updates that will be available in December, which provides a new level of difficulty to the game, as well as some familiar content being added which was revealed at TennoCon 2024. Having a social hub in a game like this is always beneficial, and you can see them in Warframe, as well as games like Destiny 2 and World of Warcraft, for example. In Soulframe, you will be able to experience the first player social hub called Silent Rose Cave. In this social hub, players will be given the opportunity to chat with NPCs and get to know them better, accept new side quests to embark on, as well as the opportunity to meet other Envoys that you may want to party up with before you go on your next adventure.</p>
<p>Additionally, you'll be able to join the hunt in Orengall's new Fable, where you'll be given the option to forge a new pact with the wolf. If you're someone who likes to jump into group content and deal some damage in dungeons, they'll now have an extra layer of difficulty. While you may have found that the dungeons were a bit easy in the past, they will now have new environmental hazards, such as acid or poison on the floor. There will be additional challenges that you'll have to contend with in the crooked corridors, and this will change how you navigate through the dungeon.</p>
<p>Finally, the Envoy character creation, which was showcased at <a href="https://wccftech.com/soulframe-looks-promising-in-new-tennocon-showcase-digital-extremes-will-talk-a-lot-more-about-it-in-2024/">TennoCon 2024</a>, will now be available and playable for those who want to add their own personal touch to their envoy. Of course, with such an expansive update, there will also be other quality-of-life improvements from members of the community who have already played the game. This includes fixing the combat tree UI and reworking the potion system in Soulframe Preludes.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/riot-games-announces-project-k-card-games-based-on-league-of-legends<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Riot Games has announced that <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/league-of-legends" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>League of Legends</em></a> is getting the card game treatment. The latest addition to the beloved franchise is called Project K, and its launch will include official organized play support.</p>

<h2>The Project K Announcement</h2>

<p>The announcement of Project K was made via an official video on Riot Games' YouTube channel. The game is a competitive experience, similar to <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/disney-lorcana" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Disney Lorcana</em></a>, just with characters and locations from <em>League of Legends</em>. It will support 1v1, 2v2, and four-player free-for-all games.</p>


<p>According to game director Dave Guskin and executive producer Chengran Chai, the game is being developed by a small team within Riot Games. In addition, this is not a physical version of its digital card game <em>Legends of Runeterra</em> but an original experience that draws from the deep lore and characters of the franchise.</p>

<p>The trailer shows some of the cards. There are familiar faces such as Jinx, Viktor, Volibear, and Yasuo as well as recognizable locations like Zaun. Each of the characters appear to have two different colors, but there don't appear to be any resources like <em>Magic: The Gathering's</em> mana. This is speculation since the game is still in development.</p>

<p>In the latter half of the video, Chai mentions that organized play will be supported for <em>Project K</em> at launch. This will include local play events at hobby shops, competitive events up to the national level, and even global tournaments.</p>

They already have a publishing partner for the game's release in China in early 2025. A global launch is planned, but they are currently seeking publishers for the US and EU.</p>

<p><em>Project K</em> is the latest expansion to the <em>League of Legends</em> series. The iconic MOBA has seen single-player spin-offs like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/mageseeker-league-of-legends-story" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Mageseeker</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/ruined-king-league-of-legends-story" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Ruined King</em>,</a> the upcoming <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/2xko" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>2XKO</em></a> fighting game, and the critically acclaimed animated series <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/more-league-of-legends-shows-on-way" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Arcane</em></a>.</p>
