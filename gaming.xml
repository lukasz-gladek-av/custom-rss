They can all run <em>Doom, </em>and naturally, so can Nintendo’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24273422/nintendo-alarmo-review-alarm-clock">adorable Alarmo alarm clock</a>. It was only a matter of time before someone pulled that off, but what I didn’t expect was that when it happened, it would be playable.</p></div><p>That’s exactly what hacker GaryOberNicht, who recently <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24283916/sound-the-alarmo">figured out how</a> to run custom firmware on the Alarmo, did in a video <a href="https://social.treehouse.systems/@garyodernichts/113414373708017840">posted to Mastodon</a> and <a href="https://x.com/GaryOderNichts/status/1852753537001718021">their X account</a> yesterday. In it, they play by turning or pressing the mushroom-shaped blob on top of the Alarmo to move and pressing the other buttons to shoot or open doors. Here, have a look:</p><p>Gary <a href="https://social.treehouse.systems/@garyodernichts/113414374157540351">said</a> it’s “possible to load the shareware version of Doom entirely from USB, without modifying the Alarmo.” And they’ve put the software and instructions for running it <a href="https://github.com/GaryOderNichts/alarmo_doom">on Github</a>, so almost any sufficiently knowledgeable and determined Alarmo owner can do it, too. Best of all, it can be done without opening the clock up at all.</p><p>How did they pull this off? Gary explains in a <a href="https://garyodernichts.blogspot.com/2024/10/looking-into-nintendo-alarmo.html">blog post</a> that after another person called Spinda <a href="https://x.com/_spinda/status/1845279277304119318">hacked the Alarmo</a> (with a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23433594/flipper-zero-hacking-gadget-wireless-pentesting-open-source-antenna">Flipper Zero</a>) and dumped the firmware from memory, Gary worked out a method that uses a USB mode and the USB-C port to point the Alarmo to custom external firmware, instead. </p><p>Given how easy it appears to be reproduce what Gary has done, Alarmo software modding almost certainly won’t just stop at <em>Doom</em>. Of course, how far any online community efforts to turn the Alarmo into a bizarro game console will get probably depends on how Nintendo, which has been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/24272743/nintendo-retro-game-corps-russ-crandall-profile-youtube-emulation-dmca-takedown-copyright-strike">particularly active</a> with its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/4/24090357/nintendo-yuzu-emulator-lawsuit-settlement">copyright</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/1/24259791/nintendo-ryujinx-switch-emulator-gdkchan-removed-downloads-github">disputes</a> lately, feels about it. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Longtime fans have theories on everything from Springfield existing in its own space-time bubble, to Marge’s family financially supporting them, to the idea that they’re actually all geniuses. One particular theory that’s become popular on TikTok is that the family is Black.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195618" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Unboxing The Baldur’s Gate 3 Collector’s Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="376" data-playlist="195618,197298,197284" data-current="195618"><div><p>Unboxing The Baldur’s Gate 3 Collector’s Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Technically, producers have never confirmed a specific race for the Simpsons, but most viewers assume they’re meant to be white. However, Black fans have been watching closely over the years and have been picking up on some interesting cultural traits.</p><p>TikTok user <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@cocoabutterofficial/video/7262069050564529450?is_from_webapp=1&amp;sender_device=pc&amp;web_id=7432343879984645662&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@cocoabutterofficial/video/7262069050564529450?is_from_webapp=1&amp;sender_device=pc&amp;web_id=7432343879984645662" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cocoabutterofficial</a></span>, pointed out that Marge has an afro, which is why she and the kids have textured hair that grows upward. The clip also notes that Marge’s sisters, Patty and Sema, are “two cigarette smoking Black aunties” who have no time for the way Homer treats their younger sister.</p><p>We’ve also got theories about Marge’s hair, as we’ve seen her change it up in flashbacks and special episodes, much the way Black women like to do. Plus, the way Marge holds her chaotic family down gives Black mom energy. </p><p>Meanwhile, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@iamthekayelle/video/7205686816358288682?is_from_webapp=1&amp;sender_device=pc&amp;web_id=7432343879984645662&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@iamthekayelle/video/7205686816358288682?is_from_webapp=1&amp;sender_device=pc&amp;web_id=7432343879984645662" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iamthekayelle</a></span> also has ideas about Marge’s hair, reminding everyone that she wears bonnets to bed. But the real proof is found in a scene where she cuts the kids’ hair and saves it in the freezer. They think this could point to her creole origins.</p><p>In the post’s comments, someone brought up Marge’s family as proof, replying, “her sisters? her Mom, yeah they black.” While another pointed to her original last name, Bouvier, writing, “She creole fa sho w that French maiden name.”</p><p>Perhaps the most obvious example of them all comes in the Season 21 episode “The Color Yellow.” While working on a school project, Lisa discovers that her ancestor Eliza tried to help Virgil, a runaway slave, escape North. When the child fails, her mother Mabel is the one who gets him to Canada, where they married and start a family. These are the Simpsons they’re actually descended from. So apparently, it’s already canon that they have a Black ancestor.</p><p>Here’s the thing, we’re talking about cartoon characters in a fantastical setting where ridiculous things are constantly happening. Honestly, the Simpsons can be whatever you need them to be. So, if you need Homer to secretly be rich, or for it to all be a dream taking place in his head, or for the whole series to be one giant time loop, that’s fine. The important thing to remember is that my version of Springfield and its residents doesn’t diminish yours, so there’s no need for more intense fans to go on the attack just because we’re having fun exploring a cool, interesting fan theory.</p><p>If this has put you in the mood for a rewatch, you can relive the series’ entire run on Disney+.</p><p><em>This story originally appeared on The Root, our sister site, on Tuesday, November 1.</em></p><p><em>.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

However, with 2014’s <em>Inquisition</em>, it seemed more vital than ever that BioWare not do this, as the studio ended that game with a devastating cliffhanger that saw your hero, the Inquisitor, locked in a battle of ideals with Solas, the elven mage party member who, at the game’s conclusion, is revealed to be an elven god. Surely, I thought, switching to a new protagonist now and sidelining the hero through whom we’d become so engaged in this conflict would result in a failure to do right by this story I’d been waiting a decade to see conclude. I’m happy to say I was wrong.

However, the game’s handling of trans identity goes beyond just options you can choose in the character creator that may support your own personal headcanon. In <em>The Veilguard</em>, BioWare has given you the option to actively declare in-game that your hero is transgender, in a way that’s reflected in dialogue throughout the game.

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Dragon Age Origins is celebrating its 15-year anniversary today, November 3, 2024. Below, we examine its role as a daring, if awkward, attempt to use sex as a central theme and mechanic.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Sex and video games have always had an uneasy relationship. Playing smut on the Atari 2600 feels like looking at middle-school scrawlings. Much of the pornography peddled on Steam is embarrassing and unattractive. Even more mainstream games in the modern era have had a fraught relationship with sex. The tame scenes in Mass Effect infamously got a paranoid Fox News report. Recent years have seen recording romantic scenes in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/larian-investigating-annoying-and-uncool-xbox-bans-for-baldurs-gate-3-explicit-video-uploads/1100-6520116/">Baldur's Gate 3 net players temporary Xbox bans</a>. In such an environment, it is hard to imagine a mainstream game having a bold depiction of sex. But 20 years ago, Dragon Age: Origins took a daring, if flawed, swing at it.</p><p dir="ltr">Dragon Age: Origins is still a weird mix. The basic plot is downright Tolkien-esque: a fellowship of warriors from across the land are driven together to stop "the blight," a horde of demon creatures dedicated to destroying all free life. In practice, however, the game takes most of its dramatic cues from A Song of Ice and Fire (the books, not Game of Thrones). Nobleman Loghan leaves boy king Cailan to die, triggering a violent succession crisis. Magic, while more commonplace than in Westeros, is marginalized, feared, and policed. Even the blight itself resembles the white walkers, i.e. a fundamental existential threat from the natural world.</p><p dir="ltr">In other words, Dragon Age: Origins, even as it holds on to high-fantasy ideas like ancient elves and underground dwarven metropolises, has a strong dark-fantasy bent. This extends somewhat to its treatment of sex and romance. Like its influences, DA:O's approach is largely heterosexual, interested in bloodlines, parentage, and, well, impregnation. This manifests in fairly tame ways, like companion Templar Alistair's claim to the throne, and in absurd ones, like the witch Morrigan begging the player to impregnate her with the spirit of the archdemon, leader of the blight. If you play as a man, she propositions you directly, but if you are a woman you must, even more comically, find someone else for her to sleep with.</p><p dir="ltr">In this moment, sex is transactional. It serves a purpose but is not necessarily about romance or love. Morrigan propositions a male player character even if she's left the party. She'll sleep with characters she finds despicable and unattractive. It's a means to an end. In some sense, this is not exactly remarkable. Most sexual encounters in video games are treated as rewards for kindness and play out in endgame cutscenes. The romance is a reward for playing correctly.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="407160685" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

Origins is no exception to this. In fact, it's perhaps an egregious example of how shallow this kind of narrative design can be. No matter how much you antagonize or bully party members, you can win their affection with a set of gifts. There's even paid DLC which fills your inventory with trinkets that max out your party's affections. You can quite literally buy your way into their hearts.</p><p dir="ltr">However, Dragon Age: Origins is good at grounding its characters in politics and a culture that exists outside them. Morrigan's utilization of sex to get power comes from her background as a mage forced to hide from the oppressive church. Mages are discouraged from having children; the prevailing belief is that the more mages there are, the more force must be expended to police them. Morrigan's ritual to trap the archdemon is a massive defiance of that restriction. In other words, the choice to go through with Morrigan's ritual is one that has implications beyond just sex. But the heart of it is the push and pull of consent and vulnerability.</p><p dir="ltr">Morrigan is the most successful example of this kind of characterization, but not the exception. Both of the possible queer romances--the bard Leliana and the assassin Zevron can be romanced by a warden of either gender--are foreigners, hailing from places where the sexual culture is freer and easier. Though religious, Leliana rejects the celibacy of the church. Zevron was raised by sex workers. Alistair's status as a virgin is openly commented on and mocked. All this is to say, Dragon Age: Origin's companions each have a sexual history (or conspicuous lack thereof). This history informs how they treat you and their overall attitude toward sex. Zevran is easygoing and flirtatious, for example, while Alistair is insecure, deflecting, and sarcastic. None of these characters are defined by their sexual orientation or experience, but both inform their characterization throughout the game's entire runtime.</p><p dir="ltr">This is not to say that Dragon Age: Origins handles all this well. To put it lightly, DA:O is immature. In its lighter moments, it has a frankly juvenile sense of humor. It uses sex and violence as a cheap and mostly ineffective means of shock value. Characters stroll out of regular combat encounters soaked in blood, which is so comical that any actual gore has no impact. In the City Elf origin, DA:O handles sexual assault and racist violence callously, as trauma backdrop for the player character's blank slate. Jokes about sex are plentiful, but mostly amount to high-school health-class fodder.</p><p dir="ltr">The encounter with the pirate Isabella is most emblematic of both the game's successes and shortcomings. If you pass a persuasion check, you can sleep with Isabella to earn a subclass (yes, it's all transactional). Other party members can join you. It's not as if there aren't a few big games that feature group sex--you can have a foursome with drow twins in Baldur's Gate 3 after all--but there are fewer where the exact configuration of the encounter depends not just on whether the player character and their partner are game, but on a chain reaction of character psychology and choices. For example, If Alistair and Leliana have been "hardened" by the outcomes of their personal quests, they'll join in. If not, they won't. Isabella will always ask Zevran to participate, regardless of his romantic status with the player. He'll happily oblige... unless Alistair is there, like a bitter bisexual rejecting the advances of a couple at a bar. This moment is better conceptually than in practice, funnier and stranger to read about than to experience. But it also reflects a deeper thinking about each character's sexual ethics and how it relates to every other character.</p><p dir="ltr">There is a further problem, however: Dragon Age: Origins is visually ugly. It is just as dirt brown as a Gears of War game, but without the brutal, comic-book starkness that franchise has. It's going for a kind of grounded grimness but ends up just feeling dirty. Sex scenes are stitled and awkward beyond even the regular woes of the uncanny valley. Characters posing in underwear doesn't feel romantic or erotic as much as it resembles the intimates section of a Sears catalog–albeit with a rustic, medieval theme. Mods can help with this, though they can also yassify the characters beyond all recognition or render DA:O aesthetic far afield from its creators' original intentions.</p><p dir="ltr">Still, despite these shortcomings, DA:O engages with sex in a way that is rare for games of its size and budget. Outside of a couple moments, Baldur Gate's 3 is interested in sex and romance as a vector for character arcs (good!) and as plain wish fulfillment (bad! <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/josh-sawyer-doesnt-like-baldur-gate-3-style-romances-and-thats-part-of-why-he-doubts-a-new-pillars-of-eternity-would-be-a-hit-i-feel-like-im-kind-of-out-of-touch-with-that-audience/" rel="nofollow ">Josh Sawyer shares my assessment</a>). Despite some standout moments in Cyberpunk 2077 (Judy Alveraz's set of side quests are perhaps the best romance of their kind in video games, period), it is also largely juvenile. The streets of Night City are plastered with annoying and tasteless ads, not provocative as much as silly.</p><p dir="ltr">To be sure, there are bright spots. Games like Disco Elysium and Pentiment don't feature the traditional mode of video game romance, but are plugged into their respective worlds' sexual mores and practices. Nevertheless, even in its crassness, its ugliness, Dragon Age: Origins took steps towards a more adult landscape. I can't help but feel that AAA games have regressed since.</p>

It was started by a guy named David Cogen, who you might recognize as the face of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TheUnlockr"><strong>TheUnlockr</strong></a> YouTube channel. At the beginning of this year, after more than a decade as a creator, he decided to open a coffee shop. And still keep being a creator. Somehow.</p><p>I spent an hour with David talking about all this, which turned into <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/20/24273515/coffee-check-david-cogen-unlockr-vergecast"><strong>a really fun episode of <em>The Vergecast</em></strong></a>. But I left David still wondering how he balanced it all —&nbsp;and wondering what I might be able to tell about his priorities from his homescreen. So I asked him to share!</p><p>Here’s David’s homescreen, plus some info on the apps he uses and why:</p><p><strong>The phone: </strong>Pixel 9 Pro. I always switch fully into whatever phone I am making a video about, and as I am very behind on reviews (see the <em>Vergecast</em> episode for more on that), that’s the next one on the docket.</p><p><strong>The wallpaper: </strong>The one that comes on the phone by default. I switch phones so often that I usually don’t change the wallpaper unless it’s obnoxious. In that case, I’ll still grab something minimalistic from Google’s <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.wallpaper&amp;hl=en_US"><strong>Wallpapers</strong></a> app (maybe a landscape to remind me what outside looks like).</p><p><strong>The apps: </strong>Spotify, Phone, Gmail, Chrome.</p><p>I generally have the multiple-clock widget, as it automatically shows me my current time and time back in NYC, which I find incredibly helpful while traveling as much as I do. Otherwise, the tools section has <a href="https://www.notion.com/product"><strong>Notion</strong></a>, which I’m a heavy user of after Evernote got worse and worse over time — it has replaced that, along with Airtable.&nbsp;</p><p>That folder has since expanded recently thanks to the coffee shop as I now have <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.joinhomebase.com%2F"><strong>Homebase</strong></a> for scheduling my baristas, <a href="https://www.poplin.co/"><strong>Poplin</strong></a> to get our cleaning rags picked up and delivered, <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.shopify.com%2F"><strong>Shopify</strong></a> for inventory / POS / sales / obsessive data analyzing, <a href="https://ring.com/"><strong>Ring</strong></a> for all the cameras in the space and to make sure milk deliveries show up on time in the middle of the night (we use a service called <a href="https://odeko.com/"><strong>Odeko</strong></a>, which has a key and brings supplies in / puts the milk in the fridges for us), and <a href="https://www.peerspace.com/"><strong>Peerspace</strong></a> to make sure I can respond to inquiries to rent out the back space.</p><p><em>I also asked David to share a few things he’s into right now. Here’s what he sent back:</em></p><div><ul><li>Probably comes as no surprise, but coffee. Particularly, I’m going to start roasting<strong> </strong><a href="https://coffeecheck.nyc/"><strong>in the coffee shop</strong></a> soon and so I’m looking forward to sourcing beans from various places, getting better at roasting those beans, and tweaking roasts to get different flavors out of them.&nbsp;</li><li>I’m also wanting to take more classes and attend more coffee events to try and learn more about the coffee world and what people in that world are also experimenting with. And eventually figuring out how to balance these two worlds of coffee and YouTube but, you know, first things first.</li></ul></div><p><h3>Crowdsourced</h3></p><p><em>Here’s what the </em>Installer<em> community is into this week.

        <p>"That attitude has remained consistent throughout my works and in Slitterhead."</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Slitterhead creator Keiichiro Toyama says that he and the team at Bokeh Game Studio are committed to "originality", even if that comes at the cost of a game being "a bit rough around the edges".</p>
<p>Toyama - who created <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gravity-rush">Gravity Rush</a>, Silent Hill, and the terrifying Siren series - hasn't released a new game since 2008's Siren: Blood Siren, making this week's launch of Slitterhead especially exciting for horror fans.</p>

<p>Talking to <a href="https://gamerant.com/slitterhead-horror-game-like-silent-hill-toyama/">GameRant</a>, Toyama stressed that he has always fought to ensure that his games feel fresh and unique above all else.</p>
<p>"From the very first Silent Hill, we have maintained a commitment to freshness and originality, even if it means being a bit rough around the edges," Toyama said.</p>
<p>"That attitude has remained consistent throughout my works and in Slitterhead."</p>
<p>Quite what, exactly, Toyama thinks is "rough" about Slitterhead remains to be seen, but thankfully, we don't have to wait long - the highly-anticipated action horror is out later this week, coming to PC via Steam and Epic Games Store, PlayStation 4, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on 8th November 2024.</p><p>Slitterhead was first announced back in 2021. We first got a good look at it last summer, when a developer diary revealed new details about its inaugural title, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/slitterheads-unique-mechanics-include-a-playable-dog">including a sneaky peek at some of the game's enemies, abilities</a>, and - surprise! - the ability to play as a dog, something <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/slitterheads-release-date-and-trailer-have-popped-up-online">reprised in leaked footage in June</a>, too.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The first PlayStation 5 Pro teardown video was shared online today, providing a better look at the new console launching in a few days worldwide.</p>
<p>The video, which was shared on YouTube by Brazilian channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TAG22" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TAG</a>, provides a good look at the console's internal components, cooling solution and more, and it is a very interesting watch even for those who don't speak Portuguese and want to see how much the console differs from the base model.</p>
<p><iframe title="PS5 PRO POR DENTRO 👊😃 | PS5 PRO teardown" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z1VSPgqY7Yw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As confirmed in the teardown video above, the PlayStation 5 Pro features a <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-improvement-repairability/">major repairability improvement</a> that grants easy access to the system's CMOS battery, allowing users to easily swap it out and ensure the console will continue to function normally in case the original battery runs out or becomes defective over time.</p>
<p>While the PlayStation 5 Pro specs were widely known already thanks to the many rumors that circulated online in the past few months, we have learned today that the system features an additional <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-specs-leak-unveils-2-extra-gb-of-ddr5-ram/">2 GB of DDR 5 RAM</a>, which is likely reserved for the OS. As such, developers should be able to utilize 16 GB for games, something that is not possible on the base model because some RAM has to be reserved for the OS.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro launches on November 7th worldwide.</p>

			<p>While the <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/ps5-pro-everything-you-need-to-know-about-sonys-new-console/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PS5 Pro</a> isn't officially out until November 7, some people have started getting their hands on Sony's revised PlayStation 5 console. An unboxing video was posted a couple of days ago and quickly taken down; now, Brazilian content creator Brunno Fast has also managed to secure a console and subsequently <a href="https://x.com/brunno_fast/status/1852829727234379871" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> the full spec sheet document included in the box.</p>
<p>By far the biggest surprise is that Sony added 2GB of DDR 5 RAM. These are likely to be reserved for the OS so that game developers can fully utilize the 16 GB of GDDR6 for the actual games. Beyond that, it's largely what we already knew.</p>

<p>To recap, the PS5 Pro offers 67% greater computing power than the base PS5 in terms of raw TFLOPS. According to Sony, this translates into around 45% faster rendering on average. However, as several developers recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-achieves-significant-performance-improvements-says-dev-the-most-impressive-aspect-is-pssr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pointed out</a>, the console's true ace in the hole is probably PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution, the customized AI-powered upscaling developed by Sony. According to the developers of The First Descendant, it can stand up to the quality of any upscalers, even NVIDIA DLSS.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the PS5 Pro officially launches next Thursday in stores globally. It will be priced at $699/£699/€799.</p>

						<h5>Razer Kraken V4 Pro</h5><p><span>September 2024</span>
					</p></div></div>
					<p>At RazerCon 2024, Razer announced a new entry in its popular Kraken headset series—the Kraken V4 Pro. The pro model joins the new Kraken V4 and V4 X, which were both released back in August of this year. Whereas the V4 X headset is a wired model, the V4 and V4 Pro are wireless offerings offering THX Spatial Audio and Razer Chroma RGB lighting.</p>
<p>The major difference between the two wireless models? The Pro model comes with Razer’s Sensa HD haptics and an OLED control HUB. Another difference is the price tag: the regular V4 sells for $179.99, whereas the Pro model goes for a whopping $399.99. Is this difference justified? Let’s find out.</p>
<figure><figcaption>The Kraken V4 Pro comes with a carry pouch</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Features and Design</strong></p>
<p>Selling for $399.99, Razer's latest outing doesn't come cheap. It's almost double the price of the regular V4 model and $70 more expensive than one of its main rivals, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/steelseries-arctis-nova-pro-wireless-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless</a>.</p>
<p>Razer's premium headset comes with 40mm dynamic bio-cellulose drivers for a natural high-end sound (the regular V4 comes with 40mm Titanium drivers). Like the V4, the Pro model packs Razer's HyperClear Super Wideband microphone and the brand's HyperSpeed Wireless 2.4Ghz tech. In addition, the headset offers support for Bluetooth 5.3 with simultaneous audio. Although the V4 Pro will likely be used wirelessly, the headset can also connect wired via USB Type-A and a 3.5mm jack (on the supplied control HUB).</p>
<figure><figcaption>The OLED hub that comes with Razer's Pro offering</figcaption></figure>
<p>Like the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/steelseries-arctis-nova-5x-wireless-first-class/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arctis Nova 5&nbsp; Wireless</a> from SteelSeries, the sides of the earcups can be distinguished easily through an "L" and "R" print on the fabric inside the earcups, which I prefer over the often tiny and dark-colored letters on the hinges.</p>
<p>The V4 Pro comes with a simple carry pouch, but being Razer's top-line headpiece,&nbsp; I would have expected a more premium carry case (like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/razer-barracuda-pro-missed-opportunity/#:~:text=Boom%20mics%20that%20come%20with,audio%20experience%20in%20most%20circumstances." target="_blank" rel="noopener">Razer's Barracuda Pro model</a>).</p>
<p>The left earcup features the microphone mute button, a status indicator, the volume wheel, a power button, and a USB-C charging port. Both the power button and volume wheel are textured and easily discernable while wearing the headset. On the left, we also find the retractable wideband mic. The right earcup packs the headset's Sensa HD Haptics function button as well as a multifunction button, which allows users to control audio EQ, Bluetooth pairing, and the wireless mode switch button.</p>
<figure><figcaption>Chroma RGB lighting in action</figcaption></figure>
<p>The customizable Chroma RGB lighting adds a nice touch, allowing some personalization to match your gaming setup. While it may not be a game-changer, it does enhance the headset's aesthetic appeal. On the other hand, this might mainly be a feature for streamers, as the user doesn't see the lighting when wearing the headset.</p>
<p><em><span>Sensa HD Haptics</span></em></p>
<p>One of the main features of Razer's premium outing is the brand's Sensa HD Haptics, which aims to enhance the gaming experience. The haptic feedback effectively brings in-game sounds to life, allowing players to feel the rumble of explosions or the subtle vibrations of footsteps nearby. This tactile response can heighten your sense of presence in a game, making those intense moments even more engaging. While the haptics tech works with all audio content, the tech really shines when playing supported games, including Final Fantasy XVI, Silent Hill 2, Once Human, Hitman, MechWarrior 5, as well as the upcoming S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl.</p>
<p>However, while the Sensa HD Haptics is a fun feature, it may not be for everyone. Some users might find it overwhelming or distracting during extended gameplay sessions. Additionally, the overall effectiveness can vary greatly depending on the type of game being played; certain titles really shine with the haptics, while others may not utilize it as effectively.</p>
<p><span><em>OLED Hub</em></span></p>
<p>Another selling point of the Kraken V4 Pro is the supplied OLED hub, which allows for wireless connection between the headset and PC/console and provides real-time information on audio settings, battery life, and even customizable profiles. This makes it easy to monitor and adjust player preferences on the fly.</p>
<p>Through the hub, users can adjust the sound using the Audio EQ, but unfortunately, this is only available for the custom sound profile. Disappointingly, the other EQ profiles can't be modified. To fully configure settings, players will need to download Razer's new Synapse 4 software for PC. This software provides additional options for the headset, including a microphone EQ, additional audio settings, and THX Spatial Audio, which is only available on PC. As such, the Kraken V4 Pro is mainly a PC headset, although advertised as a multi-platform offering.</p>
<p>While the OLED hub is a great visual addition, its practicality might not be fully realized by all users. Some may find that the features, while visually appealing, don’t significantly enhance their gaming experience. Additionally, it requires some setup and may take a little time to get used to for those who prefer simplicity.</p>
<p><strong>Comfort and Sound Performance</strong></p>
<p>Comfort is somewhat of a mixed bag. The memory foam ear cushions provide a decent fit initially, but after a few hours, the headset can start to feel heavy and uncomfortable; after a few hours of usage, I could feel a clear strain on the top of my head. For gamers who often engage in marathon sessions, this can be a significant drawback.</p>
<p>The sound quality that the Kraken V4 Pro is good, although it appears to be focused on competitive gamers. Razer appears to have focused on the midranges in order to allow those players to pinpoint exact positions with plenty of detail. The bass, however, is somewhat modest, even after adjusting the EQ. This can result in some details in the lower sound spectrum being lost, which is unfortunate. Additionally, the lower tones seem a bit unbalanced when compared to the midrange.</p>
<p><span>Microphone</span></p>
<p>The Kraken V4 Pro's microphone offers good enough sound quality; it captures voice well enough, although some might find that it makes your voice sound tinny. Being a premium headset, however, I expected a bit more from this microphone. On the other hand, it's adequate for communication during gaming sessions and works well for casual streaming.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/PXL_20240927_212224046-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><strong>Battery Life</strong></p>
<p>Although not bad, battery life is somewhat of a letdown when using the headset's 'Pro' features. While Razer claims up to 30 hours of use, I found the reality closer to 13 to 15 hours when utilizing both the haptic feedback and RGB lighting. This can be frustrating, particularly during longer gaming sessions, where frequent charging might become a hassle. Granted, when not using RGB lighting and the haptics tech, the battery can last up to roughly 50 hours, but not using the headset's 'Pro' features to save battery shouldn't be as it was intended.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>In summary, while the Razer Kraken V4 Pro offers some appealing features, its high price, subpar battery life, and moderate comfort level make it hard to recommend over more affordable alternatives. On top of that, although advertised as a multi-platform headset, the 'Pro' features are mainly reserved for use on PC.&nbsp; If you’re considering this headset, it’s worth exploring other options that deliver similar performance without breaking the bank.</p>

            <p>
It's been 12 years since <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-iii">Assassin's Creed 3</a> ended the story of Desmond Miles, the series' first recurring modern day protagonist and link between each game until that point. 
</p>
<p>
Now, speaking at a BAFTA event held in London on Friday evening attended by Eurogamer, Assassin's Creed franchise boss Marc-Alexis Coté has reflected on the series' struggles to tell a meaningful, connected narrative ever since - and how this will finally be rectified in future. 
</p>
<p>
"When the Assassin's Creed franchise was created, it introduced a bold and innovative narrative structure, a modern day story arc centred around Desmond that was intertwined with historical adventures," Coté recalled. "Desmond's journey was at the heart of the modern day conflict driving the search for powerful Isu artefacts - Pieces of Eden - that could change the course of history. However, with his death at the end of Assassin's Creed 3, we faced a creative crossroads. 
</p>
<p>
"Ending Desmond's arc was a difficult decision," Coté added, "and afterward, the modern storyline struggled to find its footing."

<p>
Subsequent games initially featured no specific modern day protagonist, before a replacement for Desmond was eventually introduced - Layla Hassan. But the length of time between different games and the shifting teams behind each entry meant the narrative suffered from being too sporadic, too inconsistent, and too repetitive. 
</p><p>
"The continued focus on characters hunting for Isu artefacts made the narrative more predictable," Coté continued, "and reduced the conflict between Templars and Assassins to a straightforward pursuit of control over - let's be honest - magical relics. This shift pulled focus away from what had always been at the heart of the franchise: exploring our history.
</p>
<blockquote>"As this approach became repetitive, both players and critics felt the modern day storyline had become a secondary concern."</blockquote>
<p>
"As this approach became repetitive, both players and critics felt the modern day storyline had become a secondary concern, more of a side-quest, rather than an integral part of the overall experience. Furthermore, the compounded complexity of 15 years of lore built in this parallel storyline created a cognitive load that made the franchise difficult to approach for newcomers."
</p>
<p>
Assassin's Creed games beginning with Shadows will be integrated via a single launcher/hub Ubisoft originally announced as a project titled <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-unity">Assassin's Creed Unity</a>. It's here that ongoing, modern day narrative will be hosted, Ubisoft has said. But why should players simply tuning in for the latest historical adventure care?
</p><p>
"As we move forward, our goal is to put history back at the centre of the players' experience," Coté said. "The modern day narrative will serve to enhance, rather than overshadow, the historical journey. By drawing meaningful contrast between past and present, we aim to restore the balance that was once the hallmark of the franchise. 
</p>
<p>
"The modern day storyline will explore deeper themes of memory, identity and autonomy, how the past shapes who we are, and how controlling this past can impact our future. These themes will allow us to reflect on contemporary issues: freedom versus control, the power of knowledge and the tension between individuality and conformity, all through the lens of history. 
</p>
<p>
"The groundwork for this new direction will take shape with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, which will lay the foundation for this narrative evolution that will grow in the years to come."
</p>
<p>
It's intriguing to hear Coté talk about this secondary narrative as "modern day" here after the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-looks-like-a-cut-assassins-creed-mirage-post-credits-scene-points-to-a-huge-shift-in-the-series-story">mysterious story stinger tucked away in the files of 2023's Assassin's Creed Mirage</a> suggested the series would shift to focus on looking back through history from the far-flung future. Ubisoft is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-mirage-developers-acknowledge-its-mysterious-lore-bending-cut-post-credits-scene">still to fully address what this seemingly-cut ending teaser</a> was due to represent.

            <p>BioWare currently has no plans for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> expansions, according to reports. Instead the studio will support the fantasy RPG with smaller updates and otherwise turn their full attention towards Mass Effect 5.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Rolling Stone <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/dragon-age-the-veilguard-john-epler-interview-1235147001/">report</a> that there are no plans for DLC, in favour of focusing on the next Mass Effect, in a piece speaking with Bioware creative director John Epler. 
</p>
<p>Although Rolling Stone confirm no specific details, IGN <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioware-no-dragon-age-the-veilguard-expansion-dlc-mass-effect-5">report</a> that they understand BioWare intend to release quality-of-life and smaller content updates for The Veilguard, but nothing more.
</p>
<p>BioWare have traditionally supported their games with substantial story DLC. The previous game in the series, Inquisition, received several, including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-age-inquisition-jaws-of-hakkon-dlc">Jaws Of Hakkon</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-age-inquisition-the-descent-dlc">The Descent</a>, and an epilogue, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-ages-inquisition-trespasser-dlc">Trespasser</a>.
</p>
<p>That said, video games are harder than ever to make and The Veilguard already took Nic 50 hours to complete for his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-ages-inquisition-trespasser-dlc">Dragon Age: The Veilguard review</a>. I am personally fine with story-based games being complete at launch, and not getting a bunch of extraneous bottle episodes and post-credits really-real endings post-release.</p>
<p>(Except for Cyberpunk 2077 which I wish had ten more in-development expansions about Idris Elba looking at me sadly.)</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-legends">The Elder Scrolls: Legends</a>, the free-to-play card game set in Bethesda's fantasy world, has been removed from sale on Steam. Its servers will shut down for good on January 30th, 2025, after which it will no longer be playable. The closure comes five years after the game was last updated.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/364470/The_Elder_Scrolls_Legends/">Steam page</a> displays a message at the top that notes it is "no longer available on the Steam store." An in-game message announces the closure.
</p>
<p>"The Elder Scrolls: Legends servers will permanently shut down on January 30, 2025," begins the message. "From now until January 30, 2025, all items in the store and entry into in-game events will be available for 1 gold each, so you can enjoy all the content Legends has to offer. On that date, servers will be shut down and the game will be inaccessible. Thank you for playing and we hope you have enjoyed your time in Legends."
</p>
<p>Brendy wrote in his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elder-scrolls-legends-review">Elder Scrolls Legends review</a> that it "improved on Heathstone in an incremental way", elevated by its rune system and held back by its Elder Scrolls setting. That was in 2017 and ongoing development on updates and expansions ceased <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-elder-scrolls-legends-development-on-hold">just two years later</a>.
</p><p>Obviously Legends never found a huge, adoring audience, but as ever I find it infuriating that live service and free-to-play games are just a slip-and-slide of unpredictable length pointing straight into a bin. No offline mode, no chance of finding an audience in future, just: bin. It's an awful way to treat your customers, and a terrible thing for video game culture in general that so much work is discarded so easily. Is any other medium so shortsighted?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Not to worry; I’ve got you covered for some of the best ones.</p><p>This week’s trailers included a teaser for Netflix’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/31/24284809/squid-game-season-2-teaser-trailer">second season of <em>Squid Game</em></a><em>, </em>a new haunted house horror film from Steven Soderbergh, and a look at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/1/24285689/disney-plus-star-wars-skeleton-crew-trailer-wild-ride"><em>Star Wars: Skeleton Crew</em></a>. Daniel Craig showed up in a trailer for a new A24 movie called <em>Queer.</em> </p><p><h3>Squid Game season 2</h3></p><p><em>Squid Game</em> is finally returning for its second season soon, and in a new teaser, Lee Jung-jae’s Gi-hun looks like he’s preparing to stage an uprising. Whatever happens, it looks like the season will be a bloody, violent return for the dystopian competition on December 26th.</p><p><h3>Star Wars: Skeleton Crew</h3></p><p>I’m very excited that Jude Law’s <em>Star Wars </em>debut, <em>Star Wars: Skeleton Crew, </em>is essentially a swashbuckling pirate adventure. The vibes it’s throwing off feel like a nice blend of <em>The Goonies</em> and <em>Star Trek: Prodigy, </em>and I’m certainly ready. The series debuts December 3rd on Disney Plus.</p><p><h3>Presence</h3></p><p>The moody trailer for Steven Soderbergh’s haunted house horror film <em>Presence </em>doesn’t show the supernatural figure that’s terrorizing Lucy Liu and her suburban family. That’s because it all takes place from the perspective of the ghost itself, which I didn’t realize until I read <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/trailers/presence-trailer-steven-soderbergh-horror-1236195815/"><em>Variety’</em>s write-up of this trailer</a>. It’s already an eerie preview, but knowing that made it much more so on my second viewing. The movie hits theaters on January 24th.</p><p><h3>Queer</h3></p><p>Luca Guadagnino’s <em>Queer, </em>based on William Burroughs’ semi-autobiographical novel of the same name, stars Daniel Craig as William Lee, an American expat who lives in 1950s Mexico City and falls for a younger man named Eugene (Drew Starkey).

            <p>Typing Of The Dead released in arcades 25 years ago remains a masterpiece - funny, absurd, tense, and novel. I am keen on any game that aims to follow in its footsteps, and there are a few. The latest is Blood Typers, a horror game where you tippity-tap on your keyboard to fight montsters in a spooky mansion, but this isn't a rail shooter, so you'll be typing to explore and navigate, too.
</p>
<p>It's now got a release of February 2025, and there's a demo you can play now.

<p>If Typing Of The Dead was a riff on House Of The Dead - almost a mod of it, really - then Blood Typers is most obviously riffing on the original Resident Evil. You're moving around a spooky space, collecting bullets and other resources, managing your inventory, and finding keys to unlock new areas.
</p><p>Three-letter words appear on the ground that when typed cause your character to move to that spot. If there's an interactive element - an item to pick up, ladder to climb, jump to make - you can perform the action by typing a command with a preceding slash, like in text adventures of old. '/climb up' to scale a ladder, for example. You'll also need to use your left and right shift keys to rotate your character, to cast a flashlight into all the dark corners of each room.
</p>
<p>Might I prefer if this was a rail shooter, with movement not your concern? Maybe, but it's undeniably tense knowing that enemies can come from all sides. There are advantages to the more expansive framework, too: aside from different characters with their own skillsets, Blood Typers supporters co-op for up to four players, meaning you can all be clearing rooms together or exploring different parts of the procedural environments.
</p>
<p>You can give the demo a go for yourself <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2790330/Blood_Typers/">over on Steam</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It has been confirmed by Esports Charts that the League of Legends World Championship, which wrapped in London, England tonight, has secured a new esports world record. During the final game of the last series in the tournament, a whopping 6.94 <strong>million </strong>users tuned in worldwide, smashing the records set by last year’s LoL Worlds.</p>



<p>If the power of League of Legends esports wasn’t already evident, this record has cemented it.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-constant-growth">Constant Growth</h2>



<p>League of Legends is, by numbers, the biggest esports title in the world. This monumental event that was capped off with a grand final in London was an eye-opener to the power of esports, even amidst the ‘esports winter’ that’s refusing to fully thaw.</p>



<p>In a report <a href="https://escharts.com/news/2024-league-legends-worlds-record" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">published by Esports Charts</a>, it was confirmed that this final series peaked at 6.94 million viewers, which is a new world record that won’t be beaten any time soon. In the last few weeks, more than 190 million hours of game time were watched, and the average viewership throughout the month-long tournament exceeded 1.7 million.</p>



<p>There are no games out there that do it quite like League of Legends.</p>



<p>The tournament was streamed across various platforms, but it dominated on YouTube. More than half the peak viewer count was logged on the platform, with Twitch sitting in second place, which isn’t all that typical for esports. This is likely because at the start of the year, Twitch revealed it was ‘pulling out’ of South Korea.</p>



<p>This year’s League of Legends World Championship was a wonderful event from start to finish. It heralded the fifth trophy for T1 Esports – and the fifth for Lee ‘Faker’ Sang-hyeok, often considered the GOAT of the esports world.</p>

            <p>Good news, Disney fans - it looks like Disney Music Parade -Encore- is coming to Nintendo Switches outside of Asia.</p>
<p>Initially, Disney Music Parade -Encore- only had confirmed releases in Japan (21st November) and Asia (12th December), although English language support was in place for those prepared to import it.</p>
<p>However, as spotted by the eagle-eyed folks at the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ghz20a/disney_music_parade_encore_rated_by_esrb/">Gaming Leaks and Rumours subreddit</a>, it has just popped up on the <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40237/disney-music-parade-encore/">ESRB</a> website, too… even though there are currently no confirmed plans for a US release.</p>

<p>ESRB's description says Disney Music Parade -Encore- is "a rhythm game in which players match on-screen prompts in time with music. Brief clips from Disney movies will occasionally play in the background".</p>
<p>"A handful of these clips include mild instances of violence (e.g., a character hit by a flaming arrow, a character kicking another person)", but none of this is egregious enough to deter an E for everyone rating.</p>
<p>The listing also confirms that there are no interactive elements, and seemingly no in-game purchases.</p>
