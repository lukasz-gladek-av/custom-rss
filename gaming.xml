Anything depicted in monochrome can be eaten and destroyed.</p><p><em>—Chomp through the obstacles blocking your way!

The more he eats, the more power he regains—and the more ferocious he becomes.</p><p><em>—If he eats too much, Mel will undergo a dramatic transformation.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Shinigami-Hime-to-Ishokan-no-Kaibutsu_2025_11-20-25_051.jpg"></a></figure><p><em>—A giant Mel can chomp down even massive monsters with ease.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Shinigami-Hime-to-Ishokan-no-Kaibutsu_2025_11-20-25_052.jpg"></a></figure><p>The stronger Mel’s power grows, the larger the area he can consume. However, if he becomes too ferocious, he’ll lose control and may become unable to move to other areas, putting Mono in danger.</p><p>You’ll need to decide carefully what Mel should eat so that he doesn’t go berserk.</p><p><em>—If Mel grows too big and too ferocious, he’ll start ignoring Mono’s instructions…!</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Shinigami-Hime-to-Ishokan-no-Kaibutsu_2025_11-20-25_053.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>■ Interfering with the Worlds of Picture Books: Turn Over</strong></p><p>As you progress through your adventure, you will acquire various skills beyond eating and destroying. One of these is Mono’s skill “Turn Over,” which allows her to manipulate the colored parts of the world that Mel cannot eat.</p><p><em>—When you Turn Over a spot where the page is slightly lifted…</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Shinigami-Hime-to-Ishokan-no-Kaibutsu_2025_11-20-25_054.jpg"></a></figure><p><em>—Part of the background will flip open with a whap! revealing hidden passageways and items!</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Shinigami-Hime-to-Ishokan-no-Kaibutsu_2025_11-20-25_055.jpg"></a></figure><p><em>—You can even slip into the shadows behind a turned-over background to evade giant monsters.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Shinigami-Hime-to-Ishokan-no-Kaibutsu_2025_11-20-25_056.jpg"></a></figure><p>By Turning Over parts of the world, you can uncover new paths hidden on the other side—or use the flipped background to hide from enemies. There are many ways to interact with picture-book worlds beyond simply “eating and destroying.”</p><p><strong>■ At The End of Each Stage, You Will Fight a Completely Changed Girl…</strong></p><p>As you progress deeper through each stage, gathering “Memory Bookmarks” that tell the girls’ story, you will encounter a girl transformed by her trauma into a “Shinigami Princess.” Defeat the Shinigami Princess and free the girl from her trauma.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Shinigami-Hime-to-Ishokan-no-Kaibutsu_2025_11-20-25_057.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>■ The First Stage’s Shinigami Princess</strong></p><p><strong>Shepherdess Girl / Ookami Princess</strong> (voiced by Tsunomaki Watame)</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Shinigami-Hime-to-Ishokan-no-Kaibutsu_2025_11-20-25_058.png"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Shinigami-Hime-to-Ishokan-no-Kaibutsu_2025_11-20-25_061.png"></a></figure><p>A girl who has transformed into a giant, sheep-like monster known as the “Ookami Princess.”</p><p>Born as the eldest daughter of a shepherding family, she is a hardworking girl devoted to her family.

Amazon's Black Friday deal shaves $20 off the cover price, dropping it down to just $40 (was $60) for the feature-packed game.</p><div title="6535986 -- Star Wars Outlaws Switch Black Friday 2025" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4896" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6535986 -- Star Wars Outlaws Switch Black Friday 2025" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F79Z9V31?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0F79Z9V31?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F79Z9V31?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20">Star Wars Outlaws (Switch 2 Edition)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F79Z9V31?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0F79Z9V31?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F79Z9V31?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20">$40 (was $60)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Set during the height of the Galactic Empire's reign, Outlaws puts you in the boots of Kay Vess, an opportunistic lawbreaker chasing down a score that'll help pay off the debts she owes to the criminal underworld of Star Wars. The third-person action-adventure unfolds across several planets and outer space, mixing exploration, combat, stealth, and interstellar dogfights together in a way that feels like a polished Star Wars experience.</p><p>This version of the game also includes the two post-launch expansions--Wild Card and A Pirate's Fortune--as well as the Jabba's Gambit DLC mission, Hunter's Legacy bundle, and Cartel Ronin cosmetic packs. One thing to note here is that this is a Game-Key Card version of Star Wars Outlaws, so you'll need to download the game to your Switch 2 after you insert the cart into the system.</p></div>                      </div><p>While the initial PS5, PC, and Xbox versions of Star Wars Outlaws had several issues at launch, developer Massive Entertainment updated the game with several substantial patches that addressed these issues and fixed numerous bugs, resulting in a significantly improved overall experience. The Switch 2 version comes with all these changes already implemented, making it a great time right out of the box--albeit with some graphical concessions to ensure the game runs at a stable 30fps in either Docked or Handheld mode.</p><p>You can also pick the game up on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D187PJHJ?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" rel="nofollow ">PS5</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D18PNXNL?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" rel="nofollow ">Xbox Series X</a>. These versions don't include the two story expansions, but they do come with the Rogue Infiltrator Character Pack cosmetics for Kay and her cute partner-in-crime, Nix.</p><p>Many other video games are seeing big discounts ahead of Amazon's Black Friday deal, so make sure you check <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/black-friday/">GameSpot's Black Friday Deals Hub</a> for more.</p><h2>More Early Black Friday Deals at Amazon</h2><p><strong>Video Game Deals</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://amzn.to/48ivKJW" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5 Game Deals</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/3K5Vm3y" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo Switch Game Deals</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/4p8zbIU" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Series X Game Deals</a></li></ul><p><strong>Video Game Accessory Deals</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://amzn.to/4p2B5eJ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5 Accessory Deals</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/47JNduJ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Switch Accessory Deals</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/4pe08uO" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Accessory Deals</a></li></ul><p><strong>Controller Deals</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://amzn.to/4i06ETu" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Switch 1/2 Controller Deals</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/4oMC9TI" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5 Controller Deals</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/49sUOiJ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Controller Deals</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/3K2LwPQ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Controller Deals</a></li></ul><p><strong>Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter:</strong></p><hr><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/evercade-exp-r-tomb-raider-cartridge-bundle-retro-gaming-amazon-black-friday-deals/1100-6534530/">Evercade Retro Handhelds &amp; Cartridges Get Rare Price Cuts In Amazon's Black Friday Sale</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kirby-air-riders-nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide/1100-6534089/">Kirby Air Riders Buying Guide: Release-Day Delivery Still Available At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/meta-quest-3s-vr-headset-best-black-friday-deals/1100-6532962/">Meta Quest 3S Black Friday Deal - Save Up To $70 And Get $50 Amazon Credit</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-gamecube-third-party-controller-switch-2-pc-amazon-holiday-deal/1100-6532458/">Grab A Wireless GameCube-Style Controller For Switch 1/2 &amp; PC For Only $40</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lunar-remastered-collection-amazon-exclusive-physical-edition-deal-switch-playstation-xbox/1100-6528818/">Amazon-Exclusive Lunar Remastered Collection Gets First Price Cut</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/final-fantasy-magic-the-gathering-set-deals-restock-preorder-buying-guide/2900-6271/">Final Fantasy Magic: The Gathering Deal - Save $45 On Play Booster Box</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-hunger-games-sunrising-on-the-reaping-gift-edition-book-box-set-deals/1100-6535218/">Sunrise On The Reaping New Collector's Gift Edition Is Already Discounted At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-dc-batman-construction-figure-and-bat-pod-bike-the-dark-knight-amazon-deal/1100-6535073/">Lego DC Batman Figure &amp; Bat-Pod Is Over 50% Off At Amazon, Sold Out Everywhere Else</a></li>   </ul> </div>

There is no extra content like the Deluxe Edition. It's not a short adventure by any means, so even the base game offers plenty of content to keep you engaged in its world and combat for hours to come. The game is also identical across PS5 and Xbox, though technical performance is a smidge smoother on Xbox, in case you happen to own both systems.</p>                      </div><p>Hell is Us is a dark and dreary open-world action game that refuses to hold your hand. Compared to other similar games, there are no overwhelming map markers, excessive side quests, points of interest, and so on. Instead, the game encourages you to find your own way through its world without giving you so much as a hint. For some gamers, this may be a hindrance, but seasoned veterans of the genre may appreciate the change. Despite this, the world is much more forgiving than you'd think, and doesn't aim to make exploration too complicated, at least according to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hell-is-us-review-devil-in-the-details/1900-6418402/" data-ref-id="1900-6418402">our 7/10 review by Alessandro Barbosa</a>.</p><p>For more Black Friday deals, check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/black-friday/">GameSpot's hub for all the latest discounts</a> on video games, Blu-rays, anime, and much more.</p><h2>More Early Black Friday Deals at Amazon</h2><p><strong>Video Game Deals</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://amzn.to/48ivKJW" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5 Game Deals</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/3K5Vm3y" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo Switch Game Deals</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/4p8zbIU" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Series X Game Deals</a></li></ul><p><strong>Video Game Accessory Deals</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://amzn.to/4p2B5eJ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5 Accessory Deals</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/47JNduJ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Switch Accessory Deals</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/4pe08uO" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Accessory Deals</a></li></ul><p><strong>Controller Deals</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://amzn.to/4i06ETu" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Switch 1/2 Controller Deals</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/4oMC9TI" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5 Controller Deals</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/49sUOiJ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Controller Deals</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/3K2LwPQ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Controller Deals</a></li></ul><hr><p><strong>Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter:</strong></p><hr><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/evercade-exp-r-tomb-raider-cartridge-bundle-retro-gaming-amazon-black-friday-deals/1100-6534530/">Evercade Retro Handhelds &amp; Cartridges Get Rare Price Cuts In Amazon's Black Friday Sale</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kirby-air-riders-nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide/1100-6534089/">Kirby Air Riders Buying Guide: Release-Day Delivery Still Available At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/meta-quest-3s-vr-headset-best-black-friday-deals/1100-6532962/">Meta Quest 3S Black Friday Deal - Save Up To $70 And Get $50 Amazon Credit</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-gamecube-third-party-controller-switch-2-pc-amazon-holiday-deal/1100-6532458/">Grab A Wireless GameCube-Style Controller For Switch 1/2 &amp; PC For Only $40</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lunar-remastered-collection-amazon-exclusive-physical-edition-deal-switch-playstation-xbox/1100-6528818/">Amazon-Exclusive Lunar Remastered Collection Gets First Price Cut</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/final-fantasy-magic-the-gathering-set-deals-restock-preorder-buying-guide/2900-6271/">Final Fantasy Magic: The Gathering Deal - Save $45 On Play Booster Box</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-hunger-games-sunrising-on-the-reaping-gift-edition-book-box-set-deals/1100-6535218/">Sunrise On The Reaping New Collector's Gift Edition Is Already Discounted At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-dc-batman-construction-figure-and-bat-pod-bike-the-dark-knight-amazon-deal/1100-6535073/">Lego DC Batman Figure &amp; Bat-Pod Is Over 50% Off At Amazon, Sold Out Everywhere Else</a></li>   </ul> </div>

                <p>Modern fighting games are designed for standard gamepads, but nothing matches the precision and feel of a dedicated arcade-style controller--especially the popular all-button "leverless" style fight sticks.

Leverless fight sticks have become very popular within the fighting game community thanks to their quicker, more precise inputs. While it might take some time to adjust to the all-button layout (especially if you are already used to a traditional fight stick), once you do, you'll be pulling off combos and special attacks with ease.</p><p>Like several other Razer products, the Kitsune has a super-thin profile and Chroma RGB lighting around the base of the chassis. The aluminum faceplate is also removable, allowing for easy tinkering with the controller. It comes fitted with low-profile optical linear mechanical switches. One thing to note here is that the Kitsune is only compatible with PS5 and PC, which is a bit of a shame considering that the PS4 still has a very active community of fighting game fans.</p></div>                      </div><p>"The learning curve is quite steep, but the payoff is well worth the effort. The lack of native PS4 support is disappointing, which would be a dealbreaker for some. But from its build quality and physical design to the ergonomics and actual performance in competitive scenarios, it's nearly impossible for me to find a notable flaw in my 20-plus hours using it," Michael Higham wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-razer-kitsune-is-the-best-fighting-game-controller-period/1100-6517983/">Razer Kitsune review</a>.</p><p>While the sleek design makes the Razer Kitsune very portable, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/GEEKRIA-Carrying-Compatible-Kitsune-All-Button-Controller/dp/B0FGJ37W9P?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="nofollow ">you can also pick up a dedicated carrying case for it from Geekria for $23</a>.

Our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/battlefield-6-review-good-company/1900-6418420/" data-ref-id="1900-6418420">Battlefield 6 review</a> gave it a 7/10, shouting out its impressive gunplay and new features like crouch sprinting and dragging downed enemies that add a new twist to the usual Battlefield formula. Battlefield 6 features both a single-player campaign and online multiplayer, but it's the latter that's earning the most praise. "Battlefield 6 is a return to form, even if it doesn't reach the same highs as the series at its peak," wrote Richard Wakeling. "The campaign is as lackluster as expected, and the multiplayer maps are only ever decent at best, but there's still a chaotic and super-satisfying shooter here that offers multiplayer thrills unlike any other. Even if you're not racking up kills by the dozens, you're still rewarded for contributing in other ways, and you're never too far away from being in the middle of a histrionic Battlefield moment."</p><p>Plenty of other video games, Blu-rays, and more are on sale in Amazon's Black Friday sale.

Aside from that difference, the specs are identical, including support for 2.4Ghz and Bluetooth wireless connections, a four-microphone array for noise cancellation, transparency mode, 360-degree spatial audio, a 10-hour battery life (up to 40 with the included case), and presets for various games accessible via the SteelSeries companion mobile app. </p>                      </div><p>As usual, a variety of eartip sizes are included with the bundle, ensuring you find a comfortable fit. And if you decide to take them on the road with you, you'll be glad to know they're IP55-rated for dust and splash resistance. These would be an ideal fit for someone who is constantly on the road, as transporting the earbuds is much easier than a bulky headset. In other words, you could easily pack these away for a holiday vacation--ensuring you have premium sound for all your games regardless of location.</p><p>Amazon is discounting a bunch of other SteelSeries headsets for Black Friday.

The full game data is included on the disc (or the cartridge, in the case of the Nintendo Switch). That said, unlike previous eras of gaming where you could simply pop a new game into your console and start playing right away, newer titles often need to install at least <em>some </em>game data to the console's hard drive, which can take several minutes. So if you're planning to give this to a family member, a pro move would be to open the case and insert the disc in the console so all the data is installed, then wrap the gift once it's complete so they can start playing right away.</p>                      </div><p>The Grinch: Christmas Adventures is a kid-friendly game that lets players explore Who-Ville as the Grinch, tackling platforming sections through the town's outskirts, snowboarding stunt sequences, jetpack challenges, and more. The Grinch's dog, Max, is also a playable character with his own unique missions, and the game is full of collectibles that let you unlock jigsaw puzzles, art, and Grinch-y accessories. The game first launched back in 2023, but has remained surprisingly popular with players, and it even received a new DLC expansion last month titled The Grinch: Christmas Adventures - Determined to Love Christmas. The expansion is available as a $10 premium download on the PlayStation Store, Xbox Store, and Nintendo eShop.</p><p>There are plenty of other early Black Friday video game deals available at Amazon.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-november-20-893/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nyt-connections-hints-today-893-%E2%80%94clues-and-answers-for-thursday-november-20.1358839/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The weekend is almost here, but before it comes, you need to smash a couple more NYT Connections puzzles! Fortunately, I’m on hand (as always) to bring you the best NYT Connections hints and solutions that you need to ace today’s challenge. If you’re stuck on today’s NYT Connections puzzle, this is the guide that you need.</p>



<p>Read on to secure the tips and answers that you need to keep that streak going.</p>











<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>

<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #893:</p>



<ul>
<li>ARTY</li>



<li>KISS</li>



<li>ENAMEL</li>



<li>ESSAY</li>



<li>CROWN</li>



<li>DECAY</li>



<li>BRUSH</li>



<li>PASTE</li>



<li>ANY</li>



<li>SKIM</li>



<li>PLASTER</li>



<li>PULP</li>



<li>STICK</li>



<li>STROKE</li>



<li>ROOT</li>



<li>FIX</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Think of things you’d literally apply to bond surfaces; one is more “medical wall stuff” than “craft glue.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>These are words for a light touch; one of them can be romantic or just feather-light.</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>Mix inner anatomy and outer protection; two are internal tissues, two are what you see or what caps it.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Say them out loud. One hides a “decay” pun that echoes D-K, and another rhymes its way to S-A.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, November 20.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>

<p>Following the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shuten_order">SHUTEN ORDER</a> on the Switch in September, a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/shuten-order-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Switch 2 Edition</a> has now been officially announced.</p>
<p>It will arrive later this month on <strong>27th November 2025</strong> for the launch price of 6,579 yen. This <strong>10%</strong> discount is available until 4th December 2025. Local pricing for the full game hasn't been confirmed just yet, but there will be a paid Upgrade Pack for existing Switch owners. Thankfully, it's only a small sum of 330 Yen (about $2).</p>
<p>As for what you can expect, the Switch 2 Edition will support a higher frame rate, including variable frame rate between 60 to 120 fps in both docked and portable modes. There will also be Joy-Con 2 mouse controls in areas of the game where it's supported.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-dmz-coming-back-catch/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-dmz-is-coming-back-soon-but-there%E2%80%99s-a-catch.1358827/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It has been revealed that Call of Duty’s DMZ mode is returning in December, but there’s a huge catch. The once-popular extraction shooter platform first emerged in Modern Warfare II in 2022, but after a few months of updates, it eventually disappeared from the ecosystem, never to return – until now.</p>



<p>There’s a huge catch though.</p>







<h2 id="h-dmz-recon-coming-december-11th">DMZ: Recon Coming December 11th</h2>



<p>DMZ: Recon is a new extraction shooter experience coming to Call of Duty: Mobile in December. It’s a reflection of the DMZ title that was released alongside Modern Warfare II in 2022, albeit a ‘shrunk-down’ version.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It will land during COD Mobile’s Season 11 update, and like the original, it’s set to feature PvPvE gameplay. Unlike the original DMZ, it’s expected that there will be no punishment or negativity surrounding PvP, as that was a sticking point for fans of the first platform. This is reflected in there being no ‘team recruitment’ mechanics, which were in the first DMZ.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CallOfDutyMobile/comments/1oyh2hg/dmz_recon_is_official_heres_what_to_expect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Early impressions from COD Mobile leakers</a> suggested that DMZ: Recon will be entirely first-person and will feature an in-match buy store, just like the one found in the original DMZ mode. There will be boss characters, weapons can be levelled up in flight, and loot is based on a tier system that includes extremely rare collectibles.</p>



<p>Players can reportedly purchase vehicles on the fly, and as it’s a smaller experience, only eight teams of three will occupy each match.</p>



<p>It has also been suggested that two maps will emerge at launch on December 11th: Serpent Island and Building 21. It was also claimed from those attending preview events that players arrive in the game via a wingsuit, can use killstreaks, carry three weapons, and can extract using a helicopter system, just like the first game.</p>







<p>Are you happy to see DMZ coming back, even if it’s only in COD Mobile? Let your thoughts be known via the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>Following its September Nintendo Direct reveal</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>There were all sorts of announcements during Nintendo's September Direct, but one you might have missed was for Gryphline's upcoming eShop release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/popucom">Popucom</a>.</p>
<p>It's described as a multiplayer co-op platform adventure title, where you'll need to master "techniques of colour switching and match-3 shooting" to overcome puzzles and defeat enemies. There's also support for motion-assisted aiming with the Switch's gyroscopic sensors.</p>
<p>In an update today, the game has now locked in a release date - with the developer confirming it will be arriving for Switch on <strong>4th December 2025</strong>.</p>

<p>According to the US eShop, this digital release will set you back <strong>$19.99</strong> (or your regional equivalent) and requires around 4.3 GB of space on the Switch and Switch 2. Additionally, it supports single-system multiplayer for 2 to 4 players, and online play for 2 to 4 players.</p>

<p>The talented team confirmed this in an official announcement on social media this week. Nintendo asked the studio to "help demonstrate new capabilities of the Nintendo Switch 2 system" while remaining faithful to the original versions of each title.</p>
<p>As you can see, the titles Panic Button helped release updates for include <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/new_super_mario_bros_u_deluxe">New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_3d_world_plus_bowsers_fury">Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/arms">ARMS</a>. These upgrades included visual and frame rate improvements, HDR support, and various Switch 2 features.</p><div><figure data-videoid="aHspT9aiKKE" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aHspT9aiKKE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytaHspT9aiKKE" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/aHspT9aiKKE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aHspT9aiKKE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed40228bvuptli&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>These were all free upgrades, with multiple other first-party Switch titles receiving similar Switch 2 launch updates.</p>

<p>Panic Button, as you might recall, worked wonders during the Switch generation - porting titles such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/doom_eternal">DOOM Eternal</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/wolfenstein_ii_the_new_colossus">Wolfenstein II</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/warframe">Warframe</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/rocket_league">Rocket League</a>. So, it's nice to see its efforts haven't gone unnoticed. Its <a href="https://panicbuttongames.com/games/">official website</a> has also been updated to include its Switch 2 work.</p>
<p>If we hear about Panic Button's involvement in anything else related to Switch 2 going forward, we'll provide an update.</p>

Soon after, the protagonist awakens with no memory, greeted by two self-proclaimed “angels”. They reveal a shocking truth: the protagonist is the murdered Founder, revived by divine power. However, the resurrection is incomplete—their memories are gone, and their life limited to a mere four days.</p><p>To survive, the protagonist must overcome “God’s trial”: identify and kill their murderer.</p><p>With the clock ticking, the protagonist, given the alias Rei, dives into the tumultuous city as a detective. The suspects? Five ministers of the Shuten Order. There’s no time to investigate them all. Choices must be made, and the pursuit of truth demands sacrifice.</p><p>Who killed the Founder? For what reason?

            <link>https://kotaku.com/govee-dumps-color-floor-lamps-now-selling-at-new-all-time-low-for-prime-members-2000645559</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/govee-dumps-color-floor-lamps-now-selling-at-new-all-time-low-for-prime-members.1358719/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Smart lighting transforms bland rooms into dynamic spaces that adapt to mood and activity. <em>Govee</em> just dropped an <strong>exclusive Prime member deal</strong> on its RGBIC Floor Lamp, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4546/">slashing the price down to $64 from its usual $99.</a> This Black Friday discount is a record low that no one other than a Prime member gets, and if you subscribe, now’s the perfect time to upgrade your lighting game. With <strong>16 million color options and music sync capabilities</strong>, the lamp does away with dead corners and bland ambient lighting.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4546/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The RGBIC designation means<strong> this lamp displays multiple colors simultaneously across different segments</strong>. Traditional RGB lamps can only show one color at a time across the entire fixture, limiting your creative options. The Govee lamp divides the light strip into independent zones that each display different colors, creating flowing gradients and multi-color effects. You can set the bottom to glow blue while the top fades into purple or create rainbow effects that flow up and down the lamp.</p>
<p>The<strong> 1000 lumen output provides serious brightness</strong> that actually works as primary lighting, not accent mood lighting. You can light up an entire corner of a room or use it as your main light source when you want softer, interesting lighting than overhead fixtures provide. The brightness smoothly adjusts from dim ambient glow to full brightness, allowing for granular control over the light intensity.</p>



<h2>Syncs With Music</h2>
<p><strong>Music sync capability</strong> turns the lamp into a reactive light show, pulsing and changing with whatever you’re playing. Equipped with a built-in microphone, the lamp picks up the audio from your room and analyzes the beat, tempo, and intensity. Colors shift and pulse in rhythm to your music, creating an immersive experience that beats static lighting. Sensitivity can be changed depending on volumes of playing music, so it will be as relevant for background jazz as for electronic dance music played at full volume. The <strong>sync works with any audio source in the room</strong>, from TV shows to Spotify to live instruments.</p>
<p>Alexa integration means that when it’s all connected to your Amazon Echo devices, the lamp is completely voice-controllable. Without needing to open the app or touch physical controls, saying, “Alexa, turn on the floor lamp” powers it up. You can change colors with your voice, adjust brightness, turn the lamp on or off, and trigger preset scenes. This voice control becomes key when you are caught up on the couch and do not want to reach for your phone.</p>



<p>The <strong>Govee app unlocks the full potential of the lamp’s 16 million color options</strong>. You can save custom color combinations as presets, browse community-created scenes, and fine-tune every aspect of the lighting. The app <strong>includes dozens of pre-programmed scenes</strong> like “Sunset,” “Ocean,” “Forest,” and “Party” that change the lamp’s appearance with one tap. DIY mode lets you pick specific colors for each segment of the lamp, creating personalized combinations that match your room’s color scheme.</p>
<p>From unboxing to first use, the lamp takes about five minutes to set up. Plug in the lamp, download the Govee app, connect it to your WiFi network, and go. The WiFi connection is a standard 2.4GHz network which most homes are already set up with-no special router configurations are required. The lamp remembers your last settings even in the event of power outages, so it will immediately go back to those settings upon being turned back on. Energy consumption stays very low despite the brightness of the output; it <strong>uses about as much electricity as a regular LED bulb</strong> while offering much more functionality.</p>
<p>This Govee RGBIC Floor Lamp provides smart lighting features that other brands sell at double the price, down to $64 from its usual $99, for Prime members only.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/riftbound-origins-review-tcg-with-movement-strategy-im-in</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/riftbound-origins-review-a-tcg-with-movement-strategy-im-in.1358701/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I got a chance to get my hands on <em>Riftbound</em> earlier this year as I was invited to Riot HQ to test out some trial decks. I've dabbled in a lot of TCGs over the years, finding elements that I like and dislike about them, but I've never enjoyed one quite as much as <em>Riftbound</em> off the bat. As I dive into the Proving Grounds beginner set, the starter decks and deckbuilding, and playing the game I'll get into what makes this game such a strong contender.</p>

<h2>Your Cards Teach You Deckbuilding</h2>

<p>In talking about <em>Riftbound</em> and how to play the game we've got to talk about how the decks are made. Each Deck has a Legend, a two colored card that features a League of Legends Champion that will serve as the face of your deck. From there, you'll then also want a Champion Unit, normally the same League of Legends hero as another ambassador for your deck.</p>

<p>Your Legend will have an ability that can be accessed at any time, normally once a turn, while your Champion Unit is a Unit you can summon with the required Runes without having to worry about drawing it to your hand.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/riftbound-origins-review-legends.jpg?itok=xlZvsPcy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/riftbound-origins-review-legends.jpg?itok=UpDfVfE6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In picking these two cards you've immediately been able to narrow down your pool of possible cards to two colors, and even further you'll look to obtain cards that interact positively with the abilities of your Legend and Champion Unit.</p>

<p>Hand of Noxus, Darius' Legend card, gives you an additional Rune as a Legion ability, while Lee Sin's Blind Monk, can buff a friendly unit. From here you can find all manner of other cards that will have Legion effects or allow for the spending of buffs.</p>

<p>It's in this way that as you create your deck based off the chosed Legend you're being taught by the game "This is how a deck using these cards will want to function, so you should continue to work with that mechanic." While loose, it's a basic framework that means even if you don't know all of the cards or the best strategies that you can start planning your own combos.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/riftbound-origins-review-types-of-cards.jpg?itok=P-q-vn7p 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/riftbound-origins-review-types-of-cards.jpg?itok=HjSq8Fbe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The rest of your deck gets filled with 39 additional cards; Units, Spells, and Gear. Each deck will also include three different Battlefields, potential battle grounds that you'll be moving your units to and from during games of <em>Riftbound</em>, and 12 Rune cards (six of each color) that work as your ramping energy system for the game.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the cards that I was most short on opening booster packs was Runes. Each pack has 1, maybe 2, that to create a deck with 12 of the same colored Runes you'll need to hope that you open enough of a certain type. For a lot of my playtesting, I just pooled all of my Runes from Boosters, Proving Grounds, and Starter Decks together so that I'd have enough. There will definitely be a time where I don't need to do that… but that time is not now.</p>

<h2>Proving Grounds Is Where To Start</h2>

<p>If you're just interested in getting into <em>Riftbound</em>, Riot Games has created a box for up to four players. This is something a bit closer to a board game approach to Riftbound but works as a starter set with underpowered decks to hopefully keep scalpers away.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/riftbound-origins-review-proving-grounds.jpg?itok=7dbPAs2m 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/riftbound-origins-review-proving-grounds.jpg?itok=Ya527mFg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Inside this box you'll find a large set of rules for how to play <em>Riftbound</em>, four <em>Riftbound</em> Decks, four Carboard Play Mats with additional instructions for how to play on them, oversized battleground cards, and acrylic character standees to use as point trackers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While this box was planned to be less desirable, it hasn't stopped a few cards, such as the Flash spell and the Master Yi and Annie Legends, from becoming very desirable.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Playing <em>Riftbound</em></h2>

<p><em>Riftbound</em> can be played with two to four players in pretty much any configuration from 1v1, to 2v2, and free for all. On each turn a player channels (draws) an additional two Runes, draws a card from their deck, and then can take any number of actions provided they're allowed to and they have the Runes to back it up.</p>

<p>Before the game is started Battlefields are put out on the table, these are zones that combat will take place in. Each player has a chance to contribute their own Battlefield as a way to potentially give themselves an additional advantage. Playing with friends, I never seemed to get to use my Battlefield and when a friend had a Battlefield that made use of Buffs (something my deck had none of) there was immediately an uphill battle to be had.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/riftbound-origins-review-playing.jpg?itok=dZ6Su5y6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/riftbound-origins-review-playing.jpg?itok=PboB3ki5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Players will summon Units to their field, activate Gear and Abilities, cast spells, or move their units from their base to a battlefield, resolve combat where necessary and pass their turn to the next player.</p>

<p>There are a lot of common aspects that you'll find in <em>Riftbound</em> if you're familiar with other TCGs: Units come out exhausted unless they have an ability to say otherwise, Runes create an energy that's accumulated to play cards etc.</p>

<p>The two major differences for <em>Riftbound</em> that I have really enjoyed are its Battlefields and the ramping Rune system.</p>

<p>When summoning a Unit you can normally only summon them to your base, which is a zone that's (normally) safe from your enemies. It's only when you start moving them out to the previously mentioned battlefields that they are at risk. Battlefields are where you earn points, so it's important to get Units out there, but the base lets you be more deliberate about when you do and don't want to engage in combat.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/riftbound-origins-review-big-combat.jpg?itok=UZxNg4mh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/riftbound-origins-review-big-combat.jpg?itok=-PSnQu8f 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Even with all of this... I lost this battle</figcaption></figure><p>Playing in a free for all, being high on points but low on Units, I was able to look at my board and hand and know that I didn't have anything to make any power plays this turn but I was able to take two turns to focus on my base, filling it up with Units and abilities to then launch an assault later. When to move your characters up, and when to lie in wait, becomes a bit of a game of chicken waiting for the right time to strike.</p>

<p>The other feature that I really love from <em>Riftbound</em> is that your Runes are constantly accumulating. Each turn there's two more energy to be able to spend on more units of weaker strength, or you can gain access to far stronger units. This ramping guarantees there's no way you're stuck with nothing to do at any point in time, and better than that it always means there's escalation to the tempo of the game.</p>

<p>Round 1 and 2 are always one or two cards being played, and then passing on, while round 8 or 9 has you chaining together a variety of different abilities letting your Legend abilities truly shine.</p>

<p>There's an excitement that's inherent to pretty much every <em>Riftbound</em> game I have played as you get to see your opponent building up their abilities and you try to stop them.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/riftbound-origins-review-artwork.jpg?itok=s-1iawsq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/riftbound-origins-review-artwork.jpg?itok=l2qk9Vc5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2><em>Riftbound</em> Facing Standard TCG Issues</h2>

<p>As expected, <em>Riftbound</em> is facing current issues of pretty much every TCG, high resale and scalpers. It's not really something that can be avoided, and I definitely didn't think that Riot would have an answer, but it does make me worry about my own ability to enjoy the game outside of digital simulators.</p>

<p>As we go into Set 2: Spiritforged, already set to release in February of 2026, it will be interesting to see how the general public is able to get their hands on the product.</p>

<p>I do hope that we'll eventually see an official simulator, but for now I'm going to continue enjoying my time with the three decks that I was able to make from a Booster Box.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/riftbound-origins-review-card-sleeves-and-mat.jpg?itok=9OFegh7K 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/riftbound-origins-review-card-sleeves-and-mat.jpg?itok=1UMEvW2X 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2><em>Riftbound</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>I'm a huge fan of <em>Riftbound</em>, everything that I enjoyed about playing it earlier this year is even better now that I'm able to be playing it with a wider variety of players and have more cards to craft decks out of.</p>

<p>I love how intuitive building a basic deck is, and how playing and refining it helps you continue to funnel towards what might be your 'perfect' deck. In addition to that I love how varied each of the different major abilities in the game are. Even when playing your own deck a number of times the way you need to respond to a trap player vs a ganking player is going to cause you to reconsider strategies at any point in the game.</p>

<p>I think what Riot Games has pulled off here is incredible, creating a fresh and quite unique TCG in what is a very busy space right now and it's almost terrifying to think with how many LoL champions out there how much room they have to continue growing.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lgs-ultrafine-27-inch-4k-monitor-sells-for-peanuts-amazon-dumps-stock-with-zero-margin-2000645574</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lg%E2%80%99s-ultrafine-27-inch-4k-monitor-sells-for-peanuts-amazon-dumps-stock-with-zero-margin.1358698/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Professional monitors make everything look better but the price tags usually sting. Amazon just <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5718/">torched its profit margins on the LG <em>Ultrafine</em> 27-inch 4K monitor, dropping it to $177 from the usual $249 price</a>. This move screams inventory clearance which means you’re getting a <strong>legitimate 4K display for less than many 1080p monitors cost</strong>. The LG <em>Ultrafine</em> monitor delivers true<strong> 4K resolution with HDR10 support and 90% DCI-P3 color coverage</strong> that creative pros actually need. This record-low Black Friday price makes upgrading from your aging 1080p screen a no-brainer decision.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5718/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>True 4K Resolution Changes How You Work</h2>
<p>With a <strong>native resolution of 3840×2160</strong>, it packs four times the pixels of standard 1080p into the same-sized 27-inch display. You can easily set multiple windows side by side without straining to read tiny text or giving up readability. Spreadsheets show more rows and columns at once, code editors display more lines simultaneously, and photo editing reveals details that 1080p screens completely miss.</p>
<p>IPS panel technology offers accurate colors and wide viewing angles that TN panels simply can’t touch. Colors remain consistent even when you’re viewing the screen from extreme angles, which matters a great deal when you work with clients or show content to others. The 1000:1 contrast ratio creates deeper blacks than typical budget monitors, which makes dark movie and game scenes richer. IPS response times have dramatically improved over the last few years, so you won’t see ghosting or motion blur from this display like you did on older IPS displays</p>



<p><strong>HDR10 support</strong> brings compatible content to life with enhanced brightness and contrast. The likes of Netflix, Disney+, and Amazon Prime Video stream HDR content that looks significantly better on this monitor compared to standard dynamic range displays. This monitor automatically jumps into HDR mode when it detects compatible content, then seamlessly flips back to SDR at all other times. Peak brightness reaches levels that will make the highlights pop without washing out the rest of the image.</p>



<p>Minimized bezels around display edges means maximum utilization of screen real estate. Thin bezels create a cleaner aesthetic, adding to the modern, professional look of any desk. Borderless designs are great for multi-monitor setups since the gap between screens will be almost invisible. The white finish will match perfectly with Apple aesthetics if you’re building a cohesive workspace; it works well with any setup, though. The matte screen coating helps reduce screen glare from windows and overhead lights, maintaining clarity of image in bright rooms.</p>
<p>Reader Mode reduces blue light emission for extended reading sessions that don’t strain your eyes. The mode shifts colors toward warmer tones that feel easier on your eyes during long workdays or late-night work sessions. Flicker Safe technology eliminates the invisible screen flickering that causes eye fatigue and headaches after hours of use. Put together, these create a display you can stare at for eight-plus hours without the burning, tired eyes that cheap monitors cause. Within the first week of using it,<strong> the reduction in eye strain is indeed noticeable</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Both HDMI and DisplayPort inputs</strong> are available for maximum compatibility. Modern laptops, gaming consoles, desktop computers, and media devices can be connected directly with no need for an adapter. DisplayPort is capable of higher refresh rates and bandwidth than HDMI, though both inputs provide full 4K resolution at 60Hz. A pair of inputs allows the connection of two devices at once and switching with the onscreen menu. USB-C displays are significantly more expensive, so the use of traditional connectivity here keeps the price accessible while still providing full functionality.</p>
<p>At $177 down from $249, this LG Ultrafine 27″ 4K monitor delivers professional specs at a price that undercuts basic 1080p displays. You’re getting true 4K resolution, HDR10 support, 90% DCI-P3 color coverage, and IPS panel quality for 29% off the regular price.</p>

              <p>LEGO display sets represent a creative outlet for adults that melds nostalgia with serious building satisfaction. Amazon is flooded with LEGO deals this Black Friday, but the <em>Hogwarts Castle and Grounds</em> set stands well above the crowd as the most iconic Harry Potter build on offer. This <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4207/">2,660-piece masterpiece drops to $140 from its usual $169 price, making it the perfect time to grab</a> what many collectors consider the <strong>definitive Hogwarts model in existence</strong>. Due to its massive scale and incredible detail, this set costs well more than average LEGO builds even at full price, but this discount makes it more affordable.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4207/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Most Intricate Hogwarts Creation LEGO has Ever Built</h2>
<p>Detail is captured with this scale model of Hogwarts Castle in ways that no LEGO attempts have ever quite achieved: the build of the Main Tower, Astronomy Tower, Great Hall, several courtyards and connecting bridges, functional greenhouses, Boathouse, and even the surrounding Black Lake at the castle grounds. Architecture faithfully adheres to the movie depictions, giving you a displayable replica any Harry Potter fan can easily recognize. The<strong> baseplate is 13.5 inches wide and 10 inches deep</strong>, and creates a large footprint that commands attention on any shelf or desk. The <strong>castle itself rises over 8.5 inches high</strong>&nbsp;which makes it a fantastic centerpiece that won’t require a microscope to appreciate.</p>
<p>The interior details reveal the hidden rooms and iconic locations that defined the Harry Potter series. You can build the Chamber of Secrets complete with the basilisk’s lair, the Winged Key room from the first film, Snape’s Potions Classroom in the dungeons, and the life-sized Chessboard Chamber. These interior spaces add much depth to what might have been just an exterior shell, giving reasons for investigating the model from all angles.</p>



<p>The grounds around it feature components that complete the Hogwarts experience rather than a mere castle structure. The Durmstrang Ship sits in the Black Lake, recreating one of the dramatic entrances featured in Goblet of Fire. The Beauxbatons Carriage sits ready near the castle gates, recreating an entrance to the Triwizard Tournament. The Whomping Willow stands with its characteristic twisted branches, and the crashed Ford Anglia rests nearby as a nod to Chamber of Secrets.</p>
<p>The<strong> 2,660-piece count gives you hours of engaging building</strong> which breaks down into sections. LEGO designed the instructions to guide you through one area at a time, preventing the overwhelming feeling that massive sets sometimes create. You can build the castle over several evenings and make it a relaxing activity rather than a marathon building session. The variety of bricks includes special pieces for architectural details, transparent pieces for windows, and textured pieces adding depth aesthetically to walls and roofs.</p>



<p>Adding a really premium feel to the display is the inclusion of the gold-colored mini-figure of the statue of the Hogwarts architect. You can place this statue next to the included <em>“Hogwarts Castle”</em> nameplate or place it at any corner of the baseplate for balance. The nameplate gives the display a museum-quality finish that makes it clear this set targets adult collectors rather than kids.</p>
<p>At $140 off from $169, this LEGO <em>Hogwarts castle and grounds</em> is incredible value for a 2,660-piece licensed set. You get the most detailed, comprehensive Hogwarts recreation LEGO has made-complete with iconic locations, surrounding grounds, and display-ready presentation.</p>

            <p>
A bit of creepy crawly, low-key city building? Ah, go on then. October and Halloween might be behind us, but Fangtopia is a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzle</a> game stroke city builder that still feels appropriate for late autumn. Having had a go with its demo, it's deceptively simple, in fact it felt so simple I wasn't entirely sure if I was doing anything at all. But when it clicked, all the pieces fell into place resulting in a pleasantly chill time.
</p>
<p>
The game is tile based, each tile having six sides, all of which are rotatable. These tiles come in different flavours, like forest tile, or a mountain tile, a wheat field tile, a village tile etc., you get it! And then some of these tiles mix and match those traits, hence why they're rotatable. You only have a certain amount of these tiles in what is essentially a deck of cards, though I hesitate to call it a deck builder, it's more just that each tile you're able to place is random from one move to the next. Placing certain amounts of tiles next to particular landmarks that crop up then add more tiles back into your deck, so you can keep building your little island.
</p>
<p>
Once you build up your little island, classic monsters like werewolves, yetis and the like crop up and they do their own thing. You know, monster stuff. One of my favourite aspects was that you could build your own little spectral trainline too. It was mostly for the aesthetics, though (I think) also helps you gather tile resources, but really I was just in it for watching the ghost train navigate its way along the path I set for it. 
</p>
<p>
It reminded me of Lego Loco, an old simulation game where you build up a town and train network for minifigures that my dad would leave me to play obsessively at his work to keep me distracted. There's something so delightful in building up a quiet corner of the world with not particularly high stakes, a quality I think comes through quite nicely in Fangtopia. Worth a punt, whenever it comes out! You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3010170/Fangtopia/">wishlist it on Steam</a> and try out its demo in the meantime.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple-dumps-13-inch-ipad-pro-m4-at-new-record-low-now-more-tempting-than-pricey-m5-models.1358677/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Premium tablets bridge the gap between laptops and phones and give you serious computing power in a portable package. Apple just unveiled its new iPad Pro M5 lineup a few weeks ago with the 13-inch model launching at $1,299, which <strong>makes the M4 version suddenly look like a steal</strong>. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5717/">dropped the 13-inch iPad Pro M4 to $1,049 from its original $1,299 price and matches what you’d pay for a smaller, less capable tablet</a>. The M4 and M5 models share so many similarities that spending $250 more for the newer chip makes zero sense for most people.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5717/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Powerful Tablet</h2>
<p>The <strong>M4 chip inside this iPad Pro brings desktop-grade performance</strong> that makes the upgrade to M5 seem superfluous for real-world work. What’s more, the 10-core CPU tackles tasks like video editing, 3D rendering, music production and multitasking without breaking a sweat. Apple built the M4 on a 3nm process that balances raw power with incredible efficiency, giving you all-day battery life even under intensive tasks. A 10-core GPU further pushes graphics performance to levels comparable to serious gaming machines, making this tablet ideal both for creative work and entertainment. The difference between M4 and M5 mainly exists in benchmark scores which most people never notice in real use.</p>
<p>The <strong>Ultra Retina XDR display represents one of the best screens ever put on a tablet</strong>. This 13-inch panel gives truly extreme brightness that remains readable in direct sunlight, while also offering deep blacks to make the OLED screens jealous. ProMotion technology adjusts the refresh rate to up to 120Hz for smooth scrolling and responsive input from Apple Pencil, then drops right down to conserve battery when the on-screen content has become static. P3 wide color gamut reproduces colors more accurately than standard displays, something that makes a big difference with photo editing and creative work. <strong>True Tone adjusts color temperature</strong> according to ambient lighting to reduce eye strain with extended use.</p>



<p>The impossibly thin design makes this 13-inch tablet feel lighter than its size suggests: <strong>Apple shaved the thickness down to just 5.1mm</strong>&nbsp;and created a profile that slips into bags easily with no extra bulk. A Space Black finish does a better job of resisting fingerprints than past aluminum finishes on Apple’s tablets, so the device stays clean throughout the day. The weight reduction means that you can hold the iPad Pro comfortably through marathon reading sessions or video calls without your arm tiring. The overall structural rigidity is impressive for such a slim frame, and the tablet doesn’t flex or creak at all if you press hard.</p>
<p><strong>Apple Intelligence integration</strong> changes how you’ll interact with the iPad Pro using AI-infused features: It helps write emails, summarize information, create images, and organize material all through natural language. It also includes privacy protections that mean all of this AI processing happens locally on your device rather than by sending sensitive information to cloud servers. The AI features seamlessly connect apps by suggesting what should be done next based on context, and the more you use them, the better they learn your preferences.</p>



<p>The <strong>new landscape 12MP Ultra Wide front camera finally puts the camera where it belongs for video calls</strong>. Center Stage automatically keeps you in frame as you move around, making video conferences feel more natural and professional. The 12MP Wide back camera captures stunning photos and 4K video with ProRes support for professional editing workflows. Four studio-quality microphones record clear audio from any direction while the four-speaker system delivers rich, immersive sound.</p>
<p>This iPad Pro M4 provides flagship performance for $250 less than the nearly identical M5 model down from $1,299 to $1,049. For your money, you’re getting the same Ultra Retina XDR display, similar processing power, an identical design, and full Apple Intelligence support, making the upgrade to an M5 unit a pretty questionable decision. The fact that <strong>this Amazon-exclusive discount</strong> combines with those cutting-edge specs to create value that’s out of reach for Apple’s official store is rather fascinating.</p>

      <p>AI, as you well know by now, is the future of everything – including, Microsoft has recently taken to informing users, malware installation. No, this is not a joke or a bit, but rather a glimmering new wing in the hallowed halls of “What are we even doing here?”</p><p>This week, Microsoft <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/experimental-agentic-features-a25ede8a-e4c2-4841-85a8-44839191dfb3?ref=aftermath.site"><u>updated its support page</u></a> on “Experimental Agentic Features” – user-like AI sidekicks that interact “with your apps and your files, using vision and advanced reasoning to click, type and scroll like a human would” – with the following warning:</p><blockquote>Agentic AI has powerful capabilities today – for example, it can complete many complex tasks in response to user prompts, transforming how users interact with their PCs. As these capabilities are introduced, AI models still face functional limitations in terms of how they behave and occasionally may hallucinate and produce unexpected outputs. Additionally, agentic AI applications introduce novel security risks, such as cross-prompt injection (XPIA), where malicious content embedded in UI elements or documents can override agent instructions, leading to unintended actions like data exfiltration or malware installation.</blockquote><p>So basically, the not-actually-intelligent, agency-free “agent” making decisions about your apps and files on your behalf might accidentally give away your data or plague your PC with malware. Cool! Microsoft says that humans will need to approve all decisions made by AI agents, but a) that’s a far from fool-proof stopgap, and b) then what’s the point of letting an AI agent take the wheel in the first place?</p><p>Lumping this tendency in with hallucinations makes sense on multiple levels: Once again, a company has uncovered what should be considered a fatal flaw, but which it has evidently decided is little more than an annoying glitch – an aberration rather than something hard-coded and essential about how generative AI functions. And again, this sure sounds like yet another instance in which AI is liable to cause more problems than it solves.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>On the upside, Windows 11’s agentic workspace is toggled off by default. On the downside, there’s no guarantee that will last, especially as Microsoft continues to foist AI upon every element of its business imaginable. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/18/business/nvidia-elite-investors?ref=aftermath.site"><u>the AI bubble is looking worryingly shimmery</u></a>, like the gentlest of jostles could blow the whole thing wide open. If all of Wall Street breathes a sigh of relief following <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/nvidia-q3-earnings-live-updates-nvda-stock-price-ai-chips-2025-11?ref=aftermath.site#nvidia-says-energy-could-be-a-bottleneck-for-ai-adoption"><u>a lone company’s earnings report</u></a>, that’s probably not a great sign for the structural integrity of… everything else.</p><p>But for now, a silver lining: it <a href="https://defector.com/it-took-many-years-and-billions-of-dollars-but-microsoft-finally-invented-a-calculator-that-is-wrong-sometimes?ref=aftermath.site"><u>took many years and billions of dollars</u></a>, but Microsoft finally invented a calculator that’s wrong sometimes <em>and </em>can install malware on our computers. </p>

From our vantage point, we see something very different.” He went on to recap many of the same claims Nvidia has been making for years about how AI will change everything, and added that AI has “reached a tipping point,” saying, “The transition to agentic and physical AI will be revolutionary.”</p><p><em><strong>Update, November 19th: </strong>Added comments from Nvidia’s investor call; updated headline after Nvidia clarified to Bloomberg that it still has “plenty of Blackwells to sell you.”</em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6ODAzMzIw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Stevie Bonifield</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/824111/nvidia-q3-2026-earnings-data-center-revenue]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review-campaign-is-it-good-zombies-multiplayer-2000645198"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>‘s campaign is bad</a>. So it’s a shame that the coolest bit of <em>Black Ops 7</em>, a new co-op RPG-meets-extraction-shooter mode called Endgame, is locked behind completing said not-very-good campaign. But that’s changing very soon, according to the game’s developer, Treyarch.</p> <p>The latest entry in Activision’s long-running FPS franchise,<a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-ai-art-user-reviews-steam-2000644734"> <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em></a>, launched earlier this week to mixed reviews from fans and critics. While many praised the game’s visuals and zombies mode, its multiplayer feels long in the tooth, and its campaign is a wild, incomprehensible mess that is only fun to play through if you like experiencing expensive trainwrecks. And for some odd reason, Treyarch decided to lock perhaps the best, coolest mode in<em> Black Ops 7,</em> Endgame, behind completion of the campaign.</p>

 <p>Currently, you have to complete the campaign to play Endgame <em>or</em> get invited to a lobby created by someone who has already finished the story. It feels like a bad decision, and many players have likely not touched Endgame yet because they don’t want to play (or finish) this year’s terrible campaign. And Treyarch seems to get that it was a regrettable design choice, and will be removing the restriction on November 21.</p>

 <p><span>“We’ve seen an awesome response to Endgame from players who’ve already been dropping in,” <a href="https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1991220426618597519">tweeted Treyarch.</a> “So we’re making it available to everyone in </span><em><span>Black Ops 7</span></em><span>.”</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">We've seen an awesome response to Endgame from players who've already been dropping in, so we're making it available to everyone in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackOps7?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BlackOps7</a> starting Friday, Nov. 21.</p> <p>Team up with other players to complete objectives, increase your power, earn unique Weapon Camos, and take on… <a href="https://t.co/2igahTPHv6">pic.twitter.com/2igahTPHv6</a></p> <p>— Treyarch (@Treyarch) <a href="https://twitter.com/Treyarch/status/1991220426618597519?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>   <p>Endgame is set on the same open-world island map that is found in the campaign. But this time around, you land with nothing and have to complete various challenges, missions, and quests dotted around the large island, either alone or with a few pals.</p>

 <p>As you kill enemies, find new loot, and complete activities, you get more powerful and can explore more of the island, with the end goal being to reach the most challenging enemies and powerful loot and then extract before time runs out. Do so, and you can return with all your stuff. Die or fail to leave, and you start over. It’s a very fun mode that takes the excellent and snappy combat of <em>Black Ops 7</em> and transplants it into a new experience inspired by extraction shooters like <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-review-extraction-loot-shooter-embark-2000642198"><em>Arc Raiders</em></a>, but which doesn’t feel as punishing as those games tend to be.</p> <p>As a bonus reward, Treyarch will send out a bunch of XP boosters and Gobblegum packs to players who beat the campaign and started playing Endgame before this change. And that’s cool; I think it’s just nice to give players who suffered through the campaign some sort of gift for their trouble. Regardless, I’m excited to play more Endgame with more people later this week and check out more of the island and what it has to offer.</p>
