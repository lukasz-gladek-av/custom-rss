            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/617730/hades-2-getting-better-early-access<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Hades II</em> just received its second major update as part of its early access development, which was a great excuse for me to jump back in. Since its initial release, I’ve logged more than 30 hours and actually held myself back from playing much more – I don’t want to get tired of the game before it hits 1.0 – but with the new update, I wanted to see what’s new and try to beat the new final boss on my very first run.</p><p>Sadly, I haven’t even been able to see what the boss is yet. I <em>did</em> make it to the update’s new region, but I got destroyed by a dangerous miniboss. Still, I’ve still been really impressed with what Supergiant Games has added since May to make what’s already a very good game even better.</p><p>The big additions are impressive. <em>Hades II</em> initially launched with six regions — four for an Underworld route and two for a “surface” route — and with each major update, Supergiant has added a new region with new enemies, characters, and music to round out that surface route.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/16/24271897/hades-ii-2-major-update-olympic">first major update</a>, which came out in October, added the game’s first new region, Mount Olympus, and it feels as epic as Mount Olympus should. It has grand architecture, fearsome enemies, and a fiery boss fight against Prometheus, all backed by an incredible orchestral soundtrack. (I’ve spent more time than I’d like to admit listening to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjiYUgx74rU">this song on loop</a>.)</p><p>That update also added the game’s sixth and final weapon – a witch-y, <em>Hades</em>-style interpretation of a mech suit. Seriously: your primary attack is punching baddies with giant fists while your special attack shoots projectiles that home in on nearby targets. You also have cool wings.</p><p>In the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/615857/hades-ii-2-warsong-update">second major update</a>, there’s a new region and boss, too, but I’ve also noticed a lot of smaller details that feel just as impactful. For example, the Altar of Ashes, a place where you pick from various passive effects in the form of arcana cards that can help your runs, got a visual redesign to add intricately-illustrated custom cards. (One of them features Theseus and the Minotaur, who you may remember as bosses from the first <em>Hades</em>, in thongs, lol.) I also spotted a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HadesTheGame/comments/1itjeu2/this_new_mel_portrait_is_so_adorable/">charming new portrait for Melinoë</a>, the game’s protagonist, that added some levity to a character that’s usually pretty serious.</p><p>And throughout the major updates and many smaller patches, Supergiant has rebalanced and changed all sorts of mechanics and details in ways that I can honestly barely begin to keep track of. The studio isn’t afraid to take the hatchet to things that need to go, too; with this most recent patch, Supergiant scrapped an entire mechanic tied to gathering.</p><p>Overall, the changes have made the game feel better to play over time – and browsing patch notes, Supergiant uses an emoji to indicate which changes are inspired by community feedback, which I think is a good way to acknowledge how players are contributing to the game, which is one of the main benefits of this type of early access release. (I should also acknowledge that <em>Hades II</em> has the advantage of building from the already-great foundation of the first <em>Hades.</em>)</p><p><em>Hades II</em> might not launch in 1.0 for a long time. Supergiant hasn’t committed to a timeframe for that, and it’s still working on a third major update that’s set to release “some months from now.” Because of the success of Supergiant’s other games, like <em>Bastion</em> and <em>Transistor</em>, the studio probably doesn’t need to rush.</p><p>But given how it’s treated <em>Hades II’s</em> early access so far, I’m fine if Supergiant takes its time. Even though <em>Hades II</em> isn’t finished, I have no qualms about recommending the game to anyone that’s interested. And jumping in now lets you experience just how much an already-great game can improve over time.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The pace of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> US sales has "fallen behind" that of the PS4 Pro.</p>
<p>That's according to games industry analyst Mat Piscatella, who used Circana data to conclude that whilst the PS5 Pro enjoyed a solid start, January 2025's hardware spend in the US was 45 percent lower when compared to the same period a year ago.</p>

</div><figcaption>Xbox Developer Direct - four promising games also coming to PlayStation.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afaO_AuPw0o" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>In fact, Piscatella posits that there was "double-digit percentage declines" across all major console platforms compared to a year ago, with PS5 hardware spend dipping by 38 percent year-on-year, Xbox Series declining by 50 percent, and Switch 53 percent.</p>
<p>The latter, however, may be as a result of players holding off for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Nintendo Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, as part of its financial report to investors, Sony confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-has-now-sold-75m-ps5-consoles-and-has-record-monthly-users">sales of its PS5 console have reached 75m units</a>, which is just shy of PS4 sales after an equivalent period.</p>

</span></p>
<p>However, Sony deviated from the norm and chose not to separate console sales in this report, so we're no longer able to disaggregate PS5 Pro sales from the base console. This makes it difficult to ascertain if the PS5 Pro's eye-watering cost of admission has put off players who would typically update their hardware mid-generation.</p>
<p>That said, PlayStation 5 was once again the best-selling hardware platform of the month in terms of both units sold and dollars generated. Xbox Series was second in hardware spending, although the Nintendo Switch edged out Xbox Series in terms of units sold.</p>
<p>As yet, there's no comparative sales data for PS5 in the UK or Europe.</p>
<p>Back in November, Sony said that despite the "different comments" on the PS5 Pro's chunky price point, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5-pro-price-has-not-had-a-negative-impact-on-sales-says-sony-boss">the "pricing [...] has not had a negative impact" on PS5 Pro sales</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-gets-new-40-minute-gameplay-with-dev-qa/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The highly anticipated total conversion mod <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-team-confirms-2025-launch-window-though-dlcs-will-come-later/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Skyblivion</a> was once again showcased by the talented modders during a 40-minute live gameplay demo. During the stream, the creators also answered several questions from the fans.</p>
<p>In this recreation of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion into Skyrim's engine, long-time players of the classic 2006 open world RPG will find some differences in character progression:</p>
<p><em>We've got the Oblivion attributes returning. We've adjusted the way they progress slightly. Rather than giving you points based on how you level up each skill per level, you just get a fixed number of points per level, similar to Fallout really. That helps alleviate a lot of the issues that Oblivion had with character progression, where if you didn't optimize your level up, you ended up with a character that was too weak for scaled enemies.</em></p>
<p><em>For the most part, our level up system is comparable to Skyrim in the way that the enemies scale with you. We've got someone going through now creating different tiers of enemies, so you won't just be going straight from imps straight to ogres. There will actually be different levels of power for each species, so that helps kind of balance things out a bit.</em></p>
<p>The new Skyblivion UI (user interface) allows players to easily keep track of all their stats and also all the factions they're a part of. Answering a question from a viewer, the team said there wouldn't be a Radiant Quest system like Skyrim's at launch. However, the content is set up in a way that creating a mod like <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17576" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Missives</a> should make it entirely possible to add the feature.</p>
<p>When asked whether Skyblivion would use sound effects from Oblivion, Skyrim, or original ones, they answered:</p>
<p><em>We'll be using a mix of all three. We'll create new sound effects; we've got a really great sound designer on the project. Also, where we can, we use Oblivion sounds because we can extract them from your Oblivion installation. There are certain effects, like skeletons, which come from Skyrim. And then there's small stuff like footsteps, which have been replaced and are a bit more specific for the type of ground you're walking on, and there's small little touches like that.</em></p>
<p><em>We should actually mention that the sound designer we have is the developer of the really popular Skyrim <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12466" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Audio Overhaul mod</a>, so a lot of people who have played modern Skyrim are probably quite familiar with the quality of work he does.</em></p>

<p>The Skyblivion team has been working on this project for a long time. We first covered it <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-special-edition-oblivion-remaster-mod-skyblivion-gets-new-teaser-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in late 2016</a>, with the modders having started earlier that year. Nine years later, they are just about ready to launch, having reconfirmed in this latest video that the goal is to release it in 2025.</p>
<p>Somewhat ironically, though, insistent rumors <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-rumors-intensify-as-details-on-the-improvements-emerge-in-new-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggest</a> that Bethesda might be about to launch its own official remaster of Oblivion.</p>

                <p>After hours and hours of exploring three separate maps in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/avowed/" data-ref-id="5000-516154">Avowed</a>, you finally arrive at Galawain's Tusks in search of the mythical Garden. Galawain's Tusks is certainly the least aesthetically pleasing map in the game, as the lava from Mt. Forja and Solace Keep along with the acid sea have turned the entire region a red, greyish color. Still, Galawain's Tusks is by far the largest map in Avowed and there's a ton to see and do as soon as you arrive.</p><p>Opening up your map for the first time in Galawain's Tusks can be a little overwhelming, as the size of the region is unlike anything you've seen up to this point. Fortunately for you, we spent hours combing through the entire map to fully uncover all of the fog on it. You can see the uncovered Galawain's Tusks map along with some points of interest in the guide below so you have a much better idea of where you're going.</p><h2>Full Galawain's Tusks Map in Avowed</h2><p>There are technically three different parts to Galawain's Tusks and there's very little that gets in your way of exploring the whole map. While there are certainly mountains, bridges, and towers surrounding every part of the map, you can fully explore all of it. Here are the major locations you'll come across in Galawain's Tusks:</p><ul><li>The Sallow Steppe</li><li>Slumbering Fields</li><li>Twinedwood</li><li>Solace Keep</li><li>Primordial Depths</li><li>Ash Forest</li><li>Mt. Forja</li></ul><p>Mt. Forja is the only location in Galawain's Tusks that isn't immediately accessible when you arrive. Part of that area can only be explored as a part of the main story quest in Avowed. However, the rest of the map is fair game and takes hours to explore.</p><p>Here are two images that showcase the fully uncovered Galawain's Tusks map:</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4446873-avowedscreenshot2025.02.18-23.53.41.34.png" data-ref-id="1300-4446873" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4446873-avowedscreenshot2025.02.18-23.53.41.34.png" data-ref-id="1300-4446873"></a><figcaption>Northern Galawain's Tusks map</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4446873-avowedscreenshot2025.02.18-23.53.41.34.png"></figure><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4446874-avowedscreenshot2025.02.18-23.53.30.43.png" data-ref-id="1300-4446874" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4446874-avowedscreenshot2025.02.18-23.53.30.43.png" data-ref-id="1300-4446874"></a><figcaption>Southern Galawain's Tusks map</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4446874-avowedscreenshot2025.02.18-23.53.30.43.png"></figure><p>As you continue in the main story, more areas will open up to you. For the most part, though, these are areas that you wouldn't know existed until you were guided there by the story quests.</p><h2>Galawain's Tusks Key Points of Interest</h2><p>With Galawain's Tusks being such a large area, it should come as no surprise that there are plenty of fast travel beacons and party camp waystones scattered around the map. In total, Galawain's Tusks has nine fast travel beacons and only three party camp waystones. Interestingly enough, there is no fast travel beacon inside the main hub city of Solace Keep. To get there, you have to fast travel to the beacon just outside of the drawbridge and then run there. It's also worth noting that some fast travel beacons don't become usable until you reach certain points in the story.</p><p>Here's a list of some other major points of interest in Galawain's Tusks:</p><p><strong>Strangled Adra</strong></p><ul><li>Located south of The Sallow Steppe and directly east of where you start in Galawain's Tusks</li></ul><p><strong>The Voice</strong></p><ul><li>Found near the Restless Cavern in the southwestern part of Slumbering Fields. You have to climb to the top of a cliff to reach it. Slumbering Fields itself is accessible via a bridge that goes over the lava river</li></ul><p><strong>Pargrun Cache</strong></p><ul><li>The Pargrun Cache in Galawain's Tusks offers some sweet rewards and also holds two of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-all-totem-of-perseverance-pieces-and-locations/1100-6529504/" data-ref-id="1100-6529504">Totem of Perseverance</a> pieces. You can reach the Pargrun Cache through the Lost Village, which is located north of Solace Keep at the top part of the map</li></ul><p><strong>Treasure Maps</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-ancient-arrowhead-treasure-map-location/1100-6529603/" data-ref-id="1100-6529603">Ancient Arrowhead</a></li><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-my-loyal-shield-treasure-map-location/1100-6529602/" data-ref-id="1100-6529602">My Loyal Shield</a></li><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-the-blade-that-hungers-treasure-map-location/1100-6529604/" data-ref-id="1100-6529604">The Blade That Hungers</a></li></ul><p><strong>Mapping the Living Lands Cartographer </strong></p><ul><li>Sanza's missing cartographer is actually alive in Galawain's Tusks, and you can find them near Solace Keep (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-galawains-tusks-cartographer-location-for-mapping-the-living-lands/1100-6529530/" data-ref-id="1100-6529530">exact location in a separate guide</a>)</li></ul><p>And there you have it, the entire Galawain's Tusks map laid out for you in Avowed.

            <p>Good news, ghost-hunting fans - <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a>'s genre-defining voice recognition feature is coming to consoles.</p>
<p>Although PC players have long been able to experience the horror game with the added stress of voice recognition, the October console release shipped initially without the feature.</p>

<p>Now, however, Kinetic said the feature is ready to go on both PS5 and Xbox consoles, enabling console players to try out the voice prompts for equipment like the Spirit Box and Ouija Board, as well as Monkey Paw.</p>
<p>The delay of some of Phasmo's fan-favourite equipment and tools hasn't put console players off, however - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phasmophobia-marks-22m-total-sales-with-its-2025-roadmap-and-changes-to-maps-kit-and-our-humble-journal">the ghost-hunting sim has sold two million copies on console</a> since it came out of early access last October, bringing the total sales across all platforms to 22 million.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phasmophobia-marks-22m-total-sales-with-its-2025-roadmap-and-changes-to-maps-kit-and-our-humble-journal">Phasmophobia outlined the road ahead for the spooky sim in 2025</a>, confirming map reworks, new ghost-hunting equipment, "thrilling seasonal events", and a brand-new location, too.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Well, you could roll a new character and grind to max level a second time…or you could swap games for a bit while you wait for the next <em>Diablo 4 </em>season start date.

The 2021 RPG released to favorable reviews but didn't break into the mainstream. But now we live in a post-<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baldurs-gate-3/" data-ref-id="5000-497541">Baldur's Gate 3</a> world, which rocked the gaming industry (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-is-gamespots-game-of-the-year-2023/1100-6519739/" data-ref-id="1100-6519739">GameSpot named it our Game of the Year in 2023</a>), and dice-based games are getting a spotlight they previously didn't have. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/solasta-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-654962">Solasta II</a> is launching into a far more favorable position than its predecessor, and feels like it could be a great game for folks who enjoyed Baldur's Gate 3 but now want a game that more closely aligns with the experience of playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons.</p><p dir="ltr">I played about an hour of Solasta II and the most striking part of the demo was how closely the game more strictly sticks to the parameters of D&amp;D 5e in comparison to a game like Baldur's Gate 3. You can't, for example, drink a health potion and melee attack on the same turn. Baldur's Gate 3 adopts the commonly homebrewed rule (and now official rule in the latest edition of D&amp;D) that considers drinking a health potion to be a bonus action and not an action, so you could reserve your action to attack and then use your bonus action to heal on the same turn. That's not how it works in the rules for D&amp;D 5e, so that's not how it works in Solasta II. This parallel seems to extend across Solasta II and although I appreciate the accuracy, it does highlight some of the problems with D&amp;D 5e that games like Baldur's Gate 3 have already circumnavigated by outright changing how they work.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4448454-ss_a2f5cc428942714e8b9c11bfd4bd30c225755257.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4448454" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4448454-ss_a2f5cc428942714e8b9c11bfd4bd30c225755257.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4448454"></a><figcaption>Different members of the party will want to solve problems differently and sometimes have unique skill checks.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4448454-ss_a2f5cc428942714e8b9c11bfd4bd30c225755257.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Ignoring the comparisons to Baldur's Gate 3, the combat otherwise feels great. Figuring out when to use my Rogue's unique cunning action ability to bonus action dash so I can save her main action to attack an enemy being flanked by the Fighter (a scenario that lets me add sneak attack damage!) felt awesome. I was repeatedly rewarded for thinking things through before engaging a target. Knowing when and how to use resources is paramount as Solasta II tracks ammunition (so I had to keep count of how many arrows my short bow-wielding sorcerer had on him, for example), and there even seems to be a risk-versus-reward consideration tied to the rest mechanic, as the first time I tried to camp to regain health and recharge the party's abilities, one of the members of the party cryptically warned that doing so might cause enough time to pass, meaning I'd potentially miss out on future storylines. That added a sense of urgency to what seemed to be an optional quest in the demo, but I'm curious to see if this same feeling is applied to portions of the main storyline as well and how often resting might cause a player to miss out on a quest.</p><p dir="ltr">The critical path sees you take control of four adventurers--a dwarf, elf, human, and gnome--who are adoptive siblings. These brothers and sisters are traveling together as part of some sort of quest connected to their adopted family name and the legacy they've all inherited, which brings them into conflict with an ancient threat. It all seems like your traditional fantasy affair, but I only saw a snippet of this plot play out in the demo. The voice acting sounds great, and though face models sometimes descend into the uncanny valley, they're more often expressive and help bring added emotion to the scene that you, as a player, can pick up even if the four protagonists all failed their Insight checks.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4448456-ss_ab26a62f7b0b78fd46dfe698474191e75b2191f8.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4448456" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4448456-ss_ab26a62f7b0b78fd46dfe698474191e75b2191f8.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4448456"></a><figcaption>Combat in Solasta II follows D&amp;D 5's rules.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4448456-ss_ab26a62f7b0b78fd46dfe698474191e75b2191f8.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">I'm most curious to see how the full game will handle the roleplaying side of things. Unlike other RPGs in which you build a party of characters with different strengths and weaknesses, but only one member of the team talks during conversations, all four members of the adventuring party in Solasta II are fully voiced and contribute to every conversation. The game lists all the available dialogue options for each party member and which bonuses each one adds to the dice roll--you can see how the dwarf Paladin's high Persuasion makes him more adept at convincing someone to help you while the human Fighter's high Insight lets her be the better choice to tell whether the person you're talking to is lying.</p><p dir="ltr">That's really cool and feels like it has the potential to replicate the essence of being a group, as opposed to a talented spokesperson at the head of a squad, like Mass Effect's Shepard or Baldur's Gate 3's Tav. The demo didn't offer an opportunity to see how the effects of conversations could steamroll into consequences, stopping me from definitively proclaiming that this is the type of squad-focused, choice-driven dialogue I've wanted in my fantasy RPGs. But I see the potential vision and I'm excited to see how it pans out in the full game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4448457-ss_1877caf6cd5a36481af522878835d1418fd12204.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4448457" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4448457-ss_1877caf6cd5a36481af522878835d1418fd12204.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4448457"></a><figcaption>The facial animations in Solasta II look pretty good!</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4448457-ss_1877caf6cd5a36481af522878835d1418fd12204.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Each of the four characters can also be controlled as a group or independently with the keyboard instead of mouse clicks outside of battle, making it easier to guide them in comparison to similar RPGs. This makes stealth and thievery a viable strategy, which is rare in games like this, as the more precise movements ensure getting around enemy vision cones isn't a frustrating ordeal.</p><p dir="ltr">I'm still undecided on Solasta II. On one hand, it follows D&amp;D 5e's original rules to the letter, a 2014 tabletop system that has been iterated, expanded, and improved upon in the past 10 years. And keeping to rules without taking steps to change it might make for a game that is ultimately frustrating for players who have appreciated the efforts made by other developers in recent years. But the game takes strides in areas outside of combat that feel like vast improvements, like giving the player more precise control over how the protagonists move and bringing the full party into each conversation instead of having only one hero be the go-to voice. This is certainly a game I want to play more of, but I'll need more time with it before deciding where I land on it.</p><p dir="ltr">Solasta II is set to launch for PC. No release window has been announced but there's a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2975950/Solasta_II/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">free demo on Steam</a> if you want to try it out for yourself.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/617336/lost-records-bloom-and-rage-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The fuzz of the cathode-ray tube (CRT) monitor, alongside static grains and flickering scanlines, is a touchstone for ’90s-era nostalgia. It’s shorthand for those halcyon days when technology was predominantly analog and millennial kids spent their summers shoving bulky tapes into VHS players, recording favorite bits of their after-school television shows, and making their own home videos with camcorders. It’s this vignette that developer Don’t Nod Montréal leans heavily into in <em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage. </em>The game follows a blossoming friendship — and apparent falling-out — of four teenagers over an unforgettable summer. And it all starts with a good dose of that nostalgia: the ubiquitously blue anti-drug message that precedes the title screen, complete with the telltale flicker of a CRT monitor.</p><p>Such adolescent longing is all par for the course for Don’t Nod. Alongside <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/4/17934166/telltale-games-studio-closed-layoffs-end-the-walking-dead">Telltale</a>, the studio popularized the choose-your-own-adventure style of narrative games with <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/28/9627302/life-is-strange-season-wrap-up">Life is Strange</a></em>, while foregrounding the outsized pain and tribulations of teenhood. But more than just coating teenage drama in a layer of dreamy nostalgia, <em>Bloom &amp; Rage</em> is also an opportunity for Don’t Nod to write a story based in familiar settings. The era already has its own vocabulary and culture; it’s the era of riot grrrl, Bikini Kill, <em>The</em> <em>Blair Witch Project</em>, and video rental stores. Doing so helps <em>Bloom &amp; Rage</em> avoid the criticism of penning teenage slang and using outdated references that sound like they’re written by much older adults. This means a lot less “hella cool” and more “let’s bounce,” which is <em>definitely </em>a phrase I remember using as a teenager.</p><p>At first glance, <em>Bloom &amp; Rage</em> looks like another <em>Life is Strange</em>. Every moment is infused with the same emotional weight the series is known for, be it standing up to a bully or excitedly gushing about your new best friend to your cat. Then there’s the tinge of the supernatural. But while promising, it’s a tad early to see if <em>Bloom &amp; Rage</em> can surpass the juggernaut that was the original <em>Life is Strange</em>. That’s because <em>Bloom &amp; Rage</em> is a two-part adventure game — a nod to the episodic roots of its forebears — with the second half of the game expected to release in mid-April this year.</p><p>Set in the small town of Velvet Cove, you’ll play as Swann, one of the four central teenagers. The story is depicted across two time periods: the present-day Swann as an adult meeting her long-lost friends decades later, and her earlier days as an awkward teenager during the summer of ’95.</p><p>The first few minutes of <em>Bloom &amp; Rage</em> neatly set the stage. At first, the adult Swann is struggling with a tedious, mostly one-sided conversation with her mother over the phone, and she can choose to respond meekly, with indifference, or mere silence. Meanwhile, lots of objects in the vicinity are available for her to fiddle with: a receipt, some brochures, and even a bottle of maple syrup. While examining these will cause Swann’s mother to chide her for being distracted, this also demonstrates how Don’t Nod is expanding the ways in which dialogue can play out. You can look at specific objects and this will, at times, open up new dialogue choices that can influence your current and future conversations with other characters. It’s a small addition, but it helps make conversations feel more authentic, rather than simply choosing between binary choices of playing nice or being rude.</p><p>Flashbacks to Swann’s younger days make up the bulk of <em>Bloom &amp; Rage’</em>s first half, with the teenager navigating the thorny passage of adolescent friendships. In the beginning, Swann is a loner, largely reluctant to socialize and too awkward to belong anywhere — the familiar plight of every millennial teenager. Spending her days memorializing almost every waking moment with a camcorder, Swann will meticulously record clips of anything that catches her eye, before putting them together to make short films. Aside from the conversations, documenting Swann’s everyday life is the game’s central conceit, a bold gamble given how this can feel like busywork at first.</p><p>From fulfilling objectives that move the storyline along, such as filming the local video store (it’s one of Swann’s favorite haunts), to discovering collectibles in the form of crude graffiti and exotic birds, this almost reduces the game to an object-hunting adventure. Eventually, you may develop the tendency to just whip out the camcorder the moment cutscenes conclude. But there’s a lingering charm to this approach, highlighting how Swann tends to instinctively interact with the people around her through her camcorder. Making films is the one thing that empowers her. This is all the more poignant as she eventually comes out of her shell and hides less behind her lens.</p><p>And then there are Swann’s newfound friends — Nora, Autumn, and Kat — who similarly are more than just one-dimensional caricatures. There’s Nora who, for all her bravado and punk rock sensibilities, is one of the most conflict-averse individuals in the group and the quickest to suggest giving up when they get into trouble. Then there are seemingly villainous folks who are more multifaceted than what their initial hostility suggests, which isn’t revealed until you examine their behavior and personal artifacts.</p><p>These point toward complexities that a young Swann may not fully comprehend, evident in some of her childlike responses, but that the older Swann — and by extension, the player — can probably recognize. This is what Don’t Nod has always been adept at: crafting believable and deeply human characters and the abundant world that they inhabit.</p><p>Experiencing the idyllic memories of Swann’s days with her friends can be deeply emotional, as if chancing upon a time capsule you’ve forgotten about. These are long-buried moments about engaging in hours-long phone calls with close friends, partaking in rambunctious activities on the fly, and waxing lyrical about larger-than-life ambitions, like playing in famous bands or living in a secret getaway, hidden from the prying eyes of untrustworthy adults.</p><p>Seeing Swann, Nora, Autumn, and Kat trade lifelong promises and form intense bonds — ones so characteristic of deep female friendships — will hit close to home for many. It’s this juxtaposition between these idyllic scenes and the constant, foreboding reminder of the group’s inevitable fallout that feels so ominous, unnerving, and perhaps a little painful. And the vague, supernatural happenings only serve to heighten the anxieties of teenhood. Whether it serves a deeper, more metaphorical purpose still remains to be seen. </p><p>The first half of <em>Bloom &amp; Rage</em> ends in a dramatic cliffhanger, of course, but it’s one that’s not quite as audacious as it seems. Some hints have been hiding in plain sight. But a small concern lingers. Stories like these often introduce so many twists that could derail the game, before the story goes off the rails so quickly that it inevitably plummets. This was partly why the recently released <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24289524/life-is-strange-double-exposure-review-pc-ps5-xbox"><em>Life is Strange: Double Exposure</em></a> faltered in its concluding chapters. For now, there’s plenty of time to wonder; we still have to wait two more months or so for <em>Bloom &amp; Rage</em>’s melodramatic conclusion.</p><p><sub>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage <em>is available now on PC, PS5, and Xbox.</em></sub></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>NetEase is reportedly pulling back on its international game investments.</p>
<p>The Chinese megacorp's backtrack commenced at the end of last year when it cut jobs and/or "paused" productions at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-veteran-will-pause-operations-at-fresh-aaa-game-studio-while-seeking-new-partner">Worlds Untold</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-infinite-head-of-designs-netease-studio-halting-work-on-first-game-as-it-searches-for-new-publisher">Jar of Sparks</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/just-cause-creators-new-studio-suffers-layoffs-before-launching-first-game">Liquid Sword</a>, but now <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/netease-studio-cuts">Game File</a> reports the company is "actively shopping around more of its non-Chinese studios" in the hope of divestiture.</p>

<p>Sources talking to Game File under the promise of anonymity claim NetEase plans to divest itself of the majority of its overseas teams. If they can't secure a buyer, studios like Quantic Dream and Grasshopper Manufacture could face closure.</p>
<p>Other studios at risk include Anchor Point, GPTRACK50, Jackalyptic Games, Nagoshi, Pincool, Rebel Wolves, Skybox Labs, Studio Flare, T-Minus Zero Entertainment, and more.</p>
<p>NetEase declined to comment formally but told Game File: "All studios and projects are in constant review and evaluation, and NetEase will determine changes needed to be made throughout that process".</p>
<p>Earlier this week, NetEase <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-team-hit-by-layoffs-despite-major-launch-success">cut jobs at its US-based Marvel Rivals creative team</a>, despite the game's significant success, claiming the decision was made to "optimise development efficiency". It also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-surpasses-40m-players-as-netease-denies-abandoning-western-studios">insisted it "has not wavered in its global expansion plans"</a> amid reports it's unloading "as much as all" of its overseas game companies due to rising costs.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Matt reported that Marvel Rivals - which has been a huge success for publisher NetEase since its launch last year - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-was-reportedly-almost-cancelled-at-one-point-because-netease-objected-to-paying-disney">reportedly almost didn't make it to release</a> as its CEO objected to paying Disney for the use of its characters.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It was poised to show Valve isn’t the only one that can build an affordable, portable, potent handheld gaming PC — you just need the right design and the right OS. </p><p>I was intrigued <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338028/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-windows">when Valve’s own Steam Deck designers told me</a> this Windows handheld would double as the first authorized third-party SteamOS handheld this May. When I heard Lenovo had procured an exclusive AMD chip that would help that SteamOS version hit $499, I got excited for a true Steam Deck competitor. </p><p>But I’m afraid that chip ain’t it. </p><p>I’ve spent weeks living with a Legion Go S powered by AMD’s Z2 Go, the same chip slated to appear in that $499 handheld. I’ve used it with both Windows and Bazzite, a SteamOS-like Linux distro <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/30/24329005/bazzite-asus-rog-ally-x-steam-os-editorial">that eliminates many of Windows’ most annoying quirks</a>. I tested both directly against <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23951655/steam-deck-oled-review">a Steam Deck OLED</a> and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24088011/lenovo-legion-go-review">original Legion Go</a>, expecting to find it between the two in terms of performance and battery life. But that’s not what I found.</p><p>Watt for watt, its Z2 Go chip simply can’t compete with the Steam Deck, and it’s far weaker than the Z1 Extreme in last year’s handhelds. That’s inexcusable at the $730 price you’ll currently pay for the Windows version, and I won’t be the first reviewer to say so. But with this less efficient chip and a mere 55 watt-hour battery, I worry the Legion Go S isn’t a good choice at all.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->730</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>Good ergonomics</li><li>Great variable refresh rate screen</li><li>Powerful cooling</li><li>Fast 100W charging</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>Performance is too low</li><li>Windows is bloated and can’t be trusted to sleep</li><li>Somewhat slippery texture</li><li>Nearly useless touchpad</li></ul></div></div></div><p>I <em>want</em> to say that the Legion Go S “makes a great first impression,” but Windows 11 still features a terrible out-of-box experience. I spent nearly 45 minutes waiting for mandatory updates to install and dismissing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/11/24196408/dark-patterns-are-everywhere">dark-patterned</a> offers for Microsoft products that have no business being on my handheld gaming machine. </p><p>Still, the Go S is built far better than <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24088011/lenovo-legion-go-review">the original Legion Go</a>, whose flat-faced controllers felt awkward in my hands. The new portable has some of the best-sculpted grips I’ve felt on a handheld, though their smooth texture can feel a little slippery. I’d have gone with more aggressive stippling to help me hold its 1.61-pound weight.</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></p></div><div><p><cite>Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>But its buttons all feel precise and secure, if the triggers are longer than I’d like, and its concave-topped, drift-resistant Hall effect joysticks feel comfy and wonderfully smooth to spin. The only weak control is the touchpad, which is so tiny I flick repeatedly to move the cursor an inch at a time.</p><p>Audio is much improved from front-facing speakers, and a larger fan moves more air while staying quieter than before. And it’s one of the fastest-charging handhelds yet — I clocked each of its top-mounted USB 4 ports drawing a full 100 watts of USB-C PD power during actual use. The cooling and charging are so good, Lenovo lets you crank the chip up to 40-watt TDP while it’s plugged in or 33 watts on battery alone.</p><p>But as you’ll see in my benchmark charts, the Z2 Go simply isn’t in the same ballpark as the Steam Deck OLED’s “Sephiroth” chip. In some games, it can’t beat the Steam Deck at all, even if you plug it in and crank it all the way up. </p><div><h2>Legion Go S 720p benchmarks</h2><table><thead><tr><th><h3>Game</h3></th><th><h3>Legion Go S (Z2 Go)</h3></th><th><h3>Steam Deck OLED</h3></th><th><h3>Legion Go (Z1 Extreme)</h3></th><th><h3>Z1E vs. Z2 Go</h3></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>AC Valhalla, 15-watt TDP</td><td>44</td><td>52</td><td>49</td><td>11.36%</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>55</td><td>N/A</td><td>63</td><td>14.55%</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>60</td><td>N/A</td><td>69</td><td>15.00%</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>62</td><td>N/A</td><td>71</td><td>14.52%</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>65</td><td>52</td><td>73</td><td>12.31%</td></tr><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077, 15-watt TDP</td><td>36</td><td>52</td><td>42</td><td>16.67%</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>41</td><td>N/A</td><td>54</td><td>31.71%</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>45</td><td>N/A</td><td>59</td><td>31.11%</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>46</td><td>N/A</td><td>61</td><td>32.61%</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>49</td><td>52</td><td>62</td><td>26.53%</td></tr><tr><td>DX: Mankind Divided, 15-watt TDP</td><td>56</td><td>70</td><td>61</td><td>8.93%</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>63</td><td>N/A</td><td>84</td><td>33.33%</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>66</td><td>N/A</td><td>89</td><td>34.85%</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>67</td><td>N/A</td><td>91</td><td>35.82%</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>70</td><td>70</td><td>92</td><td>31.43%</td></tr><tr><td>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, 15-watt TDP</td><td>18</td><td>34</td><td>25</td><td>38.89%</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>21</td><td>N/A</td><td>28</td><td>33.33%</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>20</td><td>N/A</td><td>28</td><td>40.00%</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>24</td><td>N/A</td><td>28</td><td>16.67%</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>24</td><td>34</td><td>33</td><td>37.50%</td></tr><tr><td>Returnal, 15-watt TDP</td><td>24</td><td>26</td><td>32</td><td>33.33%</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>26</td><td>N/A</td><td>38</td><td>46.15%</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>29</td><td>N/A</td><td>40</td><td>37.93%</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>30</td><td>N/A</td><td>41</td><td>36.67%</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>32</td><td>26</td><td>38</td><td>18.75%</td></tr><tr><td>Shadow of the Tomb Raider, 15-watt TDP</td><td>53</td><td>61</td><td>50</td><td>-5.66%</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>53</td><td>N/A</td><td>69</td><td>30.19%</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>55</td><td>N/A</td><td>75</td><td>36.36%</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>64</td><td>N/A</td><td>73</td><td>14.06%</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>65</td><td>61</td><td>75</td><td>15.38%</td></tr></tbody></table><div><p><figcaption><em>Average framerates.

With the Steam Deck, which runs at 15-watt TDP, I can average 52 frames per second at an upscaled 720p resolution and low settings on battery power alone. But even if I feed the Legion Go S with 40 watts and plug it into a wall, the open-world game runs <em>slower</em> at 49fps. And that’s <em>after</em> a new set of drivers; the shipping ones were much worse.</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>In other games, cranking up Lenovo’s TDP by five, 10, or 15 watts can give it a comfortable lead over the Deck. But that significantly impacts battery. In Lenovo’s default 25W “Performance” mode, I saw some games run just as smoothly as on the Deck — but with total system power consumption of around 36 watts, draining the handheld’s 55 watt-hour battery in about an hour and a half. The Steam Deck, which drains at around 22 to 24 watts at full bore, lasts two hours at the same smoothness.</p><p>I have possible good news about SteamOS: when I installed Bazzite, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338405/valve-steamos-beta-other-handhelds-beyond-steam-deck#:~:text=In%20a%20lot%20of%20ways%20Bazzite%20is%20a%20good%20way%20to%20kind%20of%20get%20the%20latest%20and%20greatest%20of%20what%20we%E2%80%99ve%20been%20working%20on%2C%20and%20test%20it.%E2%80%9D">which can serve as a decent preview</a> of what SteamOS might look and feel like, I saw frame rates improve by an average of 16 percent in early tests (minus <em>Returnal</em>, which seems to hate Linux for some reason), and Bazzite is <em>such</em> a breath of fresh air after attempting to use Windows. But it still didn’t reach Steam Deck performance unless I sacrificed more battery to get it. That works with a handheld <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/30/24329005/bazzite-asus-rog-ally-x-steam-os-editorial">like the Asus ROG Ally X</a> with a big 80 watt-hour battery, but not so much here.</p><div><h2>Legion Go S Windows vs. Bazzite</h2><table><thead><tr><th><h3>Game</h3></th><th><h3>Legion Go S (Windows)</h3></th><th><h3>Legion Go S (Bazzite)</h3></th><th><h3>Steam Deck OLED</h3></th><th><h3>Bazzite vs. Windows</h3></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077, 15-watt TDP</td><td>36</td><td>42</td><td>52</td><td>16.67%</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>41</td><td>53</td><td>N/A</td><td>29.27%</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>45</td><td>59</td><td>N/A</td><td>31.11%</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>46</td><td>60</td><td>N/A</td><td>30.43%</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>49</td><td>60</td><td>52</td><td>22.45%</td></tr><tr><td>DX: Mankind Divided, 15-watt TDP</td><td>56</td><td>62</td><td>70</td><td>10.71%</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>63</td><td>74</td><td>N/A</td><td>17.46%</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>66</td><td>80</td><td>N/A</td><td>21.21%</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>67</td><td>84</td><td>N/A</td><td>25.37%</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>70</td><td>82</td><td>70</td><td>17.14%</td></tr><tr><td>Returnal, 15-watt TDP</td><td>24</td><td>17</td><td>26</td><td>-29.17%</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>26</td><td>22</td><td>N/A</td><td>-15.38%</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>29</td><td>24</td><td>N/A</td><td>-17.24%</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>30</td><td>25</td><td>N/A</td><td>-16.67%</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>32</td><td>25</td><td>26</td><td>-21.88%</td></tr><tr><td>Shadow of the Tomb Raider, 15-watt TDP</td><td>53</td><td>51</td><td>61</td><td>-3.77%</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>53</td><td>59</td><td>N/A</td><td>11.32%</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>55</td><td>62</td><td>N/A</td><td>12.73%</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>64</td><td>63</td><td>N/A</td><td>-1.56%</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>65</td><td>65</td><td>61</td><td>0.00%</td></tr></tbody></table><div><p><figcaption><em>Average framerates.

In my tests, the original Legion Go with Z1E runs anywhere from 15 percent to 40 percent faster comparing Windows to Windows — a lot for a handheld, where modern games struggle to reach smooth frame rates at all. </p><p>The Legion Go S does have an ace up its sleeve: its crisp, colorful 1920 x 1200 IPS screen looks better at lower resolutions than its predecessor’s 2560 x 1600 panel, and it runs more smoothly at lower frame rates now that it has VRR to adjust its refresh rate anywhere between 48Hz and 120Hz on the fly. I would not buy a Legion Go over a Legion Go S for this reason alone. </p><div><p><cite>Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>And if you primarily play games that don’t require performance, the Legion Go S is a bit more efficient at lower wattage: by setting TDP, brightness, and refresh rate low, I was able to achieve a total of just 7.5W battery drain in Windows and 7W in Bazzite while playing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24082252/balatro-review-poker-roguelike-videogame">magic math poker game <em>Balatro</em></a>. That should net me seven to eight hours of battery life, and you should be able to hit the four-hour mark without those tricks just by setting the Legion Go S to its 8-watt TDP “Quiet” mode. When I played the similarly easy to run <em>Slay the Spire</em> on the original Legion Go, pulling out all the stops, I couldn’t even reach five hours.</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>But again, the Steam Deck does efficiency better. Simply limiting frame rate to 25fps and brightness to 40 percent can yield over eight hours of <em>Balatro </em>on the Deck, and I’ve gotten four hours, 42 minutes in <em>Dave the Diver</em> there. With the Legion Go S, my Dave only got 2.5 hours to hunt those sushi ingredients and blow up fake environmentalists!</p><p>I am comfortable saying <em>no one</em> should buy the Windows version of the Lenovo Legion Go S, which costs $730 at Best Buy. Even if the performance, battery life, and price weren’t disqualifiers, Windows is a stain on this machine. And like other recent Windows handhelds I’ve tested, it does not reliably go to sleep and wake up again: I woke several mornings to find the system hot with fans spinning, even though I’d pressed the power button the previous evening. I found it uncomfortably warm pulling it out of my bag the other day. </p><p>Even if you prefer Windows to SteamOS, you can get notably better performance and far better battery life from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24204770/asus-rog-ally-x-review-handheld-gaming-pc">the $800 Asus ROG Ally X</a>, which is worth every extra penny, particularly since it doubles as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/30/24329005/bazzite-asus-rog-ally-x-steam-os-editorial">the best Bazzite machine you can buy</a>. </p><p>But even if you add Bazzite to the Legion Go S, it’s no Steam Deck, and I’m not sure that’ll change by May. If you’re waiting for a $499 Legion Go S with SteamOS, here’s my advice: just buy <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23951655/steam-deck-oled-review">a $530 Steam Deck OLED</a> instead. </p><div><div><p id="agree-to-continue-legion-go-s"><h2>Agree to Continue: Legion Go S</h2></p></div><p><em>Every smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and conditions before you can use it — contracts that no one actually reads. It’s impossible for us to read and analyze every single one of these agreements. But we started counting exactly how many times you have to hit “agree” to use devices when we review them, since these are agreements most people don’t read and definitely can’t negotiate.</em></p><p>To start using the Legion Go S, you’ll need to agree to the following:</p><div><ul><li><span>Microsoft Software License Terms: Windows Operating System and Terms of Use</span></li><li><span>Lenovo Limited Warranty and “Software license agreements”</span></li></ul></div><p>You can also say “yes” or “no” to the following:</p><div><ul><li><span>Privacy settings (location, Find My Device, sharing diagnostic data, inking and typing, tailored experience, advertising ID)</span></li></ul></div><p>That’s two mandatory agreements and six optional agreements.

		<p>2019’s Stygian: Reign of the Old Gods was a promising CRPG that featured some neat madness mechanics and a tone and atmosphere that perfectly suited its Lovecraftian influences. It did, however, suffer from some difficulty spikes and a few terrible bugs that have never been fixed. I was therefore surprised to see another game in the series appear, especially given that it comes from a completely different developer and takes on an entirely new gameplay style and perspective. The old-school top down approach has been replaced in Stygian: Outer Gods by a first-person view that provides a more immersive and, dare I say, modern experience.</p>

<p>My time with the demo – which will be available as part of Steam Next Fest from Monday 24th February – began with a mysterious vision in a strange otherworldly environment before reverting to the familiar setting of an office stacked with esoteric items. This is textbook Lovecraft and reminded me of the likes of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/10/31/call-of-cthulhu-review-maddening/">Call of Cthulhu</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/06/27/the-sinking-city-review/">The Sinking City</a>. Similar to those titles you soon find yourself stranded in a coastal town with a mystery to solve and dangers to overcome.</p>


<p>Before you set out on your investigation, however, you can customise your character by interacting with the mirror in your bathroom. A series of questions are posed and your answers affect various character stats, from your occult knowledge to your lockpicking skills. The latter proved a little unhelpful in my playthrough as every attempt to pick a lock failed, despite that being my chosen skill. Hopefully these aspects will be refined for the final build although I quite liked how the effects of the dialogue choices weren’t spelled out for you.</p>


<p>The atmosphere of Stygian: Outer Gods is on point with derelict buildings and a stark coastline setting the scene and items that are clearly visible for the most part. There wasn’t a lot of variety in enemy design in this, but this isn’t surprising for what amounts to the game’s prologue. Audio design is also good and the otherworldly noises disturb and unsettle you.</p>
<p>The section contained in this build featured a mixture of stealth and combat, but it is clear that the final game is not going to be all-out action. Even single enemies will quickly kill you if you try and take them on toe to toe. Sneaking around them or using thrown bottles to distract them is far more effective, whilst manipulating the scenery is important to survive any unavoidable fights. Fortunately the AI is pretty easy to abuse, with knee high fences coming in clutch to protect you from damage. The demo features a few different melee weapons, with firearms being seen in preview footage of later areas.</p>

<p>Exploring the town is made necessary as you must find three panels for a locked gate in order to gain access a large mansion which seems to be the source of the mystery. This is a standard survival horror puzzle but feel somewhat out of place here given the game’s adoption of some immersive sim elements. Whilst exploring the town you’ll be blocked by a series of fences, but stacking boxes against them can create steps that allow you to bypass them. I was never entirely sure how intentional these moments were, although more traditional area blocking is achieved through boards that you can only break once you find an axe. The question remains, why couldn’t I just prop some boxes up against the gate and climb over it?</p>
<p>That kind of interior logic breaking aside, Stygian: Outer Gods is a promising stealth horror title that showed enough in the demo to both pique my interest and leave me wondering what other gameplay elements it’ll introduce. If Lovecraftian horrors are your bag of tentacles then make sure to wishlist this particular cosmic horror ready for its release – first with PC early access this year, and a full release in 2026.</p>
