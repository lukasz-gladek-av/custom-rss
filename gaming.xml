            <link>https://wccftech.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-the-crew-motorfest-xbox-game-pass-november-2025/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel-cosmic-invasion-the-crew-motorfest-and-more-head-to-xbox-game-pass-this-month.1356868/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Xbox has <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/11/18/xbox-game-pass-november-2025-wave-2/">announced the remaining games</a> heading to Xbox Game Pass for the back half of November 2025, and paired with the games that already joined the service this month, it makes November arguably the most stacked month Xbox Game Pass has had in 2025. An additional nine games are joining the service between today and December 1, including Marvel Cosmic Invasion and The Crew Motorfest.</p>



<p>Two of the nine games are day one arrivals into Game Pass, including the aforementioned Cosmic Invasion and Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault, which is finally set to launch in early access after it was delayed <a href="https://wccftech.com/moonlighter-2-the-endless-vault-officially-set-to-launch-in-summer-2025/">from its initial summer 2025 release window</a>. The sequel to the action-adventure game that lets you lead a double life as a shopkeeper and a dangerous explorer is looking to build on the momentum of the original, which sold more than two million copies overall.</p>



<p>Besides the two-day-one launches, two of the other notable titles entering the service this month are the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-says-the-crew-2-and-the-crew-motorfest-will-get-offline-modes/">latest entry in Ubisoft's popular driving series, The Crew Motorfest</a> and last year's action game from DON'T NOD, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/banishers-ghosts-of-new-eden-dont-nods-finest-action-game-yet/">Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden.</a> There are also two more releases from this year, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/revenge-of-the-savage-planet-review-funny-beautiful-and-tedious/">Revenge of the Savage Planet</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-records-bloom-and-rage-missed-expectations-dont-nod-signs-deal-with-netflix/">Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</a>.</p>



<p>Under Xbox's new tiered system for Game Pass, we know that most day-one releases will only be available to those at the top-tier Ultimate level subscription, but it's worth pointing out that in this batch of Game Pass additions, seven out of nine are only available to Game Pass Ultimate subscribers.</p>



<p>In fact, it's worth noting that none of the games entering the service today will be available to players at the lowest tier, Game Pass Essential. At least those players at the bottom tier aren't losing any games with the titles leaving the service this month.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of Xbox Game Pass games coming to the service for the rest of November 2025:</p>



<ul>
<li>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault - November 19 - PC - Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>Kulebra and the Souls of Limbo - November 19 - Cloud, Console, PC - Game Pass Premium and up</li>



<li>Revenge of the Savage Planet - November 19 - Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S - Game Pass Premium and up</li>



<li>Monsters are Coming! Rock &amp; Road - November 19 - PC - Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>The Crew Motorfest - November 20 - Cloud, Console, PC - Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden - November 25 - Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S - Game Pass Premium and up</li>



<li>Kill It With Fire! 2 - November 25 - Cloud, Console, PC - Game Pass Premium and up</li>



<li>Marvel Cosmic Invasion - December 1 - Cloud, Console, PC - Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage - December 2 - Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S - Game Pass Premium and up</li>
</ul>



<p>Lastly, as always, with games entering the service, there are games leaving. This month, on November 30, Game Pass subscribers will no longer have access to the following five games through their subscription:</p>



<ul>
<li>Barbie Project Friendship</li>



<li>Lords of the Fallen</li>



<li>Octopath Traveler</li>



<li>Octopath Traveler 2</li>



<li>SteamWorld Build</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Today, NCSOFT subsidiary ArenaNet delivered a surprise announcement with Guild Wars Reforged, an updated version of the classic MMORPG that will be released on December 3.</p>



<p>The original game launched in April 2005 and established the studio originally founded by former Blizzard developers. Over the years, Guild Wars was played by more than nine million users, who spent over a billion hours in the fantasy world of Tyria. ArenaNet eventually released the sequel seven years later and has focused mainly on <a href="https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-2-visions-of-eternity-expansion-out-now-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Guild Wars 2</a> ever since, but a small fanbase remained loyal to the original.</p>



<p>Guild Wars Reforged is being co-developed with 2weeks, a small studio founded last year by former ArenaNet developers. Brandon Dillon, co-founder of 2weeks, said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>It’s a real treat to revisit the original Guild Wars. Beginning as a teenager, I’ve been involved with this franchise from the very start, collaborating with the original studio founders to create the world of Tyria. Partnering with ArenaNet to update and improve the player experience means the game can continue to be a beloved beacon for fans of multiplayer online RPGs for years to come.</em></p>



<p>Game Director Stephen Clarke-Willson added:</p>



<p><em>Even after two decades, we’re still passionate about improving the experience of the original Guild Wars for players. The game has a dedicated group of fans, and with this update to modernize the experience, we hope players new and old will find a reason to continue adventuring through Tyria together.</em></p>



<p>As mentioned in the headline, Guild Wars Reforged will deliver controller support, make the game Steam Deck verified, and also bring a host of graphic enhancements, such as high-DPI support for modern high-resolution monitors, new HD skill icons, rendering improvements including new antialiasing options, ambient occlusion, enhanced bloom, more font size options for game text, enhanced 3D environmental audio, and a new quest-tracker.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/dust-to-damnation-legends-of-avantris-daggerheart-exploration-building-wild-west</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dust-to-damnation-legends-of-avantris-daggerheart-exploration-building-the-wild-west-and-keeping-things-simple.1356862/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Dust To Damnation is a new mini-campaign from the team at <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6d404c6b-162e-45bc-be64-2ca3cd9efba5" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/crooked-moon-review-incredibly-spooky-adventure-that-dms-will-love" rel="nofollow">Legends of Avantris</a>. Stepping into <em>Daggerheart </em>this wild-west themed campaign brings with it the deep story and the deeply funny that you'd come to expect from this group. As the campaign has been releasing I got to sit down with DM Mikey Gilder to understand how he built the world and get his thoughts on <em>Daggerheart</em>.</p>

<p>"Dust To Damnation is our three part (six episode) <em>Daggerheart </em>mini-campaign. It's a campaign in the Colossus of the Drylands campaign frame. It follows the folk of a town called Eden." Gilder introduced me to the plot. The Colossus of the Drylands campaign frame is one that the <em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="951117a2-07e4-403b-b1c3-26041d599e45" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/daggerheart-review-narrative-forward-yes-and-ttrpg-that-is-force-to-be-reckoned" rel="nofollow">Daggerheart Core Rulebook</a></em> describes as a mix between Red Dead Redemption and Shadow of the Colossus or Attack On Titan.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In <em>Daggerheart,&nbsp;</em>a Campaign Frame is a setting that an adventure might take place in. You can play <em>Daggerheart </em>in a traditional high-fantasy setting, but there are also pre-made Campaign Frames that lean into grimmdark concepts, the weird west, or a setting where your party will cook the monsters you kill.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"It starts with the Sheriff returning after a long time away. [Shephard] is coming back to the town and a lot has changed and he finds out as soon as he is back that his deputy has been murdered and that kicks off the primary action."</p>

<p>There are a number of campaign frames included in the <em>Daggerheart </em>Core rules so I was interested to know if this had been picked for them as they were partnering with Darrington Press, or if there was something in particular about the setting that really spoke to him. Gilder revealed that he hadn't always been the planned DM for this adventure.</p>
<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed//LBZciFpxQNk"></iframe></p>

<p>"We knew the general scope, three sessions as a mini-campaign, but I wasn't originally going to GM it. Either Andy or Derek was going to GM it. Then we were reading through the Campaign frames, and I haven't GM'd in a very long time and so I decided to come out of my pseudo-retirement because the Campaing Frame was just so compelling."</p>

<p>This production was a combined effort of Darrington Press, publisher of <em>Daggerheart</em>, and Legends of Avantris. Talking on how the partnership came up Gilder explained that this has been a long time coming.</p>

<p>"We have been talking to the folks at Darrington and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d74413d3-67d3-4bdf-af02-6270f155a945" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/critical-role-campaign-4-cast-interview-character-creation-incorrect-fan-collages" rel="nofollow">Critical Role</a> for a while now, and we always knew we were going to partner together," Gilder alluded to different meetings at conventions that had been going on. "Once <em>Daggerheart </em>was officially out there we decided a sponsored mini-campaign was the best place to start."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"We told [Critical Role] we can tell tight storied in 3-5 sessions, it was pretty much a no brainer"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Speaking to his love of the Wild West Gilder highlighted classic movies as well as series like Deadwood. "That [love of Western's] combined with the giant colossi, it was a pretty obvious choice for me to do it. I read through it once and I immediately knew what I wanted to do and that really goes to show the strength of the Campaign Frame."</p>

<p>Having reviewed and played <em>Daggerheart </em>when it released earlier this year I was clue'd in to the colossus that roam this setting but watching the mini-campaign an unaware viewer might not know what to expect. "I decided to not go really super hard into the whole colossus stuff, and then build up into it. So we could focus on a smaller human story and then build up towards the colossus and the massive stakes that are part of the campaign frame."</p>

<p>Gilder also commented that they weren't entirely sure how their group would get along with the system but they wanted to create an experience for viewers that might be shared with their table's first time playing <em>Daggerheart</em>. "It was very deliberate that we didn't spend a lot of time studying."</p>

We've gotten into some systems, and not cared for others." Gilder spoke about the group's history "<em>Daggerheart </em>really clicked with us extremely quickly, three of us had gotten a demo [...] then when we sat down and all of the extra addons, the cheat sheet and the cards made it easier to play the game."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"We were very surprised at how useful the peripherals were and how easy it is to just dive in"</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Building The Town Of Eden</h2>

<p>Throughout the exploration of the starting town of the adventure, Eden, I immediately fell in love with the different characters. Each exactly as you'd expect from Western movies, but with a <em>Daggerheart </em>twist. I was interested to learn more about how Gilder populated the world.</p>

<p>"This is, in part, a huge loveletter to David Milch who is the creator of Deadwood and the actors and writers involved in that show and I think that's a huge reason why I got into storytelling and narrative." Gilder explained "The way that I approach story is very archetypical. The tropes that you expect in a genre I think are really important."</p>

<p>"It was me getting to pick the fun archetypes and tropes, and characters from Deadwood that I loved that I could plug in and do my version of a rough impression. When I don't have an impression it's still going to the archetype of a school teacher and really making sure that I approach the theme and turn it up to 11 so you IMMEDIATELY felt like you were in a weird west setting."</p>

<p>Diving deeper into some of the mechanics of <em>Daggerheart,&nbsp;</em>I spoke with Gilder about the different outcomes of checks in <em>Daggerheart</em>, not just being pass/fail but that you can have a success where you don't get everything you want, and a failure where something good can happen. I wanted to get Gilder's thoughts on this different approach to rolling outcomes.</p>

<p>"It is certainly more cognitive load, I will say, that general thrust of complications and varying degrees of success is an aspect that I bounced off of on other systems like PBTA but I think that <em>Daggerheart </em>does it in a way where the GM is still equipped to adjust and tweak."</p>

<p>Gilder spoke highly of the options given not only to the player but also the GM "It equipped me to be like 'oh wait, you succeeded with hope, I have GM fiat to then really make this awesome victory that you had'" Gilder jokes that a lot of other systems try to take those overly large victories away with additional rules.</p>

<p>On the flip side a success with fear does a lot to empower the GM too. "Even if they hit the bad guy, then I get a fear and the spotlight shifts to me and I can spend that Fear on something else. That was one of the bigger aspects of the system, especially if you've only played Dungeons &amp; Dragons."</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/avantris-daggerheart-dust-to-damnation01.jpg?itok=GipisK_u 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/avantris-daggerheart-dust-to-damnation01.jpg?itok=6cpPhRWb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Gilder did highlight that his use for fear, joking that it might not be the 'right' way to GM <em>Daggerheart </em>was to "not use Fear in non-combat scenarios. When it comes to roleplay that's where it's very natural for us. For me building up the fear and having really brutal and terrifying combat, spending as much as I can at the beginning to make it scary. Then if I don't generate anymore and the players come and wipe out the adversary that's narratively valid."</p>

<h2>The Key To A Strong One-Shot Start</h2>

<p>Watching along with the stream I was enthralled from the getgo, I was interested to hear from Gilder what his guiding principal was when creating a mini-campaign or one-shot that hits the ground running.</p>

<p>"My secret to success is effectively the buy in from the players, basically this is the scene and you're introduced, and you're introduced, and you're introduced," Gilder explained counting off his castmates. "Nikki and Derek, who play Quibly and Portia Bella, they sat there for like an hour and a half while we introduced them."</p>

<p>"If they're meeting for the first time you need to have a plan of how you're going to drive the story forward. In a one-shot, when you have less time, it needs to be GM driven and you need to keep your foot on the gas. You're drawn into the call to action so there's no debate as to what to do and there's no back and forth which can eat up a lot of time at the table."</p>

<p>Every good campaign needs a good villain so I was also eager to have Gilder explain his philosophy behind creating one. "That is my favorite part of GMing, it's the villains. I think when it comes to creating a good villain I've never been a fan of the dark lord in the tower."</p>

<p>"I think that having that human connection is really important. You don't need a ton, but I think it's really important when you only have one scene before the final confrontation and I think as long as you make sure you tie into the antagonist into what they represent and you present that very clearly and present the direct conflict it feels very personal."</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Being a fan of TTRPGs I know what I like behind my GM screen and I know there's hundreds of different ways to approach what tools you use. I was interested to hear what it was that Gilder keeps behind his GM screen to run Dust To Damnation.</p>

<p>"I have a very ramshackle vibe behind the screen, I really just have the PDF open, and what I do is I have a google drive with screenshots of relevant sections that I might need." Gilder waved a finger in the air pointing to imaginary reference material "Then I have printed out a GM cheat sheet. Then just having your stat blocks where you can get them and scrap paper and a pen."</p>

<p>"Our production, despite how much we've grown, it isn't super polished," Gilder joked, "We don't have all of these miniatures or terrain; we have a Chessex Battle Map and bottle caps with tokens that are highly readable."</p>

<p>Explaining further Gilder likes the idea of putting the basics out on the table, for the players and fans at home to be able to fill in the finer details of any encounter.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lego-drops-major-black-friday-deal-on-r2-d2-set-now-going-for-mere-pennies-on-amazon-2000645124</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>LEGO rarely slashes the prices on its Star Wars sets aggressively since they sell at full retail throughout most of the year. This R2-D2 building set just became <strong>the first major Star Wars release</strong> to see a substantial Black Friday discount, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4474/">now sitting at $79 instead of the usual $99 price tag</a>. That’s a new all-time low on a set that already flies off the shelves with its nearly <strong>perfect 4.9 out of 5 stars rating</strong> across thousands of reviews.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4474/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>1,050 Pieces That Build an Iconic Droid</h2>
<p>This completed model of R2-D2 <strong>is over 9 inches tall, with a 6-inch width and a 4-inch depth</strong>, and offers significant desk or shelf presence without dominating entire surfaces. The cylindrical body features curved bricks and plates to achieve R2-D2’s characteristic dome shape and blue-white color scheme. The detail work features printed tiles for control panels, sensor arrays, and characteristic red and blue panels that help define R2-D2’s look throughout the Star Wars films.</p>
<p>Functional features add play value <strong>beyond static display</strong>: The dome head rotates 360 degrees with smooth action, letting you position R2-D2 looking in any direction. A detachable third leg extends from the body, recreating the droid’s mobility configuration seen throughout the original trilogy. An attachable periscope replicates the scanning device R2-D2 deploys in various scenes and additional tool attachments represent the droid’s utility arms and mechanical appendages.</p>



<p>Accompanying the set is a bonus 25th Anniversary Darth Malak mini-figure to commemorate LEGO Star Wars’ quarter-century of releases. Darth Malak originates from the Knights of the Old Republic video game era and represents deep-cut Star Wars lore instead of the usual movie characters that casual fans may be more familiar with. The minifigure sports unique printing, with Malak’s distinctive metal jaw prosthesis and Sith robes.</p>
<p>The building complexity is firmly in the intermediate range and thus appropriate for the 10-plus age recommendation. The instruction manual breaks construction into clearly numbered steps across multiple bags, letting you build the model over several sessions without losing track of progress. Younger builders might need adult assistance with some of the curved sections where brick placement becomes less intuitive. The <strong>1,050-piece count delivers several hours of building time</strong>, and lands between a quick evening project and a multi-day marathon build.</p>



<p>Color accuracy matches R2-D2’s on-screen appearance using bright blue, white, and light gray elements. Recent improvements to LEGO’s color palette mean that the blues match between different batches and piece types, avoiding some of the color variation issues that affected some of their older sets. Specialized curved and angled pieces create smooth surfaces rather than a stepped, pixelated look, common in early LEGO character attempts.</p>
<p>At $79, you’re paying roughly $0.075 per piece which falls below typical LEGO Star Wars pricing that usually hovers around $0.10 per piece. Licensed sets command premium pricing compared to generic LEGO themes which makes any discount on Star Wars releases noteworthy.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Most of us wait for year-end sales to grab big-ticket items, and it’s finally that time of the year. Black Friday is still a week away, but you don’t have to wait till then to start saving. Early deals are coming in hot already!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5664/">Those who have been looking to upgrade their gaming setup for less can now grab the 27-inch LG UltraGear OLED gaming monitor for just $500 on Amazon, after a massive 44% drop in its retail price of $900</a>. It’s definitely not your average markdown, as most other options with somewhat similar spec sheets sit well over $1,000. But as you’d expect, it’s a limited-time discount. The retailer hasn’t mentioned when the deal ends, but based on past trends, it’s safe to say it won’t be around for long. Hurry to grab yours before the price goes back up, or the stock expires for good.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5664/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Brilliant Color Accuracy for Lifelike Visuals</h2>
<p>The size is fairly decent. It’s not too big to take over your entire desk space, nor too small to make everything feel cramped; just the right size. The 27-inch screen supports VESA DisplayHDR True Black 400, which offers brilliant color accuracy, especially in scenes with low light. The 1.5 million:1 contrast ratio paired with 98.5% DCI-P3 color coverage makes sure all your favorite content appears lifelike, just how the creator intended. You’ll get brighter highlights in daylight scenes and excellent clarity in the dark, which is great for spotting the bad guys hidden in the shadows.</p>



<p>The screen also has an anti-glare, low-reflection coating that makes it easier on the eyes. You won’t have to fight reflections in brighter settings or squint to see what’s on screen during the day.</p>
<p>Performance-wise, you’re getting a 240Hz refresh rate and an ultra-responsive 0.03ms GtG response time for ultra-fast, smooth gameplay. It’s officially G-SYNC Compatible and supports AMD FreeSync Premium Pro, meaning you’ll enjoy exceptional performance regardless of the GPU at hand.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5664/">You also have the option to make height, tilt, and pivot adjustments as you like. Sitting back or playing while standing – the monitor stays at just the right angle.</a> For connectivity, there are both HDMI 2.1 and DisplayPort 1.4 options, plus you even get a 2-year warranty on the OLED panel with your purchase for some extra peace of mind. Get your orders in before it shoots back up!</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/take-two-strauss-zelnick-gta-6-pc-console-exclusive-2000645103</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/take-two-ceo-says-consoles-won%E2%80%99t-die-but-pc-is-the-future.1356838/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The divide between PC and console gaming isn’t what it once was. Heck, in a world where <i>Gears of War</i> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-1-remake-combat-evolved-trailer-hwc-teaser-xbox-ps5-2000638911"><i>Halo</i> are on PlayStation</a>, the divide between console platforms isn’t even what it once was. And according to the CEO of <i>GTA 6</i>’s publisher, Take-Two, PC gaming is only going to grow.</p> <p>Speaking to CNBC (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-says-gaming-is-moving-towards-pc-but-gta-6-is-still-down-for-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-and-s-at-launch">h/t <i>IGN</i></a>), Take-Two’s CEO Strauss Zelnick said he sees the industry “moving towards PC,” as things become “open rather than closed.” He’s not completely writing off consoles, however, saying that the experience of sitting in front of a big screen for hours on end with a game is “never going away.”</p>

 <p>Given the current landscape, Zelnick’s comments ring true. Console exclusives are somewhat of an endangered species these days, with Microsoft publishing Xbox titles on its competitor’s platforms, the Switch 2 proving powerful enough to run titles like <i>Cyberpunk 2077</i> on the go, Sony publishing once PlayStation-only experiences on Steam, and, naturally, devices like the Steam Deck and the upcoming Steam Machine breaking down the boundaries that once restricted where and how we could play PC games.</p>

 <h2>How will the Steam Machine shake things up for console gaming?</h2> <p>Last week, <a href="https://kotaku.com/16-cool-details-valve-new-steam-machine-console-controller-vr-headset-2000643572">Valve showed off its impressive new hardware lineup</a>, including a new VR headset, a brand new Steam controller, and a cube-shaped mini-PC it calls the Steam Machine. Valve previously worked with PC hardware manufacturers to ship <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_Machine_(computer)">Steam Machines 10 years ago</a>, though they failed to catch on. But now that the company has dramatically improved the experience of SteamOS and the magic of running Windows games on a Linux operating system, if priced competitively, the new Steam Machine could become a pathway to having the kinds of “big screen” experiences Zelnick talks about with PC games.</p>

 <p>Speaking for myself, if the <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-machine-controller-steamos-reaction-price-date-2000643563">Steam Machine proves as awesome as it sounds</a>, I could see myself holing up in a cabin somewhere (with an internet connection!) to finish my entire Steam backlog without an Xbox or PlayStation in sight.</p> <p>I jest, but only slightly. As PCs continue to explore new form factors and Steam and other storefronts remain a reliable way to build and maintain a digital library, I don’t think it’s unreasonable to expect a slow and steady exodus from locked-in console experiences.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/gamestop-trade-in-anything-day-rules-2000645098</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gamestop-employees-are-freaking-out-about-%E2%80%98trade-anything-day%E2%80%99-%E2%80%98god-help-us%E2%80%99.1356832/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Earlier this week, meme stock retailer turned Pok</span><span>é</span><span>mon card pawn shop, GameStop, announced a new trade-in stunt engineered to go viral. “<a href="https://kotaku.com/gamestop-trade-anything-taxidermy-store-credit-2000644850">Trade Anything Day</a>” will let customers come in and hand over almost anything in exchange for store credit. Employees who weren’t told about the promotional stunt in advance are already preparing for the worst. Some are even trying to harness the chaos for a good cause.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>GameStop’s official announcement says people can bring in their junk and trade it in on December 6 for credit toward games and other purchases as long as it doesn’t violate a long list of exceptions. Those include hazardous materials, things that pose health risks, and Meta Quest VR headsets, for some reason. Trade-ins for stuff the stores normally accept will continue as usual.</span></p>

 <p><span>But that’s not the whole story. A flyer </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1ozzats/trade_anything_promotion_information/"><span>store employees received</span></a><span> goes into more detail and explains exactly how “Trade Anything Day”is supposed to work. Customers can only trade in one nonsense item that day. They only get $5 store credit, no matter what it is. At the very end, employees will be tasked with taking all of the qualifying items to local, approved donation drop-off points. Presumably everything else will be thrown out.&nbsp;</span></p>

   <p><span>“We’re getting so many calls already and people are being extra people-y already because they aren’t reading the rules,” one current employee told </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>. “The problem has been lately that they drop this stuff on socials and we find out hours or days later.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Other GameStop workers are already crashing out. “God help us,” reads </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1ozy57j/god_help_us/"><span>one thread</span></a><span> on the r/gamestop subreddit. “I’m not prepared for the ‘bring anything to trade’ day. I just know I’m going to have to handle some nasty shit. And not only that, we’re probably going to have to reject some of the things because they’re a biological hazard. I’m gonna have so many customers asking me ‘HoW cOmE yOu CaN’t TaKe iT iN?’ Cause we can’t bro.”</span></p>

 <p><span>The fact that all of the trade-ins have to be donated or thrown out has already inspired some stores to try and coax their customers into trading in canned goods and other non-perishables or toys that can be used for holiday gift drive charities. For some reason, GameStop isn’t advertising that part of the promotion. Instead it’s making jokes about trading in taxidermy animals.</span></p>

 <p><span>“A store next door to mine has a Toys for Tots bin, so we’re going to push for toys,” an employee told </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>. “A co-worker’s church is doing a coat and sweater drive so we’ll push for that. And we’ve talked to a couple of our regular Pok</span><span>é</span><span>mon collectors about bringing in a five-ish dollar card to join the collection of cards we give to kids who come in at my store and can’t get packs [because of scalpers].”</span></p> <p><span>They’re hoping this can add a silver lining to what otherwise promises to be a messy day. While GameStop is infamous for its poor trade-in values, store employees are also used to dealing with unreasonable customers expecting top dollar for last year’s </span><i><span>Madden</span></i><span>. I can only guess how it will go when they try to bring in a cardboard box of moldy junk and only get $5 off of </span><i><span>Kriby Air Riders</span></i><span> for it.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/asus-rog-strix-g16-ryzen-9-rtx-5070-1tb-drops-to-peanuts-amazon-offloads-2025-model-stock.1356829/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Gaming laptops require serious hardware in order to run modern titles at high settings without thermal throttling or performance compromises during extended sessions. The <strong>Asus ROG Strix G16</strong> (2025 edition) packs flagship-tier components into a portable package, and it is <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5674/">now $1,699 down from the usual $2,199 price tag.</a></p>
<p>That’s a <strong>record low for Black Friday on Amazon</strong> and it feels aggressive; after all, this is a 2025 model that just launched earlier this year. You’re getting an AMD Ryzen 9 9955HX processor paired with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 laptop GPU, 32GB of DDR5-5600 RAM, and a 1TB PCIe Gen 4 SSD.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5674/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Ryzen 9 9955HX and RTX 5070 Blackwell Architecture</h2>
<p>The <strong>Ryzen 9 9955HX is AMD’s newest high-performance mobile processor,</strong> boasting <strong>16 cores and 32 threads on the Zen 5 architecture</strong>. The base clock sits at 2.5GHz, while boost speeds go as high as 5.4GHz on single-threaded workloads for serious processing power in gaming, streaming, and content creation. It can also handle background tasks like Discord, multiple browser tabs, and streaming software without negatively impacting the actual performance of your game.</p>
<p>In the RTX 5070, t<strong>he new Blackwell architecture from Nvidia</strong>, the DLSS 4 support, and the Max-Q power optimization all come into play. DLSS 4 generates additional frames using AI processing, effectively doubling or tripling frame rates in supported games without quality loss. Ray tracing performance sees considerable improvements over previous 40-series cards, enabling ray-traced reflections and lighting without framerates penalties that made earlier generations impractical to use. The 8 GB of GDDR6 VRAM can handle 1440p gaming comfortably with high to ultra settings in current AAA titles.</p>



<p>The<strong> DDR5-5600 RAM is available in a 32GB capacity</strong> across dual channels, providing plenty of bandwidth for memory-intensive games and applications. This speed grade is a major leap from DDR4, which reduces latency in CPU-bound scenarios and improves minimum frame rates when things get really intense during gameplay. The 1TB PCIe Gen 4 SSD hits sequential read speeds of about 7,000 MB/s, which cuts game load times to just seconds instead of minutes.</p>



<p>The<strong> 16-inch ROG Nebula display runs at 2560 x 1600 resolution</strong> and has a 16:10 aspect ratio for more vertical screen real estate than is provided by standard 16:9 panels. The extra vertical pixels help with productivity work like coding or document editing, while gaming benefits remain minimal. The 240Hz refresh rate with 3ms response time creates incredibly responsive gameplay in competitive shooters and fast-paced action games.</p>
<p>The Tri-Fan cooling system consists of three separate fans, each connected to a full-width <strong>heatsink and leading air out through comprehensive venting coverage around the perimeter of the chassis</strong>. The aggressive setup here keeps temperatures comfortable even in hours-long gaming marathons with demanding titles. Fan noise stays reasonable at moderate levels of performance, only spiking audibly loud when pushing maximum GPU and CPU loads simultaneously. Liquid metal thermal compound on the CPU improves the efficiency of heat transfer compared to traditional thermal paste, and it drops temperatures by several degrees under load.</p>



<p>WiFi 6E support accesses the newer 6GHz band for reduced interference and lower latency compared to standard WiFi 6. Bluetooth 5.3 handles wireless peripherals with improved range and connection stability. The port selection houses <strong>dual USB-C with DisplayPort functionality, three USB-A 3.2 ports, HDMI 2.1 for 4K external displays, an SD card reader, and a 3.5mm audio jack</strong>.</p>
<p>Windows 11 Home pre-installs ROG’s Armoury Crate software for performance tuning, fan curves, RGB control, and system monitoring. Battery capacity hits 90Wh, providing roughly 4 to 6 hours during light productivity work and 1 to 2 hours when gaming unplugged. The included 280W power adapter handles the maximum system draw during peak performance scenarios.</p>
<p>You’re getting here current-generation flagship components for 23% below retail pricing on a laptop that only launched months ago. By comparison, competing gaming laptops from MSI and Alienware with similar RTX 5070 specs usually fall between $2,200 and $2,600.</p>

              <p>With sports titles be they Madden, FIFA, or NBA 2K, because we get a new entry each year, the value of a previous year’s entry drop dramatically once the new one comes out. So you can typically save quite a bit of cash by keeping up with the franchise on a one year delay as the price comes down. Though that comes with the caveat of never having up to date rosters and staying a year behind on any new changes to the series. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5666/">That changes right now though because the latest entry for basketball in&nbsp;<em>NBA 2K26</em> has dropped to just $30 at Amazon</a>. This is a 57% discount from its launch price of $70, saving you a whole $40 before our calendar’s have even reached the year that’s in the dang title.</p>
<p>As you can expect, the latest in this annual sports titles looks the best the series ever has — looking even better than the year’s before this one, which looked even better than the year’s before that one.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5666/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Any improvements to the gameplay are incremental as this series is built on a long legacy with just a single year turnaround before needing to put out the next one. If you pick up the latest NBA 2K each year, you’ll notice these changes. Among them is a updated shot meter. <em>NBA 2K25</em>‘s shot meter was met with criticism, the new one isn’t exactly a return to form but represents a much more intuitive and easier-to-time mechanic than the previous entry.</p>

              <p>There’s been a lot of exciting news from Valve in this past week with the company’s announcement of brand new hardware including a new controller, new VR peripherals, and a new home gaming console. What paved the way for the Steam Controller, Steam Frame, sand Steam Machine is of course the success of Valve’s handheld gaming PC — the Steam Deck. Valve has given gamers a great new way to experience every game on their platform on the go with the Steam Deck, but if you want to play more and more stuff, you’re going to want to expand your storage.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5662/">Amazon right now happens to have the Crucial P310 SSD on sale.</a> Black Friday weekend is still almost two full weeks away, but that hasn’t stopped the price of this Steam Deck gaming drive from dropping by as much as 46%. Right now, you can get the 1TB version on sale for $50, bringing the price down from $135 to just $85. For even more storage, you can also grab the 2TB version for $110 off, bringing the price down from $240 to just $130.</p>

              <p>What’s better than grabbing a reliable, powerful everyday machine that even comes with Windows 11 Pro installed, for under a grand? Probably not much.</p>
<p>If you have been looking for such a machine from a known brand, now is the time to make the move. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5661/">Amazon has currently dropped the price of the 15-inch Dell Inspiron touchscreen laptop to $960, which is a straightforward, no-fuss 70% discount on its retail price of over $3,000.</a> This is also the lowest price we have seen this laptop go for in a month, but the offer doesn’t end here.</p>
<p>The retailer is also throwing in a bunch of useful computing accessories with your purchase for absolutely nothing. The 5-in-1 kit is worth almost $200, but grabbing the laptop gets you that for free. Of course, deals this good don’t stick around for long, which is why we highly recommend getting your orders in fast. Once it’s gone, there’s no telling if it’ll return for Black Friday or if it’ll still be in stock by then.</p>

<h2>Ideal for Both Students and Work Professionals</h2>
<p>This machine looks quite basic, but it packs serious performance for both work and play. The overall design is quite minimal, and features a modest 15.6-inch touchscreen that pushes stunning visuals for all your tasks. The anti-glare coating makes it easy on the eyes in both bright and dim settings, so whether you’re working in daylight or tackling tasks late at night, you won’t be straining to see the screen.</p>
<p>Touch support makes it easier to navigate. You can simply use your fingers to scroll through long documents, swipe around, pinch, and even type assigments; great for when you don’t want to bother with the trackpad or the mouse.</p>



<p>For performance, you’ve got a 10-core 13th Gen Intel Core i7-1355U processor that clocks up to 5.0GHz, paired with a hefty 32GB of RAM. Together, these make it easy to perform all your tasks with ease, without even a hint of lag. Store all your important files with the spacious 1TB SSD, which also offers faster boot and load times than traditional drives.</p>
<p>Connectivity options include WiFi, Bluetooth, plus a wide range of ports to connect essential devices. <strong>The accessory kit gets you a patented mouse, a USB Hub, a 128GB USB flash drive, a 7-in-1 cleaning kit, and pre-installed Windows 11 Pro.</strong> That’s all you need to get started right away!</p>

<p>According to new developments in the lawsuit between Krafton and the founders of Sunautica 2, the former’s CEO has been accused of using ChatGPT and discussing takeovers in Slack messages. </p>



<p>For those unaware, a lawsuit is currently underway between Krafton and the founders of Subnautica 2, in which the former has been accused of wrongful termination t<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/krafton-wanted-to-delay-subnautica-2-to-avoid-250m-payout-lawsuit-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">o avoid paying $250 million</a>, and the latter has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/subnautica-2-developer-unknown-worlds-sues-former-leadership/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accused of abandoning the game</a> and rushing the release to earn the payout.  </p>







<h2 id="h-krafton-ceo-created-a-secret-task-force-called-project-x">Krafton CEO Created a Secret Task Force Called ‘Project X’ </h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://in.ign.com/subnautica-3/246938/news/fired-subnautica-2-founders-claim-krafton-ceo-used-chatgpt-to-brainstorm-ways-to-avoid-paying-250m-b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, new <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/950200391/Public-Version-Plaintiff-s-Pre-Trial-Brief" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">legal documents</a> reveal the ChatGPT accusations against Krafton CEO from the founders of Subnautica 2. The first claim states that Krafton CEO CH Kim was “frustrated” with the acquisition of Unknown worlds, and from his perspective, it was “a bad deal for Krafton — one under which [Krafton] can only be dragged around.” CH Kim was accused of discussing a potential takeover with CFO Richard Yoon on Slack. </p>



<p>The CEO was then accused of creating a secret task force called ‘Project X’, whose main goal was to “either make a ‘deal’ with the Founders on the ‘earnout’ or execute a ‘Take Over’ of Unknown Worlds. When the Founders refused to accede to Krafton’s demands, Krafton pulled the trigger.”</p>



<p>The legal document also states that CH Kim was informed by Maria Park,&nbsp;Krafton’s global head of corporate development, that “it seems to be highly likely that the earnout will still be paid if the sales goal is achieved regardless of the dismissal with cause.”&nbsp;The document then talks about Krafton’s CEO using ChatGPT “to help him brainstorm ways to avoid paying the earnout,” and the AI advised him that it’s “difficult to cancel the earnout.”</p>



<p>The documents also mention Subnautica 2 being ready for launch, with many reports pointing to it. The Unknown Worlds playtest data in May showed that the game “met players’ expectations”. Krafton’s internal expert declared that the plan 2025 release is the “best”. Maria Park stated the game was ready for an August launch. Thiago Oliveria “penned an impassioned essay in favour of launching in August”. Krafton’s corporate designee “could not name a single Krafton employee who actually thought the game was unready for release.”</p>







<p>In other news, Krafton is offering <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/after-pivot-ai-first-krafton-voluntary-resignations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">staff voluntary resignations</a> after the pivot to “AI First”.

                <p>The end of the year is shaping up to be a big one for SpongeBob SquarePants, as the hyper-energetic Goofy Goober fan has a new game out soon and a brand-new movie. To celebrate his big-screen return, Microsoft has revealed a new line of cursed Xbox controllers featuring the unblinking visage of SpongeBob. Just don't stare too long into the abyss, because it might stare back and offer you a greasy Krabby Patty to go.</p><p>SpongeBob fans can pick up limited-edition versions of the regular Xbox controller and the Xbox Elite Series 2 controller. Both controllers feature the same graphic of SpongeBob--but the Elite Series 2 has "pants" on the handles--yellow thumbsticks, and an orange D-pad. The Xbox home button and X face buttons have also replaced SpongeBob's pupils, but he seems to be in good spirits over being slightly inconvenienced.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLBj2KuzPto" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uLBj2KuzPto" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Since both of these controllers will also be available through the Xbox Design Lab, you can further customize them with a variety of button styles and upgrades like metallic triggers and D-pads, rubberized side and back grips, and engravings. Sadly, there's no option to give these devices a <a href="https://youtu.be/vpuRYLHf3ZE" rel="nofollow ">manly mustache makeover with some seaweed</a>.</p><p>These controllers will pair nicely with SpongeBob SquarePants: Titans of the Tide.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The promised 4K@60 FPS experience that the Steam Machine is said to deliver will rely heavily on AMD FSR and low settings, according to a new early analysis.</p>



<p>YouTuber <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.youtube.com/@ThePhawx">The Phawx</a> built a makeshift Steam Machine using available components to emulate the system's specs as much as possible, using the following components:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>AMD Ryzen 7 8840U CPU</strong> (2 cores, 4 threads disabled, clock speed lowered)</li>



<li><strong>Radeon RX 7600M XT GPU</strong></li>



<li>A<strong>MD Smart Memory Access</strong> was used to join them together, which is likely what the Steam Machine will do. </li>
</ul>



<p>This system was then used to verify whether the claims that the Steam Machine is six times faster than the Steam Deck and can deliver 4K@60FPS with AMD FSR are accurate.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-steam-machine-will-indeed-be-six-times-faster-than-the-steam-deck">The Steam Machine Will Indeed Be Six Times Faster Than the Steam Deck</h2>



<p>With their testing, The Phawx confirmed that the first claim is indeed real: the Steam Machine will be six times faster than the Steam Deck. In some GPU-bound tests, the makeshift system was actually 6.5 times faster than the handheld system, but this was due to the GPU being slightly more powerful than the one in the Steam Machine, which has a higher CU count that enabled it to handle ray tracing better as well.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-steam-machine-may-struggle-to-deliver-4k-60-fps-even-with-amd-fsr">The Steam Machine May Struggle to Deliver 4K@60 FPS, Even With AMD FSR</h2>



<p>However, the second claim, delivering consistent 4K@60 FPS with AMD FSR, appears questionable based on these early tests. The only tested game that offered a 4K resolution and 60 FPS experience was God of War Ragnarok, utilizing Intel XeSS in Ultra Performance Mode and low settings.</p>



<p>Other games, such as Warhammer 40K: Space Marines 2, Marvel's Spider-Man Miles Morales, Starfield, and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, delivered mixed results. None of them ran at 4K output resolution and 60 FPS, even with upscalers in Ultra Performance mode and low settings. Some would essentially require a 30 FPS lock to deliver an acceptable experience, such as Starfield.</p>

<p>Although the Steam Machine may not deliver the 4K@60FPS experience that top-end hardware does, the upcoming system is still set to <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/steam-machine-offers-equal-or-better-performance-70-gaming-pcs/">provide much better experiences than most players can have today on their systems</a>, according to Valve. <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/valves-new-steam-machine-packs-just-8-gb-vram-is-that-enough/">The 8 GB of VRAM could definitely be a problem</a>, but if the pricing will indeed be <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-machine-pricing-will-be-really-competitive-with-building-a-similar-pc/">as competitive as Valve claims</a>, the Steam Machine could have a significant impact on the market as a whole, much like the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/steam-deck-portable-console-for-power-users/">Steam Deck</a> did when it heralded the era of handheld gaming systems upon its launch.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>For better or worse, we live in an age of man. The last ships to Lothlorien sailed off long ago; the three Fates have ceased their weaving; Arthur still waits in his tomb for resurrection. Dungeon synth artist Erang’s <a href="https://erang.bandcamp.com/album/tome-zero?ref=aftermath.site"><u>new album <em>TOME ZERO</em></u></a> contains ten melancholy tracks written while trying to process this age without magic.</p><p>Nailing down what, exactly, makes <a href="https://aftermath.site/dungeon-synth-ambient-magic-fantasy-tolkein-medieval/"><u>dungeon synth</u></a> different from the many other genres of ambient synthesizer music is a little difficult. Although dungeon synth began as a black metal offshoot genre, its revival post-2012 by artists like Erang is more rooted in the aesthetics of medieval fantasy than the aesthetics of black metal. This has led to a broader swath of influences, whether they come from fantasy novels, movies, or video games.</p><p>“My dad, born in 1946, is a huge fan of fantasy and science fiction,” Erang told me over email. “When I was a little kid, he used to tell me the stories of Bilbo fighting the spiders or the riddle in the dark with Gollum to put me to bed. We had <em>The Silmarillion </em>at home. Later (like any kid from 1982) I fell in love with all the movies from that golden era: <em>Conan</em>, <em>The Dark Crystal</em>, <em>Legend</em>, <em>Willow</em>, etc.”</p><p>Erang said that all of his dungeon synth albums exist as narratives in a fantasy world of his own creation.</p><figure><figcaption><span>A portrait of the artist (</span><a href="https://erang.bandcamp.com/album/tome-zero?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer"><span>Erang</span></a><span>)</span></figcaption></figure><p>“I’ve been very active in the revival of Dungeon Synth with my first album, <em>TOME I</em>,” he said. “All my albums take place in a world of my own creation, the Land of the Five Seasons: fantasy and fictional inventions mixed with my personal history, people and places from my real life, forever lost.”</p><p><em>TOME ZERO</em> is another part of this cycle, blending real life anxieties of the trajectory of the world with synthesizers that settle in your headphones like mist creeping over a castle wall. On bandcamp, he describes it as “cathartic music to face the darkness and, if not overcome it, at least cope with it.”</p><p>“Well, [it’s] nothing really new, and I’ll state the obvious here,” Erang said before listing off a familiar series of concerning trends: “Political madness, ecological threats, wars between nuclear powers, the rise of AI, fake news, and the omnipresence of social media and phones… Things have kind of accelerated lately, and I guess it’s depressing for a lot of us, even in wealthy countries.”</p><p>While the current state of the world is distressing, he also said that he doesn’t see things in terms of “hope or despair,” and instead takes the long view.</p><p>“I don’t think there’s any meaning in our existence or in the universe at all,” he said. “Nature and science don’t care about hope or despair, if you know what I mean. We just exist, if that word makes any real sense at all, and that’s it.”</p><p>That may sound rather bleak, but for Erang’s artistic practice, it gives him a clarity of vision. Erang said that making art is his lifeblood—he isn’t able to <em>not</em> do it. And in return if the music he makes touches other people, then that’s enough. If, as Erang told me, prisoners in concentration camps still make drawings, then art is never futile.</p><p>“I can’t do anything other than create every day, or I’ll drown in madness,” he said. “And I’ve received many messages over the years from people living in very difficult situations or in countries at war, who told me that my music helped them feel a little bit better during the short time they were listening to it.”</p><figure><figcaption><span>(</span><a href="https://erang.bandcamp.com/album/tome-zero?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer"><span>Erang</span></a><span>)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Instead of being driven by vocals and lyrics, dungeon synth is primarily driven by tone, mood, melodies and rhythms. Erang said that this album marks a “new beginning,” and was inspired by artists like LORN, Boards of Canada, Oneohtrix Point Never and ULVER. Tucked away near the end of <em>TOME ZERO</em> is a song with vocals on it, which Erang recorded on an old German tape recorder that his grandfather owned in the 1970s.</p><p>“When I make music or drawings, it’s always a very organic process,” he said. “It’s like a big puzzle, and even I don’t know what the final image will be, but it all makes sense once it’s finished. I don’t plan things. They reveal themselves as I work on the album. So I can’t tell you why I made this track, but it was needed at that very moment in the album.”</p><p>Listening to the album feels a bit like holding your hands around a candle as the flame flickers, threatening to go out. The tones sound distant and delicate—Erang’s voice on “La mort d’un parent (Death of a parent)” crackles, sounding as if he is idly singing this tune to himself, in an old room, all alone. It’s these brief glimpses of humanity and its texture that make the album stand out within the genre. It’s a reference to an imagined past, but taken in the context of our very material and depressing present day. As the album closes with “The Last Child on Earth,” it leaves you with the sounds of children playing. I sat in silence after it was over, feeling like I had just returned from a long journey. While the album does at times feel bleak, it doesn’t wallow in it. In the world of <em>TOME ZERO</em>, there will be another dawn.</p><p>“My goal isn’t to drag the listener further down,” Erang said. “If these tracks can provide even the smallest cathartic release or help someone cope with the darkness for a brief moment, then my job is done.”</p><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/dungeon-synth-ambient-magic-fantasy-tolkein-medieval/"><div><p>I Found A New Age Of Magic At A Dungeon Synth Show In Queens - Aftermath</p><p>I found myself in the back room of a bar in Ridgewood, wearing elf ears and bobbing my head to the sounds of a synthesized glockenspiel.</p><p><span>Gita Jackson</span></p></div></a></figure>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/delta-force-devs-caught-stealing-rust-assets-for-new-trailer.1356784/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a post on social media, Rust’s COO, Alistair McFarlane, called out Delta Force’s development team for stealing assets from his game. In a new trailer that surfaced to promote an event in Delta Force, developed by TiMi Studio Group, an explosive asset was seen front and centre.</p>



<p>This was revealed by McFarlane as being ripped straight from Rust. He backed up his claim with receipts and later revealed that the Delta Force team had ‘reached out to apologize’.</p>



<h2 id="h-blatant-theft">Blatant Theft</h2>



<p>In a recent post on socials, Facepunch Studios’ COO, Alistair McFarlane, uploaded a screencap from a newly shared Delta Force trailer, which is several minutes long. He’d noticed that a brick of C4 and some circuitry seemed familiar. That’s because it was ripped from his own game, Rust.</p>



<p>The follow-up post from McFarlane showed exactly where that asset was, stating that it was ‘made full in-house’, and he even name-dropped the artist who created the explosive asset.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Several hours after posting the image and references, McFarlane responded with confirmation that Delta Force’s development team had reached out to apologize, and he stressed that the ‘matter is resolved.’</p>



<p>However, gamers in the comment section of these posts didn’t want Delta Force’s team to get off lightly, and tried suggesting that a mechanical spider seen in the opening of the trailer was a ‘Tick’ enemy from ARC Raiders, developed by Embark Studios.</p>



<p>It’s not, but it’s <strong>close</strong>.</p>



<p>The trailer uploaded by Delta Force was made to promote the game’s new season, which went live as the trailer dropped earlier today. Rust and Delta Force are two totally different games, but that’s besides the point.</p>



<p>Do you think TiMi Studio Group should be let off so lightly? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>In December 2025, 9 games will leave PlayStation Plus, including big titles like Battlefield 2042, Forspoken, and more. </p>



<p>PlayStation Plus is a subscription service known for providing online multiplayer access and a library of games for players to try. The library differs for the tier players are subscribed to, with three tiers to choose from: Essential, Extra, and Deluxe. We already saw the PS Plus Game Catalog add <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-plus-game-catalog-new-games-november/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nine new games</a> this month, and now a similar number will be removed next month. </p>







<h2 id="h-playstation-plus-will-be-removing-9-games-in-december-2025">PlayStation Plus Will Be Removing 9 Games in December 2025</h2>



<p>If you head over to the PS Plus page on your PlayStation 5 console, you will see that the Last Chance to Play section has been updated with several new titles. Battlefield 2042 is one of them, as expected, since we have seen all Battlefield titles leave the library every month since the release of Battlefield 6. Other big names are Forspoken, Grand Theft Auto III, and Sonic Frontiers, which I’m sure have many fans.</p>



<p>Interested readers can check out the complete list of games that will be leaving PlayStation Plus in December 2025 below: </p>



<ul>
<li>Battlefield 2042</li>



<li>Grand Theft Auto III</li>



<li>Arcade Paradise VR</li>



<li>Sonic Frontiers</li>



<li>Forspoken</li>



<li>Star Wars: Tales from the Galaxy’s Edge </li>



<li>Firefighting Simulator: The Squad</li>



<li>Surviving Mars</li>



<li>Star Trek: The Bridge</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you have never tried any of these games, I would definitely advise you to give some of them a shot before they are removed from the library. GTA III is a classic, Sonic Frontiers is a fun time, and Forspoken could be interesting to some as well. Each of their main stories requires around 20 or fewer gameplay hours and offers tons of side activities as well. </p>







<p>In other news, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-coming-to-playstation-plus-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Red Dead Redemption</a> will be coming to PlayStation Plus Game Catalog in December 2025. Additionally, PS Plus users can <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/grand-theft-auto-coming-to-playstation-plus-in-november/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">download GTA 5 this month</a>.

                <p>Nolan North is one of the most prolific voice actors of all time, lending his voice to hundreds of video games and animated series, but he didn't realize a character was supposed to be dead. That's mainly because Ubisoft told him he's still "technically" alive.</p><p>North had voiced Desmond Miles (among a few more characters) for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-assassins-creed-game-reviewed/2900-2178/" data-ref-id="2900-2178">Assassin's Creed series</a>. Desmond had been in five games, until the character's death in Assassin's Creed 3. It wasn't until he had gone online and came across fan reactions following the game's release that he was aware of this, however. </p><p>"That technically was Desmond's death scene, and I didn't know it," North told <a href="https://youtu.be/eEipR4kRQIE" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ">Fall Damage</a>. "I found out on Twitter. 'Are you upset Desmond's dead?' And I'm thinking, what? Because there's no 'Argh!' There's nothing that you'd expect from a main character's death, although the good people at Ubisoft have told me that he's not technically dead."</p><p>Eight years after Assassin's Creed 3, in Assassin's Creed Valhalla, the actor returned to the franchise as a mysterious character named The Reader. Valhalla's ending explains that The Reader is Desmond--or the very least, his consciousness, which now lives on inside the Animus. It seems that Ubisoft creatives explained this to North years before he recorded the lines in Valhalla. Even then, it didn't seem that might have been the original plan either.</p><p>"I think the original idea was eight or nine games with Desmond," North continued. "But, as it so often goes in the entertainment industry, different developers, different creative directors come in, and they have their own way of continuing the story--and it's done very, very well."</p><p>The latest entry of the franchise, <a href="https://gamespot.com/reviews/assassins-creed-shadows-review-shinobi-simulator/1900-6418344/" data-target="true">Assassin's Creed: Shadows</a>, was released back in the spring after a handful of delays. There are also long-standing rumors about a Black Flag remake, which reportedly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-4-black-flag-remake-wont-have-modern-day-sections-report/1100-6534827/" data-ref-id="1100-6534827">will be Animus-free</a>.</p>

<p>We called Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden a "haunting story of consequence" on its release. "Don't Nod drops the melodrama for a poignantly performed story about grief and injustice, where the difficult choices tug at your heart and principles," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/banishers-ghosts-of-new-eden-review">Eurogamer's four star review</a>.</p><p>As for Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage, our former editor Tom Phillips also awarded the first tape four stars. "A fascinating new narrative adventure from the original <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange">Life is Strange</a> team, this first slice boasts fresh twists that help move the formula forward, even if its story sometimes feels a remix of genre tropes," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lost-records-bloom-rage-tape-1-review">he wrote in Eurogamer's review</a>.</p>

<p>Huzzah, we thought, as we pondered who would be the best person to talk to about the 1996 point-and-click adventure making its way to Nintendo's latest hybrid. The answer, of course, is <strong>Charles Cecil <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_British_Empire">MBE</a></strong>, the co-founder of Revolution Software, and someone who has worked on the series from its very inception right up to the present day.</p>
<p>We sat down with Charles for a Zoom chat about all things Broken Sword and Switch 2, and, naturally, it wasn't long before our discussion turned to the good old days. We heard retellings of classic Revolution stories like THQ taking $5 million for publishing <strong>Broken Sword: The Sleeping Dragon</strong>, while the dev studio had to take out a £200,000 loan ("we're very used to balancing things because we really like the fact that we're independent"), or errors in the initial game that he's always wanted to fix ("Nobody else cares, but I do").</p>
<p>We spun some of Charles' memories of the initial character designs and artwork into the game's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/broken-sword-shadow-of-the-templars-gets-reforged-again-in-new-switch-2-edition">release announcement</a>, but we thought it only right to focus this feature on how the new title came to be. So, buckle in for a chat all about developing for the Switch 2, Game-Key Cards, future Broken Sword projects, and the state of the industry at large. Enjoy!</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>You released the original Shadow of the Templars Reforged on Switch last year. What made you want to reforge it again on the Switch 2 a year later?</strong></p>
<p>Oh, because we have the opportunity to bring it to 4K and to use the mouse feature of the Joy-Con 2. It's also a huge privilege to be on the Switch 2 so early!</p>
<p>Using the mouse feature is arguably the way that it was always intended, although I'm also extremely proud of the reviews that we've had with controller and also on touchscreen. We're very lucky that the point-and-click genre adapts really, really well, from mouse and keyboard to controller, to touchscreen and swipe and touch.</p>
<figure data-uuid="9e499abd468da"><a title="Broken Sword - Shadow of the Templars: Reforged - Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9e499abd468da/broken-sword-shadow-of-the-templars-reforged-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Revolution Software</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>So was that something that piqued your interest when you first saw the Switch 2 reveal?</strong></p>
<p>Pretty much! Nintendo are brilliant, aren't they? And they create so much excitement. And obviously, I think they were a little bit miffed that so much information leaked. But actually, looking back, it probably wasn't a bad thing, because it just created this extraordinary level of enthusiasm and interest.</p>
<p>When we heard rumours that there was a mouse functionality being added to the Joy-Con 2, it was like, 'Wow, this is extraordinary.' You really do have a choice in how you control the game now. You can do it in pretty much any way you want.</p>
<p><strong>What was that development process like for you then? When did you receive dev kits for the Switch 2?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Everybody loves Nintendo in the industry, and we're no exception.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I lobbied Nintendo for a Switch 2 kit early. They were very courteous, but denied the existence of a Switch 2, you know, with a smile on their face. But then we heard about six months ago that we would be one of the early developers, for which we feel very grateful, and actually quite proud.</p>
<p>Very few Switch 2 kits have been shipped to developers. And so this is one of the very early games, which is a great privilege.</p>
<p><strong>So were you looking at dev kits just before launch?</strong></p>
<p>Just after. We got dev kits before Gamescom in August.</p>
<figure data-uuid="6fd3b2b1fdb13"><a title="Broken Sword - Shadow of the Templars: Reforged - Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6fd3b2b1fdb13/broken-sword-shadow-of-the-templars-reforged-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Revolution Software</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>What did you make of it when you first got to go hands-on with the kit itself?</strong></p>
<p>Everybody loves Nintendo in the industry, and we're no exception. The jump to the higher resolution works very well for us. It's just a great opportunity to bring it back in 4K and use the mouse functionality.</p>
<p>One of the things that we don't like doing is releasing a game that is half-finished on the basis that we're going to patch it later, and then the game comes out and it gets poor reviews, quite rightly, because it doesn't work very well. So we were super keen to release the game when it was finished. But nevertheless, there were some issues [with Broken Sword: Reforged].</p>
<p>One of the things that you <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/broken-sword-shadow-of-the-templars-reforged">criticised</a> quite rightly last time was the quality of the voice recording. Back in 1996, because the game had to stream from CD, we had to compress both the movies and the dialogue, so the dialogue was compressed to 11 kilohertz — a quarter of the size that it would be at full CD quality. But I remember at the time, we were way behind, and a publisher, Virgin, actually cut the samples up themselves and then compressed them, but they compressed them really unprofessionally. So what we had was a very, very poor quality base.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We toyed around with AI, but it didn't really work very well</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When we chose the best software to upscale, we found we could get rid of the hiss, but then it took the intonation out of the actors' voices, which broke my heart. We wanted to get a balance between making sure that the intonation was there, while reducing the hiss as much as possible.</p>
<p>When the game came out, people said, "Oh, this is ridiculous, you're not using the right software." But what they didn't appreciate was this absolute desire to keep the intonation of the actors and get the balance right. After release, a new piece of software became available. Because things are moving so fast in this field, we found that we could get much better quality. So we reprocessed all the voices in all languages, and then we reissued them all as a patch.</p>
<p>So, things like that, where we were unable to get the quality we wanted for release, we're now retrospectively able to enhance. So a lot of the criticisms that were made quite rightly on release last year have actually since been addressed, and obviously go into the Switch 2 as the native version.</p>
<figure data-uuid="002acd552a5ca"><a title="Broken Sword - Shadow of the Templars: Reforged - Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/002acd552a5ca/broken-sword-shadow-of-the-templars-reforged-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Revolution Software</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>What's been your preferred play style when you've been playing it during development? How often have you been using the Mouse Mode?</strong></p>
<p>We are using the mouse absolutely. To be honest with you, we play it in every way! Which is the preferred? I still think using the controller, but the mouse works very well, and it's lovely to be able to give people a choice.</p>
<p><strong>How does it feel to see all of this gorgeous art upgraded into 4K?</strong></p>
<p>The game has 30,000 frames of animation and substantial amounts of artwork. <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ai-was-an-expensive-mistake-charles-cecil-on-innovation-insolvency-and-broken-sword">We toyed around with AI</a>, but it didn't really work very well. So we have a very, very talented group of animators who basically just rolled their sleeves up and got on with drawing the 30,000 frames of animation and improving.</p>
<p>What we wanted to do as part of that is to be absolutely true to the original intent, because we promised fans that this was going to be the same game, but enhanced. We went back to the original line art, which I had scanned at a very high resolution, and our digital artists then painted over that. It's absolutely wonderful [to see it on Switch 2] because all of these things were always intended to be in 4K.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Switch 2 is not quite as easy to publish for, since the cartridge sizes are much larger</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the other key thing is from an interface perspective. It's an interface that we revolutionised and evolved 30 years ago, and it hasn't moved since then. So, it was a real toss-up between 'is this relevant for today' or 'is it just that we haven't adapted'? In high-resolution 4K, you don't need a blocky user interface. We looked at the reasons why people were getting stuck, and one of them was that people couldn't find the hot spots, so we changed the way the interface works and put a little cone in, and the cone moves.</p>
<p>What we're trying to do is determine how we can bring this to a modern audience so that it's much clearer what's going on. This is what we should have done years ago, but at least we've done it now. We saw this as an opportunity to completely reboot Broken Sword and, to an extent, reboot the adventure [genre] as a whole, because people refer to the modern interface as the 'Broken Sword interface'. That was 30 years ago! Surely to God, we should have realised, as should everybody else, that the opportunities that exist in 4K — the subtlety of the interface, the beauty of the graphics — are just so much more than they were 30 years ago!</p>
<figure data-uuid="f3b517f9787be"><a title="Broken Sword - Shadow of the Templars: Reforged - Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f3b517f9787be/broken-sword-shadow-of-the-templars-reforged-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Revolution Software</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You released a physical edition for the Switch 1 version of the game. Are there plans to do a similar one for Switch 2?</strong></p>
<p>We would absolutely love to. The Switch 2 is not quite as easy to publish for, since the cartridge sizes are much larger. But absolutely. Clearly, there is a need, a human need for tactility. Clearly, for people who care about a particular game, it's really nice to have a physical copy. So yeah, we did launch it both as a standalone game through Red Art Games, and then also as part of our Kickstarter that was launched last year.</p>
<p><strong>What's your opinion on Game-Key Cards?</strong></p>
<p>Personally, I don't blame people for feeling that it kind of defeats the whole point. The advantage of a Game-Key Card, of course, is that you can pass it on to somebody else, which you can't do from a digital perspective; but then it's not permanently yours. So we would love to do a physical version, but it wouldn't be a Game-Key.</p>
<p><strong>And how about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/broken_sword_-_the_smoking_mirror_reforged">Smoking Mirror: Reforged</a>? Can we expect a Switch 2 release for that one, too?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have as much time as we need to really get it right this time</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh yes, absolutely! Everything will be released at the same time. One of the reasons that we're so excited to be able to get 'Broken Sword 1 Reforged' out is because it guarantees that we will have simultaneous shipping for PC and all consoles. So yes, Switch 2 is absolutely very, very important to us.</p>
<p><strong>And how is development going on it?</strong></p>
<p>Well, I was kind of whinging about the fact that there were 30,000 frames of animation for Broken Sword 1. There are 45,000 frames for Broken Sword 2. We've got a very talented team in the UK, but for Broken Sword 1 originally, we worked with a company called Fil-Cartoons in Manila. I reached back out to some guys in Manila, and, although the animation scene has died right down, there are an awful lot of really talented animators still out there. So we're balancing between working with people who used to work for Fil-Cartoons and wonderful European and British animators who are designing the characters. So it's just really fun to be honest with you.</p>
<figure data-uuid="0f176c78ce554"><a title="Broken Sword - Shadow of the Templars: Reforged - Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0f176c78ce554/broken-sword-shadow-of-the-templars-reforged-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Revolution Software</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The thing about Smoking Mirror is that the US side of our publisher, Virgin Interactive, hated adventure games. Even though Broken Sword 1 had been really successful. They told us they didn't want to do Broken Sword 2. I convinced [Virgin Interactive boss, Martin Alper] that we would be able to write it in a year. And on that basis, he greenlit it.</p>
<p>We did write it in a year, and I'm really proud of it, but by God! We have as much time as we need to really get it right this time, and that's not to say that it was bad — it got great reviews and a lot of people love the game — but we have the opportunity to fix it. And so we're rolling our sleeves up and going, 'How do we make this better? How can we make sure this feels polished like it should have been back in 1997?' So, it's a fairly major overhaul, but it's still the same game, just much more enhanced.</p>
<p><strong>I have to ask about Broken Sword 6, because you're not just reforging. How is work going on the game? Can you tell us any developments?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>we're now in a strong position and enjoying it</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can tell you that it's going very slowly. We had it partially funded, and then, as you will remember, everything went horribly wrong about four or five years ago. We've got the design written, we've got characters designed, we've got quite a lot of logic designed, and we've kind of put it on hold. But we have the opportunity now to go back at the right time and look at all the strong elements, look at the weak elements, and really focus.</p>
<p>But to do that, we need to build the reserves. Revolution has no investment, which is wonderful in some ways. It's wonderful because we don't need to follow short-term directives by investors, but it also means that we need to write games that are successful and make us a profit, because if we don't, we'll go bankrupt. It's as simple as that. And so that's quite stressful, but it's also much more edgy. It keeps us on our toes. So, long answer short is, Broken Sword 6 is really, really exciting, but it is something that we go back to once we can afford to. Writing these Reforged games is wonderful, but it's also a good way of building ourselves up.</p>

<p><strong>With all your experience in games, what do you make of the wider industry landscape today?</strong></p>
<p>Well, I'm going to sidestep your question. I'm going to say what is interesting is that in Japan, they're not making layoffs. And the reason is because they have much more loyalty to their staff, and to an extent, to gamers. They didn't madly expand, and they're not driven by short-term profitability.</p>
<p>I would like to think that we [Revolution Software] follow much more of the Japanese model, where we didn't expand rapidly when there was the opportunity and there was lots of money available. So we're now in a strong position and enjoying it. Adventure games are a niche, but they're a sizeable niche. We didn't take lots of investment when the opportunity arose, because we didn't think it was appropriate. So we're not really affected by the downturn.</p>
<p>We work to create games that our community, and broader, will like. So we're kind of naive in that way, I guess.</p>
<p>It's a real shame, and I think it is driven by greed. It is driven by capitalism that is greedy and wants short-term profit, and I really admire the Japanese for not falling into that trap.</p>

Here's the official description of the book:</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>On a bitter-cold day, in the December of his junior year at Harvard, Sam Masur exits a subway car and sees, amid the hordes of people waiting on the platform, Sadie Green. He calls her name. For a moment, she pretends she hasn’t heard him, but then, she turns, and a game begins: a legendary collaboration that will launch them to stardom. These friends, intimates since childhood, borrow money, beg favors, and, before even graduating college, they have created their first blockbuster, Ichigo. Overnight, the world is theirs. Not even twenty-five years old, Sam and Sadie are brilliant, successful, and rich, but these qualities won’t protect them from their own creative ambitions or the betrayals of their hearts. Spanning thirty years, from Cambridge, Massachusetts, to Venice Beach, California, and lands in between and far beyond, Gabrielle Zevin’s contemporary classic examines the multifarious nature of identity, disability, failure, the redemptive possibilities in play, and above all, our need to connect: to be loved and to love. Clever, nostalgic and quietly profound, TOMORROW, AND TOMORROW, AND TOMORROW explores what it means to play—and keep playing—through everything life throws at you.</em></p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/18/tomo-cover-flat-1763472774479.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">We can also debut an exclusive excerpt from Zevin's new introduction, which offers insight into Zevin's gaming background and how that inspired the novel.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Without a shadow of a doubt, Call of Duty is primarily a multiplayer game. Following the meteoric rise of the original Modern Warfare’s PvP, the series has become an industry behemoth, and its success is entirely down to its online modes. And yet, year after year, Activision has dedicated a significant amount of cash to funding elaborate single-player campaigns. As someone who grew up on the likes of Half-Life and Halo, these campaigns are the reason I’ve come back to Call of Duty year in, year out. Sure, it’s been a rocky relationship, but it’s been worth enduring for the really good ones – like last year’s fantastically orchestrated <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-campaign-review">Black Ops 6</a>, with its conveyor belt of exciting mission concepts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But this year is different. Black Ops 7 specifically brands its story mode as a “co-op campaign,” and has been designed around a four-person squad. As our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-campaign-review">review</a> points out, it is a significantly worse experience solo, to the point we could never recommend playing it alone. And so the entire Call of Duty package this year is multiplayer, a fact that has me wondering about the future of the series. Has it finally given in to the writing on the wall? Is COD single-player over?  </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Co-op support does not always spell the death of solo play. Halo and Gears of War have both built legacies on campaigns that support both equally. But in Black Ops 7, developers Raven Software and Treyarch haven’t made a classic Call of Duty campaign that can be played with a couple of buddies. The mission structure is fundamentally different from the series’ traditional template. There are none of the scripted cinematic moments that have defined Call of Duty’s reputation, nor the experimental concepts that characterised last year’s campaign. Instead, the entire mission pool is geared around simplistic corridor shooting and bullet sponge boss fights – scenarios that are easy to orchestrate with multiple players who are potentially more interested in chatting than engaging with a plotline. Perhaps understandably, trying to support multiple players across something as delicately railroaded as Modern Warfare’s iconic stealth affair, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-all-ghillied-up-changed-call-of-duty-forever-art-of-the-level">All Ghillied Up</a>, or as attention-dependent as last year’s social espionage-flavoured Most Wanted, was considered a flight of fancy. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a result, a great deal of Call of Duty’s foundational campaign DNA has been replaced. And by that I don’t just mean the addition of online infrastructure that eliminates the series’ atmospherically vital AI-controlled squadmate characters, and enforces no pausing and being kicked after a period of inactivity. No, I mean the introduction of enemy types with healthbars and, in the case of the new Endgame mode that caps off the story, damage numbers. The arrival of colour-coded, tiered weaponry that’s found in boxes, not on corpses, effectively turns guns into loot, and the open-world Avalon, frequently visited across the campaign before becoming your home for the Endgame, is peppered with small-scale objectives and activities, akin to Warzone’s battle royale map. Or a Destiny planet. Or a Helldivers world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In fact, while there are 11 missions that lead into it, Endgame feels like the actual “point” of this campaign, more so than story, characters, or level concepts. This 32-player PvE mode will be supported throughout Black Ops 7’s lifetime, essentially turning it into an evolving, not-quite-live-service mode… one that, eventually, will be completely divorced from its original campaign packaging. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Activision already has plans to allow players to skip the missions entirely and get straight into Avalon. In a recent conversation with IGN, Black Ops 7’s associate creative director, Miles Leslie, revealed that on “day one, we want to make sure that people progress into [Endgame] naturally. We want them to get through that story, understand the world, the abilities, the characters. [But] what we've talked about is, at some point, and we haven't figured out just yet, when does it unlock it for everyone?” </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Just 5% of PlayStation players have unlocked the campaign completion trophy of last year’s Black Ops 6.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s clear that Black Ops 7 is a new breed of Call of Duty campaign, one foremost designed around co-op multiplayer trends, rather than simply inviting other players to be involved in a traditional narrative shooter. From my perspective, it’s a much less interesting direction, but it’s undoubtedly a sign of the times. Just five percent of PlayStation players have unlocked the PS5 campaign completion trophy of last year’s Black Ops 6, and that only rises to eight percent if you go back to 2022’s Modern Warfare 2. Rewind even as far as 2019’s Modern Warfare reboot, arguably the last one that was universally agreed to be a must-play, and just 12.6% have the competition trophy. These stats clearly show that the vast majority of Call of Duty’s audience simply isn’t interested in playing alone, even for just the handful of hours required to clear these short campaigns. And with the budgets demanded, no wonder Activision has been investigating other, more multiplayer-focused alternatives… and no wonder it’s landed on something that feels like a mish-mash of Destiny, Borderlands, Left 4 Dead, and Warzone – games that have secured millions of players over the years, and broadly speak to “modern” tastes that have been more widely engineered by the likes of the always online, always social Fortnite. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, this isn’t the first time that Call of Duty has attempted to go all-in on multiplayer. In fact, it’s been something of interest for Black Ops studio Treyarch for almost its entire COD career, starting with 2008’s World at War, where the campaign had (somewhat tacked-on) co-op support. A few years later, the studio would make a bolder effort with Black Ops 3, but that came with its own mistakes – a series of missions designed to be played in any order you wanted, akin to choosing multiplayer maps, meant the story lacked propulsion, coherence, and meaning. For its next game, it chose to scrap the campaign entirely, redirecting single-player resources towards Blackout, Call of Duty’s first stab at battle royale. This made Black Ops 4 the first and so far only purely multiplayer Call of Duty package – one I’m doubtful Activision will ever return to, but something that I think did signal inevitable shifts in development priorities. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We can see the colossal influence of multiplayer in other aspects of Call of Duty’s campaign design, too. 2023’s disastrous Modern Warfare 3 didn’t have co-op, but it did fully lean into the sensibilities of battle royale, tooling many of its missions to allow for the type of gameplay that those trained on Warzone would instinctively use. That went as far as even using whole sections of the Verdansk map as locations within the campaign, an idea Black Ops 7 has since pilfered with its use of Black Ops 6’s Skyline multiplayer map in the tail end of its campaign.   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The infamously squashed development timeframe of Modern Warfare 3 is likely the most significant factor to blame for its “multiplayer recycled as single-player” feel, but I think there’s more to it. It wasn’t just that battle royale assets were there and ready to be Frankensteined together… it was also that Warzone was colossally more popular and more widely understood than the old-fashioned story campaign. And you can see that thinking in Black Ops 7, albeit from a new angle. Its campaign is designed around the interactions of a multiplayer shooter, not a cinematic story, and the result of that is a mode you can <em>technically </em>play alone, but one where the structure and balancing simply don’t make sense for it. And so, for the first time since Black Ops 4, Call of Duty is arguably a multiplayer game in its entirety. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But is this the future of Call of Duty? Will traditional campaigns be replaced by roughly-story-shaped co-op modes? It’s impossible to tell, since the series zigs and zags with yearly frequency. 12 months ago, we were given Call of Duty’s most ambitious take on its traditional single-player template since 2017’s Infinite Warfare, and yet the very same developers who made Black Ops 6 created this year’s wild left turn. In 2026, we’ll presumably get Infinity Ward’s next project, which could just as easily be a re-try of Modern Warfare 3’s Warzone-tinted experiment as much as it could be an emulation of the 2019 MW reboot or something else entirely. But as much as the future is impossible to see, the present paints a clear picture: Activision is assessing what Call of Duty means for the modern generation. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For years now, Call of Duty has been a trifecta of single-player, multiplayer, and co-op, expressed through its campaign, online, and zombies/spec-ops modes. And when you see the resources that went into Black Ops 6’s spectacular campaign, only for it to be completed by barely anyone who bought it, you have to be amazed at (and even respect) Activision’s historic dedication to big-budget single-player. But returns can only diminish for so long. The triple-A campaign shooter is an endangered species, with barely a Doom or a Wolfenstein to bank on regularly, and often, Call of Duty is the only one of its kind to arrive each year. It’s clear that Activision knows the era of the narrative FPS is practically over, and that it’s spending money on something barely any of its mammoth audience wants. And so things change. That started with multiplayer elements repackaged as single-player content, and it’ll very likely go much further than campaigns reimagined as multiplayer – you can now play Call of Duty entirely in third person, just in case you thought some things were invulnerable to the influence of Fortnite and Sony’s first-party titans. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While significant, permanent change may not come next year, or even the year after, I think this year’s campaign is a sign of things to come. At this point, when Call of Duty is a Game Pass tentpole and needs to demand engagement month after month to spin up never-ending subscriptions, why wouldn’t you turn your formerly five-hour-and-forget campaigns into a mini Destiny? </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Executive Editor of Features. </em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/does-black-ops-7-signal-the-end-of-single-player-call-of-duty]]></content:encoded>
