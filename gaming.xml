            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/20/stellar-blade-2-in-development-shift-up-confirms/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>A <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</a> sequel is in the works, developer Shift Up has confirmed in an investor relations presentation, and it could be coming pretty soon.</p>
<p>One slide in particular outlines a timetable that extends from 2024 through to 2027, showing two entries for Stellar Blade with “Platform Expansion” related to an impending PC port of Stellar Blade, and then a larger block labelled “Sequel”.</p>



<p>In other words, a sequel is well on its way and should be released by 2027.</p>
<p>A sequel to Stellar Blade obviously makes a lot of sense, when you consider the positive critical reviews and healthy sales that it had. The game currently sits at 81 on Metacritic and was able to quickly sell 1 million units within its first two months on sale for PS5, and the IR presentation states that it has made 68.1bn KRW (that’s ~ £365 million). A PC version is set to be released shortly on 11th June, which is only going to bolster those figures.</p>

<p>The original game took around five years to be released from its first teaser as Project Eve in 2019, through to the game’s launch in 2024 (though it was originally intended for 2023). Game sequels can often be quicker to develop, as the initial burden of conceptualising gameplay, building up a technical foundation, and staffing a full team has already been done. Importantly, a 2026 or 2027 target would put Stellar Blade within the PS5 generation still, meaning that Shift Up wouldn’t have to consider going through all the pain of gearing up for a new game engine and new console generation.</p>
<p>Stellar Blade is a good, solid action game from Shift Up, blending together high action a la Bayonetta and Nier Automata, and some great PS5 visuals. We said in our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/24/stellar-blade-review/">Stellar Blade review</a>, “Stellar Blade is a pretty enjoyable game to swing your hairband sword at, so long as you don’t mind the obvious sexualisation. There’s a few rough areas, but nothing to spoil things overall and there’s plenty of interesting story to uncover as you fight your way through giant monsters with circular saws for heads and weird tentacles for legs.”</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-is-more-vertical-and-lets-you-go-anywhere-and-thats-why-it-doesnt-have-a-minimap/">Borderlands 4</a> doesn't have an official price yet, but there's plenty of speculation that it will go the way of <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-is-worth-the-80-price-of-admission-says-nintendo/">Mario Kart World</a> and sport an $80 price tag. When asked about the price at <a href="https://wccftech.com/gearbox-announces-new-risk-of-rain-2-expansion-and-digs-into-more-details-on-borderlands-4-at-pax-east-2025/">PAX East,</a> Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford gave a long answer about why pricing isn't his call to make, and how those on the publishing side are weighing all the options when it comes to pricing.</p>
<p>Pitchford was much more curt when responding to a fan on X, though. He reiterated to someone pleading with him not to make Borderlands 4 $80 that the price was not his call and that a "<em>real fan</em>" would find a way to buy it, even if it ends up being $80.</p>
<p>Commenting on Pitchford's post about the Creator's Voice video for Borderlands 4, <a href="https://x.com/oldgoldsot/status/1922412081023783167">X user oldgoldsot wrote</a>, "<em><span>Randy, this game better not be 80 dollars. Don't take that risk, alot of gamers aren't gonna pay 80 dollars and feed this notion of constant increase of the price tag You are the CEO, you have some say with the price when it comes to your publisher</span></em>."</p>
<p>Pitchford's response boiled down to telling users to pull up their bootstraps if the $80 price tag is too high for them.</p>
<p>"<em><span>A) Not my call. B) If you’re a real fan, you’ll find a way to make it</span></em><span><em> happen</em>,</span><span>" <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1922454876803551555">Pitchford wrote</a>. "</span><em><span>My local game store had Starflight for Sega Genesis for $80 in 1991 when I was just out of high school working minimum wage at an ice cream parlor in Pismo Beach and I found a way to make it happen.</span></em><span>"</span></p>
<p>It's not the best reply, if only because Oldgoldot's original complaint is more to do with the idea that players, like themselves, will vote with their wallet against games jumping up to $80. Whether they were a 'real fan' had nothing to do with it, and they didn't believe that Pitchford had absolutely no say when it came to pricing, as the chief executive officer at Gearbox.</p>
<p>Nintendo was the first to break the $70 ceiling by bumping up Mario Kart World to $80, followed by Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-xs-price-increase-europe/">increasing the price of its games and hardware</a>. PlayStation has bumped up the price of its <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-is-considering-a-ps5-price-increase-in-the-us-in-response-to-tariffs/">services and hardware across the world</a>, and while it hasn't seemingly done the same with its games, keeping <a href="https://wccftech.com/pre-order-the-ghost-of-yotei-from-amazon/">Ghost of Yotei at $70</a>, it's realistically only a matter of time.</p>
<p>Take-Two might have held back with <a href="https://wccftech.com/mafia-the-old-country-launches-on-august-8th-for-only-50-new-gameplay-trailer-released/">Mafia: The Old Country</a> with a much lower-than-expected price of only $50, and it might hold back again with Borderlands 4, opting not to jump up to $80 but stay at $70. Regardless, it's unlikely that it will cost less than $70. When <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-3-leaked-september-13th/">Borderlands 3</a> launched in 2019, it did so at the then-standard $60 price. So players should expect to pay at least $70 for Borderlands 4.</p>
<p>But they shouldn't have to expect to be told to "<em>make it happen</em>" by studio bosses when the prices go up, especially when everything, including the cost of things more important than video games, is going up.</p>

Based on the preview, it looks like this scene is in the finale, unless the show decides to handle Jesse’s fate differently.

Rather than craft another <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/stray-gods-a-roleplaying-musical-review-worthy-of-an-encore/1900-6418099/" data-ref-id="1900-6418099">superb choice-driven visual novel</a> with an emphasis on music and Greek myth, Summerfall's next game is a turn-based roguelite deckbuilder set in a demon-filled city. The tone looks to be far darker and there's a lot more to the gameplay this time around, but much like Summerfall Studios' first game, Malys looks like a visual delight and features characters I desperately want to get to know.</p><p dir="ltr">"There was an initial question, do we want to do this more as a visual novel, more like Stray Gods?" Summerfall creative director David Gaider told me during an exclusive gameplay preview of Malys. "Because Stray Gods did not have much in the way of gameplay, we wanted to try something that has more gameplay to prove that we're a studio that can do something that's fun and still narrative-driven but that has a very strong gameplay loop at its heart."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4497724-ss_ec565deb0246e301b95f662a1cf89d0e99f83c18.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497724" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4497724-ss_ec565deb0246e301b95f662a1cf89d0e99f83c18.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497724"></a><figcaption>Even the weaker demons can pack a punch.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4497724-ss_ec565deb0246e301b95f662a1cf89d0e99f83c18.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In Malys, you play as a former priest turned exorcist named Noah. He's striving to cross the entirety of a city to reach a major demon waiting for him on the other side, but lesser demons block his path. Each confrontation has a chance of wearing on Noah's will, and if it is fully depleted, he collapses, only to awaken back at the start of his journey with a time reset. These time loops allow Noah to better prepare for future runs and gain the trust of citizens, but he isn't the only one who remembers everything that transpires with every loop: A mysterious celestial, a powerful occultist, and a seemingly friendly masked demon are immune to the time rewinds, too.</p><p dir="ltr">I desperately wish I could have stolen the controller from Gaider during the hour-long preview and played the game myself--Malys looks very fun, leaning into the type of roguelite deckbuilding formula I've come to love in games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/slay-the-spire/" data-ref-id="5000-465459">Slay the Spire</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/inscryption/" data-ref-id="5000-517014">Inscryption</a>. The gameplay seems pretty intuitive. You need to protect Noah's will (essentially his health) while chipping away at the health bar of the demon in front of you, with cards pulled at random every turn offering different choices.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4497725-ss_dc5d57312d7a2b0e5d85faeb8683745bdb770480.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497725" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4497725-ss_dc5d57312d7a2b0e5d85faeb8683745bdb770480.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497725"></a><figcaption>Building your deck during a run will determine what type of strategy you can implement.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4497725-ss_dc5d57312d7a2b0e5d85faeb8683745bdb770480.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"I always liked the idea of a card game as something that builds a story," Gaider said. "You can think of the exorcism as this little contained narrative--if I'm playing salt cards [to damage the demon] and the compel [cards to weaken it, I'm] building an image in my mind of what is happening during this exorcism. Then, when we add the VO, so that [when] the demon does something and the host cries out, 'Please help me,' and then Noah plays a card [that causes] you to hear him [chanting] in the background, 'I summon the Lord's minions,' it is a story... There's the story you're being told, and then the card game is a sort of story."</p><p dir="ltr">Further complications add an intriguing strategic element to the gameplay. Each card has a cost to be played, and you can only earn the resource to play cards by burning cards in your hand. Each turn becomes a question of which cards you want to burn and which you want to play, with resources carried over between turns, so you could burn multiple cards and choose to not use the rest of your hand, reserving resources for the next turn. And as much as each demon wants to take down Noah, they're not above fighting dirty, and plenty of them will attack the mortal host they're occupying, presenting yet another person you need to protect. If any humans die, Noah's night gets reset.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4497726-ss_231053d868ec933b566caec2eba3264675af43d1.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497726" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4497726-ss_231053d868ec933b566caec2eba3264675af43d1.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497726"></a><figcaption>Lydia the Witch is the most intriguing patron, but I have questions about the unnamed Angel as well.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4497726-ss_231053d868ec933b566caec2eba3264675af43d1.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">More and more considerations get added the further you make it into the city, with options to unlock more cards and artifacts, the latter of which inform passive abilities that Noah brings to the fight, sort of like having a character class. Certain demons hide their true identity, forcing Noah to uncover it first to be able to hurt them--a process that's aided by the time loop nature of the narrative. As a player, you begin to remember which demons are where and what their weaknesses are, which can make subsequent showdowns easier for you to overcome and inform the direction you take across the city. Another big factor to consider are the three patrons: supernatural individuals who can aid Noah on his quest in exchange for faith (currency). There's the unnamed Angel, the Witch known as Lydia, and the Collector--a masked demon named Gideon.</p><p dir="ltr">"All three of them have a reason why they use faith as their currency system," Gaider said. "They will take your faith, [and] in exchange they will give you things. The Collector gives you access to the rarest cards that you're not going to find anywhere else. And [they] can also upgrade your cards. The Witch offers you curios, which are basically [Slay the Spire's] relics. You get a curio and it can give you modifiers that remain for the rest of your run... [And the Angel is who] you're going to [if you] need that healing. And there are a few holy-based cards that only the Angel can offer you as well. So there's a reason to go to all three of them, but they don't like each other. They're diametrically opposed to each other, so they don't like you allying with the other characters. There is an element of [having] no choice that comes down the line, [and that's] the strategy: You've got to work out your path and figure like, 'Okay, if I go down this left path rather than the right [and don't meet the Angel], what if I end up in need of healing? That might be an issue.'"</p><p dir="ltr">The designs for all three patrons and Noah are as excellent as the reimagined gods in Stray Gods, which makes sense seeing as art director Benjamin Ee has returned for Malys. The bigger surprise are the designs of the demons, which are grotesque monstrosities that look nothing like anything from Stray Gods. If Malys is, as Gaider said, the team's attempt to prove they refuse to be typecast as a visual-novel studio, I'm convinced. Parts of Malys look like Stray Gods--the designs of the humans, and the focus on choices--but so much of it stands in stark contrast to Summerfall's first project. I'm sold on the gameplay; here's hoping the story elements are also pretty good!</p><p dir="ltr">Malys is set to launch for PC in 2025.</p>

		<p>The unthinkable is happening in Helldivers 2 right now, as the Illuminate invasion has reached Super Earth itself, giving players the daunting task of defending Managed Democracy on its homeworld.</p>
<p><iframe title="Helldivers 2 - Heart of Democracy | PS5 &amp; PC Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uwDx7-HTk0s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>“The worst nightmare of all those who fight for Managed Democracy has been made a grim reality,” reads the announcement.</p>
<p>“Despite the valiant efforts of our Helldivers to push back the fleet, the Illuminate have reached Super Earth. Now they are swarming our cities, terrorizing citizens, and destroying our infrastructure. It’s time to rise up and take arms and fight for the precious foundations and soil of Democracy manifest. Helldivers, return to our planet and defend what is rightfully ours.”</p>
<p>While human settlements were featured in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> since the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/13/helldivers-2-omens-of-tyranny-is-out-now-a-new-faction-and-trucks/">Omens of Tyranny update</a> introduced the first Illuminate enemies at the end of last year, the urban sprawl of Super Earth will take that to the next level. Battles on Super Earth will feature huge skyscrapers, busy streets and even playgrounds that you’ll have to fight the Illuminate scourge from.</p>

<p>The one goal is to repel the Illuminate invasion by fighting to gain ground, battling alongside less elite SEAF troops who will fight autonomously, but can also be ordered to follow Helldivers around – salute them and they’ll join your fight – and activating Planetary Defense Cannons to blast away at the Illuminate fleet.</p>
<p>Players should be more powerful than ever thanks to the primary weapon customisation that was added last week alongside the expanded surplus options. These were already being put to use against new Illuminate enemies including the Crescent Overseer and the freaky Fleshmob.</p>
<p>It’s not clear how long the game’s community will have to try and stave off the Illuminate attack, but should they fail, this will be the end of the first campaign in the game, which started with the launch back in early 2024. Don’t worry, the galactic map will reset if that happens.</p>
<p>The update does also have some fixes and tweaks, so here’s the patch notes for Helldivers 2 version 1.003.002:</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
<li>Crash fixes</li>
<li>Fix for some corpses flinging the Helldivers great distances</li>

<h2>Fixes</h2>

<li>Fixed a crash that could occur when trying to enter the Weapon Customization menu on certain weapons</li>

			<p>The Cyberpunk 2077 sequel codenamed Project Orion is going to feature a second city to explore besides Night City, according to information provided by the creator of the Cyberpunk universe.</p>
<p>As reported by Polish publication <a href="https://www.cdaction.pl/newsy/cyberpunk-2077-tworca-potwierdza-nowe-miasto-w-kontynuacji-to-chicago-ktore-poszlo-w-zla-strone" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CD-Action</a>, Mike Pondsmith recently talked with TVGRY during the Digital Dragon 2025 event, revealing that, while he is not as involved in the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel as he was with the original game, he gets to see scripts, check out new cyberwar, and talk with the various departments at work on the game, including the environment design people. From these people, he probably learned that the second entry in the series will feature a second city besides Night City, which he described as having the feel of "Chicago gone wrong", rather than the Blade Runner-inspired atmosphere of Night City. While unable to share more, Mike Pondsmith added that he sees this city working for the game, so it will definitely be interesting to see how it will fit in the story and the universe.</p>
<p>Though we probably won't see the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel Project Orion anytime soon, the franchise by CD Projekt Red entered the spotlight once again last month, when a Nintendo Switch 2 port of the game was announced alongside the Nintendo system. Despite the technical differences with the other consoles, the port seems to be holding up quite well and could offer a much better on-the-go experience than the Steam Deck, judging from some <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-early-comparisons/">recent comparisons.</a> With CD Project Red putting so much <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-run-effort-play-well/">effort</a> into the port, including the entirety of the game on the retail edition's cartridge, it wouldn't be surprising to see the game become one of the most popular Nintendo Switch 2 launch releases.</p>
<p>The Cyberpunk 2077 sequel, Project Orion, is currently in development for yet-to-be-announced systems. A release date has yet to be confirmed.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/campfire-cabal-expeditions-still-alive<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Expeditions&nbsp;</em>franchise steward Campfire Cabal has confirmed that it isn't dead, and that a new game in the series is in the works, despite the past couple of years of "radio silence".</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://campfirecabal.com/still-alive/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> rather appropriately titled "Still Alive" on the official Campfire Cabal website, the studio says that it "never stopped" working on the newest entry in the series, but that it did go through some hardships as a result of the turmoil currently facing the gaming industry.</p>

<p>Campfire Cabal says that although it was never shut down, it did have to "say goodbye to many of [its] colleagues", leaving a "compact team" behind to work on the new&nbsp;<em>Expeditions&nbsp;</em>game, which began production back in 2022.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/expeditions-rome-campfire-cabal.jpg?itok=QEv5XgYq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/expeditions-rome-campfire-cabal.jpg?itok=OrkX9C0d 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Expeditions: Rome&nbsp;</em>is still the latest game in the&nbsp;<em>Expeditions&nbsp;</em>series, at time of writing.</figcaption></figure><p>The studio goes on to say that it "received the green light to scale back up and transition into full production" on the latest&nbsp;<em>Expeditions&nbsp;</em>game in March this year.</p>

<p>According to Campfire Cabal, the next&nbsp;<em>Expeditions&nbsp;</em>game will be set in a "new period of our history" and "a new part of the world for the series", and it will represent "another step up in quality" from&nbsp;<em>Expeditions: Rome</em>.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with Campfire Cabal, the studio was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/campfire-cabal-is-new-development-studio-from-expeditions-rome-developers" rel="nofollow">founded all the way back in 2022</a> to steward the&nbsp;<em>Expeditions&nbsp;</em>series of historical RPGs, following the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/expeditions-rome-developer-logic-artists-closing-down-to-make-nft-games" rel="nofollow">disbandment of original developer Logic Artists</a> to pursue NFT game development alongside new parent Dynasty Studios.</p>

<p>As it stands, there are three games in the&nbsp;<em>Expeditions&nbsp;</em>series: 2013's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/expeditions-conquistador" rel="nofollow"><em>Expeditions: Conquistador</em></a>, which kicked off the franchise, and its two followups&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/expeditions-viking" rel="nofollow">Expeditions: Viking</a>&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/expeditions-rome" rel="nofollow"><i>Expeditions: Rome</i></a>.</p>




<p>If you're wondering where 2024's&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/expeditions-mudrunner-game-announced" rel="nofollow">Expeditions: A MudRunner Game</a>&nbsp;</em>fits into things, well, it doesn't. It's a completely unrelated title, so don't worry about fitting that one into your schedule if you're looking to complete the series.</p>

<p>In any case, it looks like the&nbsp;<em>Expeditions&nbsp;</em>series will continue its explorations, although we don't know where or when. Stay tuned for more.</p>

While nothing is set in stone, this is a fairly quick turnaround for a new Stellar Blade game, considering that it first launched for PS5 in 2024 and has been supported with several pieces of post-launch content since then.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4497706-shift-up.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497706" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4497706-shift-up.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497706"></a><figcaption>Shift Up is aiming to have Stellar Blade 2 out by the end of 2026.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4497706-shift-up.jpg"></figure><p>The upcoming PC release is also scheduled for June 12, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stellar-blade-on-pc-has-been-blocked-in-over-130-countries-catching-its-developer-by-surprise/1100-6531596/">but the game has been blocked from sale on Steam in over 100 countries</a> for an unknown reason.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-accidentally-leaks-stellar-blade-complete-edition-and-pc-release-date/1100-6531492/">Details on Stellar Blade: Complete Edition were also leaked earlier this month</a>, and we do know that this will be coming to PS5 and PC on June 11.

                <p>Developer Rebellion's newest game, the survival FPS Atomfall, was a big success right away, it appears. <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/rebellion-we-dont-gamble-wildly-weve" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business</a> reports that the day-one Game Pass launch was "immediately profitable" and that Rebellion is now working on DLC for the game and considering a possible sequel or spin-off.</p><p>No sales numbers for Atomfall have been announced, but the game reached 1.5 million players right out of the gate, later climbing to 2 million.

In roughly one year, it has brought in more than $48 million of revenue for the developer, so it won’t be a surprise that the team is working on a follow-up game. However, according to a <a href="https://shiftup.co.kr/eng/ir/irdata.php?ptype=view&amp;idx=254&amp;page=1&amp;code=irdata_eng">Q1 2025 fiscal year presentation</a> from ShiftUp, the developer plans to have a sequel before 2027.</p><p>In the presentation, which is where ShiftUp reveals Stellar Blade has brought in 68.1 billion KRW (or $48 million), there’s a slide titled, “IP expansion on its way with high visibility.” We can see the 2024 release of Stellar Blade on PlayStation 5, additional strategy for ShiftUp’s mobile gacha game, Goddess of Victory: Nikke, and “Platform Expansion” for Stellar Blade.

            <p>Developer Housemarque, known for the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/returnal">Returnal</a> and Nex Machina, has no plans to go down the free-to-play or live-service route any time soon.</p>
<p>Speaking to Eurogamer at the developer's 30th anniversary event in Finland last week, studio head Ilari Kuittinen and creative director Gregory Louden said "as long as people are buying premium games", Hoursemarque will remain a studio which provides just that.</p>
<p>"Our philosophy is that [our games] are an experience for a certain time of your life, and you experience that within a few days, or weeks, or whatever," Kuittinen said. The studio head added Housemarque's titles are a bit "like movies or TV series", which are there for a certain "phase" of a person's life. "And I believe that's really cool. You don't need to spend the rest of your free time with our games," he said.</p>

<p>"It's a unique experience," Kuittinen continued. "You have it, you get something out of it. Maybe you come back to it, but you don't need to play it for the rest of your life."</p>
<p>Louden added the studio is currently "fully focused on single player and premium" with its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/returnal-studio-heads-to-a-hostile-shape-shifting-planet-for-newly-unveiled-saros">upcoming PS5 title Saros</a>, and Housemarque - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-buys-returnal-developer-housemarque">which was acquired by Sony in 2021</a> - aims to make sure it is around for another 30 years by continuing to make "amazing games" and keeping up that "momentum".</p>
<p>"You just need to keep creating special games," the creative director said, before Housemarque's brand director Mikael Haveri added: "We are only as strong as our latest game."</p>
<p>Haveri acknowledged that Housemarque hadn't necessarily had the easiest of journeys to where it is now, and the team is "aware of pitfalls out there", so it needs to keep making "good games" to thrive.</p>
<p>"It's almost like a responsibility, we're very lucky to be in the position we are in, and we should keep pushing the medium and keep showing what we can do and keep pushing our gameplay and our story and our technology, and just keep growing," Louden furthered. "That's the future for the next 30 years - it's just creating better."</p>

<p>Back in February 2022, Sony stated it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plans-to-launch-more-than-10-live-service-games-before-march-2026">aimed to launch over 10 new live-service games</a> over the coming years.

<p>Since then the company has dialled back its plans and just this month, the Sony published live-service shooter Fairgames was reportedly delayed, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fairgames-reportedly-delayed-into-next-year-as-haven-founder-jade-raymond-exits">Haven Studios founder Jade Raymond made her exit from the company</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Nintendo has given us a proper look at a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> game card.</p>
<p>This look at the upcoming cards comes from a video showing off an official Switch 2 carrying case, which was shared on the Nintendo Today app. </p>
<p>As a reminder, this is the app Nintendo announced back in March, that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-new-app-that-will-deliver-you-daily-information-and-content">delivers daily content to its users about Nintendo's events and games</a>. It is where Nintendo first let us all know the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/legend-of-zelda-movie-release-date-revealed-by-nintendo-and-its-not-as-far-away-as-you-might-have-feared">release date for its Legend of Zelda film adaptation</a>.</p>

</figure>
<p>But, I digress. Back to those Switch 2 game cards. Thanks to Nintendo's new video (which you can check out via the embed below), we can see that the Switch 2 cards are, unsurprisingly, very similar in size to the OG Switch's cards. </p>
<p>As we have seen previously via a mock up, the newer game cards come with a red colour scheme, making the Switch 2 game (in this case, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>) stand out rather boldly against the carry case's black lining compared to their predecessors. Also, in case you missed it, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-switch-2-games-will-still-taste-so-bad-you-will-want-to-spit-them-out">Nintendo previously confirmed Switch 2 game cards will taste horrible</a>, so don't be tempted to pop one in your mouth.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo/Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As for that case, it will be able to house the Switch 2 console itself with two Joy-Con attached, as well as six game cards. There is also a little netted pouch users can slide their Joy-Con 2 straps into for safe keeping. I quite like the colourful zipper pull rings. </p>

How much is a game worth? What qualities or aspects of a game justify a higher price tag, or demand a lower one? Does a game that costs $70 deserve the same critical reaction as the identical game but $30? All this has gone on since time immemorial. But something that seems to rumble underneath so much of the discussion is rich people telling poor people that prices don’t matter. When asked about a potential $80 cost for <em>Borderlands 4</em>, multi-millionaire Randy Pitchford—CEO of developer Gearbox—told a potential customer, “If you’re a real fan, you’ll find a way to make it happen.”</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196163" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Firefight’s Back In Halo!

In 1991 when he had just left high school and was working a minimum-wage job at an ice cream parlor on Pismo Beach, he was able to find a way to pay $80 for <em>Starflight</em> on the Sega Genesis. So, you know, so can everyone else. Pitchford sent the message as a reply on X last week, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesradar.com/games/borderlands/gearbox-boss-randy-pitchford-says-its-not-my-call-if-borderlands-4-costs-usd80-but-if-youre-a-real-fan-youll-find-a-way-to-buy-it-anyway/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/borderlands/gearbox-boss-randy-pitchford-says-its-not-my-call-if-borderlands-4-costs-usd80-but-if-youre-a-real-fan-youll-find-a-way-to-buy-it-anyway/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spotted by <em>GamesRadar</em> today</a></span>.</p><p>Randy Pitchford grew up in Fairfax, Virginia, then California. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20190112044349/https://www.kotaku.com.au/2012/05/randy-pitchford-and-the-perfect-shuffle/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190112044349/https://www.kotaku.com.au/2012/05/randy-pitchford-and-the-perfect-shuffle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">His father worked in U.S. intelligence</a></span> in the 1970s, and his house was filled with all manner of technology throughout his childhood. While I cannot say for sure (although I have emailed to find out), it seems vanishingly unlikely that Pitchford was living off of his minimum wage ice cream job after he’d graduated high school, as his tweet seems to want to heavily imply. Pitchford soon after went to UCLA, so we can quite safely guess that this was a short-term job, one for earning a bit of extra spending money while still living at home with his parents.</p><p>I would suggest that to use this anecdote to explain to all living humans that if they really want a copy of <em>Borderlands 4</em>, they can easily find eighty bucks to spare is grotesque. It kind of makes me sick.</p><h2 id="h146549"><a id=""></a>Luxury viewpoints</h2><p>“Video games are a luxury.” That’s a point many people want to make in situations like this. “If you can afford the console to play the game on...” people might begin, as they argue that you can’t really be <em>that</em> poor if you can still afford entertainment. All those people living on welfare, but with those giant TVs, etc. It’s a fascinating perspective, almost exclusively proffered by those who <em>aren’t</em> living on welfare, and have rarely truly wanted for anything. Because if there’s one thing that’s pretty damned desirable when you’re living in real poverty, it’s some option for positive entertainment. For so many others, furiously working and saving and scraping together the money to be able to buy their children a games console, to give them that one thing they so desperately want when they’ve had to go without so much else, is not an act of opulence but of enormous sacrifice.</p><p>So no, this isn’t about abstract situations made up by armchair philosophers trying to justify Pitchford’s claim by arguing that any truly poor person have to choose between food or games entirely. This is about reality, where a person might go without so much extra food, or only buy the very cheapest food, so that they can pull together the $60 that year to buy the new entry in their favorite gaming franchise. That little bit of light. And then they find out it’s maybe now going to cost $80 instead.</p><h2 id="h146550"><a id=""></a>For 37 million Americans, there <em>isn’t</em> an extra $20</h2><p>In 2023 (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2024/demo/p60-283.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2024/demo/p60-283.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the most recent data</a></span>), <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/09/magazine/poverty-by-america-matthew-desmond.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/09/magazine/poverty-by-america-matthew-desmond.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">23 percent</a></span> of Americans worked in low-wage jobs.

An example of “poverty” was given as “a family of three with income below $21,559.” In 2025, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://aspe.hhs.gov/topics/poverty-economic-mobility/poverty-guidelines&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/topics/poverty-economic-mobility/poverty-guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Department of Health and Human Services</a></span> describes poverty for an individual as living on less than $15,650 a year. This is all before the recent raids on welfare. </p><p>That breaks down to $1,300 a month. The average rental price for a one-bedroom apartment in the United States is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.apartments.com/rent-market-trends/us/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.apartments.com/rent-market-trends/us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$1,625 a month</a></span>. The average monthly household expenses for a single person <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ramseysolutions.com/budgeting/american-average-monthly-expenses&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ramseysolutions.com/budgeting/american-average-monthly-expenses" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">come to $4,641</a></span>, including food, insurance, rent, cell phone, internet, and personal care. Even taking into account that these are averages, it’s pretty obvious that when you’re one of the one-in-nine people living on $1,300 a month, you don’t have a lot of spare piles of $80. In 2012 (soon after the crash), <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2012/08/01/157664524/how-the-poor-the-middle-class-and-the-rich-spend-their-money&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2012/08/01/157664524/how-the-poor-the-middle-class-and-the-rich-spend-their-money" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it was reported that the poorest people in America spent 98 percent of their income</a></span>, with one dollar per day to save. That study showed this group spends 4.8 percent of their income on “entertainment,” a broad category that even includes pets. An $80 copy of <em>Borderlands 4 </em>is 6.2 percent of $1,300.</p><p>Jump forward to the pre-covid boom in 2019, and on an annual family household income of $25,525, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://engaging-data.com/household-spending-income/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://engaging-data.com/household-spending-income/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">total spending is measured to be $25,525</a></span>. Of that, for an average family in this bracket, a total of $1,270 is spent on “entertainment.” That’s roughly $105 a month. But, again, it’s essential to understand that “entertainment” includes all sporting activities, all children’s extra-curricular education, toys, bikes, every electronic item from a TV to a camera, and even musical instruments and pets. If you own a dog, you’ll know that $105 a month could be taken up by it alone.</p><p>For so many of us, finding another $20 to buy a favorite game means grumbling and pulling out our wallet. But for so many others, it means not buying the one game we were hoping to play this year.</p><h2 id="h146551"><a id=""></a>“But if you’re a real fan...”</h2><p>Hopefully, this context suggests why it’s just so revolting for a man <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gearbox-has-been-bought-for-1-3-billion-1846186922&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gearbox-has-been-bought-for-1-3-billion-1846186922">who sold his company for a potential $1.3 billion in 2021</a></span> to tell someone on X that “if you’re a real fan, you’ll find a way to make it happen.” Because, you know, when he was doing a summer job at the beach in California, he somehow pulled enough cash together for that game he wanted.</p><p>It’s gross. It sucks. I’m fed up of it. I’m sick of rich people telling poor people that they can find the money if they just try hard enough. I’ve had my fill of people who’ve never known hunger, never struggled to pay a bill, flippantly dismissing the concept that life is extremely tough for millions and millions of people. It’s the rhetoric that allows for the myth of the “welfare queen” to be so readily accepted, to assume that the poorest people just aren’t pulling their weight or working hard enough, that if these people were <em>really</em> poor, they wouldn’t be playing video games at all. It’s <em>hateful</em>.</p><p>As for whether <em>Borderlands 4</em> will cost $80, Pitchford claims it’s “not my call,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-price-preorders-randy-pitchford-pax-east-1851780045&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-price-preorders-randy-pitchford-pax-east-1851780045">having previously said it’s still undecided</a></span>.

You just take the call.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s the advice that was given to designer Chris Maple by a fellow designer friend back in 1998, who warned him the call would be coming later that day. At the time, Maple was no stranger to sudden phone calls from company executives. Maple ran his own design business, Media Design, which specialized in last-minute work for companies in emergency, time-crunch situations whose agencies weren’t equipped to handle the speed or size of their request. Though it was rarely, if ever, publicly credited for this type of work, over Media Design’s history, Maple says his company quietly developed a good reputation with clients throughout its local Seattle area. He recalls doing work for (among many others) Boeing, the Seattle Mariners, Holland America Line cruises, and others.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Maple had been in the business for several years when then-Nintendo of America president Minoru Arakawa’s secretary phoned him and asked him to come visit the office in Redmond. He was told over the phone that the company wanted him to work on a new game, but that was it. Maple, intrigued, accepted the invitation, not knowing he was about to become an instrumental part of one of the biggest cultural phenomenons in the world: Pokémon.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Go West, Pocket Monsters</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">“So I showed up there and I sat in their lobby for about a half hour and stared at this beautiful 21-inch crystal horse in their lobby, a crystal horse head,” Maple recalls of the day he went to Nintendo of America’s Redmond HQ. “And I was like, just staring. You get a sensation. Like I'd have to read a room when I go into these corporate arenas, since I'm the subjective person presenting the aspect of imagery and content behind whatever's bothering them that day or what's broken or what needs to be fixed. You just learn to pick up stuff. So I was sitting there staring at this crystal head, and it was the Nintendo lobby.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Eventually, Maple was taken upstairs into a meeting room where a few individuals were sitting, waiting for something. “It looked like the inquisitor was going to come out,” Maple recalls. But when Arakawa entered, Maple says he “was a very magnetic personality. I could tell why he was in the seat.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ll let Maple relate what he remembers happening next:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“He introduced himself and said that they're going to be launching a game officially in the United States and Europe. Only problem is, the prior agencies they've tried out for the situation didn't quite hit the mark, and they burnt the budget and time element. Are you okay with that? And I go, ‘Yeah, sure. It's going to cost a penny.’</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/19/pokemon-15-1747669946566.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">A photo of Maple and his son in Maple's home office. Photo provided by Chris Maple.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“So this other person, she comes down and she has a little cardboard box, and she dumps all these toys and pieces of paper and weird drawings and things all in front of me on the table, and I'm looking at them, and she's standing there with a smirk on her face holding the box, and I'm looking at Mr. Arakawa, and he's just staring straight at me and I go, ‘What is this?’ And he goes, ‘It's a Pocket Monster.’ And I said, ‘Oh, what's a Pocket Monster?’ He goes, ‘It's Pokémon. We're going to call it Pokémon.’”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>And I said, ‘Oh, what's a Pocket Monster?’ He goes, ‘It's Pokémon. We're going to call it Pokémon.’”</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Maple was being asked to make a new logo for Pokémon, which at the time existed only in Japan as Pocket Monsters Red and Pocket Monsters Green. Nintendo wanted to release the game in the West with a Blue version and, later, a Yellow Pikachu Edition. But the company wanted a new logo to fit the rebrand from “Pocket Monsters” to “Pokémon”, and was struggling to find someone to nail the look. Maple wasn’t given any instruction on what Nintendo was looking for though, he says. Just one parameter: he had just one month to make it.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Attaching Energy</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Normally, Maple tells me, a logo like this would take something like six months, with lots of back and forth between the designer and client, drafts and redrafts. Nintendo’s one month deadline wasn’t arbitrary, though. The new logo had to be ready for the big unveiling of Pokémon Red and Blue that would take place at E3 1998.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Maple was used to cramming things like this into short spans of time. So he got to work. He drew numerous variations of a Pokémon logo by hand, on a light table, trying different letter shapes until he was happy with something. When he liked a logo, he’d set it aside, and try again to make something different, ultimately creating several variations to present to Nintendo so they could pick which they liked best. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Original Pokemon Logo Sketches by Chris Maple</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, there wasn’t much to go on. Maple wasn’t given copies of the games to play, or even a lot of information on what Pokémon was. “We were given nothing but paper and toys,” he says, recalling that one of the toys was a very tiny Pikachu figurine. Nintendo did explain the game a little bit, he says, and he saw some illustrations of both existing and in-progress monsters as well as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/y3rfi/the_pok%C3%A9mon_are_coming_scan_from_may_1998/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>an early version of a Nintendo Power magazine</u></a> that discussed the game (the final version of which would be the logo’s actual public debut). Maple was also instructed that the logo would need to be suitable for use on a tiny, pixelated GameBoy screen, and would have to work in both color and black and white.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After coming up with several variations, Maple took his suggestions back to Nintendo to present them. He tells me he opened by presenting a few versions he wasn’t as excited about, and says his audience was relatively unresponsive. But then, he showed his favorite.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The room was quiet, Maple says. He stayed quiet too. Then, again from Maple’s own recollection:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And then Don James [former Nintendo of America executive VP of operations] speaks up and says, ‘I believe this is the one.’ And he starts shaking his head. He goes, ‘Yep, that's the one. It's the one.’ And everyone, Arakawa's just sitting there. He goes, ‘Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay.’ And Lance [Barr, former Nintendo of America designer] gets up and leaves and Gail [Tilden, former Nintendo of America VP brand management] leaves and then Don looks at me and goes, ‘Produce it.’ I went, ‘Okay.’ So I went back and produced it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And so the Pokémon logo was born. I asked Maple why he liked the final version best, and why he thinks Nintendo accepted it. He tells me he can’t fully explain it. It’s vibes, he says.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Energy in it. Also, when I was trying to take some of the real rough sketches from the original artists that did it for the person who started the game, I was trying to envision the story. There's a story in everything, the story, brand story, what it possibly could turn into.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/19/pokemon-12-1747670798361.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Color tests for the Pokémon logo, provided by Chris Maple.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Maple has a similar explanation for why the logo ended up yellow and blue. He tried a bunch of different color schemes. Maple admits it’s possible he was subconsciously thinking about the color-themed naming of the two new games being released in the West: Blue and Yellow. While Pokémon originally released in Japan in Red and Green versions, only Red was brought to global release alongside a slightly different, Blue version. Yellow, focused on Pikachu, came the following year. Maple was told about both Blue and Yellow in his work on the logo. But whether that was part of it or not, he says that the final version just seemed right to him. “It just feels a certain way,” he says. “I know it sounds flaky, but it's true.” </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It just feels a certain way. I know it sounds flaky, but it's true.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Once the logo was finalized, Maple was largely removed from the rest of the process as Nintendo got to work marketing and eventually releasing the games. He says he didn’t think too much of it until one day, a few months later, he took his son to Toys R Us.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We walk in the front door and there's a massive display, big arches and everything, and TVs going and noise and the Pokémon logo, and I'm like, ‘Holy smokes. This is crazy.’”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Pokémon Forever</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">This wasn’t Maple’s final interaction with Nintendo, though, or even with the Pokémon logo. After E3, Maple recalls Arakawa asked him to alter the logo slightly. He doesn’t remember receiving any specific instructions on what exactly Arakawa wanted altered, though he says that clients telling him to “just change it a little” without extra instruction is fairly common in his field. So Maple went back to the drawing board, literally, and made some minor adjustments to the interior of the “P” and the “E”, resulting in the version of the logo we now know today.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Later, Maple was called back to do some other design work, and remembers assisting with design projects for games like Major League Baseball Featuring Ken Griffey Jr., Mischief Makers, and a Star Wars game he doesn’t recall the name of (possibly the Nintendo 64 release of Star Wars: Rogue Squadron). He also was called upon to redesign the Nintendo 64 box for the console’s Atomic Purple release.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/19/na-pokemon-1998-1747670431704.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The first final version of the Pokémon logo Maple submitted, prior to the adjustments he made to the P and E.</figcaption></figure></output><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/19/international-pokmon-logo-svg-1747670511222.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Pokémon logo with Maple's adjustments, as we know it today.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">He did eventually play the Pokémon games, just a little bit, but didn’t get too far. Maple was a busy man. He does remember his son collecting the trading cards when they came out…until they were banned at school.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I'd be at a store or something and I'm buying something for my daughter and she'd be jumping up and down. She'd go, ‘My daddy did that logo,’ and a couple of moms would look at me in line and go, ‘Oh, so it was <em>you</em>, was it? You're the guy.’”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Maple’s work with Nintendo eventually ran its course, as the company began hiring more and more in-house artists and designers. That was fine with him, though. He had plenty of other work lined up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For years, Maple never spoke of his work on the Pokémon logo publicly. It wasn’t listed on his website, nor was he credited anywhere as the designer. He says that at the time, he wasn’t allowed to talk about it, and it’s fairly normal in his industry not to credit individual logo designers. But now, Maple’s started talking about it. He’s <a href="https://chrismaple.com/pokemon" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">put the logo up on his website</a>, alongside some newly-designed T-shirt mock-ups and other images, to showcase the massive project he took on all those years ago.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Why now?, I asked. Maple says a lot of it stemmed from conversations with his son, who urged him to come forward about his role and take credit where it was due. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's just after years, it didn't matter…So 27 years later, I thought I'm going to be changing what I do more and more, and I thought, why don't I just, if I'm going to put this as one of my accreditations, I should have some kind of validation to it and move on. For all the people that are interested in the games, you, IGN, wouldn't you want to know what really happened?”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Chris Maple Modern Mock-up Logo Images</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I ask Maple if there’s anything he would do differently if he had the opportunity to do the logo now. He says he’d probably revert it back to the original logo that was accepted in 1998, before Arakawa had him adjust it slightly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The other thing I would probably do, I would feel kind of almost responsible about and maybe a little bit strong about, is when Pokémon turns 30 next year, they'll probably try to do some celebration around that and whatever, and I know how things go, but they're going to dig an artist out of the woodwork and he's going to put 30th across that logo somewhere and it's not going to be right.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I know it won't be right because all the base, all the foundational thought that went into creating it in the first place to survive the way it did and for us to be talking to one another today, there is an energy and a skeleton in there, and to even add another component, like the word 30th or two numerical characters, TLC [tender loving care], big time. Don’t just get it done. It's going to be TLC. So I would hope that Pokémon International would ring me and say, ‘Hey, this would be great PR. The guy that did the logo gets to put the 30th on for us. Good PR for us.’ That would be smart of them to do. Of course I'm pitching for myself here.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>In some way I feel responsible about all the children and the other people that have grown up that take ownership of this.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Though Maple’s work with Pokémon only spanned a few months, and only one image, that effort has since been replicated across everything Pokémon. Aside from perhaps Pikachu, the Pokémon logo is the most well-known and iconic symbol of the global phenomenon that’s only grown in popularity in the years since Maple unwittingly stumbled into the process of its creation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So then, does he feel he had a hand in Pokémon's ultimate success? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I would say that in some way I feel responsible about all the children and the other people that have grown up that take ownership of this,” he says. “I feel really... I feel good about, that I did the thing responsibly for them. I teach children in challenged areas…And when I teach the children, they just go nuts. Once the teacher leaks the fact that I did this, I can't get a word in edgewise because they're saying, ‘Draw the characters for us, please.’ So I put it at the end of the lesson and I'll do a couple characters and I'll put the giant logo across the big white board in the classroom, and that became pretty popular.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Some of the experiences you get are just priceless. But I'm just happy that it's doing well…Yeah, I love it, and that's why I work still today.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

Recent datamines of Space Marine 2 itself may hold clues.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Warning!</strong></em><em> Potential spoilers for Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 follow:</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s start with perhaps the biggest question Space Marine 2 fans have right now: what is the new class? <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Spacemarine/comments/1jsr0k7/major_spoilers_for_upcoming_content_all_of_the/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Datamines suggest it is the Techmarine</a>. Why? Because in the files was mention of a perk called ‘shoulder gun bolter,’ which is a clear indication that Techmarines are finally in play.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For the uninitiated, a Techmarine is a Space Marine engineer-type class who’s a big fan of the Cult Mechanicus as well as their Chapter. They’re big on technology and specialize in fixing and maintaining vehicles and other big stuff, such as Dreadnaughts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can see how a Techmarine might slot into a Space Marine 2 squad, which currently lacks a class of this type. And this ties into another datamined detail: the apparent ability to “summon” a Dreadnaught in Horde mode. Dreadnaughts are a part of the Space Marine 2 campaign (one viral moment involves a Dreadnaught being particularly heroic and badass), and you also fight alongside one in a PvE Operations mission. Could you earn the right to summon a Dreadnaught and, as a Techmarine, keep it alive, in Horde mode?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now onto the promised new melee weapon. Datamines suggest Space Marine 2 will finally get a Power Axe, which again, makes sense in the context of Games Workshop’s big Space Wolves push for the tabletop game. And let’s remember, in December, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/space-marine-2-modders-put-the-axe-from-secret-levels-warhammer-40000-episode-into-the-game">IGN reported on <u>Space Marine 2</u> modders who put the axe from Secret Level’s Warhammer 40,000 episode into the game</a>.</p><blockquote data-media-max-width="560" data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>THIS is why I’m a fan of Warhammer 40k!

As discussed in a recent video by Warhammer 40,000 YouTuber <a href="https://youtu.be/Emh-Qq-UNnE?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chapter Master Valrak</a>, dataminers recently unearthed evidence of a Grav-cannon in Space Marine 2. This is, typically, a big gun used by Space Marines that manipulate gravity to cause a target to crush itself to death. Could the Techmarine class, should it be a genuine upcoming arrival, exclusively wield the Grav-cannon? If so, I imagine there will be many players who gravitate towards it with the release of Patch 8.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting that Patch 8 remains under wraps for now, but we’re expecting Space Marine 2-related announcements during the upcoming Warhammer Skulls livestream this Thursday, May 22. Perhaps we’ll find out more there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a lot happening in the world of Space Marine 2, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-3-announced-development-officially-begins-at-saber-interactive"><u>despite the surprise announcement that development of Space Marine 3 development had begun</u></a>.
