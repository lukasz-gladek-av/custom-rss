            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-week-in-gaming-business-10k-layoffs<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Another week has gone by, and as ever, the gaming industry has done everything but stand still. This week, we've seen layoff roundups, final farewells from studios, and a buyout for some big names in the publishing world as well.</p>

<p>Here's our roundup of what's been happening in the world of gaming business this week.</p>

<h2>PlayStation London's final farewell</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/playstation-london-blood-and-truth-gaming-business.jpg?itok=0huGSs2a 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/playstation-london-blood-and-truth-gaming-business.jpg?itok=kxUcEMMV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>PlayStation London's projects include VR game&nbsp;<em>Blood and Truth</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Back in February, it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-layoffs">was announced</a> that PlayStation London Studio, best known for games like&nbsp;<em>SingStar</em>, would be shut down, and this week, the studio said its final farewell before closing its doors.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/LondonStudioHQ/status/1792872997167984733" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a message on X</a> (formerly Twitter), London Studio thanked its players and colleagues, describing its time in the industry as "one wild and wonderful journey" while also looking ahead to the "new adventures" its staff will be embarking on.</p>

<h2>Fragbite says&nbsp;<em>Alara Prime&nbsp;</em>developer Fall Damage Studio is bankrupt</h2>

<p>In October last year, Fragbite <a href="https://fragbitegroup.com/mfn_news_en/fragbite-group-ab-publ-acquires-fall-damage-studio-ab-and-evaluates-the-conditions-to-carry-out-a-directed-issue-of-units/?lang=en" rel="noopener" target="_blank">purchased&nbsp;<em>Alara Prime&nbsp;</em>developer Fall Damage Studio</a> for SEK 20 million (roughly $1.9 million).</p>

<p>This week, however, Fragbite <a href="https://fragbitegroup.com/mfn_news_en/fragbite-group-declares-subsidiary-fall-damage-studio-bankrupt/?lang=en" rel="noopener" target="_blank">declared</a> that Fall Damage is bankrupt, having failed to secure a publisher for&nbsp;<em>Alara Prime</em>. The game is still in development, however, and it doesn't seem that Fall Damage will be shut down (at least not yet).</p>

<p>Fragbite CEO Marcus Teilman did, however, <a href="https://fragbitegroup.com/mfn_news_en/marcus-teilman-resigns-from-the-position-of-ceo-at-his-own-request/?lang=en" rel="noopener" target="_blank">resign from his position</a> this week, with current chairman Stefan Tengvall taking the role of interim CEO while the search for a permanent replacement is underway.</p>

<h2>IGN's parent company buys the Gamer Network</h2>

<p>The Gamer Network...uh, network, which includes publications like Eurogamer, GamesIndustry.biz, and Rock Paper Shotgun, was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ign-entertainment-acquires-eurogamer-gi-vg247-rock-paper-shotgun-and-more" rel="noopener" target="_blank">bought this week</a> by IGN Entertainment.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ign-entertainment-acquires-eurogamer-gi-vg247-rock-paper-shotgun-and-more" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GI.biz</a>, the buyout has led to "some redundancies" across the network. The sale doesn't include EGX, nor does it include Comic-Con company MCM or ReedPop's Popverse.</p>

<h2>Industry layoff woes continue</h2>

<p>This tally includes almost <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-report">2,000 layoffs across Microsoft</a>, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unity-layoffs-core-business">1,800 layoffs at Unity</a>, 670 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/electronic-arts-to-lay-off-5-of-its-workforce-amid-refocus-on-owned-ip-and-sports-games">Electronic Arts layoffs</a>, and around 600 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-interactive-layoffs">Take-Two Interactive employees</a> being cut from the company.</p>

<p>Although the archive doesn't include Modus Games' parent company Maximum Entertainment, that studio <a href="https://storage.mfn.se/d1fbf7e0-da83-4aad-85a2-60ec973916cf/me-interim-q12024-report-eng-vf.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">released its Q1 2024</a> report this week, and it showed that Maximum has laid off almost 10% of its workforce since December last year.</p>

            <p>
Avalanche founder Christofer Sundberg has hit back at Mad Max film director George Miller for claiming the studio's game "wasn't as good as [he] wanted it to be".
</p>
<p>
During promotion for the new Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga film, Miller was asked by <a href="https://x.com/gamingbible/status/1792566156810756105">GamingBible</a> about whether a new game was considered alongside the film.
</p>
<p>
He responded that Avalanche's previous game "wasn't as good as I wanted it to be", adding "I'm one of those people that I'd rather not do something unless you can do it at the highest level". He then said he'd love for Hideo Kojima to take on the challenge of a Mad Max game - because, of course.

<p>

Sundberg has since hit back at Miller, stating "this is complete nonsense" that shows his "complete arrogance".
</p>
<p>
"They did everything they could to make this a complete linear game after having signed up with a developer of open-world games," wrote Sundberg on X. "I'm sure Hideo Kojima would make an awesome Mad Max game, but it would be a completely different experience."
</p>
<p>
He continued: "After the first year of development they realised that they had forced us to make a linear experience rather than the open world game we pitched. We threw away a year of work and got to hear that 'players want autonomy in this day and age'. Well, no shit..."

<p>Larian Studios director of publishing Michael Douse also weighed in, claiming the developers didn't have access to the film assets, which made it "pretty difficult to capture the spirit of it when legal is precious about IP". He added: "A 'small' nuance probably Miller doesn't even know."</p> <div>

<p>
Mad Max was released by Avalanche (and publisher Warner Bros. Games) in 2015 on PC, PS4 and Xbox One, the same year as the film Mad Max: Fury Road. It was a third-person open world action-adventure game inspired by the Mad Max franchise, but separate to any specific film.
</p>
<p>
This followed the studio's work on the Just Cause open world games it was known for. Just Cause 3 was released shortly after Mad Max.
</p>
<p>
Mad Max received mixed reviews - not the "highest level" Miller was expecting - but has since been considered something of an underrated gem. 
</p>
<p>
"Like Shadow of Mordor before it, Mad Max sees Warner Bros thoughtfully apply its filmic property to an open world," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mad-max-review">Eurogamer Mad Max review</a>.

            <p>
If you are looking to get your hands on Dave the Diver's free Godzilla DLC, there is a limited time you will be able to do so. 
</p>
<p>
This DLC adds three new missions to Dave the Diver, each of which will be available after chapter five's close. There are also new dishes to discover, and a number of Godzilla figures scattered throughout the ocean for players to collect. 
</p>
<p>
You can see a little teaser for Dave the Diver's Godzilla DLC in the video below.

<p>
The DLC is out now across Steam, Nintendo Switch, PlayStations 5 and PS4. However, it will be delisted on 23rd November, and will no longer be available to download after that time. 
</p>
<p>
Developer Mintrocket stated as long as the DLC has been downloaded before this date, it will remain accessible, don't worry. Players will also be able to delete the DLC and reinstall it should the mood take their fancy after the end of the distribution period. 
</p>
<p>
Along with this new content, Mintrocket has also made a few other adjustments across the game, including adding controller vibrations to certain cutscenes and improving the design of some DLC icons.
</p>
<p>
You can read more about what's new in Dave the Diver via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1868140/view/4145079037715714518">Steam</a>.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, if you're still yet to give it a go for yourself, we fully recommend that you do. Our Donlan actually described it as "one of the most generous games in years" when he played it.
</p>
<p>
"Dave the Diver isn't a complicated game, but it can be a very busy one. I mean this as a compliment. From a simple core, it builds outwards in unlikely and enchanting ways. But that core keeps everything from becoming bewildering," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dave-the-diver-a-dizzying-game-of-many-parts-and-a-journey-into-deep-wonder">Eurogamer's five star Dave the Diver review</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/rafal-wlosek-discusses-alters-strategy-on-smaller-scale-and-his-favorite-alter<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>While in Poland last week playing upcoming 11Bit games <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/alters-preview-resource-management-on-smaller-scale"><em>The Alters</em></a> and <em>Frostpunk 2,&nbsp;</em>I had the opportunity to chat in depth with Rafał Włosek, Lead Designer behind <em>The Alters</em>, about what led Jan Dolski to being part of Project Dolly, what it was like to design each of the Alters, and what players can expect as they dive further into the game.</p>

<h2>How Did Jan Find Himself In Space</h2>

<p>To learn more about Jan himself I asked what it was that led Jan to be on this voyage to a different planet in search of a material such as Rapidium. I was also interested in the inception of the idea of <em>The Alters.</em> Unfortunately for Jan, that's not a very happy story.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-alters-preview-tree-of-life.jpg?itok=WVYsWQnk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-alters-preview-tree-of-life.jpg?itok=uhmbcJkQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>One of the nodes on the Tree of Life showing that altering this would lead Jan to become a Refiner</figcaption></figure><p>Włosek explained that "Jan is a person who's trying to figure out what to do next in his life. He's not happy about his decisions." Włosek referenced that Jan's life up until this point has been filled with hardship from birth, something you get to see represented on the Tree of Life.</p>

<p>It was also joked that while Jan had a lot of reasons to be there, 11Bit put him there because they "wanted someone to crash in space."</p>

<p>On the topic of the Alters themselves, it was explained that Włosek and the rest of the creative team were interested in the idea of what people we would be or "Who would we become if we were a bit different? Different choices in our life, what would become of us, and what people would end up around us?"</p>

<h2>At Its Core,&nbsp;<em>The Alters</em> Is A Strategy Game</h2>

<p>This was the basic idea that the development team started with. Being 11Bit though, they added what they're good at: strategy games.</p>

<p>"We started from this idea, but the more we focused on the topic, the more we understood that we need to have a clear narration and storyline,"&nbsp;Włosek said.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"We built upon the storyline, adding more emerging stuff like the stories of each Alter. While you can have different Alters you cannot have all of them in one game. The difficulty of the emerging storylines is how they react to what you do."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Asking for an example of how the different Alters would lead to differences in gameplay, Włosek used the River of Lava that you encounter in Act 1 as an example.</p>

<p>"The way you overcome the problem is always the same, you build a bridge, but there is a lot that may happen on the level of the Alters," he said.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-alters-preview-exterior-terrain.jpg?itok=CG-JDsUR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-alters-preview-exterior-terrain.jpg?itok=x1BPGaXB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A river of lava is the first of what will be many obstacles for Jan.</figcaption></figure><p>"What technology you will develop, how you will treat your Alters, if you want to push them or treat them well," Włosek continued, "it's a strategy game and the different talents of your Alters will be better in different situations."</p>

<h2>Internal Conflict Between Me, Myself, And I</h2>

<p>The Alters won't just be reacting to issues, but can also cause a variety of issues. The different Jans will all have different ways that they react to decisions, and depending on which Jans you've created, there won't always be a "correct" way out of a situation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Whatever version of Jan you create, they're not always entirely happy about your decisions, so they have different problems."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In your playthrough of <em>The Alters</em>, you'll always begin with the regular Jan you play as, the Technician, and the Scientist. These Alters are important to repair the ship and give you access to the research Tech Tree. From there all other Alters are decided by the player themselves. You could have a Miner or a Botanist, but they're all still built around the same foundation.</p>

<p>"The foundation is pretty solid, but then, every Alter has a different story,"&nbsp;Włosek said. "You'll see them showing anxiety and other emotions, and interacting with them will change that. You can please them or piss them off."</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-alters-preview-ship-building-2.jpg?itok=_d9TxqvR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-alters-preview-ship-building-2.jpg?itok=heUGllI8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll need to create living spaces for each of your Alters, but you can also start to have space issues</figcaption></figure><p>Knowing you could piss them off I had to know just how far you could go.</p>

<p>"If they're not happy, they will probably work less and not support you," Włosek said. "They'll start as your friends and then they will not like you. Finally, they will stop talking with you and eventually will rebel against you and just decide that they are the guys who can do it better than you." Włosek described this as a game over state.</p>

<p>"On the other hand, if you're good at handling them and understanding them, they will help you, support you, and will want you to succeed."</p>

<h2>How Were New Jans Created?</h2>

<p>Knowing that each Jan spawned from a different change along the timeline and that those changes led them to different places in life, Włosek explained how they approached creating each new Alter.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-alters-trailer-multiple-jans.jpg?itok=OP3KEAnr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-alters-trailer-multiple-jans.jpg?itok=hiComPAq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Each Jan has a different look and personality.</figcaption></figure><p>I had originally wondered if there was a core element that made them all 'Jan' but Włosek corrected me. "We didn't look at it from that perspective. We liked to ask ourselves 'What decision?' What would be the decision made that the players could refer to and understand from their own life."</p>

<h2>A Favorite Alter; Gameplay or Personality</h2>

<p>If there were only a limited number of Alters that you could create in a single playthrough I did wonder what Włosek's favorite was. He explained that as a system designer, the answer was more complex than I was probably expecting.</p>

<p>"You can create a miner. You're mining things so if you create a miner, they will improve your abilities and it's easy to use for a beginner," Włosek said. "The more you play the game, the more interesting strategies you'll see with different Alters. Because of how I like to connect things, I don't have a single favorite Alter in terms of usefulness."</p>

"If you create a good meal, that will make everyone happy. This can allow you to create special outcomes."</p>

<p>Not taking gameplay into account though, Włosek admitted that he liked the Refiner "because he's a cool guy but he also has an interesting story." Włosek also spoke highly of the Worker for how well he was written but that he would probably hate him in real life.</p>

<h2>How Long Is <em>The Alters</em>?</h2>

<p>While a lot about <em>The Alters</em>, including its release date, is currently shrouded in mystery, I did want to see if I could understand how long the game is, especially with the idea of replayability in mind.</p>

<p>Włosek wasn't able to give me a concrete timeframe, but he did tease to me that from the original scope of the game from when they began development to now, "it's at least twice as long as [11Bit] was aiming, and I'm only talking about a single playthrough."</p>

<p>Avowed and Indiana Jones previews will be shown on June 10th, one day after the Xbox Games Showcase.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has learned that both Avowed and Indiana Jones and The Great Circle will be playable to select media outlets and content creators at this year’s Summer Game Fest. According to those familiar with the plans, both games are expected to be shown at this year’s Xbox Games Showcase, with previews from the hands-on going live on June 10.</p>



<p>Avowed and Indiana Jones have been given a vague 2024 release date, so we’re reasonably confident that both games will also get a definite release date at the event.</p>



<p>During the January 2024 developer direct, we already got a decent look at both Obsidian Entertainment’s Avowed and Bethesda’s Indiana Jones and as we’ll be getting hands-on previews soon after the showcase, we wouldn’t expect anything more than hype trailers and release dates this time around.</p>



<p>As for other games at the Xbox Games Showcase, keep your eyes peeled on Insider Gaming for the latest, as we’ll have more details soon.</p>



<p>Immediately following the Xbox Games Showcase on June 9, Xbox will also hold a unique Black Ops 6 direct, which will offer an unprecedented deep-dive into the game.</p>



<p>Are you excited to see the hands-on gameplay of Avowed and Indiana Jones? Let us know in the comments below. </p>

    <p><span>Clorinde, Sigewinne, and Sethos join the fray, plus a sneak peak into the nation of Natlan.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 4.7 update for <em><a title="Games > Genshin Impact [114 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a></em>, dubbed “An Everlasting Dream Intertwined,” will launch on June 5, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [160 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-884608"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>The latest update brings us three new playable characters, Clorinde, Sigewinne, and Sethos, another long-term Challenge Domain aside from the well-known Spiral Abyss, and a new tower-defense mini-game event. Meanwhile, with the Archon Quest progressing, more secrets about Khaenri’ah will be uncovered as the twin Travelers and Dainsleif meet once again.</p><p>Starting from July 1, a fresh monthly-reset challenge domain “Imaginarium Theater” will emerge in a hidden chamber within Mondstadt Library, and the Spiral Abyss will shift to a monthly update cycle on the 16th day of each month. Imaginarium Theater offers combat challenges of multiple difficulty levels but allows only characters of designated elements (plus a few exceptions) to participate, with a limit on the number of times they can fight. During the challenge, players will receive a variety of buffs and debuffs, and will be able to gradually assemble and adjust their team builds from the characters they own, the initial lineup of six designated characters preset by the domain, friends’ Supporting Cast characters, and a few special guests.</p><p>More challenge domains also provide richer rewards. The current “Imaginarium Theater” rewards its champions with up to Primogems ×620 per month, a series of new photo poses for certain characters, new bonuses for first-time completion, and “Fantastical Blessings” that will apply in the open world for the six designated characters of the month. Meanwhile, the total amount of Primogem rewards from Floors 9 to 12 of the Spiral Abyss will be increased to 800.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_884609"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
        <blockquote><p>In the wake of Arlecchino, we’ll also be seeing the arrival of two more playable characters who can utilize the Bond of Life mechanic in different ways. Clorinde is a Champion Duelist of Fontaine and a five-star Electro sword wielder. When she is in the “Night Vigil” state, Clorinde can alternate between different attack styles, using piercing pistolet attacks to accumulate Bond of Life and a powerful lunging sword attack that clears her Bond of Life and restores her HP. Healing effects she receives through other means during her “Night Vigil” state are added to her Bond of Life instead of her HP. Sigewinne, on the other hand—as a Melusine and the Fortress of Meropide’s head nurse — uses Bond of Life to help her teammates. Her healing will be increased based on the total Bond of Life values across all the characters in her party. In combat, Sigewinne can fire a giant bouncing bubble to trap and attack nearby enemies, as well as to heal and buff her team.</p><p>Aside from these two Fontainian characters, we’ll also see the arrival of the new four-star archer Sethos who can fire piercing Electro arrows in combat. Sethos’s Charge Level 2 attack restricts his movements but fires a formidable, piercing shot. But the successor to the Temple of Silence can initiate a ritual with his Elemental Skill, consuming Elemental Energy to shorten the charging time, then restoring it whenever his attacks trigger any type of Electro-related Elemental Reaction. His Elemental Burst can also fire consecutive enemy-piercing bolts.</p><p>In the Version 4.7 Event Wishes, Clorinde and Sethos will feature in the first half with Alhaitham’s rerun, while the second half will feature Sigewinne alongside <a title="Games > Furi [8 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/furi">Furi</a>na’s rerun. Clorinde and Sigewinne’s Story <a title="Platforms > Quest [100 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/meta/quest">Quest</a>s will also become available for Travelers.</p><p>More mini-games and optimizations will also be coming with Version 4.7. The new <a title="Genres > Tower Defense [19 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/tower-defense">tower defense</a> mini-game “Mutual Security Enhancing <a title="Genres > Simulation [472 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/simulation">Simulation</a>” allows players to deploy their own monster troops in offensive or defensive games. On top of this, to further enhance the daily gaming experience, the Original Resin cap will increase from 160 to 200.</p><p>And a one-minute video clip of Natlan was shown at the end of today’s <em>Genshin Impact</em> Version 4.7 Special Program, providing us with a glimpse into the all-new nation arriving later this year.</p></blockquote><p><em>Genshin Impact</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [7,073 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [26,720 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [20,134 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://ys-api-os.mihoyo.com/event/download_porter/link/ys_global/genshinimpactpc/default" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">client</a> and <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/p/genshin-impact" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/genshin-impact/id1517783697" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.miHoYo.GenshinImpact" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google Play</a>.

                <p>The last couple of weeks have been pretty demoralizing in Helldivers 2, but developer Arrowhead is looking to motivate its community with a chance to unlock a shiny new mech. This week's major order is live, and it's simple enough: Valyria 5 needs to be liberated and players need to take over an Automaton "petafactory" before it's too late.</p><p>The reward for this objective will be a new mech-suit strategem: the EXO-49 Emancipator Exosuit. This model rocks a pair of Dual-Autocannons, making it an absolute beast for demolishing enemy forces. <a href="https://youtu.be/een1GvVyE2U" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The mech leaked a few months ago</a> in Helldivers 2, and each arm carries 75 Autocannon rounds, which is more than enough firepower to demolish an overpopulated Terminid hive.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/helldivers2/status/1793674703359353305" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">MAJOR ORDER: Surveillance has uncovered an Automaton "Petafactory"; its only purpose to mass-produce heartless weapons of war.<br>Liberate it and we can convert it to produce en masse the dual-Autocannon EXO-49 EMANCIPATOR EXOSUIT. <a href="https://t.co/r2yZeCvY2D" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/r2yZeCvY2D</a></p>  — HELLDIVERS™ 2 (@helldivers2) <a href="https://twitter.com/helldivers2/status/1793674703359353305?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 23, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>It also looks better than the first mech unlocked by players, as the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-players-have-successfully-unlocked-mechs-after-a-brutal-campaign/1100-6521715/" data-ref-id="1100-6521715">Patriot Exosuit</a> originally had a small design flaw that would cause it to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-patch-adddresses-the-games-exploding-mech-problem/1100-6521976/" data-ref-id="1100-6521976">violently explode</a> if its rocket launcher was fired while it was turning. This major order also comes on the back of several losses in Helldivers 2, as these events have steadily become more difficult to complete, partly due to the Helldivers 2 community naturally shrinking since the game was first released in February.</p><p>Hot off the momentum of a successful launch, Arrowhead has begun taking the next steps to grow as a studio. Johan Pilestedt has stepped down as CEO and is now the studio's chief creative officer, with his former role being filled by Shams Jorjani. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-studio-wants-to-be-the-next-from-software-has-no-current-desire-to-be-acquired/1100-6523632/" data-ref-id="1100-6523632">Arrowhead wants to become the next From Software or Blizzard</a>, and it plans to do so by focusing on making "really great" co-op games, retaining a manageable number of employees, and staying independent.</p>

        <p>Stefan Tengvall named interim CEO, gaming and esports firm initiates cost reduction program</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Marcus Teilman, the CEO of gaming and esports firm Fragbite Group, has resigned from his position.</p>
<p>The company said he will leave to "pursue new challenges," and will be replaced by chairman of the group's board of directors Stefan Tengvall on an interim basis. Tengvall will step down as chairman and will be replaced by current board member Sten Wranne.</p>
<p>Teilman worked at Fragbite for over three years, originally joining as deputy CEO and head of M&amp;A.</p>
<p>In his comments on the leadership changes, Tengvall announced the company has begun a cost reduction programme, which may identify opportunities for restructuring. This will be his main focus as he takes on the role of interim CEO.</p>
<p>"The Board and I thank Marcus for his efforts and his commitment to Fragbite Group during his time as CEO and wish him the best of luck in the future," said Tengvall.</p>
<p>The news of Teilman's departure was announced on the same day Fragbite revealed it was <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/fragbite-declares-bankruptcy-for-developer-fall-damage-studio-seven-months-after-acquisition">declaring bankruptcy for subsidiary Fall Damage Studio</a> after the developer struggled to find a publisher for its upcoming game, Alara Prime.</p>

"With AI, your creativity sets the limits. Understanding art history, composition, and storytelling is essential for effective direction.

Karch and fellow co-founders Andrey Iones and Anton Krupkin are an uncommon group of executives in the video game business in that they've stayed with the studio they've founded for nearly a quarter of a century.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a moment of uncertainty, learning what studios can do to adapt to changing trends is important. We spoke with Karch about the past and future of Saber—and what other developers should learn from its success.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Saber's in-house tech is a secret powerhouse">Saber's in-house tech is a secret powerhouse</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The first game from Saber Interactive was </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Will Rock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, published by Ubisoft, but it's the time travel first-person shooter </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>TimeShift </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">that really exemplifies its development strategy.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Karch still has a soft spot for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>TimeShift</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">—which didn't win over many critics but was a modest sales success, enough to keep the studio in business.

"I wrote our first scripting language," he said.

"We control our own technology," he explained. "That's partially because our company was [co-founded] by engineers who think about things from a very, very technical perspective."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He's referring here to Anton Krupkin and Andrey Iones, Karch's friends and business partners who hailed from far across the Atlantic. Their maintenance of Saber3D allowed it to fuel games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>World War Z</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and the upcoming </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Warhammer 40,000:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Space Marine 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which both take advantage of the engine's capabilities to push the number of units and quality of environments that can render onscreen.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We use Unreal for certain games, but those are games that don't really require the same level of technical proficiency," he added, going so far as to say developers shook up by </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/unity-apologizes-to-devs-reveals-updated-runtime-fee-policy">Unity's runtime fee debacle</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> should feel comfortable pivoting to Epic Games' popular licensed engine.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With Iones, Krupkin, and other early employees still at the company (an ever-growing rarity), there's an immense amount of retained knowledge about Saber3D's ins and outs. There's a centralized core technology team that keeps it updated and humming along—both the front-end systems (named "Prose") and the back-end systems (called "Hydra") are under that team's purview.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When the company is working toward a major release like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Space Marine 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, that team is solely dedicated toward supporting that game. "That's one of the reasons when we one of our own projects, we try to not release them at the same time," he said, noting the company will sometimes "hold" games to ensure the Saber3D developers aren't overstretched.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Just like Epic Games' work on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fortnite</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> leads to improvements in Unreal Engine, Saber3D gets a bit better with each project. "If we want to rewrite a renderer, if we want to rewrite lighting—no matter what we want to do on the tech side, we can do it."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="From Moscow to New Jersey, and then the world">From Moscow to New Jersey, and then the world</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On TimeShift, the St. Petersburg-based Krupkin and Iones would lead principal development with the team in Russia, while Karch and other New Jersey-based colleagues juggled creative tasks and business relationships with their publisher in California. It was an early example of distributed development, one that's served served the studio in the years since.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The international operation was an "organic" phenomenon, Karch said, simply based on the home countries of the three men.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Those dual offices have since evolved into a sea of global studios (some built by Saber, others being subsidiaries absorbed from its </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/embracer-group-divests-core-saber-interactive-assets-in-deal-worth-247-million">divestment</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> from Embracer Group). Saber isn't stationed in Russia anymore, as the country's invasion of Ukraine led to the last employees in the nation decamping in order to keep working with their Western colleagues, joining </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/game-platforms/rovio-zynga-and-supercell-suspend-operations-in-russia-and-belarus">many other developers</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> who've divested from the region.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>TimeShift</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> days, Karch said the team balanced American management, design, and cultural sensibilities with talented St. Petersburg-based developers taking ownership of developing and utilizing Saber3D.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The studio's expansion was "slow and deliberate," Karch said, and built off the principle of keeping projects in scope of what its in-house engine was capable of.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The division of labor across national borders raises an interesting question: as more studios turn towards international co-development partners to take advantage of lower labor costs in other regions, an uncomfortable dynamic sometimes emerges. In some of these relationships, game studios in the Western world will have creative ownership over a project, and the "grunt work" goes to the outsourced studios.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"That [dynamic] happens primarily when it's not organic," Karch said, explaining that now the technical and creative relationships between studios crisscross the globe. "Our lead designer on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Space Marine 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, he's been with us about 15 years. He moved out of Russia, lives in Armenia, and has full ownership over the game. He works closely with one of our lead writers...who's based out of Liverpool" (near Warhammer license-holder Games Workshop).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He rattled off the other studios' locations in Portugal, Spain, Serbia, Estonia, and the United States. He'd called in from Nimble Giant Entertainment in Argentina. In each of those regions, he said that Saber "gives product ownership to [its teams]."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I wish we'd made </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Helldivers 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">," he lamented in an extended ramble about how streams of great games now pour out of Arrowhead Studios' native Sweden, or Belgium, where </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Baldur's Gate 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> developer Larian Studios is headquartered. "20 years ago, people would say they wouldn't trust Swedish developers. They didn't want to do anything if it wasn't based in North America." He said he's still surprised to hear colleagues from other major studios not wanting to develop a game unless it's based in California.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Does slow and steady make a studio ready for high-profile games?">Does slow and steady make a studio ready for high-profile games?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Saber Interactive now faces a tall task with the remake of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. While the company's previous games appealed to more niche audiences, this game's dramatic development saga and fervent fanbase have made many lock eyes on the studio, salivating at any tidbit of news.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On paper it's a moment 20 years in the making. By patiently improving Saber3D and building a reputation with a library of modest games, Saber's arrived in a position that Aspyr may have rushed into too fast. If all goes well, Karch, Krupkin, and Iones' long bet will have paid off.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Of course, it's only in Star Wars that stories peak at big dramatic conclusions. Once the lights of the Old Republic fade, the studio will have to figure out if its fate still is about going slow and steady—or if such success means it's time to speed things up.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Karch (who expressed frustration in our call at Embracer's decision to grow too big too fast) probably won't want to steer that direction. But one way or another, game studios are at the whims of the market. All they can do is build sturdy ships that hopefully make it through wherever the winds take them.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author(s)</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

<p data-characters="257" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/baldurs-gate-3-is-2023s-best-reviewed-game-so-far/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Baldur’s Gate 3</a></em> is an amazing RPG because it’s so open for players to choose their own path and considers every choice they make. Now, because of a brand new mod, the game can also help you and your entire party realize that you are all Kenough.</p> <p data-characters="512" data-current-count="512" data-injectable="true">Thanks to mod author lokelaniii, any <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> PC player can download Ken’s Mojo Dojo Wardrobe from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/9771" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nexus Mods</a> and start dressing their party like they’re straight out of the <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/barbie-corvette-hummer-coming-to-forza-horizon-5-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Barbie Movie</a></em>. There are five top options to choose from, an honest-to-goodness pair of jorts, white bellbottoms, some sparkly cowboy boots, and a matching pair of sparkly glasses and hat to complete the look. Your enemies will never know what hit them because they’ll be blinded by your sequinned splendor. </p>
 <h2 id="h-everyone-is-kenough-with-ken-s-mojo-dojo-wardrobe-in-baldur-s-gate-3" data-injectable="false">Everyone is Kenough with Ken’s Mojo Dojo Wardrobe in <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Astariel on Twitter</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="436" data-current-count="736" data-injectable="true">This mod can completely transform a playthrough in <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> in the best way. Let’s face it: we all care about how our character looks and what everyone else in and out of the party back at camp is wearing, too. It’s genuinely distracting if a character hasn’t changed their outfit for a day or so, and we’ve all stripped everyone down to their underwear to see the wide range the game has to offer. </p>
 <p data-characters="279" data-current-count="279" data-injectable="false">I first saw the mod thanks to <a href="https://x.com/astarielx/status/1793928933559423338" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Astarial on Twitter</a>, who has posted three absolutely amazing images of Astarion donning an “I am Kenough”crop top, some cowboy boots with purple sequin highlights, and the best-looking pair of jorts I’ve ever seen in a video game. </p> <figure data-current-count="579" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="330" data-current-count="330" data-injectable="false">If you download Ken’s Mojo Dojo Wardrobe for your next playthrough, then make sure you read through the notes carefully. The cosmetics are available for BT2, BT4, and BT2 Githyanki, and the glasses are a character creation item, so you’ll need to use the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/899" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Appearance Edit Enhanced mod</a> to get them onto your companions. </p> <p data-characters="418" data-current-count="748" data-injectable="true">Once installed, you’ll find all the modded clothing in the tutorial chest. If you have any issues, then you can reach out to the mod author on the Nexus Mods page through the Discord link there. They say you need to have some level of experience with<em> <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-mods-in-baldurs-gate-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Baldur’s Gate 3 mods</a></em> to get this one working, but I think the end result more than justifies any amount of effort and learning you’ve got to put in. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Ken’s Mojo Dojo Casa Wardrobe Mod</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="542" data-current-count="842" data-injectable="false">You can enjoy this mod even if you’ve never seen the <em>Barbie Movie</em> and don’t understand what “I am Kenough” means. I think the outfits look amazing and fit in the game world surprisingly well. They don’t look wet or clip through character models too much like other mods, and I could imagine that if you don’t look too closely until you reach a conversation or cutscene, you might even forget your characters are wearing them until you burst out laughing while being threatened by a group of angry Goblins. </p>

			<p>Capes is exciting. It’s a turn-based strategy game similar, gameplay-wise, to the X-Com series, but instead of defending the planet from an alien threat you’re leading a team of superheroes. Rather than shooting guns at extra-terrestrials, you’re telekinetically shooting chunks of rock at them, or teleporting to and then stabbing them, or sometimes just punching them, but it a super heroic way. If you want another comparison, it’s a lower budget, non-Marvel Midnight Sons, but with proper movement and no card system for your attacks.</p>
<p><iframe title="Capes: Official Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V9Yn-Fg90PM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>We will begin with the game’s presentation, which is…okay. Graphically speaking it isn’t going to blow any minds, even the heroes’ ultimate attacks don’t really impress on that front, but it’s good enough to get the job done and combine with a few aesthetic choices that I like. Things like dialogue being presented with comic-style dialogue boxes in addition to being fully voice acted and some basic, but effective direction in cutscenes when establishing the area a level is set in.</p>


<p>It sounds pretty good too, voice acting is competent-to-good throughout, though there are a few anomalies with the levels on certain clips, where Weathervane’s ultimate scream is way too quiet. The dialogue they’re dealt is sufficiently comic book as well, with just that right amount of tongue-in-cheek campiness present in everywhere from the street level goons to the mustache twirling supervillains. It’s just enough to sell the comic styling outside of the cutscenes at base, which are actually cartoon rather than the 3D graphics of in-game. You won’t spend much time back at base, instead characters will pop up over a mostly static background for a conversation, each of them apparently unable to stand still as they have the exaggerated stances of Street Fighter characters, before you jet off for another mission.</p>
<p>These missions will take you all over King City, a dystopian city where developing superpowers is a crime punishable by being taken away, never to be seen again. The city is a dark, dangerous place where The Company is more than happy to kidnap supers and forcibly silence any witnesses, which is where your team of ragtag superheroes comes in. Gathered together by a mysterious man known as Doctrine to free King City from The Company, your team of heroes are young people who have recently come into their powers. These include, but are certainly not limited to, Facet, who can summon crystal shards as armour to reduce damage or to entangle and block enemies, Rebound, who can teleport around and deal extra damage on backstabs, and Weathervane, who can shoot lightning that chains between nearby enemies.</p>


<p>In combat, there are lot of ways these characters can team up, both literally and just with clever planning. Certain abilities can be enhanced if you are in range of another character – for example, Weathervane can add a gust of wind to one of Facet’s melee attacks to add a knockback effect. Alternatively, if a character is in range of rebound they can spend an action to have her teleport them somewhere. Facet’s crystal growth can conduct electricity, so with some strategic placement you can set it up so that Weathervane can damage more enemies with his chain lightning. Another hero named Mercurial is a Speedster (like the Flash) and has an ability that dashes a long distance, but when upgraded by Facet it leaves crystal growth along its entire route, which is very helpful for when you want to chain lightning every enemy in a level.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, these team up abilities are very powerful, which is good, because Capes is <em>tough</em>. It doesn’t mess around when it comes to throwing enemies at you, constantly bringing in more groups of enemies in numbers that, frankly, seem overwhelming when it first starts happening. With careful use of team ups, meticulous positioning, and heavy use of bottle necks you’ll find that it’s not quite as bad as you think. Especially when you realise that you can knock enemies through surrounding walls where they will fall to an instant death.</p>
<p>There are a few issues though. Certain abilities are so useful that they are basically essential. Facet is the only character I currently have that can soak up a lot of damage due to his crystal armour’s damage reduction and, considering the sheer number of enemies that tend to appear, I’ve taken to him always being in my group of four. Rebound can teleport and, as such, isn’t affected by terrain when aiming attacks, and her main attack is ranger teleport, so she doesn’t take reaction damage, so she’s always in there, too. Weathervane and Mercurial always finish up my team, because of the big growth-dash-chain lightning combo I’ve already mentioned, which is disproportionately helpful as you can have Mercurial connect up groups of enemies as they arrive and then run away so Weathervane can damage all of them at once.</p>

<p>Each hero has an ultimate which is charged differently depending on the character – Weathervane’s is charged by hitting people with chain lightning. If you set it up right you can have him using his ultimate, which damages <em>every enemy</em> in a reasonable radius, every round on top of the one damage from the lightning <em>and</em> his second action, because ultimates are free actions. It’s unbelievably useful, especially since there are objectives in the levels like defending hostages and the Facet’s growths also act like walls, blocking enemy movement.</p>
<p>This is all very cool, but the other heroes that I don’t use because my main team is so effective must be a little lonely by now. They have their uses, but they’re not quite as effective as damaging every enemy on the field plus an ultimate every round. Your heroes all level up using Skill Points that are earned not just from completing levels, but from bonus objectives on those levels as well. You can “simulate” previous levels to retry them and earn some extra SP, complete with your now likely significantly more powerful heroes, and they’ll even earn XP whilst they do it. The SP is shared between all heroes, which is useful in that you can spend SP on lesser used heroes to beef them up a bit, but it mostly resulted in me favouring my main four heroes and leaving the others very underpowered, as I didn’t want to constantly replay levels to level them up.</p>
<p>There is one other issue with combat – frustration. On top of the shocking amounts of enemies, some of them have abilities that seem almost unfair and really limit your options. Some enemies have a free action they can fire from a chest cannon at anyone who’s within a very long range in any of the cardinal directions every turn, so if you leave your hero in range they’ll take a hit in addition to the enemy’s turn. This might seem fine, except that some of these levels have like twelve of these bastards and you can only see the range of each one when you highlight it, which, when positioning characters, is time consuming at best. Most importantly, it feels <em>cheap</em>, which is discouraging in a strategy game.</p>

<p>Other enemies have their own free attacks that need to be disarmed before they trigger to avoid damage, forcing you to damage them less in favour of stopping an attack that won’t feel satisfying in a moment when it’s their turn and they still have an attack anyway. There are even stealth sections, where you can see enemy’s sight range and maneouvre around them taking enemies out without them noticing. I actually love this idea, but again, you need to highlight enemies to see their paths for next turn, and there tend to be a lot of enemies to keep track of – just the abilitiy to see all enemy paths at once would make a big difference.</p>
<p>There are a few little niggly bugs and glitches, like the camera clipping through the environment during attacks so you can’t actually see, the HUD sometimes missing elements like whether an enemy will take damage from displacement into objects/drops, or some fiddly UI, especially in the level up menu. But despite this list of small niggles, I really like Capes. It takes the Midnight Sons formula and adds proper levels and positioning into it, whilst removing the randomness of the cards. It’s a great idea that’s mostly well delivered.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-alters-preview-and-qa-11-bit-studios-adds-branching-narrative-layers-to-base-building-survival-genre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Alters</a> is a video game developed and published by <a href="https://11bitstudios.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">11 bit studios</a>. A large part of this team also created the outstanding <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/this-war-of-mine-the-little-ones-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This War of Mine</a>. That is the extent of what I knew about The Alters, going into my time recently spent in Warsaw with the studio, and it was honestly all I needed to know. From the Anomaly games to This War of Mine and Frostpunk, 11 Bit Studios is a developer I trust (also as a publisher, following titles like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/moonlighter-worth-staying-up-for/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moonlighter</a>, Children of Morta and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-invincible-exploring-the-unknown/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Invincible</a>), so my recent hands-on time with The Alters and the story mode of Frostpunk 2 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/hands-on-with-frostpunk-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">preview of the earlier beta here</a>) offered an opportunity to see if that trust would remain after an early look.</p>
<p>The Frostpunk 2 coverage will be in a few days, so I won't say more than my trust remains unsullied. Speaking solely about The Alters, from a game I knew nothing about except what was mentioned above and the nice amount of pink on show in the trailer, I'm now waiting for it to release because I want to play more.</p>
<figure>
<div>

</figure>


<p>So, what is The Alters? From what I've seen and been told, the best way I can describe it is that it's a story-driven third-person adventure game with survival elements and base-building mechanics. The theme of the game is the question the title of this preview asks: "What if?" What if you had decided to become a fluffer instead of a politician - Would you be happier with your life and feel less dirty? What if you were less careful when burying the corpse of your latest Tinder date? These are essential questions we all face in life and those that Jan Dolski will face.</p>
<p>Jan Dolski, voiced multiple times by Alex Jordan (Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty, Dragons Dogma 2, Final Fantasy XVI, Troy: A Total War Saga, Blasphemous, and many more), is stranded on an alien planet and is all by himself. He needs others to survive, so he will create alternate versions of himself where the "What if?" question is directly altered. The first one you meet is a technician version of Jan, and he is created by changing that to escape his father's abuse of his mother and himself; instead of running away, he fights back.</p>
<p>You'll need these alternate Jans to progress through the story because they have the skills to fix something that's broken, and simply because in the actual gameplay, they will need to man different parts of your base. It raised the question of whether you have some control over which Jan you get and when, which I asked, but with this being a narrative-focused title, you will create the Jan needed. This did worry me at first, but getting to see what's on offer did alleviate that.</p>
<p>When you create Jan Technician, sadly not called Jan Hammer, he is understandably disoriented and angry. He was created because you needed him to fix something, nothing more, and he's now facing the near-inescapable death you're facing. He didn't ask for this, but it also opens up the opportunity to win him and the other Jans over through the discussions you have, your shared memories, and, at times, what your alternate version did differently. It's a compelling scenario and one that 11 bit studios seems to be handling well, though, after the use of emotions in This War of Mine, I'm not surprised.</p>
<figure>

</figure>


<p>But what of the gameplay outside of your conversations? Here's where The Alters surprised me more than anywhere else. I expect a good narrative and emotional impact from the developers now. Still, I didn't expect what could be a successful gelling of adventure, survival, and side-on base building (think Fallout Shelter). 11 bit studios has managed to do this quite successfully; at least, that's what I get from the first few hours of the game.</p>
<p>The opening doesn't start quickly, and it is arguably the only thing I think could put people off. The first hour, maybe an hour and a half, is all introductions. It sets the scene, introducing Jan and the giant wheel that is your base. I didn't mind it, but it was the issue I heard from others at the hands-on event, and I can understand that, particularly as - in the current climate - the first few hours need to hook you to keep people going past the steam refund period.</p>
<p>Since these were the first few hours, I didn't get to see all the rooms you get to build in your base, but what I did see started to expand quite quickly. You'll also research expansions, manufacture tools, meals, and more. This is where the multiple versions of you come in, where you can task them with different base rooms, each with their strengths. You'll even be able to send them out into the world to mine, but be careful to keep an eye on their radiation levels and overall health - physical and mental.</p>
<figure>

</figure>


<p>All in all, I'm interested. I started my time at 11 Bit studios with nothing. No knowledge, hype, or excitement for The Alters. I left with a game that I am looking forward to and fully intend to play, either reviewing it or purchasing it upon release. If that isn't a sign of something, nothing is.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Alters Preview - Resource Management On A Smaller Scale]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/alters-preview-resource-management-on-smaller-scale</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-alters-preview-resource-management-on-a-smaller-scale.880428/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/alters-preview-resource-management-on-smaller-scale<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last week I had a chance to fly out to Poland to get hands-on time with 11Bit Studios' upcoming title, <em>The Alters. The Alters</em> is a resource management game where players take on the role of Jan Dolski, an astronaut stranded on a planet trying to collect resources, build up his base, and continue along the planet's surface trying to outrun the harsh sunrise.</p>

<h2><em>The Alters</em> Immediately Sinks Its Hooks Into You</h2>

<p>Our demo began with the start of the game, here Jan had crashlanded on the planet and found that he was the sole survivor of his crew. Making his way to the mobile operations base he had shelter but quickly learned that he would need to gather resources from the surface to begin to repair the base.</p>

<p>Jan was able to contact those in charge of monitoring the mission, to questionable success, and learn that he could get rescued but he'd first need to make it somewhere safe and far from the ever-encroaching sunlight of dawn that would fry the ship and him inside it.</p>



<p>Understanding that piloting this ship and making it to safety isn't entirely within his skillset Jan is given access to the full power of the Quantum Computer on board and The Womb. Combined the Computer is able to create alternate timelines of Jan, where certain decisions were made differently, resulting in different professions.</p>

<p>Some Jans that I got to see in our time playing included a Technician, Miner, Scientist, and I had just created a Botanist Jan before being told I had reached the limit of the presentation.</p>

<p>There's not much more to say but that <em>The Alters</em> had an incredibly strong opening. There was immediate tension in Jan's predicament, a solid plot hook and objective, and also the lingering question of "how do we survive this?"</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-alters-preview-jan-exploring.jpg?itok=1hMpPV6X 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-alters-preview-jan-exploring.jpg?itok=MTCaMUzI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Spend downtime in your base before braving the outside world</figcaption></figure><h2>Gameplay Mechanics Never At Odds</h2>

<p>For me coming to this event, <em>The Alters</em> was a bit of an unknown quantity, I had remembered seeing its announcement at the PC Gaming Show but the gameplay was a bit all over the place.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It showed off <em>Fallout Shelter</em>-like base building, the resource management and survival of <em>Frostpunk</em>, but also third-person exploration and resource gathering that may be more familiar to casual fans of survival games. Playing the game it felt like it all worked together perfectly harmoniously.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-alters-hand-on-footage-resource-gathering.jpg?itok=EjgYBS7W 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-alters-hand-on-footage-resource-gathering.jpg?itok=zmRcts88 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Obtain resources to build more and survive in The Alters</figcaption></figure><p>The gameplay began by being very hands-on with what the player should be doing, I can imagine for some it was annoying having their hand held but I enjoyed the blend of story and gameplay as you learned that you needed certain resources to build a structure that could obtain a different resource. With so much going on narratively it never felt like I was simply following a tutorial.</p>

<p>There was no point where the game made me feel lost, and as the narrative was introducing concepts like the Quantum Computer, the story of Jan's life, and the ability to create Alters the pace still felt rapid and kept me engaged.</p>

<p>Within 40 minutes I already had an Alter or two, had learned a bit more about them, and was assigning them to help gather resources from the planet's surface.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-alters-preview-alter-assignments.jpg?itok=MVioeUnP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-alters-preview-alter-assignments.jpg?itok=dbs5tkHX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You can assign your Alters to take on different tasks that will help around the base or out in the world</figcaption></figure><p>It felt like pushing dominoes that a resource would let me gather another, which would lead to new structures, I'd create a new Alter, build a new part of the ship for them, and then we'd move on to gather more resources.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unlike the harsh pacing of <em>Frostpunk </em>where a dozen things are happening all at once and it's up to you to somehow balance them all everything in <em>The Alters</em> is very deliberate and smaller in scale. You'll always take steps because you know what you want to do next, and never because you're just reacting to the world.</p>

<h2>Interact With Your Alters, And Your Alters Interact With You</h2>

<p>While there wasn't too much time to interact with the Alters what time we did have laid some good groundwork for where the mechanic would lead.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-alters-hand-on-footage-alter-reacting.jpg?itok=uC2NiJY7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-alters-hand-on-footage-alter-reacting.jpg?itok=EciqhG7J 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Jan will remember that</figcaption></figure><p>As soon as you awaken a new Alter you'll see different emotions appearing around their head as they're angry or apprehensive. It's not just enough to manage resources you also need to manage your relationships with the versions of yourself that you might have been</p>

<p>An early example of interaction with my Technician Alter was after learning they were sleeping on the floor at night I was able to craft a dormitory that could house up to four Alters. Looking down the research tech tree I noticed there was also space to create private rooms that could improve moods further.</p>

<p>I was also able to bond with an Alter by gifting them a pocket multi-tool that both he and I had fond memories of. It goes to show how exploration might reward the player with resources, but can also provide you with chances to strengthen your bond with other Alters.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-alters-hand-on-footage-promt-with-an-alter.jpg?itok=028s2_Xm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-alters-hand-on-footage-promt-with-an-alter.jpg?itok=2KRyYe-6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Different conversations will open up giving you a chance to improve relationships or create new structures</figcaption></figure><p>One very unnerving conversation with an Alter came from the birth of the Miner variant of Jan. The memories that led to this Jan's current predicament also included him losing his arm in an accident. Awakening with both of his hands was a rattling experience.</p>

<p>As I was pondering what something like this could mean Alex Jordan, the Voice Actor behind Jan and his different Alters, happened to walk by and tease that where these memories come from will be explored as the game continues.</p>

<h2>The Look Of A New World</h2>

<p>One of the things that most impressed me was the visuals and sound design of <em>The Alters</em>. From the moment you crash down on the planet, you're met with known quantities like rain and lightning, as well as the alien elements like the oil slick look of the waves or strange ferrofluid reactions to the sand.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-alters-preview-rapidium.jpg?itok=w9Y9eCyR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-alters-preview-rapidium.jpg?itok=BIzlWdtz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>As you approach Rapidium the ground begins to shake as if altered by digital noise</figcaption></figure><p>It was tense dealing with how little you could be outside your ship during each active day while also marveling at the world that was around you.</p>

<p>Within the ship, it was a bit more of the standard sci-fi fare in the look and feel of the place. The internal environment gave a vibe of a cleaner and slightly more up-to-date aesthetic that you'd see in 90s sci-fi like the Alien franchise.</p>

<p>It was impressive to see how much work had been done on each of the Alters. While some only offered slight differences where were others that held themselves in different ways that you could tell came from a different life.</p>

<h2><em>The Alters</em> Might Be A Gateway To <em>Frostpunk</em></h2>

<p>I thoroughly enjoyed <em>The Alters</em> as someone who enjoys a moderate amount of resource balancing and gets stuck into a good story.</p>

<p>The DNA of <em>Frostpunk </em>and <em>This War of Mine</em> is very present but it feels like <em>The Alters</em> is being set up as a more casual entry into the rest of what 11Bit has to offer. If those elements tickle your fancy then 11Bit already has the next game for you to try.</p>

<p>After getting only a few hours on the game I was left wanting more, I want to know how much deeper the mechanics go as well as what's going on with the mysterious corporation behind Project Dolly.</p>

            <link>https://www.polygon.com/24161457/hellblade-2-psychosis-psychologist-interview</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/in-hellblade-2-the-biggest-challenge-senua-faces-is-other-people.880425/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24161457/hellblade-2-psychosis-psychologist-interview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="0dNaXI">Ninja Theory’s 2017 game <em>Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice</em> is famous for exploring the experiences of people with psychosis through the medium of a vision quest undertaken by Senua, a Celtic warrior in the early Middle Ages. It earned acclaim for its sensitive, thoroughly researched, and audio-visually immersive portrayal of Senua’s condition — something the Ninja Theory team had arrived at through close collaboration with Paul Fletcher, a professor of psychology at the University of Cambridge.</p>
<p id="F3XVew">Following a singular success like this is always challenging, but maybe especially so in the case of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24120021/hellblade-2-senuas-saga-preview-ninja-theory-unreal-engine-5"><em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2</em></a>, which was released this week on Windows PC and Xbox Series X, and is included with Game Pass. How could Ninja Theory bring players back into Senua’s experience of the world without rehashing the first game — or sidelining or trivializing her condition? How could it raise the stakes for the character without undoing Senua’s growth, or succumbing to the “descent into madness” tropes the first game had so conscientiously avoided?</p>
<p id="F1qXm6">The answer, as it turns out, was quite simple: Have her meet and interact with other people.</p>
<div id="OLaFCV"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KVBxvlRV0d4?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="SwyFJC">“We definitely didn’t want to walk back on [the first game] and make it seem as though we’re resetting her,” scriptwriter and Performance Capture Director Lara Derham said during a conversation with myself and Fletcher at Ninja Theory’s Cambridge offices, which Polygon visited a couple months before the game’s launch. </p>
<p id="VZorVS">“She’s still got that sense of a greater sense of peace, a greater sense of opportunity,” Derham said. “But I see the first game as a very internal journey, very personal, and very oriented around herself and what she’s lost. And I think this game, while we’re still obviously seeing the world through Senua’s eyes, it’s more about interacting with the world around her, people around her, and pushing out into the future a little more.”</p>
<p id="MQtWUC">This makes sense dramatically, but for Fletcher it was also an opportunity to get deeper into a crucial aspect of psychosis that the first game, by nature, hadn’t really explored. </p>
<p id="bT7MXX">“I think what Lara and the team are doing now is exploring a bit of the distress of psychosis that perhaps wasn’t so much to the fore in <em>Senua’s Sacrifice</em>, which is what happens when your reality — your construct of reality — conflicts or coincides with that of other people around you,” Fletcher said. </p>
<p id="7ymOR6">One of the most prominent aspects of psychosis for some people is the constant narration of internal voices, characterized in the game as Furies. As Senua interacts with other people on her quest to track down some slavers in Iceland, a natural dramatic tension arises from the way the Furies react during conversations — sometimes encouraging her to interact, sometimes sowing seeds of distrust.</p>

<p id="AgXauG">Fletcher explains that this tension gets at one of the most fascinating aspects of psychosis — one that can be illuminating about the human condition in general, in fact. </p>
<p id="aII4jh">“I think one of the first things [about being human] is that we make contact with each other through a sort of tacit agreement about the fact that we’re inhabiting the same space with the same experiences and same reality,” he said. “Whereas in fact, we’re all carrying our own little environments around with us — and I think, in psychosis, that that rupture is much greater.”</p>
<p id="JXEEIO">For people with psychosis, interacting with other people means bridging the gap between two (or more) quite different realities, which can be a huge challenge. “That kind of split focus between this internal world and the external world can be really difficult to manage,” Derham said. </p>
<p id="MDfbIl">Fletcher agreed: “It’s a very exhausting process to juggle it for people, you know. If somebody still has these psychosis-related beliefs, but they’re also engaging with people who don’t share them at all — and, in fact, think that they’re mad — then there’s all sorts of things that they have to do to suppress them or to hide them. And they also have to somehow negotiate between the two — to find a way of having this cherished inner reality that they don’t let go of, while at the same time functioning within a different one.”</p>
<p id="sbOdMm">That Senua might “cherish” her own experience of reality is one of the key learnings Derham and Fletcher took from the conversations they had with people with psychosis while they were researching for the game. </p>
<p id="LQP3Hv">“The experiences, or voices and visions, [are] actually integral to the sense of self,” Fletcher said. “It’s not a symptom that’s just been stuck on to a person. People will often say: ‘This is a part of me. It’s my reality, it’s my experience, and you can’t just treat it as a... it’s not a tumor.’ Sometimes the experiences are deeply rewarding and engaging, immersive, pleasurable; they’re not always suffering.”</p>

<p id="53bNda">“Obviously, a lot of what Senua experiences is quite dark,” Derham said. “But occasionally, there’ll be moments where she feels a special connection with someone or the world seems to have a special kind of beauty to her. And I think those experiences are very positive. And that reflects what we’ve understood from people we’ve talked to — that occasionally, there’ll be a time where the world just seems a bit brighter than it might to some of the rest of us.”</p>
<p id="C6ZoTD">Researching psychosis for the Hellblade games from a purely experiential perspective, rather than as a problem to be solved or as suffering to be alleviated, also challenged Fletcher’s medical and academic perspectives on the condition. “The sole question here, or the starting question here, was always, ‘What’s it like? What does that feel like?’ And I think it created a whole new conversation for me with people with a history of psychiatric illness, which is very enriching,” he said.</p>
<p id="zs8gKf">After <em>Senua’s Sacrifice</em> came out, Fletcher remembers feeling encouraged by what he saw as a successful effort to destigmatize psychosis and mental health issues at large. That’s still a hope he nurtures for <em>Senua’s Saga</em>, of course, but now he harbors an even bigger ambition: that the game can encourage every player to consider a big metaphysical question. Perhaps the biggest. </p>
<p id="b0ERXk">“The fantasy I have is that people will reflect upon the nature of their constructions of reality,” he said, “and just how tenuous our links with objective reality might be.” </p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1793902842681638976" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> on Twitter/X today, reliable leaker @HYPEX revealed potential Lethal Company-themed cosmetics that are possibly coming to Fortnite.</p>



<p>HYPEX did not have further details about the release date for this collaboration. However, they did showcase both a Lethal Company skin and Back Bling.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Lethal Company was a co-op horror indie hit about collecting scrap together on abandoned moons, a welcome surprise for Fortnite. </p>



<p>HYPEX has successfully leaked a variety of information about Fortnite for a long time. That includes details about the recent <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-x-star-wars-crossover-announced-for-may-3rd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars crossover</a> and more.</p>



<p>Another prominent Fortnite leaker, user @ShiinaBR, also showcased an upcoming “Company Jig” emote for the Lethal Company crossover. This included a brief video of the emote in action <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1793916082321039698" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via Twitter</a>.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Lethal Company launched into Early Access in October 2023 to rave reviews, praised for its atmosphere and more. It still maintains Overwhelmingly Positive reviews on Steam. </p>



<p>In fact, Lethal Company further seemed to influence games like Content Warning, which similarly took the indie scene by storm last April. At this time, there’s still no date for Lethal Company’s full release. </p>



<p>While Fortnite fans await the Lethal Company crossover, many are hoping for more information about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-x-fallout-crossover-event/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Fallout collaboration</a>. Fans of the IP enjoyed seeing the T-60 Power Armor suits. Fallout certainly earned wider appeal among casual audiences following the Amazon live-action series.</p>



<p>Epic Games has not officially confirmed anything about the Lethal Company collaboration yet.</p>

                <p>The Alters is a strange, genre-blending sci-fi survival game that's centered around cloning its protagonist. After Jan Dolski--a spaceship engineer--crash-lands on a desolate, uncharted planet he must clone himself to survive. It's an odd premise, but it's one that developer 11 Bit Studios tackles earnestly. Cloning Jan is built around a series of "What If?" questions: What if Jan pursued chemistry instead of engineering, or what if he stood up to his abusive father? These "What If?" questions are at the heart of The Alter's themes and narrative.</p><p dir="ltr">The demo begins as Jan crash-lands on a black sand beach with jagged cliffs and rough water. The Alters has a strong visual identity, with the almost-monochrome world punctuated by bright and colorful flares lighting up the sky as rain pours down. The world looks beautiful, ferocious, and alien all at once. As Jan makes his way to the Mobile Base--a giant wheel-like structure--he learns that his whole crew, including the captain, died on impact. He's alone and very, very far from home.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Alters Is An Ambitious Genre Blending Survival Game</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Upon reaching the Mobile Base, Jan learns that he must relocate the base before sunrise, otherwise the sunlight will fry everything it touches. In order to get it up and running, Jan needs natural resources and a technician. And to accrue the necessary resources, Jan must set up mining outposts on top of mineral deposits in the surrounding area. The materials can then be transported to the Mobile Base by daisy-chaining pylons together. It's a rather straightforward process with just enough quirks and intricacies to keep it engaging. However, recruiting a technician is a bit tougher considering Jan is on the planet all by himself. This is where cloning comes in.</p><p dir="ltr">Each time you clone Jan, you are presented with a timeline of his life, and you can create branches at key moments that result in different Jans with different personalities and skill sets. As you create more Jans, more game systems open up and your odds of survival increase. However, cloning Jan comes with its own set of repercussions that 11 Bit Studios seems eager to explore. The first alternate Jan you create is a technician, and when he finds out he's a clone living in a universe where his childhood did not exist, he's understandably frustrated and confused.</p><p dir="ltr">Jan's decision to clone himself doesn't come easily, either. The logistical and ethical implications weigh heavily on him, but one person can't run the Mobile Base alone. Due to the urgency of the situation and pressure from the unsavory organization that funded the expedition, he suspends his moral dilemma and clones himself.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4307556-thealters_screenshot_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4307556" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4307556-thealters_screenshot_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4307556"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4307556-thealters_screenshot_2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Backed by some light social-sim mechanics and dialogue options, proto-Jan must earn technician-Jan's trust by spending time and bonding with him. Chatting with Jan's alter is surprisingly novel. Sure, they are biologically the same person, but because technician-Jan chose a different path than proto-Jan, it's fascinating to see how their parallel lives have impacted who they are and how they navigate the world. The Alters, based on my two-hour preview, seems like the perfect setup to explore its themes of individualism and identity, and the complicated relationship of nature vs. nurture.</p><p dir="ltr">According to game director Tomasz Kisilewicz, "Learning and understanding their storylines while managing them effectively is at the core of…the game." While not every Jan will be as frustrated as technician-Jan, many of them will have their own flaws and insecurities that proto-Jan must navigate. Sometimes that’s through dialogue and other times it’s by creating a Jan that can compliment or uplift another. It's tough to say how deep these social-sim mechanics go, but considering how many genres 11 Bit Studios is balancing, a bit of restraint might go a long way. Too much sim management might muddle the experience, and too little might make it feel superfluous. After all, The Alters is a survival game first and foremost, and most of my time was spent outside of my ship, exploring the planet.</p><blockquote><p>It's clear that 11 Bit Studios has a story it wants to tell, and this linearity seems to facilitate that narrative.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">Like many survival games, much of your time is spent harvesting materials, building structures, and researching new technologies. However, The Alters' survival mechanics aren't as freeform as something you might see in Grounded or Valheim. The Mobile Base--at least in the first few hours--only moves for plot reasons. This means that players will likely experience the world in a similar manner: Explore the same areas, mine the same resources, and inhabit the same sections of the map. While this may turn some survival fans off, this linearity feels intentional. It's clear that 11 Bit Studios has a story it wants to tell, and this linearity seems to facilitate that narrative. Unlike other survival games, The Alters seems to have a definitive ending with clear goalposts: Build up the Mobile Base enough in order to fly back home.</p><p dir="ltr">If anything, the gameplay diversity lies in its management-sim mechanics. After you unlock the technician, a handful of different alters become available, and as long as you have the resources you can create whichever Jan you think is most helpful. From there, you can choose which technologies you'd like to prioritize, which alter is working on what, and how you'd like to arrange and upgrade your ship and its various modules. As you create more alters, you'll need to build more facilities to appease the growing demand. Eventually, your ship could become a small self-sufficient colony populated by Jans.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4307559-thealters_screenshot_8.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4307559" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4307559-thealters_screenshot_8.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4307559"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4307559-thealters_screenshot_8.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">When I asked Kisilewicz about how 11 Bit Studios balances and blends all these disparate genres, he said, "We wanted to find the tools and elements of different genres that would suit the message…Combining them together was a big challenge, but also something exciting. If we can make these work together it’s going to be something else. Something different." In order for the player to feel like they are exploring an uncharted planet with a crew of clones, the gameplay needed to support that. That meant social-sim mechanics to give the crew a bit of dynamism, survival elements to make the planet feel dangerous, and management systems to fully utilize the crew.</p><p dir="ltr">Based on my hands-on session, it seems like 11 Bit Studios has found a way to merge these disparate genres in a way that feels elegant. No one mechanic or system felt overbearing, and all of them had a tangible purpose that fit with the overall premise. That said, The Alters is spinning a lot of plates at once, and I feel like it could all come crashing down with the slightest push. It's hard to say if that "push" will ever come based on my playtime, but after chatting with Kisilewicz, it seems like the team is well aware of their lofty ambitions. If 11 Bit Studios manages to blend all these genres together and thoughtfully explore its themes, I think The Alters could be something special.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-franchise-500-million-figures<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company has released some new figures for the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>franchise, showing just how popular and enduring the series' legacy truly is.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://corporate.pokemon.co.jp/en/aboutus/figures/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new set of numbers on the company's official website</a>,&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>is nearing 500 million software units shipped worldwide, with the latest figure standing at a whopping 480 million.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that around 24 million of those, at last count, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-has-sold-13936-million-units-super-mario-bros-wonder-sold-1196-million">can be attributed</a> to&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet</em>, so the series is still going strong sales-wise despite the ambivalent reaction to those games' technical issues.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-franchise-numbers.jpg?itok=F8psW4wr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-franchise-numbers.jpg?itok=b2nvhZXF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Love 'em or hate 'em,&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet&nbsp;</em>have earned big bucks for The Pokemon Company.</figcaption></figure><p>In fact, a quick glance at Nintendo's <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/software/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">best-selling titles list</a> shows that&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Sword and Shield&nbsp;</em>have sold around 26 million units, so between them, the mainline&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games on the Switch alone make up for more than 10% of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em>'s total software sales.</p>

<p>The Pokemon Company points out that&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>has been translated into nine languages around the world, too, so it's a truly global franchise (as if you needed reminding).</p>

<p>On the trading card side, the company pulls out some more staggering statistics. Almost 65 billion&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>cards have been manufactured since the game was launched, and the card game is available in 15 different languages across 93 countries.</p>

<p><em>Pokemon</em>'s animated TV offerings, meanwhile, have been made available in 192 countries and regions around the world. It's a pretty sobering reminder that it's&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em>'s world, and we're all just living in it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-franchise-numbers-animated-series.jpg?itok=dJFuQDNX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-franchise-numbers-animated-series.jpg?itok=1-vdDVSj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pokemon</em>'s animated series offerings are truly global.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, it's not like the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>franchise is done conquering the world, so these numbers are likely to get even more impressive over time.</p>

<p>While a mainline&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>game hasn't been announced for this year,&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-a-announced">lined up for a release on Switch in early 2025</a>, and a new&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Trading Card Game&nbsp;</em>mobile app is scheduled to arrive this year.</p>

        <p>As companies start to rebuild the development capacity lost in mass layoffs and closures, much of the focus will be on growing new studios away from traditional high-cost regions</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>The enormous wave of layoffs, studio closures, and corporate consolidations which hit the games industry last year is by no means over – but it does appear to have crested, at least, with the pace of such announcements starting to slow down as we've entered the second quarter of this 2024.</p>
<p>The knife will still fall in some painful places before this is over, but at last we're also starting to see early signs of recovery – green shoots amidst the rubble, with new studios being formed and some established ones cautiously starting to expand again.</p>
<p>The scale of the downturn this time around was unprecedented – not least because the industry overall is so much larger than in previous cycles, so there are more jobs to be lost in the first place – but the downturn itself was a familiar story. Companies over-extended in an economic environment where capital was easy to come by and made some bad bets on trends that didn't turn out to have the appeal or longevity they hoped; a shift in economic climate then dampened risk appetite and companies that had voraciously pursued growth for years suddenly found themselves obsessed with cost-cutting instead. This cycle has repeated throughout the industry's history at various intervals and at different scales.</p>
<p>It is a cycle, though, and the wheel that turns downwards eventually reaches its nadir and begins to move upwards again. It's a little too early to proclaim that we've bottomed out, but at some point fairly soon the industry will start the process of rebuilding the capacity it has just lost; hiring will outpace redundancies, and studio openings will become more commonplace than studio closures.</p>
<p>The big question, then, isn't whether the jobs that went away will come back – they will – but where and in what form they'll come back. The capacity the industry will rebuild will have a different focus and form to the capacity it tore down over the past year and a half. Crucially, it may also have a different location.</p>
<blockquote><p>"When the wheel turns back around from contraction to expansion, they'll be able to control costs by building up their new capacity in cheaper places than those in which they previously operated"</p></blockquote>
<p>To that last point, keep an eye on the trickle of announcements of new studio openings and expansions that we've started to see coming through. Just this week, Amazon announced that it's <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/amazon-opens-new-studio-in-bucharest">opening a new studio in Bucharest</a>. Larian, high off the extraordinary success of Baldur's Gate 3, is <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/larian-to-expand-with-warsaw-office">opening one in Warsaw</a>.</p>
<p>The depth of game development talent in Eastern Europe is unquestionable – the era when game companies in that region were almost exclusively working as outsourcing houses for major studios in North America or Western Europe is long gone – but it's also undeniable that the cost of operating a studio in those regions is much cheaper than in traditional game development heartlands like the West Coast of America or the South of England.</p>
<p>As the industry begins to rebuild its lost capacity, that cost calculation is going to be a tough one to avoid. At the same time that the games business was carrying out mass layoffs and closures, inflation in high cost of living areas was running at its highest level in a generation, and salaries in those areas have gone up significantly in response.</p>
<p>Game development is incredibly labour intensive, requiring a lot of people with a wide range of advanced technical and creative skills; the cost of labour is one of the most defining aspects of the overall cost of creating a game. If you can successfully operate a studio somewhere like Eastern Europe or South-East Asia rather than in Los Angeles or London, you can bring down development costs significantly – at least in theory.</p>

</figure>
<p>That cost gap has always existed, of course, and publishers have been experimenting with opening studios in less expensive regions for decades – but in the current climate, the calculus has shifted quite resoundingly in that direction.</p>
<p>That's not just because costs in expensive regions have soared, far outpacing wage growth in less expensive regions; it's also because the skilled labour base with the technical and artistic skills required to build games has improved significantly in many cheaper regions. In many places, especially in Eastern Europe, there's also now a base of skilled workers with significant game development experience, which was always the key thing that was lacking in these regions in the past; there were tons of skilled young people but few who had the kind of experience of development that's required to ensure that projects run smoothly, and relatively easy to find in workforces in those traditional game development heartlands.</p>
<p>The conclusion a lot of companies are going to reach is the same; when the wheel turns back around from contraction to expansion, they'll be able to control costs by building up their new capacity in cheaper places than those in which they previously operated.</p>
<p>However, the question of whether that new capacity will really be able to get up to speed quickly and effectively remains a thorny one. There are certainly more experienced staff in these regions than in the past, but there's still a major gap – and that's problematic when you're trying to maximise the efficiency of your new development resources.</p>
<p>The advantage of experienced staff is that they've made mistakes, and watched others make mistakes, and know how to avoid those mistakes in future; that's experience in a nutshell, and a studio lacking that experience will probably make a ton of costly, time-consuming mistakes that could have been avoided otherwise.</p>
<p>Moreover, many of the staff available in less costly regions, while very highly skilled, are skilled in ways that may look similar on paper to what staff in an established developer would be like, but are very different in practice. For example, there is a new wealth of game development talent in India, but it's almost exclusively focused on mobile game development, and even at that tends to be focused on creating games for lower-spec devices – a valuable and worthwhile skillset, but not one that's easily parlayed into developing for high-end consoles or PCs.</p>
<blockquote><p>"The games industry will build up capacity again in the next year or two, but a large proportion of that will be in cheaper locations"</p></blockquote>
<p>What has tended to happen in the past is that companies establish studios in cheaper regions using less experienced staff, while the experienced staff in more expensive regions find funding and establish their own independent studios; ultimately, many of the studios in cheaper regions simply end up functioning as outsourcing providers for those experienced developers, who have been bought up by publishers on the upturn of the cycle. It's generally been a fairly wasteful way to reach a straightforward outcome – but there's a growing sense that things could be different this time, as regions like Eastern Europe and (for mobile titles at least) South and South-East Asia now have some homegrown experienced talent available.</p>
<p>What's more, rising living standards in many of those places – combined with many people in expensive regions in the West feeling increasingly priced out of a decent standard of living – could make it appealing for experienced developers from western countries to move there and work for these new studios. That's something that has tended to be very rare in the past, with developers generally only moving to such studios when they were taking on senior management roles, but the push and pull factors for people who have been working in extremely high cost-of-living areas are markedly different this time around, and a kind of "reverse brain drain" is arguably on the cards, especially for younger and more mobile staff.</p>
<p>In the short- to mid-term, at least, the outcome is clear; the games industry is going to start to seriously build up capacity again at some point in the next year or two, but a large proportion of that capacity is going to be located in cheaper locations than previously.</p>
<p>What's less clear this time around is what the fate of those new studios in cheaper regions will be; more than any point in the past, there's reason to believe that they could thrive and even start to attract experienced talent from other regions.</p>
<p>For those affected by the industry layoffs, however, this just introduces another thorny issue to grapple with; as hiring begins to ramp back up in earnest, many people may have to face tough questions about their willingness to move to lower-cost regions to continue their careers.</p>

            <p>Arrowhead's chaotic alien-shooter Helldivers 2 became <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-now-playstations-fastest-selling-game-ever">PlayStation's fastest-selling game ever</a>, but despite its initial success, player numbers have since declined.</p>
<p>A look at the game's Steam charts shows a steady drop since February, when the game launched. According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/553850/charts/#3m">SteamDB</a>, at its peak in February shortly after launch, there were 458,709 concurrent players. In comparison, its peak over the last 30 days is 166,305. That's a drop of 64 percent.</p>
<p>Looking by average players, February had 208,303 helldivers in the game. That average player count has dropped to 78,634 over the last 30 days (a 62 percent drop).</p>

</figure>
<p>Of course, player numbers are expected to drop over time. But for Helldivers 2 there are a number of factors that may have contributed to this decline.</p>
<p>The most notable reason is the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-steam-players-will-soon-need-to-link-a-psn-account-and-they-arent-happy">infamous PSN debacle that kicked off earlier this month</a>. At the start of May, Helldivers 2 publisher Sony announced players on Steam would soon be required to link a PlayStation Network (PSN) account to keep playing. This not only resulted in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2s-positive-steam-score-tumbles-as-pc-players-hit-back-at-sonys-psn-requirements">swathes of negative reviews from a very disappointed community</a>, but the game was also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-has-been-pulled-from-sale-in-177-countries-as-its-psn-linking-requirement-rolls-out">pulled from sale in 177 countries where PSN was not available</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-overturns-helldivers-2-psn-requirement-following-backlash">Sony soon backtracked on its plans</a>, stating it was "still learning what is best for PC players", calling the monumental spate of feedback "invaluable".</p>
<p>Another factor contributing to the game's decline in player numbers could be the balancing, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-developer-gets-new-ceo-plans-to-remain-an-independent-studio">Arrowhead's newly appointed chief creative officer and chairman Johan Pilestedt</a> previously admitted the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-balancing-has-sometimes-gone-too-far-ceo-admits">team sometimes went too far with</a>. Additionally, the game has sometimes been subject to bugs and other issues, causing player frustration.</p>
<p>In response, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-studio-mulling-slightly-lower-update-frequency-after-hectic-first-few-months">Helldivers 2 team is now considering a "slightly lower" but higher standard update frequency</a> after a busy first few months.</p>
<figure>

 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>SteamDB/Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>While there has undeniably been a drop in player numbers, Helldivers 2 remains popular, and Pilestedt believes the game's success is not because of the price point (Helldivers 2 currently retails at a comparatively modest £34.99 on Steam).</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Pilestedt spoke at the Nordic Game conference, where he addressed Helldivers 2's 'smash hit' status. Here, he stated Arrowhead managed to get the "fundamentals" right and delivered on the "fantasy" of the experience. While many others have made shooters like Helldivers 2 before, Pilestedt said his team "dug into the believability of what it would be to be in that game". </p>
<p>Pilestedt also reasoned Helldivers 2 is an authentic experience in a lot of ways and doesn't put up barriers that wouldn't be actually there. "In Star Wars, how many strikes does it take to cut somebody's hand off with a lightsaber? It's one," he said. "It is fundamental that we adhere to the fantasy... Fine, balance it, but don't make it two strikes. I know that's false, and now we're not making a Star Wars game anymore." </p>
<p>
Another factor that has contributed to Helldivers 2's success is its style, with the developer stating the game is a "representation of those who made it". </p>
<p>Pilestedt lastly touched on its success as a live service game, something others have struggled with. "It's easy to say, 'well, we'll earn more money by being able to drop a content pack here and there'. But that's not a reason why any consumer would want to engage with us," he noted. </p>
<p>Pilestedt said live service games can be good for the industry "if done right", as they become a continuously evolving hobby. "If you forget this when making a live service game, then I think that - I don't want to say it's a problem - but it is a problem. I think that is a problem... I've decided it's a problem, it's a massive problem," he said.</p>
<p>He also implored developers not to shy away from engaging with its community. While he admitted there are "arseholes" out there, that should not prevent a studio from interacting with its fanbase. He noted there will be times when people get "pissed", acknowledging that PSN hoo-ha. "But, at that point, it's like 'ah, sorry! Yeah, that was a bad move by us'... an apology doesn't mean that you devalue your own brand as an organisation, it just strengthens you."</p>
<p>You can hear Pilestedt talk in the video below, starting at the 4hr 37 minute mark.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/stellar-blade-update-1003-adds-new-boss-challenge-new-outfits-and-more<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</a> developer Shift Up Corp. has released patch 1.003, adding a new Boss Challenge, new outfits for main character Eve, and more.</p><p>Stellar Blade is an action game released exclusively on PlayStation 5 in April. IGN’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stellar-blade-review">Stellar Blade review</a> returned a 7/10. We said: “Stellar Blade is great in all of the most important ways for an action game, but dull characters, a lackluster story, and several frustrating elements of its RPG mechanics prevent it from soaring along with the best of the genre.”</p><p>Now, a month after release, the new update adds the Boss Challenge mode, which pits players against the 19 bosses from the base game. Progression in the Boss Challenge requires battle data from bosses you’ve previously defeated, director Kim Hyung Tae explained in a post on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/05/23/stellar-blade-adds-new-boss-challenge-mode-on-may-24/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation Blog</a>. You can also fight bosses on the hard difficulty setting after you’ve seen the ending of the game.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/24/sb1-1716548636019.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>To start the challenge, you can either load up and use your own gear you’ve been using or choose one of several presets. “Choose the minimum preset for a true challenge, which is extremely understated, or the maximum preset, which has all of your skills and stats buffed up, if you want to taunt the boss with some spectacular combat,” Kim Hyung Tae suggested.</p><p>After the challenge is over, your battle data is automatically analyzed. You’ll see metrics like battle time, number of perfect parries and dodges, consumable usage, and more. You can compare your results with those of your friends. If you defeat all bosses in the Boss Challenge on Normal difficulty setting or higher, you’ll get to earn the Neurolink Suit for Eve, below.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/24/sb3-1716548657498.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Speaking of new outfits, the update adds two new Nano Suits: White Kunoichi and Black Kunoichi (check them out in the images below). Kim Hyung Tae encouraged players check in-game for more Nano Suits.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/24/sb4-1716548674770.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/24/sb5-1716548689495.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>And finally, quality-of-life improvements mean if you switch to ranged attack mode and switch back while locked on to an enemy, you will automatically lock on to the enemy again. The update also adds an option to always show the compass in the HUD.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

The clip, published by the <a href="https://x.com/ArkhamVideos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Arkham Videos X/Twitter account</a>, shows an icy section of Metropolis alongside an advert for Ho-Ho Frozen Chicken Bites.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The latest Suicide Squad patch added a small tease in Metropolis for Season 2, which supposedly will introduce Mrs. Freeze as a new playable character. <a href="https://t.co/N6w8xvG0AG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/N6w8xvG0AG</a></p>— Batman Arkham Videos (@ArkhamVideos) <a href="https://twitter.com/ArkhamVideos/status/1793319054435877058?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 22, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Rocksteady has yet to announce Season 2 or what it will add to the game, but it is expected to launch with a new playable character. Season 1 added Joker to the live service co-op shooter.</p><p>The addition of Mrs. Freeze won’t come as much of a surprise to Kill the Justice League’s core fanbase, given datamining has suggested playable characters on their way include Mrs. Freeze, Lawless, and Deathstroke. Given Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League's Joker is an alternate-reality Elseworlds variant hoovered into the Arkhamverse by Brainiac, this in-bound Mrs. Freeze may be an Elseworlds variant of Mr. Freeze.</p><p>In February, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-villain-seemingly-leaks-upcoming-playable-character">Kill the Justice League players were surprised to hear</a> main antagonist Brainiac appear to spoil the upcoming addition of Mrs. Freeze in-game. Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideSquadGaming/comments/1aiydw6/am_i_crazy_or_did_brainiac_just_call_me_freeze/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>ZeronintyPlays</u></a> posted a gameplay clip showing their Harley Quinn taking down an enemy, only to be called the wrong name by Brainiac. "I didn't expect you to be the weak link in this chain, Freeze," the baddie said.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>As reported earlier this month, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-flop-leads-to-200-million-impairment-charge-warner-bros-confirms"><u>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</u> has disappointed Warner Bros. Discovery</a>, owner of developer Rocksteady, to the tune of a $200 million hit to revenue.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-review"><u>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League was panned by critics upon launch</u></a>, with extremely low player numbers on Steam. Some of the frustration stems from Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League not being another Batman game from Rocksteady, despite the fact it is set within the Arkhamverse. The developer’s Batman Arkham series is much-loved by fans, with 2011’s Batman: Arkham City in particular held up as one of the greatest, if not <em>the</em> greatest superhero video game of all time. Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, on the other hand, is a live service third-person combat game in which Batman is a villain.</p><p>Rocksteady has faced tough questions around Warner Bros.’ long-term commitment to Suicide Squad’s live service. Warner Bros. is yet to announce Rocksteady's next project, but earlier this month <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-batman-arkham-game-in-years-is-a-vr-exclusive"><u>it revealed Batman: Arkham Shadow</u></a>, a VR game developed by Camouflaj, maker of the Iron Man VR game, and set for release exclusively on the Meta Quest 3 later in 2024.</p><p><em>Image credit: Arkham Videos X/Twitter account.</em></p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

While the Pro parts initially required a specialty guitar controller, the new update will introduce options for playing them on a standard keyboard or gamepad across all consoles and PC.</p><p>Unlike standard Fortnite Festival parts, Pro parts require players to hold down the correct fret key and strum to hit a note. Pro Lead and Bass parts also have unique note types called hammer-ons and pull-offs, which replace standard parts' Lift Notes. To hit these notes, which look visually different to normal notes, you just have to press the corresponding key with no strumming.</p>

<p>With the new update, v30.00, players will be able to keybind their own controls for Pro Lead and Bass, mapping the five colored notes as well as the strum key. This will allow players to use any keyboard or controller they like for Pro parts, in any configuration they like. By default, the keyboard mapping has fretting on keys 1-5 and strumming on Right Shift and Enter, allowing you to hold the keyboard as you would a guitar... if it were missing a string. </p><p>The update is also making some changes to how Pro parts work as a whole, introducing some improvements to hitting hammer-ons and pull-offs without strumming, as well as adding the option to toggle input labels under the note highway on in Pro parts.</p><p>While it won't arrive in this update, Fortnite is also working on improving the feel of guitar controllers, with some players saying fret forgiveness currently feels too strict. Fortnite is also working on plans to expand the number of guitar controllers compatible with the game.</p><p>The new update also has some added options for non-Pro parts, such as the option to view multi-colored notes instead of Fortnite Festival's standard single-color track, and the option to play all parts, including drums and vocals, with a supported guitar controller.</p><p>The new update v30.00 arrives today.</p>

            <p>
GTA 5 will no longer be part of the PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium games catalogue offering as of the middle of next month, as the countdown continues to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Rockstar's hugely-popular open world is now listed among the games labelled as being your "Last chance to play", visible from your PlayStation console.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has spotted a dozen games set to depart the service on 18th June, with other top picks including indie adventure Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons and sci-fi puzzler The Talos Principle. 
</p>
<p>
The full list of games leaving PlayStation Plus Extra/Premium next month are: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons </li>
<li>DC League of Super-Pets: The Adventures of Krypto and Ace</li>
<li>Dodgeball Academia</li>
<li>Grand Theft Auto 5</li>
<li>Indivisible</li>
<li>Monster Jam Steel Titans </li>
<li>MotoGP 23 </li>

<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-5-leads-decembers-playstation-plus-extra-and-premium-catalogue-additions">GTA 5 was only added to the PlayStation Plus Extra/Premium catalogue relatively recently</a> - on 19th December 2023 - so its tenure has lasted just six months. 
</p>
<p>
Its arrival marked a flurry of fresh activity in the decade-old game, as the countdown began to the long, long-awaited arrival of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-6-coming-in-fall-2025-publisher-take-two-reveals">GTA 6 - now set to launch in autumn 2025</a>. None of this has stopped GTA 5 from continuing to shift yet more copies, of course - it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-5-sales-have-topped-a-staggering-200m">now passed another staggering sales milestone</a>.

"Publishers shouldn't be judged by their biggest hit. In the end, I think the best way to judge a publisher is by the spread of all of their games.

But not the mean, because the average can always be dragged up by those big hits–but the median is telling.

How they support those developers and whether they stand by them."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bender explains devs should also be wary of publishers "operating in a predatory or opportunistic way," especially in the world of indie publishing. How can you identify those bad actors? He says one warning sign to look out for is publishers that essentially fire from the hip.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"You know, [there are publishers that will] sign five games. Four will flop. One will succeed. And they forget about the flops and put all of their efforts into the one that's perceived as having the highest ROI," continues Bender.

Tim Bender, co-founder and CEO of Manor Lords publisher Hooded Horse, believes it's important to avoid becoming wrapped up in another company's success. Instead, look at how publishers treat those project and studios that perhaps underperformed. It's pretty bold advice coming from Bender, whose own company recently found meteoric success with Manor Lords. The strategic medieval city builder amassed over 3.2 million Steam wishlists and topped 1 million sales in rapid time under the stewardship of Hooded Horse, but Bender emphasised that project is a clear outlier.

It's also possible to browse a company's entire portfolio, highlighting the entire breadth of performances from top to bottom.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bender claims the site is "so accurate," which is a rather compelling testimonial given he's well placed to compare Gamalytic's estimates with, say, Hooded Horse's actual numbers. He concedes it still occasionally gets some things wrong, but says the figures it throws out are "pretty damn impressive." Gamalytic itself claims 77 percent of its estimates are within 30 percent margin of error, while 98 percent are within 50 percent margin of error. "At an aggregate level, estimates were 99 percent accurate," adds the site.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When analysing those figures, Bender says developers need to look for signs of "consistent performance."

		<p>I’ve found a renewed love for Overwatch 2 this week, and as such I’ve been spending more time than is healthy in competitive matchmaking. What it has taught me is that if someone else plays as Moira I don’t really know how to play any other support characters. Then everything goes to hell. Still, I’ve mostly been having fun. Other than that, I’ve been playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/21/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-review/">Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II</a> for review, and dipping into <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/20/the-arrival-of-monster-hunter-stories-on-playstation-and-pc-finally-puts-the-series-in-one-place/">Monster Hunter Stories 1+2</a> as well.</p>
<p>Firstly, this week is a big one for one of our News Editors, <strong>Aran</strong>, as he is getting married tomorrow! Huge congratulations, and we wish you all the best on your special day from all of us at TSA!</p>

<p><strong>Jim</strong> is not getting married, instead deciding to wrap up the Thieves Guild quests in Skyrim and turning his sights towards The Dark Brotherhood. He says, “I’ve thoroughly enjoyed my return to The Elder Scrolls series and now have a deep longing to play Oblivion.” He continued, “While I would say that starting another open-world game would be foolish, that’s exactly what I’ve done with Death Stranding. Having abandoned it soon after launch, I felt like I jumped off just before things we’re about to get good. In some ways that’s true – I’ve now surpassed where I was on my original playthrough, and have access to progression unlocks that make the game less of a chore, no doubt bolstered by some post-launch content and QoL improvements. With a sequel on the way, I’m definitely going to stick with it, even if I’m also juggling Ghost of Tsushima which – I’m happy to report – plays nicely on Steam Deck.”</p>
<p><strong>Ade</strong> has played <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/23/crown-wars-the-black-prince-review/">Crown Wars: The Black Prince for review,</a> and you can check out his thoughts right now! Otherwise, he’s been maintaining his pirate empire in Skull of Bones. He tells us, “Gotta say, I’m still thoroughly enjoying the game and am genuinely excited for Season 2 dropping next week! Oh, and I’ve been playing some Star Wars: Jedi Survivor, fantastic blockbuster action game, if that’s your kind of thing the game does not disappoint!”</p>


<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> has played Capes, an XCOM style superhero game, as well as Diablo IV, and Baldur’s Gate 3. Meanwhile, <strong>Nick P</strong> has seemingly played a bit of everything. Stellar Blade, Helldivers 2, Dead by Daylight, Street Fighter 6 and Killer Klowns from Outer Space for review next week.</p>
<p>Rounding things out for the week, <strong>Tef</strong> polished off a review of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/21/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-switch-review/">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a>, loving the ability to play the GameCube classic on Switch, and that’s before the lovely makeover in a new engine. He also hopped into some matches of Killer Klowns with Nick and Steve to help fill out the server.</p>
<p>What about you? What have you played?</p>

            <p>
The developer of MultiVersus has gone "above and beyond" to ensure the game is protected from dataminers.
</p>
<p>
The free-to-play fighter is out next week and includes villains like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/multiversus-files-point-to-mark-hamill-as-the-joker">The Joker</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fans-think-the-matrix-is-coming-to-multiversus">Agent Smith from The Matrix</a>, both of which were rumoured long before their reveals.
</p>
<p>
Now, it seems the developer has put stronger defences in place to protect the game from future dataminers, though there's no guarantee there won't be further leaks.

<p>
MultiVersus director Tony Huynh told <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/multiversus-director-says-dataminers-do-a-disservice-to-the-players/">VGC</a> that datamining is a "disservice to the players" as they "don't get the grand reveal that we have planned".
</p>
<p>
"It is an arms race, so it'll be constant protections against new and creative ways to datamine," said Huynh. "At the end of the day, we've done a lot, we've learned a lot, but again, it is an arms race.
</p>
<p>
"I can't promise that there won't ever be leaks or anything like that. But on our end, we've done, I think, above and beyond what industry standards and protections there are.
</p>
<p>
"That being said, everyone's very creative and they're... they're just very, very smart. We're reacting, and we put a lot of stuff in place, but I'm just continuously impressed by their level of ability to get through things."
</p>
<p>
He continued: "I think it's a disservice to the players, honestly, that these things are ruined, and it's deflating for the team as well.
</p>
<p>
"But more importantly, it's - I wouldn't use the word 'depressing' - it's just unfortunate for the players. They don't get the grand reveal that we have planned, and a lot of the air is sucked out of the room."
</p>
<p>
MultiVersus held an open beta last year, which then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/multiversus-to-shut-down-until-2024-with-no-refunds-for-paying-players">closed ahead of a full release</a>. That's happening next week across PC (Steam and Epic), PlayStation 5, PS4, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S, with cross-platform and cross-progression play.

</p>
<p>
Ahead of the release, developer Player First Games has detailed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/returning-multiversus-beta-players-will-receive-free-premium-battle-pass">season one premium battle pass</a>, which will be available for free for players returning from the beta. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/multiversus-adds-the-matrixs-agent-smith-jason-voorhees">Jason Voorhees from Friday the 13th</a> is the main draw.

			<p>The <a href="https://roguetrader.owlcat.games/">Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader</a> DLC expansion called Void Shadows is launching this August, introducing 15 hours of new content to the massive cRPG developed by Owlcat Games.</p>
<p>The Void Shadows expansion, which launches on August 8th, will allow players to delve into the depths of their voidship to fight a new enemy that is trying to bring down the von Valacious dynasty from the inside. The expansion will add two new archetypes with unique abilities, new lore content, a new companion, the Death Cult Assassin Kibellah, new crew members, new locations, and more. All the content will be seamlessly integrated into the main campaign, so it will be possible to bring the new companion along in base campaign's quests and use the new archetypes freely.</p>

<p>Even with the Void Shadows DLC expansion, Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader is a massive cRPG filled to the brim with content. While prior knowledge of the Warhammer 40,000 universe makes it more enjoyable, the game does its best to introduce newcomers to the universe created by Games Workshop, although a lack of innovation and some frustrating mechanics do hold the experience back a bit, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader-charting-a-new-course/">review</a>.</p>
<p><em>With the great amount of love for the setting that was poured into the game evident from every line of dialogue and every little detail, Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader is one of the best games based on the universe created by Games Workshop, and a solid tactical turn-based role-playing game that can provide hundreds of hours of fun. However, while the lack of innovation isn't a major setback thanks to its high-quality campaign, the presence of bugs and frustrating mechanics prevents it from being a must-have for all RPG enthusiasts, limiting its appeal beyond Warhammer 40,000 and Owlcat Games fans.</em></p>
<p>Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

			<p><span>A gallery of weathered posters from the start of Death of the Outsider.</span></p>
		</div><div>
		<p><em>Following a devastating winter and spring for the games industry, and a lot of dismal rhetoric from publishers and platform holders, Rob and Patrick try and reckon with what the future holds for the kinds of games and experiences they have always loved... and maybe the entire concept of commercial art.</em></p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> Hey Rob, earlier this week I finally put the finishing touches <a href="https://remapradio.com/other/i-burned-myself-out-playing-a-game-i-love/" rel="noreferrer">on Final <em>Fantasy VII: Rebirth</em></a>, the second installment in a trilogy (!!) of remakes/sequels to a video game from 1997. It’s been 27 years since I played that original game. So much has happened since then in my life, not the least of which includes the death of my father and the birth of my two children. I’m nearly 40, but still don’t have gray hair. The video game industry has also changed radically, too, with different power brokers entering and leaving, and the form of the devices we play on undergoing radical shifts along the way. But for all that supposed change, nearly 30 years later, I’m still playing a story about a guy named Cloud and a girl named Aeris—sorry, <em>Aerith</em>—and it makes me wonder: how often do radical shifts end up feeling less radical with some distance?</p><p>I say this because on a recent podcast, we collectively wondered whether some of the games we like to play are going away. Thousands have been laid off and dozens of studios shuttered. There are unknowable numbers of games that you and I probably would have loved that we’ll never actually play, because their developers will never get a chance to ship them. What the industry is going through at the moment is, undeniably, <em>change</em>. I just don’t know what’s on the other end of it, and for as rocky as it feels, isn’t there a good chance it looks remarkably similar?</p><p>Who’s going to make the next immersive sim? Arkane Austin isn’t going to make another <em>Prey</em>, but this year, we were also treated to a loving <em>System Shock</em> remake. <em><u>Deathloop</u></em> wasn’t that long ago, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/indie-gaming-is-on-the-verge-of-an-immersive-sim-eruption?ref=remapradio.com"><u>and indies have taken up the design torch with gusto</u></a>. It feels like we’ve poured one out for the immersive sim at least a dozen times, during the eras of Waypoint and Remap.</p><p>Inevitably, are we collectively playing out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjKZzKLpNII&amp;ref=remapradio.com"><u>“that gum you like is going to come back in style”?</u></a></p><p>There <a href="https://kotaku.com/old-games-2023-playtime-data-fortnite-roblox-minecraft-1851382474?ref=remapradio.com"><u>was an interesting data point going around recently</u></a> about how the most played video games in 2023 were, broadly, old. Games like <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Minecraft</em>, <em>Roblox</em>, <em>League of Legends</em>, and others dominated, with precious few “new” games managing to sneak in. Strange days, surely, but if <em>Fortnite</em> is the avenue for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/23/24137577/fortnite-festival-rock-band-4-controllers?ref=remapradio.com"><u>a <em>Rock Band </em>resurrection</u></a>, praise be. But it’s also incredibly scary if you’re a player of a certain age, because you can easily look at that data and tell yourself a story that ostracizes your interests with a few more demographic shifts.</p><p>I don’t know what to make of it. I also can’t help but wonder if, 10 years on, it’ll look shockingly similar to right now, just as Square Enix begins to roll out its three-part <em>Chrono Trigger</em> remake, and we’re watching someone present their new take on a game directly inspired by <em>Dishonored</em>.</p><p>So I put the question to you: how do you feel you, and the games you play, fit in this landscape?</p><hr><figure><figcaption><span>The December 1995 issue of Computer Gaming World, back when the Wing Commander Franchise commanded some of the biggest budgets in games.</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Rob: </strong>On the one hand, I think you are right that the future will look an awful lot like the present: an industry that is declining and stagnating, yet managing to bring forth flourishing crops of great games. On the other hand, the cycle of boom and bust can still have an overarching trend, the same way you can still get bitterly cold winters against a backdrop of global heating. I think that barring some major, transformative changes to business models, the future of the games industry will almost certainly be&nbsp; less interesting, less original, and less sustainable than it was in the past. It will also keep finding ways to produce the kind of stuff we’re worried will go away.</p><p>I bring this up a lot, but developer Greg Costikyan gave two famous GDC rants a decade apart, each producing impending doom for the industry. The 2004 speech is <a href="https://boingboing.net/2005/03/11/game-developers-amaz.html?ref=remapradio.com"><u>absolutely scorched earth</u></a>: at one point he said, “Iwata-san has the heart of a gamer, and my question is what poor bastard's chest did he carve it from?” This speech doesn’t think there’s such a thing as a “good suit”, putting it at odds with a decade of deferential and even fawning treatment of industry leaders from players and parts of the press.</p><p>But here’s the real crux of his argument:</p><blockquote>Who was at the Microsoft keynote? I don't know about you but it made my flesh crawl. The HD era? Bigger, louder? Big bucks to be made! Well not by you and me of course. Those budgets and teams ensure the death of innovation.</blockquote><blockquote>…My friends, we are <em>fucked</em>. We are well and truly fucked. The bar in terms of graphics and glitz has been raised and raised until we can't afford to do anything at all. 80 hour weeks until our jobs are all outsourced to Asia. But it's ok because the HD era is here right? I say, enough. The time has come for revolution! It may seem to you that what I describe is inevitable forces of history, but no, we have free will! EA could have chosen to focus on innovation, but they did not. Nintendo could make development kits cheaply available to small firms, but they prefer to rely on the creativity of one aging designer. You have choices, too: work in a massive sweatshop publisher-run studio with thousands of others making the next racing game with the same gameplay as Pole Position. Or you can riot in the streets of Redwood City! Choose another business model, development path, and you can choose to remember why you love games and make sure in a generation's time there are still games to love.</blockquote><p>Electrifying stuff! And you read it and there’s a lot here that he was right about… but then you think about how much amazing stuff came out between this rant and his next one in 2014 where he revisited these themes. </p><p>People who believe strongly in the inherent wisdom of markets and their power to give people what they want, and who see that forces of progress (technical or otherwise) often open up opportunities and innovation in seemingly moribund fields, will see these discrepancies and argue that the doomsayers were wrong. The world didn’t end, it got better!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/naughty-dog-boss-neil-druckmann-says-ai-will-revolutionize-how-content-is-being-created<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">But it brings up "ethical issues we need to address."</h2></div><section><p>Naughty Dog boss Neil Druckmann has said AI will "revolutionize" video game development process, but cautioned that the controversial technology has “ethical issues.”</p><p>Druckmann, Studio Head and Head of Creative at The Last of Us and Uncharted developer Naughty Dog, issued the comment as part of a <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/creative-entertainment-vision/interview/2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sony-published interview</a> on the company’s ‘Creative Entertainment Vision.’ Druckmann was asked how he envisions the “fusion of storytelling and technology evolving over the next 10 years” as part of a Sony series that also revealed <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-might-a-playstation-controller-look-like-10-years-from-now-sony-has-an-idea">an idea for a futuristic PlayStation controller</a>.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/24/the-last-of-us-1716544738405.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The Last of Us Part I. Image credit: Sony Interactive Entertainment.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Here’s Druckmann’s response in full:</p><blockquote>We're seeing this exciting marriage of cutting-edge technology with traditional storytelling that's pushing us into a future where enhanced fidelity isn't just about achieving realism, but about broadening the spectrum from highly stylized visuals to ultra-realistic ones. This broadening of possibilities is fueled by increasingly accessible tools that allow even non-technical people to use their imagination and create worlds and narratives to their heart's content.</blockquote><blockquote>Moreover, AI is really going to revolutionize how content is being created, although it does bring up some ethical issues we need to address. With technologies like AI and the ability to do motion capture right from home, we're reducing both costs and technical hurdles, opening the door for us to take on more adventurous projects and push the boundaries of storytelling in games. This evolution is truly empowering creators to bring their visions to life without the traditional obstacles.</blockquote><p>Later in the interview Druckmann said AI will let Naughty Dog "create nuanced dialogues and characters, expanding creative possibilities," but insisted it was "crucial to precisely direct these tools to achieve the intended outcomes."</p><p>"I emphasize mastering fundamentals over tools; with AI, your creativity sets the limits," Druckmann said. "Understanding art history, composition, and storytelling is essential for effective direction. Tools evolve quickly — some tools once essential, now are obsolete. At Naughty Dog, we transitioned from hand-animating 'Jak and Daxter' to using motion capture in 'Uncharted', significantly enhancing our storytelling. AI will allow us to create nuanced dialogues and characters, expanding creative possibilities.

            <p>
The developer behind new gacha adventure <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wuthering-waves-tier-list-best-characters-9436">Wuthering Waves</a> has apologised for the number of bugs and lag issues at launch.
</p>
<p>
The game launched worldwide yesterday (UK time) but has already seen multiple hotfixes, the latest of which forced an uninstall and reinstall of the game, Eurogamer can confirm.
</p>
<p>
An English post on X from Chinese developer Kuro Games has acknowledged the situation and promised players compensation of ten Lustrous Tides - essentially gacha pulls for new characters and weapons. Further, a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WutheringWaves/comments/1cz0ua9/wuwa_dev_apology/">BiliBili post in Chinese</a> includes a fully apology.

"We have identified some issues that have impacted your gaming experience and are now actively working on solutions," wrote the developer. "We are committed to constant self-reflection and improvement, with your satisfaction as our top priority. We are incredibly grateful for your understanding and patience during our recent technical issues."

Further, a <a href="https://wutheringwaves.kurogames.com/en/main/news/detail/777">news post on the game's website</a> details a list of known issues. That includes a login timeout issue that's supposedly been fixed, issues of age authentication in certain areas, and needing to repeatedly log in when the game client is relaunched on PC.

</p>
<p>
The post also acknowledges localisation quality and performance issues. "We have received feedback regarding the localisation quality of the game," it reads. "Ensuring high-quality localisation has always been a priority for us, and we are fully committed to improving it. Currently, our team is endeavouring to continuously rectify and optimise the localised texts to provide an enjoyable experience for Rovers everywhere. Fixes to some of the known issues with the current localised texts will be included in the patches to be released soon."
</p>
<p>
It continues: "Please rest assured that we are dedicated to providing the best possible experience for our players, and we take performance concerns seriously. In future updates, we will continue to optimise the game's performance to improve your gaming experience."
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, fans have been sharing posts on the game's subreddit to show the current state of the game, including the below lag issues.

            <p>Activision have celebrated my birthday in the traditional manner by announcing a new Call Of Duty game. Said Call Of Duty game is Black Ops 6, "a dark new chapter" in the Treyarch-helmed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> sub-series which is known for seedier and weirder, alt-historical or post-future stories featuring hallucinations and cybernetics and catchy period music.</p> <!--more-->
<p>What do we know right now about Black Ops 6? Friend, right now I can tell you little other than that the logo art appears to feature a wolf wearing the Capitol building as a hat. Please let this not be my weary end-of-week projection. Please let this be evidence that Black Ops 6's major antagonist (or protagonist?) is a wolf so vast it is obliged to clothe itself in major US landmarks. Perhaps it could wear the Pentagon as a diaper? Ho ho ho I slay myself. Please let this be evidence that Black Ops 6 is secretly a Bayonetta game. Hitting a giga-wolf over the noggin with the Capitol building is absolutely a thing Bayonetta would do. You can keep your silly tactical nukes, Mason.</p>
 <p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>2024's Call Of Duty will get <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-2024-and-gears-6-to-get-june-reveal-alongside-avowed-and-indiana-jones-release-dates-claims-report">a proper reveal at Summer Games Fest</a>, and is the subject of many a rumour. For example, the game will reportedly be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-next-call-of-duty-will-launch-on-game-pass-on-day-one-reports-say">the first Call Of Duty to launch on Game Pass</a>, which one former Microsoft employee has described as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/game-passs-only-outside-shot-for-sustainability-is-to-get-gta-6-or-call-of-duty-says-former-microsoft-senior-pr-lead">essential</a> if the subscription service is to do numbers of sufficient magnitude to offset Microsoft's recent billion-dollar inhalation of Activision-Blizzard. It's also rumoured to be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-next-call-of-duty-is-a-black-ops-game-set-during-the-first-gulf-war-according-to-reports">set during the events of the first Gulf War</a>.</p>
<p>Inasmuch as I have emotions about Call Of Duty these days, Black Ops is the aspect of the FPS juggernaut I have the greatest fondness for. It's as basically batshit and half-cocked in its representation of war and history as the Modern Warfare series, but Black Ops at least has the courtesy to be openly batshit and half-cocked rather than making reference to authenticity and fidelity. A giga-wolf would fit in perfectly here, Activision. Make it so. Come on, it's my birthday.</p>

            <p>The Asus ROG Ally X, a sort of semi-sequel to last year’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/asus-rog-ally-review-a-nifty-handheld-pc-with-the-best-and-worst-of-windows">ROG Ally</a> handheld PC, has had its specs spilled over at <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/asus-rog-ally-x-specs-leaked-24gb-lpddr5x-7500-memory-and-massive-80-wh-battery">Videocardz</a>. I’m usually a lot more suspicious of hardware leaks, which are often just out-of-date or otherwise inaccurate info, but I’ve also sat through enough mic-muted prebriefings to know an official slideshow when I see one, and that appears to be exactly what Videocardz got its hands on. Besides, these specs include a gigantic 80Whr battery upgrade (doubling the ROG Ally’s 40Whr capacity), so we can at least file this under "News James <em>wants</em> to be true."</p>

<p>It's not as wide-ranging a refresh as the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-oled-review">Steam Deck OLED</a> was to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a>, as the ROG Ally X will apparently keep the same Ryzen Z1 Extreme APU that powered the original model. The display also appears unchanged, sticking with a 7in, 1920x1080 IPS panel with 500cd/m2 peak brightness. But that new battery could be a major improvement, given how quickly the ROG Ally runs out of juice (and how unbefitting that lack of stamina is for a portable device).</p>
<p>The leak also lists a RAM upgrade to 24GB of LPDDR5, running at 7500MHz. Ye olde ROG Ally was no memory slouch, packing 16GB of LPDDR5 at 6400MHz, but that extra capacity and bandwidth might well produce performance upgrades; remember that with an all-in-one APU, memory is shared among the central processor and the GPU, so the latter is getting an indirect power boost.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-microsd-cards-for-steam-deck">microSD card</a> slot has also been moved away from the lower air vent, hopefully avoiding further cases of overheating that ROG Ally owners have occasionally grappled with. The more surprising storage change, though, is the listed support for M.2 2280 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-ssd-for-gaming">SSDs</a> – the same kind you likely have in your desktop PC, rather the smaller, more expensive, less widely available <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-install-ssd-steam-deck">M.2 2230 drives</a> currently used by the ROG Ally and Steam Deck.</p>

</figure>
<p>All this added bigness has, inevitably, forced an increase in the ROG Ally X’s proportions. It will weigh 678g (up from 608g; the Steam Deck OLED weighs 640g) and measure 36.9mm across, so it’s gained 4.5mm of thickness. That’s still not as chunky as the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lenovo-legion-go-review">Lenovo Legion Go</a>, mind. Or as weighty.</p>
<p>Expect confirmation of the ROG Ally X’s specs and pricing at Computex, Taiwan’s computing-focused tech trade show of renown, on June 2nd. Word is it will release the same month, too.</p>
<p>I like the sound of all these changes, at least for a refresh – <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-vs-asus-rog-ally">battery chugging</a> was one of the original ROG Ally’s two biggest issues, and while I’m a Steam Deck OLED convert these days, there was nothing about the ROG Ally’s display or performance that seemed in drastic need of upgrades. It was also slim and light enough that the new design’s modest bulk additions surely can’t spoil it.</p>
<p>That said, its <em>second</em> biggest issue was the fiddliness of using Windows 11 on a small screen with no onboard trackpads, and for all of SteamOS’s occasional <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wuthering-waves-really-really-doesnt-want-to-run-on-steam-deck">compatibility headaches</a>, it’s still just a much more welcoming software experience than what the ROG Ally has ever offered. Asus actually have confirmed a new replacement for the Ally’s games launcher app, ROG Pulse (formerly Armory Crate), but I’m still waiting to be convinced that this and/or the ROG Ally X itself will fully address the underlying mismatch between OS and hardware.</p>
