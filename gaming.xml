<p>As shared on the official <a href="https://x.com/KirbyAirRiders" tabindex="-1">@KirbyAirRiders</a> X account, Sakurai has provided a course overview for the steampunk-inspired 'Steamgust Forge' track, and he does so by, you guessed it, demolishing the hardest CPU opponents in a race.</p>
<p>Similar to the Waveflow Waters demonstration from the <em><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/kirby-air-riders-direct-every-announcement-how-would-you-rate-it">first</a></em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/kirby-air-riders-direct-every-announcement-how-would-you-rate-it">Air Riders Direct</a>, this whistle-stop tour of the steampunk environment showcases the tight turns and chaotic combat you'll have to contend with. It's also another chance to wrap your head around just how <em>fast</em> everything is — Mario Kart this ain't.</p><div><figure data-videoid="WA6pqBIEskk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4035aelukwgx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

<p>This isn't the first overview that Sakurai has provided since the last Direct — earlier this month, he raced around the autumnal '<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzMXDirLNZw">Mount Amberfalls</a>' circuit — but it's funny to see him still revealing new information despite there being a 60-minute presentation right around the corner. Oh Sakurai, never change!</p>
<p>The Direct itself kicks off tomorrow at 2pm BST / 3pm CET / 6am PT / 9am ET. As for what will be shown, your guess is as good as ours! Bring on more course overviews, we suppose...</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-tops-us-sales-charts-ghost-of-yotei-matched-tsushima-covid-era-numbers/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/borderlands-4-tops-the-us-sales-charts-for-september-2025-and-ghost-of-yotei-matched-tsushima%E2%80%99s-covid-era-numbers.1331734/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Circana analyst and senior director Mat Piscatella has reported the latest sales charts for video game sales in the United States for the month of September 2025, and it's a sports-games-focused top five with a mix of shooting and some sword slashing, as Borderlands 4 lands in the number one spot, Ghost of Yotei cracks the top five at the number four spot, and the latest annualized sports titles making up the rest of the top five.</p>



<p>As Piscatella does each month, he shared the charts for the best-selling premium games of the previous month and how they factor into the best-selling premium games of 2025 so far in the US. With Borderlands 3 shooting to the top of the sales charts for the month of September 2025, it also did well enough to become the third-best-selling premium game in the US in 2025 so far with Monster Hunter Wilds in second and NBA 2K26 in first ahead of it.</p>



<p>NBA 2K26, for its part, was one of the annualized sports games that filled out the rest of the top five best-selling premium games for September. It landed just behind Borderlands 4 in the number two spot, while EA Sports FC 26 came in at number three, followed by Ghost of Yotei, with Madden NFL 26 rounding out the top five in fifth.</p>







<p>Even though Ghost of Yotei didn't make the top three for best-selling premium games, it's worth noting that it made the top five even without being in players' hands, since it officially launched on October 2. Piscatella also points out that Yotei's numbers were "<em>flat</em>" in comparison to Ghost of Tsushima. </p>



<p>That might not sound like a positive takeaway, but when you remember that at the time of Tsushima's launch on July 17, 2020, much of the world was under COVID-19 lockdowns, with the video game industry enjoying a massive boom with everyone spending all their time inside, many not fully back to work as companies across the globe adjusted to the pandemic, it's clearly a sign of how strong Yotei's performance was.</p>







<p>Ghost of Yotei also cracked the charts for the best-selling premium games in the US for 2025 so far at number 18. Overall, for a console-exclusive title, there's no denying that Ghost of Yotei is off to a strong sales start.</p>



<p>On the hardware side of things, the Nintendo Switch 2 was once again the best-selling console of the month in the US, followed by the PlayStation 5. The PS5 also hit a milestone in September, as it officially surpassed the lifetime install base of the PlayStation 3.</p>



<p>Overall, September was a strong sales month for the video game industry in the US, as Piscatella reports the total spend across hardware, software, and accessories grew 10% compared to last year. It'll be interesting to see how October's charts line up, with Yotei having a full month on shelves and the arrival of <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-1-hands-on-preview/">Battlefield 6</a>.</p>



<p>For more on Ghost of Yotei, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghost-of-yotei-exploring-the-price-of-vengeance-in-17th-century-ezo/">check out our full review</a> where Wccftech's Alessio Palumbo gave it an 8.8/10, saying, "<em>Ghost of Yōtei is a worthy sequel to the already excellent Ghost of Tsushima, building upon that game's foundation with an equally interesting (albeit quite different) plot and select improvements to combat and open world exploration. It may feel a little too familiar, not to mention similar to the previous game, but that sensation is quickly forgotten amidst all the fun you'll have in Ezo</em>."</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pokemon-legends-za-review-a-mega-adventure.1331731/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>While the <em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="8e948d2c-e718-4b87-9a04-0d0bc246614c" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/pokemon-legends-z-preview-another-reason-to-get-switch-2" rel="nofollow">Pokémon </a></em>formula has been slow-moving over the years, with <em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ab965b69-179c-4525-9aa0-c19799509f61" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/pokemon-legends-arceus" rel="nofollow">Pokémon Legends Arceus</a></em>, a big change was made in exploration and story format. The release of <em>Pokémon Legends ZA</em> makes some steps even further from the formula, but also many closer. Do these differences make it a better <em>Pokémon </em>game, or something harder to recognize?</p>

<p><em>Pokémon Legends ZA</em> is set in the town of Lumiose City, which was a central setpiece for the events of <em>Pokémon X and Y</em> for the Nintendo 3DS, and now is the sole location for your <em>Legends ZA</em> adventure. You play as a newcomer, visiting Lumiose City for a holiday before you get wrapped up in taking part in a city-wide night-time battle tournament called the Z-A Royale, investigating mysterious Rogue Mega Evolution events, and exploring the city.</p>

<h2>Revisit Kalos And Become A Pokémon Master</h2>

<p>The start of the story is strong, introducing you to the primary cast of characters while also teaching you about the Pokémon-inhabited Wild Zones of the city. You'll meet characters like your rival Taunie/Urbain, fellow members of Team MZ, Naveen and Lida, and AZ, the mysterious hotel keeper, as well as some major players in the city, like Emma the detective.</p>

<p>There isn't any level of collecting badges; instead, your simple goal is to join a battle royal event called the Z-A Royal and work your way from Rank Z to Rank A (as the name implies). As you progress through the game, you're also introduced to the mystery of mega energy seeping out all over Lumiose City, which has been leading certain Pokémon to go rogue, leaving people in danger. This drive to become stronger, as well as the mystery of the rogue Mega Evolution, is the core thread that will pull you through the game.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-legends-za-review-exploration_0.jpg?itok=DbckCvYg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-legends-za-review-exploration_0.jpg?itok=XqEYkzhA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>While the story is very much present, it also gives plenty of breathing room. Your next objective might be to reach a new rank or to take out a rampaging Rogue Mega Pokémon. You can reach these objectives quite easily, but it's in the amount of exploration that can be done and side-quests to accomplish that you'll find yourself stopping to smell the roses and take in everything that the game has to offer.</p>

<p>Something I really enjoyed about the story of <em>Legends ZA</em> compared to other, more traditional, titles in the <em>Pokemon </em>franchise is that it wasn't that you got to spend 50-60% of the game completing your main objective of badges/Z-A Royale, then get an interlude story where the evil team tries to take over the world, and then back to completing your goal of being the very best, like no one ever was. Instead, the story is constantly being woven in and out of the Z-A Royale storyline, culminating in what might be one of <em>Pokémon</em>'s most impressive finale setpieces.</p>

<p>The story did a great job highlighting not just the protagonist's ability to be the greatest Pokémon trainer, but also managed to create a group that actually felt like they were friends with each other and not just the main character, and fill the city with a unique and colorful supporting cast of characters.</p>

<h2>A New Way To Battle</h2>

<p>One of the largest changes to the Pokémon formula is in the new active battles. Instead of a static turn-based experience, the combat in <em>Pokémon Legends ZA</em> lets you roam around with your Pokémon to your side, calling out attacks for it to you as it maneuvers into place, trying to hit your opponent while not getting hit yourself.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-legends-za-review-combat.jpg?itok=Ha0RsYOs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-legends-za-review-combat.jpg?itok=2PpkrCj_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>I am a huge fan of this gameplay style, possibly because it's the closest I'll ever expect we get to an anime-style Pokémon battle, but also because at its core it's not too different from classic Pokémon battling, and there's plenty of room to grow.</p>

<p>If you want, you can send out your Pokémon, and you and your opponent can stand statically, hitting each other until one of you faints. There are a number of things you can factor into your strategy that will allow you to deal more damage faster, or even avoid damage in certain scenarios.</p>

<p>Speed and range of attacks are far more important in <em>Pokémon Legends ZA</em>, as with the right loadout, you can get 2-3 attacks in while your opponent is still queuing up their second attack. Each move will have the Pokémon move to a specific spot or within close range. This means there's a new level of strategy to how you want to respond to your opponents' attacks, too.</p>

<p>When an enemy uses Fly, you can begin to move, and with enough skill, might avoid your opponent crashing down. Similarly, for massive attacks like Hyper Beam, you could find a way to avoid it by strafing or even putting the environment between yourself and the attacks. I loved learning the different ways I could fight with my Pokémon, how to best chain attacks into each other, and what type advantages I could come up with on the fly.</p>

<p>In Ranked Play, this causes the 4-player free-for-all battles to be truly chaotic. Moving from lobby to lobby, your team of three might be perfectly set up to sweep the enemy, or you could truly be out of luck as you get countered by something super-effective to you at every turn. There's nothing more satisfying than sniping an enemy's kill with a long-range flamethrower, and alternatively, there's nothing worse than being so close to the kill and having it stolen away.</p>

<p>I don't expect this combat to replace the classic formula, or even have anywhere near as much popularity, but as someone who never got into the competitive side of Pokémon, I was excited to Hyper Train some Pokémon to compete in Ranked Play.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-legends-za-review-rogue-mega-battle.jpg?itok=uhmoglb5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-legends-za-review-rogue-mega-battle.jpg?itok=4bd0TH_A 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Bullet (Seed) Hell</h2>

<p>The best use of the active combat is in the Raid-like Rogue Mega Evolution battles, where you need to fight an enraged Mega Pokémon. For these battles, you're paired with one of your story companions and end up on a battlefield to take on this gargantuan Pokémon.</p>

<p>The basic formula of the battle is to deal super-effective damage to the Mega Pokémon, siphon off some Mega Energy in the shape of dropped orbs, and then Mega Evolve your own Pokémon to deal as much damage as possible until they revert. While you're doing this, you'll also need to be dodging the Pokémon's attacks.</p>

<p>This Rogue Mega Pokémon doesn't just attack your Pokémon, but also focuses on the player. You'll be running, dodge rolling, and even recalling your Pokémon to keep them out of harm's way during battles.</p>

<p>Some of these Pokémon set off incredible effects like tornadoes that follow you around the stage, violent rocky shockwaves, and a classic massive beam of energy that follows you as you run from it.</p>

<p>The biggest downside of these Rogue Mega Encounters for me was that while they're repeatable, there was no way to enjoy them with a friend. As the Pokémon franchise has promoted Max Raids and Tera Raids, I was disappointed to learn that there wasn't any way to pair up with even a single friend and take on these gargantuan foes together, especially when there's already local battle multiplayer.</p>

<h2>The City Is Alive</h2>

<p>It's clear that <em>Pokémon </em>has taken inspiration from other recent Nintendo successes like <em>Breath of the Wild,&nbsp;</em>where, after completing the tutorial, the whole map is open to you. You've got a variety of Pokémon-filled areas to explore, as well as a multitude of side quests to immediately involve yourself even further with the city.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-legends-za-review-veritcality.jpg?itok=qwS9uaAL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-legends-za-review-veritcality.jpg?itok=XJcouFqN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Even on the ground level, at nearly any point, you can rotate in a complete circle and see one or possibly two Wild Zones, a shop or cafe, wild Pokémon, or an NPC with a side-quest ready to ask of you. This also felt like a lesson learned from <em>Breath of the Wild</em>: the world doesn't have to be the largest, but if you pack it densely, then players won't be able to stop getting sidetracked as they move from main objective to main objective. 99 times out of 100, I'll prefer a smaller but more densely packed world that one that can promise landscapes that you can walk in a straight line for hours in, but there's nothing to see or do.</p>

<p>The way that <em>Pokémon </em>has further enhanced Lumiose City is through the amount of verticality it has. You can walk along all of the main and side streets, discovering little parks or water features along the way, but you can also take to the roofs filled with Pokémon and hidden items. Unlocking elevators to different roofs and traversal options are other perks of progressing through the storyline, letting what seems like a static world at first grow in size while not physically getting larger.</p>

<p>Going into <em>Pokémon Legends ZA</em>, and honestly, even for the first hour or two while the game has you on rails, I was concerned that the map would be too small, and now that I'm 50-60 hours in, I couldn't have been more incorrect, as I keep turning corners and finding new interesting places.</p>

<h2>Side-Quest Variety Impressed</h2>

<p>What fuels a lot of your exploration is the Side-Quests, with around 100 in total for the whole game. Some of these are quite basic, can you battle with me or show me a certain type of Pokémon, while others are side-quests masquerading as tutorials teaching new players about the benefits or drawbacks of poison vs paralysis, or how moves like Protect are helpful.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-legends-za-review-side-quest.jpg?itok=4tWsPg50 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-legends-za-review-side-quest.jpg?itok=yNlAgmfJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>A number of side-quests that long for a lot of games can be a red flag to certain people; the strength of the side-quests in <em>Pokémon Legends ZA </em>comes down to two simple things.</p>

<p>The first is that there was a health variety in the types of things being asked of you. A fair number were battles, which for a <em>Pokémon </em>game didn't even entirely feel like a side-quest, while others would have you collect certain Pokémon, trade Pokémon, search for hidden Pokémon in a museum (one of my favorites), and even chase down fleeing Pokémon.</p>

<p><em>Legends ZA</em> also used side-quests as a way to gift the player with Pokémon such as Froakie, Fennekin, and Chespin in interesting and unusual ways.</p>

<p>The second major strength is that none of these side-missions were very long. Depending on how much time you have to sit down and play, you might be able to complete a night of Z-A Royale, or you might just want to finish 'one more' quest. These quick quests mean there's always just one more little thing for you to do, and then when you realize you still have a bit more time then you can squeeze in another.</p>

<h2><em>Pokémon</em>&nbsp;<em>Legends ZA</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Going into <em>Pokémon Legends ZA </em>I had a lot of fears. How will it run? Is Lumoise City going to feel too small? Will it be able to compare with the epic story of <em>Pokémon Legends Arceus</em>? Will the new combat style be fun?</p>

<p>Thankfully, I was impressed with pretty much every aspect of the game. <em>Pokémon Legends AZ</em> is an incredibly polished game from start to finish with an entertaining story that's fun for newcomers and veterans alike. Lumiose City might not physically expand, but with the introduction of new areas and Wild Zones throughout the story progression, you get to experience it growing as you do.</p>

<p>Best of all, the core mechanic of <em>Pokémon Legends ZA</em>, the new active combat, is incredibly fun. It was such a fun experience taking Pokémon and attacks I knew and seeing them played out in motion instead of stuck in place. It made the combat more engaging and opened up new levels of strategy for a lot of moves that might not otherwise get much love.</p>

<hr><p><em><strong>Pokémon Legends ZA </strong>was reviewed on Nintendo Switch with a copy purchased by the reviewer over the course of 55 hours of gameplay - all screenshots were taken during the process of review.</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-plants-vs-zombies-remaster-is-a-sad-reminder-of-what-could-have-been.1331728/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>It only took a few notes from the <em>Plants vs. Zombies</em> menu music to transport me to a long-forgotten world of sunflowers, pea shooters, and not being able to put the dang game down for one second. First released in 2009, the colorful strategy game was an instant hit, adding to developer PopCap’s enviable lineup of time-wasters like <em>Peggle</em> and <em>Bejeweled</em>. And now it’s been newly remastered so you can relive those days on modern consoles. The updated <em>Plants vs. Zombies</em>, dubbed <em>Replanted</em>, is still a great game that stands the test of time — and it’s also a depressing reminder of just how badly EA fumbled this franchise.</p><p>If you haven’t had the pleasure of fighting off the undead using only a garden full of plants, the premise is relatively simple. The zombies are here, and you need to defend your little slice of home. On the right side of the screen is your house, which you need to protect, and on the left, the undead will shamble in to attack. Between the two is a lawn divided into rows. You fend off these hordes using a green thumb, planting flowers in that lawn that each have a unique ability. The pea shooters… shoot peas, making them the basic turrets of your arsenal. There are stomping squashes and walnuts that form protective barriers, along with explosive cherry bombs. At the core of all of this is the humble sunflower; in order to add new plants, you need to harness the sun, which is generated from those smiling flowers.</p><p><em>PvZ</em> is a serious and deep strategy game masquerading as a Sunday morning cartoon. The complexity steadily ramps up, introducing things like pools and nighttime free of sun that force you to adapt new strategies while continuing to give you more fauna that can be utilized as instruments of destruction. The sheer variety means that there’s a lot of potential for creativity and experimentation. Nearly two decades later, I still get a lot of enjoyment out of placing a man-eating plant behind a walnut, where it can munch on unsuspecting zombies. The whole experience is then slathered with charm, from bouncing, cheerful plant life to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0N1_0SUGlDQ">perhaps the catchiest song in video game history</a>. It was a near-perfect game, and the remaster offers some enhanced visuals, a few new ways to play co-op, and a handful of single-player modes. But not much changed, because it didn’t need to.</p><p>Sounds like the perfect recipe for a beloved series, right? EA seemed to have that exact same thought when it acquired PopCap in 2011. But instead of a proper sequel, the publisher expanded the <em>PvZ</em> brand in other ways. There were Facebook spinoffs and a strange shooter series called <em>Garden Warfare</em>, along with plentiful comic books and other merchandise. <em>Plants vs. Zombies 2</em> did launch in 2013, with a free-to-play mobile iteration that had some interesting ideas but eventually became bogged down by energy timers, microtransactions, and constant updates. It largely played like <em>PvZ</em>, but it lacked the purity of vision that made the original so great. That didn’t matter much to EA, of course, because <em>PvZ 2</em> did numbers, <a href="https://www.ea.com/news/plants-vs-zombies-2-sprouts-big-numbers">reaching a much larger</a> — and more lucrative — audience than its predecessor.</p><p>But something was lost in the search for more players (and money). While the series became financially successful, the creativity that made it so beloved steadily dwindled. The original <em>PvZ</em> was a hand-crafted, carefully tuned experience with a beginning, middle, and end. It’s the kind of game that you want to revisit through a remaster like this because it’s just that good. The sequels and spinoffs, meanwhile, were mostly watered-down versions of this premise that proved much more disposable. It’s not like I’m anticipating playing a remaster of <em>PvZ2</em> in a few years. (A third mainline game is currently in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/17/24042133/ea-plants-vs-zombies-3-soft-launch">soft-launch limbo</a>.)</p><p>It’s a sad state of affairs for a concept that once held such promise. And the fact that I really can’t stop playing the remaster — I’ve whispered<em> just one more round</em> to myself multiple times while writing this — drives that point home further. And things don’t look like they’ll be getting better anytime soon. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/787112/electronic-arts-55-billion-privacte-acquisition-pif-silver-lake-affinity-partners">EA is in the midst of going private in a deal worth $55 billion</a>, which will almost certainly necessitate <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/787723/ea-private-deal-buyout-future-games-layoffs">further layoffs and fewer risks</a>. That means focusing even more on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/795232/ea-battlefield-6-hit-launch-deal">big games with big earning potential</a>, instead of cute games that worm their way into your heart. In that way, this remaster is like a time capsule from a simpler, happier time.</p><p><sub>Plants vs. Zombies: Replanted <em>launches on October 23rd on the Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, and PC.</em></sub></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/803795/plants-vs-zombies-replanted-remaster-switch-pc-ps5-xbox]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Someone over at Game Freak knows the gays are watching. The </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>series has become increasingly inclusive and queer-coded over the years, with this trend most visible in character design. There are a lot of hotties, of course, but there’s also a throughline of queer aesthetics for both trainers and their monsters that has shown up in recent games, especially since the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-fairy-queer-lgbtqia-sylveon-pride-trans-flag-1850577955"><span>Fairy type</span></a><span> was introduced in Generation VI. So I have to believe that someone at Game Freak knew the toxic yuri shippers would latch onto Lebanne and Jacinthe, two of the strongest trainers in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>  <p><span>The player first comes into contact with these two women </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-society-battle-connoisseurs-jacinthe-2000637284"><span>after a run-in</span></a><span> with members of the Society of Battle Connoisseurs, a group of snobby, elite competitive trainers who have never been told “no” in their lives. Jacinthe, </span><i><span>Z-A</span></i><span>’s resident fairy-type expert, is a rich socialite who runs the SBC, and Lebanne is her personal maid. At least, that’s how it appears on the surface. In some of the early interactions with Jacinthe, Lebanne tries to warn the player of what will happen if they cross her. When she does this, her typically calm, collected demeanor changes to one of near-feral panic, but our heroes pay this no mind until it’s too late. After Team MZ blows off a tournament Jacinthe has organized, she traps them in a manufactured battle zone outside their home base and forces you to battle her lackeys, including Lebanne.</span></p>

 <p><span>When the dragon-type trainer finally enters the ring, she lets loose. All her poise goes out the window, and she reveals her true self: an angry, pent-up rage machine who commands some of the most vicious Pokémon in Lumiose City. This all juxtaposed against her keeping the maid outfit on while no longer maintaining the facade of being Jacinthe’s mild-mannered housekeeper. After you take her down, she levels with you. She wasn’t always waiting hand and foot on Jacinthe. Back in the day, Lebanne was a “fighter” who only sought to fight “the strongest opponents” she and her dragon Pokémon could find. But two years ago, Jacinthe’s fairy-type Pokémon “totally annihilated” her, and now she’s subjected to this daily humiliation ritual of pretending to be what Jacinthe wants her to be. It’s toxic as fuck…but the fanfiction writes itself.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">becoming a disposable henchwoman as punishment for losing a single fight,,, multiple years in a humiliating maid outfit; forced to bend to her every whim… overwrought retribution for overconfidence,, im losing my mind….. <a href="https://t.co/dE5RfOXTsk">https://t.co/dE5RfOXTsk</a></p> <p>— Tabitha ✨ (@_kikimari_) <a href="https://twitter.com/_kikimari_/status/1980002971275407548?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Obsessed with these two <a href="https://t.co/zVuq3fK3MF">pic.twitter.com/zVuq3fK3MF</a></p> <p>— Ghost 👻 (@Ghostblobbu) <a href="https://twitter.com/Ghostblobbu/status/1979984586357825627?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Lebanne and Jacinthe yuri</p> <p>pokemon za spoilers this really happens after you beat the game three times blindfolded <a href="https://t.co/jfedPkboRY">pic.twitter.com/jfedPkboRY</a></p> <p>— Percy (@keyblot) <a href="https://twitter.com/keyblot/status/1980298162134003733?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="und" dir="ltr">))))<br> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/pokemonlegendsza?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#pokemonlegendsza</a> <a href="https://t.co/CVSPT2B6Pv">pic.twitter.com/CVSPT2B6Pv</a></p> <p>— Tuif (@Tuiffff) <a href="https://twitter.com/Tuiffff/status/1980719747626070449?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Haven't even played this game but I know yuri when I see it and Jacinthe and Lebanne feel real familiar…<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PokemonLegendsZA?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#PokemonLegendsZA</a> <a href="https://t.co/KsCQ3eUI0H">pic.twitter.com/KsCQ3eUI0H</a></p> <p>— Kori.☾ || Garofano CEO (@Korichi_Celeste) <a href="https://twitter.com/Korichi_Celeste/status/1980446851368473007?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">jacinthe + lebanne <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/pokemonlegendsza?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#pokemonlegendsza</a> <a href="https://t.co/4iwyQ7qaIQ">pic.twitter.com/4iwyQ7qaIQ</a></p> <p>— yawn… (@yawntchi) <a href="https://twitter.com/yawntchi/status/1980932939430125871?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 22, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Doodles of Lesbianne.

            <title><![CDATA[Game Pass Might Be Hitting Its Best 31-Day Stretch Of Releases Ever]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-october-november-2025-powerwash-sim-2-2000638198</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/game-pass-might-be-hitting-its-best-31-day-stretch-of-releases-ever.1331713/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Game Pass’ history is full of peaks and valleys. That’s the nature of a subscription-based service, and also one of the challenges Microsoft has struggled to overcome as it seeks to grow that part of its gaming empire. But right now? October 2025 heading into November 2025? This is arguably the service’s hottest stretch ever. The big question, of course, is whether this will prove to be another anomalous blip in Game Pass’ chaotic and ever pricier trajectory, or a sign Microsoft has finally purchased enough of the wider gaming industry to combat churn and fuel the service for years to come.</p> <p>The month-long period is question began on October 17 with the launch of <em>Keeper</em>, the first new Double Fine game in four years. It’s a beautiful, evocative, and weirdly clever puzzle adventure that echoes back to the Xbox Live Arcade days of <em>Limbo</em> and <em>Fez</em>. It concludes on November 17 with the launch of <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> which is likely to be the antithesis of <em>Keeper</em> in every way, including that it will probably go on to be the best-selling game of 2025.</p>

 <p>Within that 31-day window is a truckload of other day-and-date releases available on Xbox Game Pass Ultimate or its cheaper PC equivalent. Here’s every <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/10/22/xbox-game-pass-october-2025-wave-2/">day-one game</a> coming over the next few weeks:</p> <ul> <li><strong><em>Keeper – </em></strong><em>October 17</em></li> <li><strong><em>Ninja Gaiden 4 </em></strong><em>– October 21</em></li> <li><em><strong>PowerWash Simulator 2 </strong></em>– October 23</li> <li><strong><em>Bounty Star</em></strong><em>– October 23</em></li> <li><strong><em>Super Fantasy Kingdom</em></strong> <em> – </em>October 24</li> <li><strong><em>The Outer Worlds 2</em></strong> – October 29</li> <li><strong><em>Football Manager 26</em></strong> – November 4</li> <li><strong><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em></strong> – November 17</li> </ul> <p>Most of these games haven’t come out yet so I have no idea if they will live up to the hype or actually be good. But many of them are also known quantities. <em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em>? I think I know what to expect. Will any of them be GOTY contenders? Maybe! But I wouldn’t bet my Game Pass allowance on it. They will probably deliver most of what players expect and make up the critical mass of remaining big console releases heading into the holiday.</p>

 <p>Don’t forget, we were also supposed to get <em>Moonlighter&nbsp;2: The Endless Vault</em> on Game Pass this week before it was delayed just out of the 31-day window to November 19 because there were just too many games coming out in October. Look further outside that period and you have great day-one games like <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> and <em>Ball x Pit</em>. Look beyond the day-one criteria and you have the upcoming addition of <em>1000xRESIS</em>T, one of last year’s most mind-bending sci-fi interactive narratives, on November 4.</p>

 <p>Look, if Obsidian somehow totally flubs the quest design and character choices in <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> or the latest <em>Call of Duty</em> single-player campaign crashes and burns, this period probably won’t go down as the strongest stretch in Game Pass’ history. But it’ll still be close. Microsoft usually tries to sprinkle its bigger day-one releases throughout the year. See the staggered cadence of<em>&nbsp;Starfield</em> and <em>Forza Motorsport</em> in 2023 and <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> and <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> in 2024. That’s how you’re supposed to do it anyway. But the first half of 2025 also bucked this trend.</p>

 <p>Maybe the only other single-month stretch of Game Pass that can rival it was back in the spring. The end of April added <em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em> and <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>, followed by <em>Revenge of the Savage Planet</em> and<em> Doom: The Dark Ages</em> in the first half of May. Microsoft brought <em>Grand Theft Auto 5</em> back to Game Pass during that period, too, just for good measure. Will the service stay in this high gear going into 2026 or was Microsoft just shoving a bunch of stuff out the door in advance of the biggest single price hike in subscription gaming history?</p> <p>The company has been claiming for years that it’s finally about to turn the corner on its uneven development timelines and shifting release calendars. Will that change the service’s stalling fortunes or convince console gamers that $360 a year for a buffet of rentals is a price worth paying? Who knows. But it’s probably the best the service has ever been. Maybe as good as it will ever be.</p>

<p>No Man’s Sky has received a new Halloween update called Breach, and it is free for existing players. </p>



<p>The Voyagers update has been big for No Man’s Sky, not only introducing a lot of new things to the game, but also helping the game experience&nbsp;a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/no-mans-sky-enjoys-resurgence-after-anniversary-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">huge resurgence</a> on Steam. The latest Breach update will build towards features introduced in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/no-mans-sky-voyagers-patch-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Voyagers</a>, including ship assembly, space-walking, skydiving, and community spirit. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-new-in-no-man-s-sky-s-breach-update">What’s New in No Man’s Sky’s Breach Update</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>As mentioned above, the Breach Expedition is a Halloween update for No Man’s Sky, making players traverse a desolate and abandoned universe as they explore wrecks of ill-fated corvette ships, which can be scavenged for ship modules that can be added to your ship-building arsenal. These wrecks feature all types of corvette pieces, including rare&nbsp;vertical parts&nbsp;which unlock a whole new range of&nbsp;build configurations.</p>



<p>The Breach update also introduces exclusive expedition rewards, and a set of Atlas-themed modules is among them. As players go on their scavenging spree, they will learn about the fate of the “jewel in the crown of these wreckages”, Fireship Arcadia. On this expedition, players will journey through the “ominous and exotic&nbsp;purple-star solar systems”, first seen in the Worlds Part II update. The expedition is available from today and will last for approximately 3 weeks. </p>



<h2 id="h-all-no-man-s-sky-breach-patch-notes">All No Man’s Sky Breach Patch Notes </h2>



<h3 id="h-space-wreckage">Space Wreckage </h3>



<p>In the far reaches of deep space,&nbsp;wrecked corvettes&nbsp;can now be encountered and salvaged. Step out into&nbsp;zero-gravity&nbsp;to explore these hollow hulks, and&nbsp;equip your Multi-Tool laser&nbsp;to dismantle their valuable modules – then repurpose this scrap to&nbsp;build your dream ship&nbsp;at a Corvette Workshop.</p>



<h3 id="h-new-corvette-modules">New Corvette Modules</h3>



<p>A significant number of new corvette modules are now salvageable from deep-space corvette wrecks and planetary scrapheaps. These include new&nbsp;landing gear,&nbsp;shields,&nbsp;weapons,&nbsp;connectors, and a number of&nbsp;highly-requested wedge-shaped modules&nbsp;that enable a huge variety of creative and complicated corvette builds.</p>



<h3 id="h-quality-of-life">Quality of Life </h3>



<p>In addition to the bundle of fixes, improvements, and new features in today’s update, the No Man’s Sky team have been hard at work on improving Voyagers since its launch in August. Notably,&nbsp;snapping&nbsp;is greatly improved,&nbsp;collision&nbsp;is more robust, and the Corvette Workshop now offers the option to&nbsp;apply a colour palette to an entire corvette. There has never been a better time to build a corvette!</p>



<h3 id="h-breach-expedition-rewards">Breach Expedition Rewards </h3>



<p><strong>Event Horizon, Eternal Serpents, and Siren of the Stars Posters</strong></p>



<p>These decorative posters commemorating the Breach expedition depict a deep-space&nbsp;gravitational anomaly, the&nbsp;tileable eternal serpent of time, and a&nbsp;betentacled siren, poised to begin its mucal embrace…</p>



<p><strong>Aeron Cowling &amp; Diffuser</strong></p>



<p>The geometry of these corvette modules is ancient and unmistakable, shaped by the crimson heartbeat of the universe itself.</p>



<p>The extruded&nbsp;Aeron Cowling&nbsp;and&nbsp;Aeron Diffuser&nbsp;hull plates add a bold, angular appearance to your corvette’s silhouette.</p>



<p><strong>Wings of Aeron</strong></p>



<p>This Atlas-themed&nbsp;wing module&nbsp;stabilises the corvette during atmospheric flight.</p>



<p><strong>Aeron Powershield</strong></p>



<p>The Aeron Powershield is linked to the corvette’s&nbsp;shielding system, providing a significant performance boost to the ship’s defence array.</p>



<p><strong>Aeron Winglet, Aeron Pillar &amp; Aeron Pyramid</strong></p>



<p>These&nbsp;decorative Atlas-themed modules&nbsp;can be affixed to the corvette exterior, furthering the ship’s devotion to the crimson entity.</p>



<p><strong>Aeron Starship Trail</strong></p>



<p>This engine modification injects the Starship&nbsp;exhaust trail&nbsp;with an&nbsp;arterial streak of crimson.</p>



<p><strong>Aeron Drive &amp; Aeron Blade</strong></p>



<p>Design a hefty, heavyweight&nbsp;Atlas corvette&nbsp;with the bulky&nbsp;Aeron Drive, or favour a more lightweight, sleek aesthetic with the streamlined&nbsp;Aeron Blade&nbsp;wing.</p>



<h3 id="h-bug-fixes-and-quality-of-life">Bug Fixes and Quality of Life </h3>



<ul>

<p>Marvel Cosmic Invasion, the 2D Beat ‘Em Up from Dotemu and Tribute Games, finally has a release date. </p>



<p>On Wednesday, it was announced that Marvel Cosmic Invasion will launch on <strong>Monday, December 1.</strong> The release date was confirmed at the end of the latest trailer <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-demo-data-mine-heroes-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">introducing the game’s final two</a> playable characters: Phoenix and Iron Man.</p>



<p>Available for PlayStation, Xbox, PC, and Nintendo Switch 1 &amp; 2, Marvel Cosmic Invasion is based on the Annihilation storyline from the mid-2000s. In the game, Annihilus has launched an attack across the galaxy, where it’s up to you to fight your way through enemies to stop the Annihilation Wave.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Marvel Cosmic Invasion, while looking like a standard side-scrolling 2D fighting game, introduces new mechanics to the genre, like its “Cosmic Swap” system. This system allows players to quickly swap out with another character as they play. </p>



<p>From <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming’s Preview</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>…it’s not all about just swapping in and out because you want to use a certain character. Instead, there’s a strategy to who you decide to choose and how you use them.</p>



<p>In my playthrough I chose Spider-Man and Venom as my two characters. Immediately, you can find synergy between them. I would throw enemies into the air with Venom only to quickly switch to Spider-Man for a swinging kick. I’d then hit my opponent in the air with Spider-Man, switch to Venom and chomp away across the screen. The variety of combinations you can pull off, even if they don’t necessarily flow or make sense, adds a level of depth to the combat that’s rarely seen in a beat ’em up.</p>

According to Circana, Borderlands 4 didn't just set a franchise record in September, it also became the third highest-selling video game in the US for 2025.</p><p>Circana's Mat Piscatella‬ shared <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m3rvn3gwbk25" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the sales charts for September 2025</a> in the US, and Borderlands 4 topped the Xbox Series X|S and PC charts, while coming in at No. 3 on PlayStation's list. Specific sales numbers weren't included in the charts, but Piscatella noted that Borderlands 4 "generated the highest launch month dollar sales of any title in franchise history, nearly 30% higher than the previous best, Borderlands 3."</p><p>However, it remains to be seen if that momentum was retained in October. PC players have been very vocal about the game's optimization issues. Gearbox Software CEO Randy Pitchford <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-boss-calls-people-4k-stubborn-disputes-reports-of-performance-issues/1100-6534746/" data-ref-id="1100-6534746">challenged players' negative reviews</a> on social media and even suggested that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-boss-calls-people-4k-stubborn-disputes-reports-of-performance-issues/1100-6534746/" data-ref-id="1100-6534746">they should get a refund</a>. Pitchford went on to offer optimization tips, while Gearbox has put forth <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-stuttering-on-pc-gearbox-has-an-unusual-step-to-fix-stability-issues/1100-6535046/" data-ref-id="1100-6535046">an unusual step</a> to handle recurring problems on the game's PC port. The company subsequently released a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-patch-notes-add-fov-slider-on-console-stability-and-performance-improvements-and-more/1100-6535022/" data-ref-id="1100-6535022">new Borderlands 4 patch</a> to tackle some of the game's stability and performance issues.</p><p>Pitchford recently noted that the Borderlands franchise is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-dev-gearbox-says-we-suck-and-heres-why/1100-6535409/" data-ref-id="1100-6535409">closing in on the 100 million sales milestone</a> across all titles. Borderlands 4 reportedly only needs to sell 6 million copies to reach that franchise mark.</p><p>Meanwhile, Gearbox has set November 20 as the release date for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4s-first-paid-dlc-brings-new-story-based-missions-bosses-and-legendary-loot/1100-6535395/" data-ref-id="1100-6535395">Borderlands 4's first DLC</a>.

                <p>While Pikmin fans might not be getting a new game anytime soon, an upcoming update should give them some reasons to jump back into Pikmin 4.</p><p>Coming on an unspecified date this November, the update will add some attractive features to Pikmin 4, most notably a camera mode and difficulty modes that will make the Nintendo Switch game easier or harder.</p><p>With the new Field Camera tool, players can snap in-game photos and fully customize them with stamps, frames, and filters. Pikmin 3 featured a camera tool, but the field camera in Pikmin 4 looks more in line with camera modes in most modern games.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBtBDFzu9ZA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TBtBDFzu9ZA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>There are also new "Creature Difficulty Levels," which is just Nintendo's fancy phrasing for difficulty modes. The easier Relaxed mode will make it so enemies won't attack unless they're attacked first, and they'll also be less difficult to defeat. On the other hand, Fierce mode will increase the difficulty, which is a great option for veteran Pikmin players seeking a greater challenge.</p><p>But the cutest addition to Pikmin 4 is the inclusion of Decor Pikmin from Niantic's mobile game Pikmin Bloom. Players can find Pikmin donning some form of decoration, like a ladybug toy costume, a pink doughnut, or an ice cream hat. No, they don't have any special abilities, but they're adorable as hell. These little guys can also be transferred to Pikmin Bloom.</p><p>A free demo is available for Pikmin 4, and it will be updated the same day as the full game. Unfortunately for Switch 2 owners, Nintendo makes no mention of any technical enhancements for Pikmin 4 on the new console, hindering <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/nintendo-switch-2-edition-games-we-want-to-see/2900-6488/#7" data-ref-id="2900-6488">hopes of a Switch 2 Edition</a>.</p><p>The announcement for the future update comes on the heels of the bizarre drop of an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendos-second-weird-baby-short-introduces-pikmin-to-the-mix/1100-6535303/" data-ref-id="1100-6535303">animated Pikmin short film</a> called "Close to you." The video by Nintendo Pictures was initially <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-just-put-out-a-weird-animated-short-film-with-no-explanation/1100-6535274/" data-ref-id="1100-6535274">released in a cryptic manner</a> without any explicit Pikmin connection. Another version of the short came out not long after, adding Pikmin to the mix.</p><p>The video led to intense speculation about a new Pikmin game or a feature film, but it appeared to be just a separate project by Nintendo Pictures. In addition to announcing the Pikmin 4 update, Nintendo also released the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75JEwjP_GD8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full "Close to you" video</a>, featuring both versions of the short, on YouTube.</p>

            <p>EA and Battlefield Studios have just released a trailer for the first season of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> post-launch content, including a peek at the massive Blackwell Fields map and a new game mode.</p>
<p>Blackwell Fields is a gigantic map set on an air base in California, where air and land vehicles will be available in large-scale game modes. Covered in oil wells, much of the map will be on fire too, which should add some spice to your online matches.</p>
<p>In addition Season One is coming with Strikepoint. This new game mode is a 4v4 occasion, where each player gets one life per round. There are also going to be new weapons and vehicles coming with the Season One update, including the APC, the SQR-300 Carbine, the Mini Fix sniper rifle, and the GGH-22 pistol. Lastly, two new attachments are coming to the game. These are the LPVO sight and the Rail Cover.</p>

			<p>The next-gen Xbox system will be <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-console-will-be-very-premium-very-high-end-curated-experience-says-ceo/">a very premium and high-end experience</a>, but it sounds like the experience won't be the only premium element of the console. As suggested by known AMD insider Kepler L2 on the <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/">NeoGAF forums</a>, the price of the system could easily hit well above the $1000 mark, due to a few reasons, including its high bill of materials, which is considerably higher than that of the Xbox Series X.</p>



<h2 id="h-next-gen-xbox-magnus-bill-of-materials-may-push-its-price-well-beyond-1000">Next-gen Xbox "Magnus" Bill of Materials May Push its Price Well Beyond $1000</h2>



<p>Commenting on the next-generation system, which will be powered by the <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-magnus-apu-flexibility-compete-pre-built-pcs/">AMD "Magnus" APU</a>, the known AMD leaker, who has provided accurate information in the past and pointed insights into upcoming AMD hardware, said that <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/the-next-gen-xbox-console-is-going-to-be-a-very-premium-very-high-end-curated-experience-sarah-bond.1689342/post-270918219">the price of the next Xbox will 100% be over $999.</a> </p>



<p>As things stand, the system's bill of materials (the raw cost of the physical system) is over twice that of the Xbox Series X, which is currently $650. As if this weren't enough, if the next-gen Xbox Magnus will indeed support Steam and 3rd party stores as rumored, Microsoft won't be able to subsidize selling the system at a low or near brea-even price with the guaranteed 30% cut on every game sold on the system.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-next-gen-xbox-magnus-high-price-may-impact-sony-s-playstation-6">The Next-gen Xbox "Magnus" High Price May Impact Sony's PlayStation 6</h2>



<p>The high price of the next generation Microsoft system, and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/rising-prices-and-a-sense-of-broken-trust-will-likely-have-lasting-consequences-for-the-wider-xbox-brand-says-analyst/">current perception of the brand</a>, which is at an-time low following price increases of <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-x-s-prices-will-reportedly-go-up-again-in-us-microsoft/">Xbox hardware</a> and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-is-rumored-to-drop-pc-game-pass-get-cheaper-ad-supported-tier/">Xbox Game Pass service</a>, and the cancellation of multiple projects which have led to studio closures and multiple waves of layoffs, may also impact the PlayStation 6 and Sony's general strategy for the next generation.</p>



<p>Asked about the possibility of the release of a PlayStation 6 Digital Edition without a disc drive at a lower price that the main edition of the system, Kepler L2 said that <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/the-next-gen-xbox-console-is-going-to-be-a-very-premium-very-high-end-curated-experience-sarah-bond.1689342/post-270919867">it would only be possible at a significant loss</a>, as the Japanese company essentially no longer has competition, considering the current state of the Xbox brand.</p>



<p>Although the next-gen Xbox may end up being one of the most expensive gaming systems ever released, the system has a high chance of being the most powerful to date as well. Judging from <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-2027-launch-rumor/">leaked system specifications</a>, the console won't massively outperform the PlayStation 6, but will still be able to offer the premium version of the performance the Sony system will offer, something that would definitely fall in line with recent statements from Xbox CEO Sarah Bond.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-1-hands-on-preview/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-season-1-hands-on-preview-%E2%80%93-thumbs-up-for-new-conquest-maps-thumbs-down-for-the-new-modes.1331671/</guid>

			<p>Now that Battlefield 6 is out and in players hands, EA and Battlefield Studios are ready to look to what's next for the game, beginning with its Season 1 update, which comes with three stages of updates that'll carry Battlefield 6 through to the end of this year.</p>



<p>Season 1 for Battlefield 6 begins on October 28, 2025, and ahead of that arrival, I got the chance to get a closer look at everything that's coming to the game beginning October 28 all the way through to December 9, and go hands on with the new modes, vehicles, maps, and weapons that'll be added throughout Season 1.</p>



<p>As a note, I got ample time to review and go over the details EA shared of what's coming in Season 1 for Battlefield 6, and only three hours to play the new content for myself. I also had time to go over the details before I went hands-on with the Season 1 content, which is why the first section of this preview is an overview of everything broken up by each of Season 1's main updates, followed by my impressions.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-season-1-preview-thumbs-up-for-new-conquest-maps-thumbs-down-for-the-new-modes">Battlefield 6 Season 1 Preview - Thumbs Up for New Conquest Maps, Thumbs Down for the New Modes</h2>



<h3 id="h-the-leadoff-rogue-ops">The Leadoff - Rogue Ops</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Blackwell Fields. Image credit: EA</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Season 1 will last for at least the rest of 2025, but all of Season 1's content won't arrive in one big batch on October 28. It'll arrive in three separate content updates, with Rogue Ops on October 28, California Resistance on November 18, and Winter Offensive on December 9. </p>



<p>Starting with Rogue Ops, the key additions of which are: </p>



<ul>
<li>Blackwell Fields (new map)</li>



<li>Strikepoint (new game mode)</li>



<li>Traverser Mark 2 (new ground vehicle)</li>



<li>SOR-300SC (new carbine weapon)</li>



<li>GGH-22 (new sidearm pistol)</li>



<li>Mini Scout (new sniper rifle)</li>



<li>Rail Cover and LPVO (new attachments)</li>
</ul>



<figure><figcaption><em>Battlefield 6 Season 1. Image credit: EA</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Perhaps the biggest addition that comes with Rogue Ops, only because Rogue Ops is the first of Season 1's updates, is the addition of Battlefield 6's battle pass. The battle pass will have four different paths for players to work through, each with their own free and premium rewards. It's EA and Battlefield Studios' attempt at giving you more choice, so you're working towards the rewards you want sooner, instead of going through a single long list of rewards, many of which you might not care about. You also get a fifth path after finishing the first four.</p>



<p>Though it's worth wondering if breaking up that one long list into five shorter ones will actually make you feel like you're not drudging through rewards you don't care about to get to the ones you do. I guess we'll find out on the 28th. </p>



<p>Rogue Ops' other two highly notable additions are its new map, Blackwell Fields, which Battlefield Studios describes as a map "<em>built for all-out warfare</em>," adding to the maps designed especially for Battlefield's signature Conquest game mode.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Battlefield 6, Season 1 Blackwell Fields. Image credit: EA</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Strikepoint is the second of the two notable additions to Battlefield 6 in Rogue Ops. It is a 4v4, no-respawn mode in which teams compete to capture a single control point. Rounds are won by either eliminating the enemy team or capturing the control point. The first to win six rounds wins the match.</p>



<p>It's a play on the classic search-and-destroy game mode we've seen for years, and it'll be interesting to see how the combat meta changes since it's not necessarily about defusing or arming a bomb, but controlling an area of the map.</p>



<h3 id="h-what-s-on-deck-california-resistance">What's on Deck - California Resistance</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Battlefield 6 Season 1 Eastwood. Image credit: EA</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>After Rogue Ops, California Resistance will arrive on November 18, bringing along with it:</p>



<ul>
<li>Eastwood (new map)</li>



<li>Sabotage (new limited-time mode)</li>



<li>Battle Pickups (new gameplay feature)</li>



<li>DB-12 (new shotgun)</li>



<li>M357 Trait (new revolver sidearm)</li>



<li>Troy Angled (new attachment)</li>
</ul>



<p>Eastwood doesn't bring players to a large field for its battles, but a California suburb where you'll be running through living rooms and across suburban hills and running through a nearby golf course to try and get an angle on your enemy.</p>



<p>Unlike Strikepoint, which is a new permanent mode for Battlefield 6, Sabotage, the mode that'll be coming with California Resistance, will only be available for a limited time. Sabotage is an 8v8 mode where one side has to defend supply caches and the other attacks them, with teams switching sides between attacking and defending each round. The team that destroys the most caches the quickest wins the match.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Battlefield 6 Season 1. Image credit: EA</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Lastly, Battle Pickups are a key addition in California Resistance. They're a new form of weapons cache coming to Battlefield 6 matches that are high-powered weapons with limited ammo that can help give players an edge in a match if they find one of them.</p>



<h3 id="h-in-the-hole-winter-offensive">In the Hole - Winter Offensive</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Battlefield 6, Season 1 Brooklyn Winter Event. Image credit: EA</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>For some reason, in what I thought would be a look at everything to come in Season 1 for Battlefield 6, EA and Battlefield Studios shared no details during this embargoed preview time for Winter Offensive. </p>



<p>We know<a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-1-starts-october-28-roadmap-unveiled/">, based on the roadmap image we saw ahead of the game's launch</a>, that the Brooklyn map is getting a snowy refresh as a limited-time event map, and that there will be a limited-time event called Ice Lock with the arrival of Winter Offensive. Players will also get a new melee weapon, an ice climbing axe.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Battlefield 6 Season 1 Brooklyn Winter Event. Image credit: EA</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>But beyond that, we didn't see anything else about Winter Offensive, which was pretty disappointing. Maybe the team wants to hold something back because by then, Battlefield 6 will be going head-to-head with Call of Duty, and EA wants to have some major surprise to keep players from jumping over to Black Ops 7.</p>



<h3 id="h-hands-on-impressions">Hands-On Impressions</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Battlefield 6, Season 1. Image credit: EA</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Starting with the good, the Conquest variants of the new maps, Eastwood and Blackwell Ridge. Admittedly, I'm a little upset that Eastwood isn't coming until November 18; it's arguably the best map in Battlefield 6, and it's technically not even in the game yet, but Blackwell Ridge is no slouch.</p>



<p>Its sunset setting and rolling hills make it a classic sniper and vehicle playground, and it's genuinely one of the most eye-catching maps in the whole game because of its constant sunset.</p>



<p>Eastwood, for its part, is just a lot more fun to run around in and has a few great hubs where battles for control points can flow throughout a match and find that sweet spot of Battlefield where there's an exciting ebb and flow to the gameplay between both sides. Also, it's just fun to drive around in a golf cart and get kills as you go.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Battlefield 6, Season 1 Eastwood. Image credit: EA</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The new SOR-300SC carbine rifle is a solid addition to the arsenal though it doesn't immediately shoot up to being above my regular choices, even when I tried out different versions with all of the attachments available.</p>



<p>The Mini Scout is a different story, however, since it's arguably going to be the best sniper rifle in the game when it arrives on October 28. Easily my favourite sniper rifle to use, and incredibly powerful.</p>



<p>Overall, I'm just thrilled that the large-scale versions of Eastwood and Blackwell Ridge are as good as they are. Which is why the variants you play on for both the new permanent Strikepoint mode and the limited-time Sabotage modes are all the more disappointing.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Battlefield 6, Season 1. Image credit: EA</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Strikepoint and Sabotage both took place on linear, small-scale versions of Eastwood and Blackwell Ridge. While Eastwood retains the neighbourhood feel, with its high walls and corners to duck around, the Blackwell Ridge map is much more open and feels much less suited for the mode. Both maps have one respawn point at either end, making it easy for either team to start shooting at you the moment you respawn (particularly when playing Sabotage), and neither feels like they successfully shrunk down what's appealing about the full, large-scale map in these condensed versions.</p>



<p>The poor quality of the maps also further exacerbates the fact that Strikepoint and Sabotage are just plain boring, really. Paired with the lacking map variants, Strikepoint's play on classic search-and-destroy make it nowhere near as enticing as the best search-and-destroy game modes. I'm not asking for Battlefield Studios to add an economy system, buying weapons and armour each round, etc., just something more than a single control point in the middle of an uninteresting map (particularly the Blackwell Ridge map) that keeps the matches from becoming deafeningly repetitive and boring.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Battlefield 6, Season 1. Image credit: EA</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>I think the switch from making it about bomb arming and defusal to making it a point you have to defend is an interesting one, but due to Strikepoint's setup of one control point in the same place every match, it was genuinely putting me to sleep during the last hour of the three-hour play session we had with the Season 1 content. It was a major letdown after having a blast playing on Conquest on two excellent new maps for two hours.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, this isn't the part where I say, 'don't worry, Sabotage is actually fun.' It's fine. It can be a good time, particularly because the 8v8 structure allows for a bit more dynamic and chaotic combat simply because there are more people in the match, but overall, the mode didn't make for exciting matches.</p>



<p>I think part of my problem with both these modes is that neither of them is what I look to Battlefield for. It's not that I don't appreciate EA and Battlefield Studios trying new things; I just don't like what they've tried. I'm happy with the new weapons, I'm happy with the new maps, but I can live without the new modes. I'll certainly give Strikepoint another try, especially if there are better map variants for it from maps like Brooklyn, Mirak Valley, and New Sobek City. But if you're a fan of search-and-destroy, you're probably better off sticking with whatever your go-to shooter is for that mode.</p>



<h3 id="h-keeping-up-the-momentum">Keeping Up the Momentum</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Battlefield 6, Season 1. Image credit: EA</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Now that Battlefield 6 has been in players' hands for nearly two weeks and we're days away from its live service engine springing to life with the introduction of its battle pass, the goal for EA and Battlefield Studios is to keep the momentum that <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-sold-over-7-million-units-3-days-biggest-franchise-launch/">its stellar commercial launch started</a>.</p>



<p>We'll see if the pacing of Season 1's content on top of everything else players already love about the game is exactly what Battlefield 6 needs to keep itself in fighting shape for when Call of Duty arrives. I think Blackwell Ridge and Eastwood will both be huge for the variety of what's available in Battlefield 6, and hopefully, for EA's sake, people like Strikepoint a hell of a lot more than I did when it arrives.</p>



<p>As a side note, while I can't wait for Eastwood, I can't help but appreciate the timing of its arrival. Black Ops 7 launches on November 14, four days before Eastwood is set to launch in Battlefield 6. The headquarters offices for both EA and Activision are based in California, not to mention Ripple Effect, one of the teams that worked on Battlefield 6, is also based in California. A map all about a battle on Californian soil launching on November 18 can't help but feel a little symbolic of what's to come.</p>

The news comes in the aftermath of a disappointing launch for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/689333/fbc-firebreak-review-xbox-ps5-steam"><em>FBC: Firebreak</em></a>, the Finnish studio’s first foray into multiplayer gaming. Virtala will be replaced on an interim basis by Markus Mäki, Remedy’s chief product officer and one of the studio’s co-founders. The studios says it will “initiate a search process for a new CEO immediately.”</p><p>Virtala took over the role back in 2016, and was a key figure behind Remedy’s transformation over the past decade, as it shifted from a work-for-hire studio to one that developed multiple projects simultaneously and owned and published its own games. This period was highlighted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/26/20832997/control-review-creators-thriller-ps4-xbox-pc">the launch of <em>Control</em> in 2019</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23934662/alan-wake-2-review-ps5-xbox-pc">the long-awaited sequel to <em>Alan Wake</em> in 2023</a>.</p><div><p><em>Firebreak</em> was meant to be a major part of this transformation, a self-published spinoff of <em>Control</em> that was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/665752/fbc-firebreak-preview-interview-remedy-control-ps5-xbox">an attempt to marry the studio’s worldbuilding and storytelling with a live-service co-op shooter</a>. However, the combination didn’t win over players and, despite launching <a href="https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/784967/remedy-fbc-firebreak-update">a major update in September</a>, two weeks ago <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/?publicationId=b4d23a32-03e7-49e5-bbc3-93ec062699a5">Remedy issued a profit warning</a> due to “weak sales” of <em>Firebreak</em>.</p></div><p>Part of the impetus behind Remedy’s shift to a multi-project studio — in addition to <em>Firebreak</em>, it’s also currently developing <em>Control 2</em>, remasters of <em>Max Payne</em>, and a mystery game — was to help it deal with potential flops like <em>Firebreak</em>, though Virtala told me ahead of the game’s launch that, even still, each release was still significant for the independent studio. “Every single game is highly important for us,” <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/691964/remedy-entertainment-profile-alan-wake-control-fbc-firebreak">Virtala told <em>The Verge</em></a>. “There is no question that we are not fully insulated.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>2006’s <i>Scarface: The World is Yours</i> is back! Well, maybe. It’s complicated. Possibly illegal. See, the <i>Vice City</i>-lookin’ open-world action-adventure game for PS2, Xbox, and Wii recently resurfaced on Steam and the Epic Games Store. That’s (possibly) good news if you like diving into some gaming deep tracks from the early 21st Century. But it’s bad news if you’re the rights holder to this game because you didn’t give anyone permission to do this.</p> <p>Arriving on Steam and EGS, the loose adaptation of the legendary gangster film is back courtesy of a publisher named EC Digital Entertainment, who promises some graphical upgrades to the 2006 game (yes, they’re “AI-assisted”). But <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/scarface-pc-re-release-unintentionally-pushed-live-early-on-epic-with-steam-to-follow-but-i-may-smell-a-rat">as <i>Rock Paper Shotgun </i>documents</a>, EC Digital Entertainment doesn’t have much of a history. Based in Hong Kong, their website is blocked for whatever reason, and their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ecdeasia/featured">YouTube page</a> is filled with so many <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1o9khke/we_can_all_agree_that_this_is_scarier_than_arc/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;embed_host_url=https://kotaku.com/ark-raiders-embark-studios-server-slam-2000637325">tumbleweeds</a> it’s giving me <i>Arc Raiders</i> PTSD flashbacks. What’s more, this version of <i>Scarface</i> includes some QoL mods baked in <a href="https://x.com/__silent_/status/1980894088913383823">without permission from its creators</a>, one of whom is clearly stating “the holder of the <i>Scarface </i>license wasn’t willing to re-release the game.” So how did this happen?</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This release reportedly ships SilentPatch and Fusion Fix, and none of us were contacted about this in advance (which isn't necessary as per the license, but would be nice).</p> <p>I KNOW that the holder of the Scarface license wasn't willing to re-release the game, so this is suspect. <a href="https://t.co/eDCWkKys4p">https://t.co/eDCWkKys4p</a></p> <p>— Silent (@__silent_) <a href="https://twitter.com/__silent_/status/1980894088913383823?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 22, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>We love a mystery.</p> <p>As flummoxed as any of us by this strange news, the creator of <a href="https://gtaforums.com/topic/669045-silentpatch/">SilentPatch</a> dug in a bit more to <a href="https://x.com/__silent_/status/1980979864707719465">find out that the author</a> of one of the included mods was contacted. However, they also found that the “Movie IP rights holder appears to be unaware [of the Steam and EGS listing]” and that the store pages launched prematurely.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Here's what I found out so far:<br>* TAG (Fusion Fix author) WAS contacted, they were unable to reach me because of a lost Discord friend invite (despite my e-mail being public)<br>* Movie IP rights holder appears to be unaware of this<br>* Store listings were put early in error</p> <p>Oh boy. <a href="https://t.co/1aaYiyOD2A">https://t.co/1aaYiyOD2A</a></p> <p>— Silent (@__silent_) <a href="https://twitter.com/__silent_/status/1980979864707719465?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 22, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Weird stuff for sure. You can buy the EGS version right now, though the Steam listing still says “coming soon.”</p> <p>As for the game itself, I faintly remember seeing the box art on store shelves back in the 2000s and at the time thought, “Why wouldn’t I just play <i>GTA</i>?” Al Pacino lent his likeness and personally chose his voice replacement for Tony Montana, but a few other actors from the movie did reprise their roles. Critical reception of the game was mostly positive, hovering around 7’s out of 10’s, with the occasional 6 and one 4.5 out of 10 from <i>Official Xbox Magazine</i>. Sequels and a PSP and Xbox 360 version were planned, but later scrapped.</p> <p>I like seeing old games, possible hidden gems, return from eons past. But it sounds like this rerelease of <i>Scarface</i> might be best avoided for now.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sony-quietly-dumps-the-1000xm4-at-50-off-now-3x-cheaper-than-airpods-max-or-bose-2000638177</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-quietly-dumps-the-1000xm4-at-50-off-now-3x-cheaper-than-airpods-max-or-bose.1331653/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Premium noise-canceling headphones typically demand $400 or more, and Apple’s AirPods Max is sitting at $549. Sony just quietly <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3787/">dropped the WH-1000XM4 to an all-time low of $198 on Amazon (down from $348)</a>, which makes these legendary headphones <strong>roughly three times cheaper than AirPods Max</strong> and significantly less expensive than current Bose or Sonos models.</p>
<p>Sure, Sony released the newer 1000XM6 but the upgrades are incremental at best, and this model cost more than double what you’ll pay for the XM4 right now. For daily commuting, office work or travel, the 1000XM4 delivers the same core noise-canceling technology that made Sony’s 1000X series the benchmark everyone else tries to match.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3787/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why the XM4 Still Competes with Newer Models</h2>
<p>Dual noise sensor technology <strong>employs external and internal microphones on each earcup to pick up and eliminate ambient noise</strong> with surprising accuracy. External mics pick up external noise such as airplane engines, traffic, or air-conditioning systems, and internal mics are listening for what actually ends up in your ear and make adjustments on the fly. This dual-pronged attack creates an area of silence that’s truly impressive, eliminating low-rumble growl of engine noise and higher-pitched chatter of nearby conversations. <strong>Noise cancellation of the XM4 stays on par with the XM5 and XM6 in practical application</strong>, where the variance is slight enough most people would only pick up on the difference by direct comparison.</p>
<p><strong>Battery life stretches to 30 hours with noise cancellation active</strong>&nbsp;which covers multiple cross-country flights or weeks of daily commuting before you need to recharge. Quick charging adds another convenience layer: a 10-minute charge via the included USB-C cable delivers five hours of playback, so even if you forget to charge them overnight, a quick top-up during breakfast gets you through the day. <strong>This battery performance beats AirPods Max</strong>&nbsp;which manage around 20 hours and lack any fast-charging capability.</p>



<p><em>Speak-to-Chat</em> is one of those features where you think it’s just gimmicky until you actually use it every day. The <strong>headphones sense you beginning to speak and instantly mute your music</strong> and lower noise cancellation so you can hear the person on the other end perfectly. Once you’ve finished speaking, music plays again instantly once silence has lasted for some seconds. This comes in super handy for short conversations with baristas, coworkers visiting your desk, or your family questioning you, so you don’t have to physically mute and take off your headphones to have short conversations.</p>



<p>Excellent call quality results <strong>from five integrated microphones and sophisticated audio signal processing</strong> that separates your voice from noise. Those on the receiving end of calls are able to hear you naturally even where the situation is noisy, e.g., on busy roads or windy situations. Beamforming technology in the microphone array zeroes in on your voice and mutes the noise, and this is key where you are working from home or where you take your calls while commuting.</p>
<p>Multipoint connection <strong>allows you to pair the XM4s with two devices at once</strong> so you can be connected to your laptop to get your job done and your phone so you can take calls. Audio seamlessly switches to whatever device actually has content playing, so the phone call cuts your laptop music without you having to switch it by hand. This ends the constant dance of re-pairing your single-connection headphones have to go through every time you switch between devices.</p>
<p>At $198, the <strong>1000XM4 represents roughly 36% of the price you pay for AirPods Max</strong> but provides the same or superior noise cancellation, increased battery life, and additional features.</p>

<p>With less than a week until its launch, the Battlefield 6 Season 1 trailer has been released, previewing what’s to come for players. </p>



<p>The trailer, which you can watch below, gives players a first look at the new Blackwell Fields map along with the Strikepoint game mode.</p>



<p><strong>“Season 1 rolls out in three phases with new hardware, gadgets, maps, and monthly drops for Portal,”</strong> EA said. <strong>“Blackwell Fields spans besieged facilities and homesteads under a burning horizon, supporting all combat sizes with land and air. Eastwood turns a quiet villa and golf retreat into a frontline, with land vehicles and helicopters in play.”</strong></p>



<p>Battlefield 6 Season 1 starts with the aforementioned new map and mode, along with three new weapons, a new attachment, and a new vehicle. The new weapons coming to the game are the SOR-300SC rifle, GGH-22 pistol, and the Mini Scout sniper rifle.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/powerwash-simulator-2-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/powerwash-simulator-2-review.1331644/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Do you have time to talk about my lord and saviour, PowerWash Simulator? The unexpected cult hit hooked weirdos like me back in 2022 with its relaxing, satisfying premise; clean dirt off things. Has the sequel, PowerWash Simulator 2, changed the fundamental act of power washing? Has it given new meaning to slowly blasting graffiti off a wall? Will it make you question what it truly means to be filthy in 2025? No. And thank Mr. Clean for that, because it's the simplicity that makes it so satisfying. What you do get is what fans like me - I've got over 400 hours logged in the original - really needed; some quality of life upgrades and lots of new things to wash. I can see myself racking up another 400 hours on this installment easily. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In case you missed out the first time, it really is as straightforward as it sounds. You are given a vehicle or location to clean, a selection of power washers (they all function the same way, just with varying power), soap, and if a level is feeling saucy, some ladders. You choose your washer, your nozzle (I'm a green girl, yellow for detail work, any one who uses white wasn't loved enough by their mother), and you're left to clean at your own pace, sluicing down sections in whatever way you please. One of the real beauties of PowerWash Simulator is that you can't eff it up. As long as you're blasting water at dirt, eventually things will get clean. Even if you never upgraded anything, you'd still get there in the end. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The big headline for the sequel is all the new cleaning jobs to work your way through, and they don't disappoint. There are vehicles like a mobility scooter or a car decorated like a dog; there are buildings like bandstands, public toilets, and grand houses; and there are even new multi-stage jobs where you'll need to clean a particular part of a map to reveal a new area. There is the perfect balance of large buildings and complex structures, for when I wanted to spend a solid hour spraying, alongside smaller vehicles for a quicker splash of dopamine. Less exciting for purists like me is the addition of a home base you can decorate (with items you get to wash first) and some pet cats. I mean, everyone likes virtual pets, but unless I can tie mops to their feet I have no interest in them when I'm busy jetwashing a billboard. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There's the perfect balance of large buildings and smaller vehicles to clean. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">You'll understand the beautiful mundanity of this game when I tell you that one of the most exciting innovations is that soap is now free and multipurpose. Not just a blow against capitalism, it actually removes one of the biggest annoyances about the first game. Soap had to be purchased, came in limited quantities, and a different soap was required for each surface. Now you just switch to the soap attachment and any surface, on any job, can be your own personal foam party as it breaks down tough stains. I've gone from a soap dodger to a detergent dilettante. While you're cleaning there are also new icons to help you track down things that still need polishing up, which might sound minor, but as someone who spent hours of their life looking for a 1% speck of dirt on a huge restroom wall, I am hugely grateful for it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The other new tricks in your cleaning kit similarly make things that were a bit of a fiddle or a grind easier, without letting you skip the work. There's an abseiling rig for large structures like billboards, a cherry picker lift so you're not balancing on ladders to get to hard to reach areas, and a spinning surface cleaner - you know, like school janitors mysteriously push around after hours - to make polishing up large flat surfaces a little less daunting. There are even tiny tweaks, like that tall scaffolding now has a ladder on the outside when you just want to get to the top, no more zig zagging up and down. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">PowerWash Simulator 2 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What's key is that the improvements aren't about speeding you through the jobs more quickly or letting you skip chunks, because the whole point of PowerWash Simulator 1 and 2 is the meditative flow state you achieve just working away at the grime and graffiti, back and forth, up and down, all with the gentle hiss of water accompanying your progress. It's underrated as an ASMR experience, although you will need to pee every 10 minutes. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you've yet to discover the wonders of jet washing random buildings and vehicles, good news; there's no lore you have to catch up on. The loose story is delivered through text messages while you're working, but you could skip them all without a problem. They usually explain why you're cleaning, for instance, a street sweeper covered in huckleberry jelly, or will give you weird information about the area. There are some nice touches for devotees of the original, too. A shooting gallery has miniature versions of the landmarks you'll recognize, and the chatter will reference the iconic merman statue or strange temple. It's nonsense, but it's nonsense I appreciated. </p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Line up ladies and gentlemen, and see the rare example of a sequel to a special game that knew just what to tweak, and what to leave well enough alone. The meditative motions of cleaning, the silly sense of humor, and the sense of satisfaction. There's enough here to justify slapping a big old 2 on the end of the title, but the key mechanic and feeling of the first game lives on.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/powerwash-simulator-2-review]]></content:encoded>

It guides players towards the new space wrecks, is a great way to salvage some new rare ship parts, while uncovering a spooky story - suitable for the Halloween season!</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">No Man's Sky Breach Update Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“It has been a crazy year for the No Man’s Sky team and we’re so proud and pleased to be able to continue working on this game we all love so much nine years after launch.Seeing so many folks enjoying Voyagers has really inspired us, and we can’t wait for you to see what we have in store in future.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">No Man’s Sky continues to receive free updates even now, years after launch. And it’s clearly keeping players interested. No Man’s Sky launched in August 2016 on PS4 and PC to tens of thousands of negative reviews on Steam, with players complaining about broken promises and a lack of meaningful content, particularly on the multiplayer side. The game quickly settled on the dreaded ‘overwhelmingly negative’ Steam user review rating, a clear sign to anyone who visited its Steam page that something was very wrong.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Guildford, England-based developer Hello Games has continued to update No Man’s Sky over the years, improving player sentiment to the point where it is now considered superb. It took two years to hit ‘mixed,’ then another three to hit ‘mostly positive.’ At the time, five years after launch, Tim Woodley, Head of Publishing at Hello Games, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/no-mans-sky-gets-mostly-positive-steam-review-5-years"><u>explained how hard it was to claw back Steam user reviews from such a low base</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Hello Games continues to work on No Man’s Sky, it’s developing its next game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/light-no-fire"><u>Light No Fire</u></a>.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvel-cosmic-invasion/news/">Marvel Cosmic Invasion</a> will officially launch on December 1, and two more characters are joining its roster. Tribute Games and developer Dotemu revealed that Phoenix and Iron Man will team up with fellow heroes like Captain America, She-Hulk, Wolverine, and Spider-Man, increasing the total number of playable heroes to 15. Phoenix--X-man Jean Grey's cosmic powerhouse alter-ego--can dish out telekinetic blasts, while Iron Man uses bleeding-edge technology to clear the field of enemies.</p><p>First revealed at Summer Game Fest earlier this year, Marvel Cosmic Invasion sees Earth's mightiest mortals take on Annihilus as he launches a new campaign to take over the galaxy. Dotemu had previously worked on another licensed property, the well-received Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge for PC and console.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itVLfmX3Ts8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/itVLfmX3Ts8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4589194-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4589195-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4589196-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4589197-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4589198-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4589199-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4589200-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_7.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4589194,1300-4589195,1300-4589196,1300-4589197,1300-4589198,1300-4589199,1300-4589200" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4589194-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4589195-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4589196-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4589197-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4589198-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4589199-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4589200-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_7.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4589194-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4589195-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4589196-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4589197-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4589198-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4589199-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4589200-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_7.jpg"></figure><p>The Marvel game has a beat-'em-up design at its core, and each character can pull off unique attacks.

                <p>In a <a href="https://rollingstone.com.br/noticia/hideo-kojima-criar-jogos-e-cansativo-mas-sinto-que-estou-realmente-vivendo/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">recent interview</a>, game creator Hideo Kojima kicked off a firestorm on social media as he shared his thoughts on the future of the industry. Kojima warned that relying too heavily on remaking old franchises is creatively risky and that, in the future, <a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/hideo-kojima-remakes-sequels-ai/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">AI will likely be used to create these kinds of projects</a>. </p><p>Kojima has already said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-should-be-embraced-not-feared-two-prominent-game-developers-say/1100-6535479/" data-ref-id="1100-6535479">he doesn’t see AI as a threat</a>, though. Instead, he believes it can be a helpful tool for handling repetitive tasks, allowing human creators to focus on more imaginative work. Kojima explained that he sees AI as a "friend" in development, one that improves efficiency without replacing human leadership in creativity.</p><p>Silent Hill series producer Motoi Okamoto strongly disagrees with Kojima's prediction. Okamoto stated that <a href="https://google.com/search?q=gamespot+silent+hill+f&amp;udm=14" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Silent Hill f</a>, the latest game in the franchise, could not have been made by AI. While AI might be able to generate ideas for sequels, Okamoto believes it cannot make bold creative decisions, such as changing the setting to 1960s Japan or involving acclaimed horror writer Ryukishi07. These choices, he says, came from human insight and vision--something AI simply can't replicate at this point.</p><p>"AI may be able to put together a project for a sequel that takes place in the Silent Hill universe, but things like changing the story's setting to Japan or getting Ryukishi07 on board as a writer are the kind of bold choices AI would never be able to make," Okamoto said (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/ai-could-never-come-up-with-a-sequel-like-silent-hill-f-series-producer-joins-discussion-on-ai-generated-remakes-and-sequels/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Automaton translation</a>). </p><p>Silent Hill f is a significant shift for the series, moving away from the familiar town and instead focusing on a deeply personal horror story set in historical Japan. The game follows Hinako Shimizu, a teenager dealing with overwhelming pressure from those around her. Since its release in late September, the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-fs-launch-sales-higher-than-silent-hill-2-remake/1100-6535077/" data-ref-id="1100-6535077">has sold over 1 million copies</a> and received mostly positive reviews. </p><p>The debate surrounding AI in gaming has gained momentum recently, particularly with advancements in generative AI, such as Sora. Fans have utilized these tools to create parody content featuring popular franchises such as Mario and Pokemon, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-sora-2-ai-mario-and-pikachu-videos-seem-primed-for-nintendo-lawsuits/1100-6535191/" data-ref-id="1100-6535191">sparking concerns from companies like Nintendo regarding copyright infringement</a>. Despite the controversy, developers like Kojima and Glen Schofield (creator of Dead Space) continue to advocate for AI as a valuable tool. Schofield said that after experimenting with AI for two years, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-should-be-embraced-not-feared-two-prominent-game-developers-say/1100-6535479/" data-ref-id="1100-6535479">he sees it as a way to improve speed</a>, reduce costs, and support developers, not as a replacement for them.</p>

            <p>Microsoft has increased the price of its Xbox Development Kit, making it more expensive for studios to make games for the console.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/803237/microsoft-xbox-devkit-price-hikes-developers">The Verge</a>, the dev kit has bumped up from $1500 to $2000 - a 30 percent increase in cost.</p>
<p>"The adjustment reflects macroeconomic developments," reads an announcement to developers from Microsoft. "We remain committed to providing high-quality tools and support for your development efforts."</p>

</figure>
<p>Not only is this price coming into effect immediately, The Verge understands this will impact developers in Europe and elsewhere, not just the US.</p>
<p>The price hike follows price increases in recent months for both the Xbox console and its flagship subscription Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.</p>
<p>In the US, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/us-xbox-fans-hit-with-another-hardware-price-hike-just-four-months-after-the-last-increase">cost of both the Xbox Series X and S consoles increased</a> from 3rd October - the disc-playing Series X model now costs $649.99, an increase of $50.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-increases-price-of-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-despite-record-subscription-profits-last-year">Game Pass Ultimate, meanwhile, increased by over 50 percent</a> - in the UK it now costs £22.99 per month. This is the top tier of the subscription, though PC Game Pass also increased in price. Some countries are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-price-hikes-wont-affect-existing-subscribers-in-some-countries-for-now-microsoft-confirms">yet to see the price increase</a>.</p>
<p>As The Verge explained, the Xbox dev kit is already expensive due to additional hardware to allow developers to test their games for both the Series X and S models.</p>

            <p>Nintendo has announced a free update to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pikmin-4">Pikmin 4</a> coming next month, but it doesn't include a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> upgrade.</p>
<p>The update will add a Photo Mode using the new field camera item, with players able to adjust angles and customise images with various decorations.</p>
<p>Decor <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pikmin">Pikmin</a> will also be added. Originally seen in mobile game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pikmin-bloom">Pikmin Bloom</a>, these Pikmin are hidden around levels to be discovered and transferred to your squad - they can also be transferred to the mobile game.</p>

<p>Lastly, new Creature Activity levels will be added. In Relaxed mode, enemies won't attack unless you attack first, allowing for a breezier challenge, while in Fierce mode they'll be more aggressive.</p>
<p>Though there's no date, the update will arrive in November along with a new demo to try out.</p>
<p>The news follows a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-posts-cute-and-mysterious-animated-short-film-but-is-it-teasing-pikmin">mysterious animated short shared earlier this month called Close to You</a>, which showed a baby being (somewhat) terrorised by invisible creatures. Fans rightly guessed these were Pikmin, and a revised version including the plant critters was published the following day.</p><p>As such, some form of Pikmin news has been expected. But most fans had anticipated an upgraded version of Pikmin 4 for Switch 2 - something Nintendo has released for many of its games, including the two open-world Zelda games, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land">Kirby and the Forgotten Land</a>, and Super Mario Party Jamboree. Super Mario Bros. Wonder is also getting an expanded version next year.</p>
<p>But not so Pikmin 4. While the game is playable on the Switch 2, there's no specific upgrade.</p>
<p>Still, it remains a brilliant game on the system. "The Pikmin series blossoms anew, in a bouquet of fresh gameplay and the best bits from its roots," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pikmin-4-review-nintendos-oft-overlooked-garden-strategy-reaches-near-perfect-evolution">five star review of Pikmin 4</a>.</p>

		<p>Hello Games has announced and launched a new update for No Man’s Sky, calling it Breach. The Breach Expedition is a limited time event that will run for three weeks, taking players to an abandoned universe filled with corvette wrecks that can be salvaged for parts. The end goal of the expedition is to find the Fireship Arcadia, but to get there players will need to venture into hostile environments including the purple star systems.</p>
<p><iframe title="No Man's Sky Breach Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eNaY10DQkJw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The purple star solar systems were first teased in the Worlds Part II update, and players venturing to these areas will need to be fully prepared as these are pretty hostile areas environmentally. The prizes of stripping the Corvette wrecks may be worth it though. Equipped with your multi-tool laser you will able to take parts from the wrecks and use them to build ships at a Corvette Workshop. The items you can get as scrap include landing gear, shields, weapons, connectors, and wedge-shaped modules. The rewards going into the Breach include Event Horizon, Eternal Serpents, and Siren of the Stars posters, Aeron Cowling and Aeron Diffuser hull plates, the Atlas-themed Wings of Aeron wing module, the Aeron Drive &amp; Aeron Blade,&nbsp; the decorative Aeron Winglet, Aeron Pillar &amp; Aeron Pyramid, the Aeron Starship exhaust trail and the Aeron Powershield which can boosts your ship’s defences.</p>
<p>Fixes have also been released since the launch of Voyagers, with Hello Games improving snapping, making collisions more robust, and adding the option to apply a colour palette to a Corvette at the workshop.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ring-battery-doorbell-plus-is-selling-for-pennies-amazon-cuts-50-off-for-final-clearance-sale-2000638162</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Missing a package delivery because you didn’t hear the doorbell or weren’t sure if someone actually rang feels frustrating, especially when you’ve been waiting days for that shipment. The Ring battery doorbell <em>Plus</em> solves this by giving you real-time alerts, two-way communication with visitors and a full head-to-toe video view of whoever’s standing at your door – all accessible from your phone no matter where you are. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4926/">just slashed it to an all-time low of $79 (down from $149), making this one of the most affordable ways to add smart home security</a> to your front entrance.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4926/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why Video From Head-to-Toe Really Matters</h2>
<p>The wider-angle view through the Ring <em>Plus</em> doorbell captures visitors from the head down to the heel, rather than cutting them off at chest level, like most standard doorbells. That makes all the difference when delivery personnel deposit packages at your feet and go or when you’ll be able to determine whether someone’s holding something. <strong>HD+ video resolution gives you higher definition than standard HD</strong> so you’ll be better able to distinguish faces, read package labeling, or make out identifying characteristics on cars parked nearby.</p>
<p><strong>Color night vision</strong> eliminates the guesswork of nighttime visitors. Old-time infrared night vision provides you with grayscale video, making it harder to distinguish clothing colors, type of vehicle, or other details useful for identification. Color night vision performs better under ambient light and amplifies what light you have, providing usable color video even where the light gets low.</p>



<p>Motion detection triggers alerts the moment someone enters your field of view of your doorbell camera so you have early notification even before they press the button. You have the ability to block off some of the zones within the camera view, like your neighbor’s window or the busy sidewalk, so you only get alerts of motions you actually are interested in.</p>
<p>The Quick Release Battery Pack makes recharging simple: You remove the battery,<strong> charge indoors through the normal USB cable and click the battery back into place without removing the whole doorbell</strong>. This setup eclipses hardwired doorbells where your current doorbell cabling is poor or doesn’t exist, and eliminates the requirement to call an electrician to install the doorbell. <strong>Recharge time covers several weeks to months</strong>, dependent on the level of use, and some owners have a second battery kept charged so they can switch immediately without downtime.</p>



<p>Installation involves setting up the doorbell to your door frame or wall by using the hardware provided and plugging it into your WiFi through the Ring application. <strong>Installation typically takes 15-30 minutes</strong> or so for the average person, and you won’t require any special equipment aside from the use of a screwdriver.</p>
<p>With two-way audio, you can speak to delivery people, say to visitors you’ll be there in just a minute or deter suspicious individuals without having to open your door. The quality of the speaker and microphone is good enough for average conversation, and the lag between someone speaking and you hearing it is negligible. Your real-time communication makes the doorbell system an intercom system you can use anywhere you have internet access.</p>
<p>At $79, the Ring doorbell <em>Plus</em> is cheaper than most of the bare-bones doorbells available without any smart features whatsoever.</p>
