<figure data-uuid="f91587d6942cf"><a title="Assassin's Creed Shadows" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f91587d6942cf/assassins-creed-shadows.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Ubisoft</em></figcaption></figure><p>With just one week to go before <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> arrives on Switch 2, Ubisoft has updated the game's eShop page with some noteworthy details to keep in mind before you buy. Like, for example, the dreaded file size.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-games/Assassin-s-Creed-Shadows-2967695.html">updated listing</a>, Shadows will take up a beefy <strong>62.8 GB</strong> on your system. It's not the most surprising news considering the size of the game, but it's something to keep an eye on as we head towards release.</p>
<p>For reference, this file size puts Shadows above the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a> (60.6 GB), <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ea-sports-madden-nfl-26">Madden NFL 26</a> (57.1 GB), and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0: Director's Cut</a> (45.3 GB), but it's still a good step below <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a> (69.2 GB) and the upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> (90-95 GB). Not the end of the world, then, but it might be time to start looking for a Micro SD Express, if you're hoping to have a couple of these in your library.</p>
<p>For those who missed the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/its-official-assassins-creed-shadows-comes-to-switch-2-in-december-with-cross-progression">initial announcement</a>, Assassin's Creed Shadows will arrive on Switch 2 on <strong>2nd December</strong>, complete with cross-progression saves, touchscreen support and all the title updates you could wish for — apart from the Claws of Awaji expansion, you'll have to wait until 2026 for that.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/asus-rog-strix-24-5%E2%80%B3-gaming-monitor-sees-a-major-black-friday-price-shift-with-a-3-year-warranty-attached.1362862/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’re on the hunt for a new monitor, be it for your main screen or as a second, or dare I say, a third display, you can get a solid piece of hardware without emptying out your entire wallet. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5867/">Right now, Amazon has the ASUS ROG Strix — a 24.5-inch Full HD gaming monitor — on Black Friday sale for 43% off.</a> This hefty discount brings the price down by a whopping $130. It usually sells for $299, so that means you end up only having to pay $169 for a limited time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5867/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Insane Frame Rates</h2>
<p>When it comes to monitors, if you want to stay within a reasonable budget, you’re going to need to make some decisions on what your priority is. Like, do you want your screen to be massive above all else? Do you want the sharpest detail with a crazy 4K resolution? Well, the ASUS ROG Strix is for the frame rate freaks out there. Sure, it only measures at a humble 24.5 inches. It only displays in your standard 1080p HD resolution. However, this monitor is capable of up to 310Hz. People love to argue online over what the maximum perception of the human eye is when it comes to screen refresh rates, but this thing has got to be approaching that.&nbsp;You’ll be able to game at ridiculously fast frame rates without sacrificing much size or detail. 24.5-inches and 1080p is still good.</p>



<p>The ASUS ROG Strix monitor has a 1ms response time. This will make it so all your inputs feel immediate and snappy. A high response time will make it so every move feels like you’re walking through mud. That won’t be a problem on this monitor. I’ve been playing <em>Ho</em><em>llow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>through Game Pass UItimate, meaning I have access to it on both my Xbox and my PC. I had started out on my Xbox which is connected to a fairly cheap 2017 Vizio. I struggled hard with a lot of the platforming sections, but then I switched over to playing on a new Lenovo Legion gaming laptop and man is that change night and day. I now know it’s time my TV gets and upgrade.</p>
<p>You have multiple options when it comes to how you connect to this ASUS monitor. It supports USB-C, DisplayPort 1.4, and HDMI. So you can connect a laptop, your PC tower, a phone, or perhaps your new ASUS ROG Xbox Ally if you so please.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Bose and Sonos watched nervously as Amazon entered the soundbar market after noticing the category’s massive sales potential. Amazon’s strategy was simple: create their own hardware and undercut premium brands on price while delivering competitive quality. The <strong>Fire TV Soundbar Plus</strong> represents this approach perfectly and packs 3.1 channels, a built-in subwoofer, Dolby Atmos, and DTS:X into a package that costs a fraction of comparable models.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4053/">$149, down from $249, this newest model has hit an all-time low price</a> on Amazon for Black Friday.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4053/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Best Soundbar</h2>
<p>The <strong>integrated subwoofer</strong> addresses the most significant compromise in budget soundbars by housing appropriate bass drivers within the main unit. You get deep, room-filling low-end without buying and placing a separate subwoofer box. Action movies provide satisfying rumble during explosions and car chases. Music playback maintains warmth and body across genres from hip-hop to rock.</p>
<p>The <strong>3.1 configuration adds a dedicated center channel </strong>specifically for reproduction of dialogue. Conversations, narration, and vocal performances come through exceptionally well. You finally stop reaching for the remote when scenes switch between quiet talking and loud action. It also keeps your center channel focused on speech frequencies while left and right channels handle music and effects, which stops a muddy audio mix plaguing cheaper 2.0 soundbars.</p>



<p><strong>Dolby Atmos support introduces 3D audio</strong> that flies around and above your listening position. Height virtualization bounces the sound off your ceiling to create overhead effects in movies and shows. Helicopters fly over your head, rain falls from above, and atmospheric sounds envelope you on all sides. DTS:X offers similarly multi-dimensional audio with somewhat different processing. Both transform your living room into a theater-like experience without needing to install ceiling speakers.</p>
<p>Setup takes only minutes via a <strong>single HDMI cable attached to the eARC or ARC port on your TV</strong>. Audio automatically stays perfectly synchronized with video over the HDMI connection. You avoid the lip-sync issues that plague budget setups with optical cable connections. Power the soundbar on, and your TV instantly recognizes it. The included HDMI cable means you do not need to invest in any more accessories.</p>
<p>It has <strong>four preset audio modes that automatically adjust the sound</strong>, depending on the content. Movie mode enhances dynamic range for cinematic experiences with deep bass and clear dialogue. Music mode balances frequencies to accurately reproduce your favorite songs and albums. Sports mode amplifies crowd noise and commentary for live events. Night mode compresses dynamic range so late-night viewing won’t disturb others.</p>



<p>The Amazon Fire TV Soundbar Plus delivers premium features at nearly half the retail price this Black Friday, priced at $149. Amazon actually made up the soundbar category to begin with specifically to provide better value than the established brands. If cinematic audio is what you need but want to avoid the premium prices, then this record-low deal proves that you don’t need to spend over $500 on a soundbar.</p>

<p>The team behind FiveM has officially announced support for GTA 5 Enhanced Edition, allowing users to convert Legacy assets for GTA 5 Enhanced Edition through a new tool called Alchemist. </p>



<p>As we wait for Rockstar’s next big thing to arrive, GTA 6, players still have time to sink their teeth into all that Grand Theft Auto 5 and GTA Online have to offer. Recently, we were informed that GTA Online <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-online-now-included-with-gta-membership/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will be included</a> with a GTA+ membership. Now, the modding community has some good news to celebrate, thanks to mods being updated for Enhanced Edition support. </p>



<h2 id="h-alchemist-will-convert-fivem-mods-for-gta-online-enhanced-edition">Alchemist Will Convert FiveM Mods for GTA Online Enhanced Edition</h2>



<p>According to a new <a href="https://forum.cfx.re/t/introducing-alchemist-for-fivem/5366795" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> by Cfx.re (via <a href="https://rockstarintel.com/new-fivem-conversion-tool-released-by-rockstar-games-owned-team/#google_vignette" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rockstar Intel</a>), Alchemist is the first tool in a series of updates set to arrive for GTA 5 Enhanced Edition to support FiveM. The new tool will allow players, server owners, and creators to convert assets that were originally made for the GTA 5 Legacy edition and make them compatible with the Enhanced Edition. Alchemist also lets users refine existing Legacy assets to address potential formatting or compatibility issues introduced by earlier tools.</p>



<p>The Asset Conversion feature in Alcehmist allows users to convert a folder and all its content automatically. When choosing the folder, Alchemist can identify all GTA 5 Legacy assets inside the subfolders and “convert them to the GTAV Enhanced format inside the selected target directory.” The tool will also copy scripts, interfaces, and configuration files without altering them. </p>



<p>In other news, GTA 6’s delay could <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-delay-could-impact-halo-remake-gears-e-day-next-call-of-duty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">impact the launches</a> of Halo Remake, Gears E-Day, and the next Call of Duty. Additionally, Rockstar’s recent firings have led to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rockstar-hit-with-legal-claim-after-firings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">legal issues</a> with IWGB.

He's now reacted to receiving that nomination, saying he is thrilled, but also making it clear that the credit ought to go to the performance-capture actor, Maxence Cazorla.</p><p>"I am thrilled for this nomination," Cox said at the La Conve/Animex event in Mexico recently. "There is an amazing French actor by the name of Maxence Cazorla who did almost all of the motion capture for that role in that game. Any nomination, or any credit I get, I have to give to him. I believe the performance of that character is really down to him and my voice was just a part of that process."</p><p>Cox was nominated for Best Performance alongside two other Expedition 33 actors, including Ben Starr and Jennifer English. Erika Ishii was nominated for Ghost of Yotei, Konatsu Kato for Silent Hill f, and Troy Baker for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.</p><p>Expedition 33 led all others this year with 12 total nominations, including a nod for Game of the Year. With 12 nominations, that makes it the most-nominated game in the history of The Game Awards.</p><p>The Game Awards take place on Thursday, December 11, but it's expected there will be teases ahead of that, so keep checking back with GameSpot for the latest.</p>

            <p>An upcoming Pokémon game may have a darker story than you'd expect given its cheerful look and typical Nintendo vibrancy. With links to the original Pokémon game trilogy and hints at older lore, what appears to be a quirky spin on the franchise might actually have a sadder side if fan theories are spot on.</p>
<p>That game, for those not tuned into all things Pokémon, is Pokopia. This is an Animal Crossing style game in which you play a Ditto, morphed into human form, and find Pokémon spread around the island in order to restore some life to the place. Cool right?</p>
<p>Well, the extended trailer The Pokémon Company released earlier this month does offer some hints at a more dire tale hidden beneath the surface. First of all, while a Pokémon Centre is present, there are no other buildings. Ruins, sure, but no sign of human life. This is stated explicitly by your in-game guide Professor Tangrowth, who hasn't seen a human in a long time.</p>

<p>So what's happened? Well, there are some clues hidden fans believe which point to an important link to early Pokémon games. For one, the Pokédex seen at the start of the extended trailer is a generation one Pokédex, which offers a good starting point for where Pokopia takes place. Secondly, the game is set on an island, a key detail to the puzzle.</p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/1oxrrpd/cant_unsee_the_connection_after_rumors/">Pokémon fans believe the game may be set on Cinnabar island from the Kanto region</a>. This location was a key spot where the fire gym was located in the first generation Pokémon games: Blue, Red, and Yellow. However, by the time Pokémon Gold, Silver, and Crystal takes place, the volcano on the island erupts, leaving only the Pokémon centre standing - just like the starting town we see in the Pokopia trailer.</p>
<p>Following this eruption the entire island is evacuated, explaining the lack of people present on the island despite clear evidence of buildings, roads, etc. In case you think this isn't enough evidence, there's actually more proof Pokémon Pokopia takes place on a post-eruption Cinnabar. Ditto, who you take control of in Pokopia, can only be found in one spot in the generation one Pokémon games: Pokémon Mansion. If this games <em>does</em> take place between the generation one and two Pokémon games, where else could a Ditto come from?</p>
<p>If we accept Pokémon Pokopia is set in Cinnabar Island it explains a lot of the new Pokémon we see in the trailer too. Pokémon Mansion is where a lot of experiments on Pokémon took place - it's where Mewtwo was created - so it's not out of the question to say other tinkering may have happened.</p>
<p>Failing that, the new Pokémon like Mosslax could simply be a Snorlax left in the same spot mid-sleep, uninterrupted for a super long time. Without people around, it's not out of the question. Maybe Smearguru is what happens when Smeargle is left alone to paint without interruption. Cinnabar may also explain the ghostly Pikachu we see: Peakychu. If there was a volcanic eruption then, well, maybe they got wiped out? A sad possibility.</p><p>There are alternate theories out there that are equally tantalising. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/1p3sg81/pokopias_world_is_created_by_mewtwo/">Some believe this</a> could be some alternate spin on early Pokémon games where Mewtwo removed humans from the Kanto region. Not entirely off the cards, <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_multiverse">given alternate realities is something the Pokemon franchise has arguably embraced over the years</a>. In the Mystery Dungeon series there are no humans whatsoever, so anything is possible.</p>
<p>It's something fans of the franchise will surely be digging into come March 2026 when Pokémon Pokopia comes out on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. Until then, theories and speculation run amok. Or perhaps, a-Muk.</p>

<p>It's a fantastic comeback, and yet another feather in Kirby's cap; seems the pink puffball can do little wrong on the Switch and Switch 2. We've <em>always</em> loved him, of course. But what about you lovely folks?</p>
<p>Yes, we want to hear what you think of Kirby Air Riders on Switch 2. Have you been blitzing through it all weekend and have some strong thoughts on it? Or have you just dabbled and want to put more time into it? You can give the game a score below and, if you change your mind later, come back and do just that!</p>

<p><em>Thanks for voting! If you've got even more thoughts to share about Kirby Air Riders, hop on that warp star and let us know if you're enjoying the game in the comments.</em></p></section></article><div><p>Alana has been with Nintendo Life since 2022, and while RPGs are her first love, Nintendo is a close second.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-players-trouble-finding-microsd-express-cards-microsd-shortages/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-players-could-have-trouble-finding-microsd-express-cards-if-microsd-shortages-continue.1362826/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>People who upgraded from a Nintendo Switch to a Nintendo Switch 2 quickly learned (if they didn't already know) that the MicroSD cards they used on the original Switch would not work with the Nintendo Switch 2. Instead, the Switch 2 requires <a href="https://wccftech.com/teamgroup-launches-apex-sd7-1-microsd-express-card-for-nintendo-switch-2/">MicroSD Express cards</a> to expand the system's 256 GB of internal storage. Finding those Express cards could, however, become more difficult and more expensive if a current shortage of non-Express MicroSD cards continues.</p>



<p>Why would a shortage of MicroSD cards impact MicroSD Express cards? The answer lies with AI companies. According to an interview with Japanese publication <a href="https://www.itmedia.co.jp/pcuser/articles/2511/22/news019.html?s=31">IT Media</a> (spotted and translated by <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/microsd-cards/large-capacity-microsd-cards-are-now-regularly-out-of-stock-in-japan-as-storage-crunch-claims-another-victim-high-capacity-hdds-are-also-vanishing">Tom's Hardware</a>), while consumers seemingly moving towards using large-capacity MicroSD cards for their storage requirements is part of the issue, the bigger part is how AI companies are swallowing up huge amounts of storage products, including HDDs, SSDs, and MicroSD cards.</p>



<p>"<em>It looks like large-capacity models are getting sucked up for AI use, so we aren't getting any stock at all,</em>" one tech shop owner told IT Media. "<em>Everyone knows what's going on, so even if the price goes up, the drives sell out immediately...and the cycle repeats</em>."</p>



<p>It was already difficult to grab a MicroSD Express card <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-microsd-express-cards-sell-out-amazon-best-buy-1851776846">when the Switch 2 was first revealed</a>. Now, with AI companies swallowing up storage stock, paired with a consumer move to MicroSD and MicroSD Express cards as the more common storage option, as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/ongoing-microsd-shortages-could-have-a-knock-on-effect-for-switch-2-storage-availability">Nintendo Life</a> points out, a shortage and price hike of the only kind of storage cards the Nintendo Switch 2 uses feels inevitable. </p>



<p>Essentially, if you were already looking at <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-first-party-games-like-super-mario-odyssey-get-rare-discount-for-black-friday-2025/">grabbing a new game for your Switch 2</a>, or if you were looking to grab <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-friday-2025-nintendo-switch-2-deals-save-on-console-accessories-and-games/">a Switch 2 console as part of ongoing Black Friday sales</a>, then you would be wise to include a MicroSD Express card in your shopping cart while you can still get one.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloodlines-2-name-chinese-room</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ex-chinese-room-head-says-bloodlines-2-shouldnt-have-been-called-bloodlines-2.1362820/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Chinese Room co-founder and former creative director Dan Pinchbeck has expressed his regret that&nbsp;<em>Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>wasn't called something different, suggesting that his studio felt the game wouldn't serve as a true sequel to the 2004 cult classic.</p>

<p>In an interview with The Goth Boss Podcast's Cat Burton (via <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/dan-pinchbeck-ex-the-chinese-room-was-aware-they-couldnt-make-the-vtmb2-that-fans-wanted-in-time-and-wanted-paradox-to-call-it-something-else.1362589/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ResetEra user doops</a>), Pinchbeck says that he and a former producer at&nbsp;<em>Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>studio Paradox would hold planning sessions for how to get the producers "to not call it&nbsp;<em>Bloodlines 2</em>".</p>

<p>He says that trying to recreate the "magic" of the original&nbsp;<em>Bloodlines&nbsp;</em>is "wrongheaded" in the modern environment, because the finished product wouldn't make anyone happy; fans of the original would be disappointed, and new players would get a "flawed game that was built too fast and with not enough money".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bloodlines-2-chinese-room-comments-combat.jpg?itok=Nva6RQx- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bloodlines-2-chinese-room-comments-combat.jpg?itok=cHg2jW8J 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>There might be a reason&nbsp;<em>Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>doesn't feel much like the first game.</figcaption></figure><p>Pinchbeck reckons that it wasn't possible for The Chinese Room to make a true&nbsp;<em>Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>because the studio had neither the time nor the money to do so; instead, he says his studio approached development from a perspective of what could be done with what it had available.</p>

<p>The result of that was, according to Pinchbeck, something that wasn't&nbsp;<em>Bloodlines 2</em>, nor was it an open-world RPG like&nbsp;<em>Skyrim</em>. Instead, it was something closer to&nbsp;<em>Dishonored</em>, a "tightly focused and true to the mythos" game that, nonetheless, wasn't a&nbsp;<em>Bloodlines&nbsp;</em>sequel.</p>

<p>Judging by the <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/19138/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">critical</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/532790/Vampire_The_Masquerade__Bloodlines_2/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">fan</a> reception to&nbsp;<em>Bloodlines 2</em>, Pinchbeck is right; most people don't really seem to view it as a proper successor to Troika's flawed-but-fun 2004 RPG. Perhaps a change of name might have been a good idea on that front.</p>

<p>Still, even if&nbsp;<em>Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>isn't what it should be, it's perhaps a miracle that the game was released at all, given its lengthy history of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-indefinitely" rel="nofollow">delays</a>, developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-is-back-developed-by-chinese-room" rel="nofollow">changes</a>, and slightly sketchy <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloodlines-2-toreador-lasombra-paywall-removed" rel="nofollow">monetization practices</a>.</p>

            <p>
The former creative director of The Chinese Room's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a> has finally said the quiet part loud and agreed that the game really shouldn't have been called Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2. Have you played Bloodlines 2? What would you have called it? I'm going with Vampire: The Masquerade - Third Cousin Twice Removed.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Speaking to Cat Burton in <a href="https://youtu.be/iyWDyNLAo1E">an hour-long career retrospective</a> passed along by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/how-do-we-get-them-to-not-call-it-bloodlines-2-chinese-room-co-founder-reveals-early-masquerade-doubts/">VGC</a>, The Chinese Room's departed co-founder Dan Pinchbeck revealed that getting publishers Paradox to change the name was an unofficial priority after the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dear-esther">Dear Esther</a> studio <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-is-back-and-now-under-development-by-dear-esther-studio">took charge</a> in 2023.</p>
<p>"Right from the word go, there was one of the producers, then at Paradox, who I'm still friends with, who's now with another publisher," Pinchbeck explained. "We used to sit there and go and have these planning sessions of: 'how do we get them to not call it Bloodlines 2? That feels like the most important thing we do here is to come at this and say this isn't Bloodlines 2. You can't make Bloodlines 2. There's not enough time. There's not enough money'."
</p>
<p>
If Pinchbeck was unsuccessful at getting Bloodlines 2 renamed, The Chinese Room did apparently succeed in persuading Paradox to publish a more constricting breed of bloodsucker. "I came in and went, 'we can't make Bloodlines 2, we can't make <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>, but we can make <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dishonored">Dishonored</a>'," Pinchbeck explained. The Dishonored parallel struck a chord with journos: in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-review">our own review</a>, Dominic Tarason called Bloodlines 2 "a blend of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/batman-arkham-city">Batman: Arkham City</a>, Dishonored and a first-person Streets Of Rage". 
</p><p>
Paradox themselves downplayed the idea that Bloodlines 2 was a direct continuation of the old Bloodlines style <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bloodlines-2-is-more-spiritual-successor-than-sequel-to-a-a-competently-good-game-by-2004-standards-say-paradox">when we spoke to them in October 2024</a>, with Paradox's deputy chief executive officer Mattias Lilja calling the new game a "spiritual successor". 
</p>
<p>
In the same interview, Lilja also opined that aspects of the original Bloodlines "wouldn't fly today", though he didn't go into much detail beyond noting that the 2004 CRPG had a bunch of technical problems. In this week's interview with Burton, Pinchbeck made the same argument a little more colourfully.</p>
<p>"Bloodlines 1 came out at a really interesting period in game development," he said, "when it was the same time as games like Stalker and Shenmue, when you could ship a really ambitious game that was full of bugs and holes, was totally flawed, but the ambition was really exciting." 
</p>
<p>
"A lot of those games, they're real cult games now, but they really weren't very good when you actually broke them apart and analysed them," Pinchbeck continued. "They had great ideas, wonderful ideas, players loved them. But you couldn't get away with it now.
</p><p>
"So trying to recreate that magic in a different environment felt wrongheaded. No one would be happy. You wouldn't make people who loved Bloodlines 1 happy, and you wouldn't make people who didn't know about Bloodlines 1 happy, because they'd never get Bloodlines 2, and they'd always get a flawed game that was built too fast and with not enough money."
</p>
<p>
The worryingly pale elephant in the room here is, of course, the earlier version of Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 that was in development at ill-fated Hardsuit Labs under the narrative leadership of original Bloodlines designer and writer Brian Mitsoda, with former RPS contributor Cara Ellison pitching in as senior narrative designer.</p>
<p>I saw a bit of Hardsuit's game at preview stage in 2019 - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-preview">as did Alice Bee</a> (RPS in peace). Inasmuch as I can still make out the details of that preview session through my rose-tinted goggles, I thought it seemed quite promising. I'm keen to learn how the project stood when Paradox pulled the plug. Back in October 2024, Lilja told me only that "with Hardsuit Labs, we agreed on a vision of what they were gonna make, [and] they had a problem delivering on that."

              <p>One of <a href="https://kotaku.com/intergalactic-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-ps5-actors-1851722128">the biggest surprises at 2024’s trailer-fest The Game Awards</a> was a brand new game from&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us</em> creators Naughty Dog, a sci-fi action-adventure called&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-trailer-1851720900"><em>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</em></a>. Being the first new property from the developer in 12 years, there was good reason to sit up and take notice. Except, following that initial reveal, there was nothing to take notice of. A year later, tipsters are advising us not to get our hopes up for this year’s Geoff-Fest, given the game is very unlikely to be seen.</p> <p>That reveal last year was so compelling. Central character Jordan A. Mun was instantly very appealing, her misanthropic approach to space travel seemingly a result of the falling apart of her previous band of criminals, the Five Aces, as she now appeared to be hunting them all down. Of course, the trailer was also met with a vicious and deeply pathetic backlash from the remaining denizens of X who cannot tolerate the existence of a female video game protagonist who isn’t there for them to fap over before crying themselves to sleep. But idiots aside, it showed truly wonderful acting from Tati Gabrielle as Jordan, and potential for more of the exquisite storytelling that Naughty Dog is known for. If we can just ignore the excruciating ads for Porsche and Adidas.</p>

  <p>But since last November, we’ve not heard a peep, other than just how far away we are from getting this game. In September this year, <a href="https://kotaku.com/intergalactic-heretic-prophet-neil-druckmann-last-us-part-3-hbo-2000624967">game director Neil Druckmann spoke to&nbsp;<em>Variety</em></a> and mentioned that the game is in full development, but spoke of&nbsp;<em>Intergalactic</em>‘s massive scope and budget, suggesting this was nothing imminent. And in the last couple of days, the likes of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1p3zwoe/comment/nq8f5f9/">Jason Schreier</a> and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/grubb.wtf/post/3m6ajw5exkk2p">Jeff Grubb</a> have been telling people that there’s no chance of seeing the game before 2027. (Thanks&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/naughty-dogs-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-reportedly-still-years-from-release-and-dont-expect-to-see-it-at-the-game-awards"><em>IGN</em></a>.)</p>

 <p>Grubb went further, posting to BlueSky that not only is the game likely a couple of years away, but also that “it will not be shown at The Game Awards.”</p>   <p>They were responding to a rumor that spread from an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-2026-release-report/"><em>Insider Gaming</em> article</a>, citing a&nbsp;recent episode of the Dan Allen Gaming podcast, in which former IGN editor and podcast host Colin Moriarty said he&nbsp;“believe[d]” the game would appear at The Game Awards, and called <em>Intergalactic</em> “content complete.” “I think next year it’ll be good to go,” he said, explaining that he had heard from people who’d “interacted with the game,” and based on Naughty Dog hiring for localization.</p> <div role="listitem" aria-roledescription="message" data-qa-hover="true" data-qa="virtual-list-item" data-qa-unprocessed="false" data-qa-placeholder="false" id="message-list_1763995661.805549" tabindex="-1" aria-setsize="-1" data-item-key="1763995661.805549"> <p>This inspired others to jump in and suggest the complete opposite, with Moriarty himself saying they were just personal speculation. But if we know anything in 2025, it’s that big games take <em>forever</em> to make, with colossal budgets and enormous scope meaning entire businesses ride or die on their individual success. <em>Intergalactic</em> will appear when it’s good and ready, no matter how frustrating that might be for us as we impatiently wait for more details.</p> </div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-6-rockstar-fired-union-workers-legal-2000643030"><span>Rockstar fired 34 developers back in October</span></a><span>. While Rockstar claims these </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-rockstar-games-union-busting-delay-2000640525"><span>people were fired for “gross misconduct</span></a><span>” over allegedly sharing company secrets, the former employees claim the company was union-busting. Now, according to a new </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TvWNFBBwuY"><i><span>People Make Games</span></i></a> <span>report, the entire saga actually started after Rockstar started cracking down on developers communicating about non-work topics in the company Slack.</span></p> <p><i><span>People Make Games </span></i><span>posted a new video that includes alleged messages from the Rockstar union workers’ private Discord server where members discussed conditions at the studio, but specifically not the status of projects like the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-november-rockstar-games-2000641787"><span>recently delayed </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto 6</span></i></a><span>. One former Rockstar employee claimed the only company information that was shared there were emails about updates to the company’s Slack guidelines following discussions in recently shut down channels.</span></p>

 <p><span>In October, Rockstar reportedly made changes to the company’s Slack, which included removing several miscellaneous channels where employees discussed non-work topics like pets, hobbies, and games they were playing. The “Slack Purge,” as it was called, prompted discussions in an outside union channel on Discord. This was then followed by another change preventing people from using emojis in their Slack statuses, which workers theorized was to prevent people from using the Palestinian flag or the Sprout emoji used to symbolize Union support.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>These emails were sent outside of work hours, and Rockstar has systems set up so workers cannot access their work email outside of their office. As such, Union members sent these emails to the Discord so people outside of the office could see their contents, which led to one member of the Discord expressing their concerns to management about the discussions. </span><i><span>PMG</span></i><span> theorizes that Rockstar gained access to the Discord at this point and read the previous chat logs to make a case for firing 34 workers by the end of that month.</span></p>

 <p><span>You can watch the full video below:</span></p>  <p>Rockstar limiting workers’ email access may have started this entire mess, but as&nbsp;<em>People Make Games&nbsp;</em>explains, the company has been the subject of several high profile leaks over the years, including a <a href="https://kotaku.com/gtavi-gta-vi-gta-6-grand-theft-auto-leak-video-dump-1849550414">massive data dump of unfinished <em>Grand Theft Auto 6&nbsp;</em>assets and footage back in 2022</a>. So it’s not entirely surprising that the studio has a lot of internal communications on lock and key to prevent leaks. That being said, as the IWGB Game Workers Union lays out in the video, discussing your working conditions is not the same as freely posting&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto VI&nbsp;</em>footage on a Discord server, and should fall under protected union discussions.</p>

 <p>In the weeks since Rockstar fired these workers, those affected have been holding protests outside both Rockstar and publisher Take Two’s London offices. Despite being fired, several members have expressed a desire to come back and finish working on&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>, which is still a year away after its recent delay.</p> <p><strong>Update, 11/24/25, 10:43 a.m. EST: </strong>An IWGB representative has released a statement to <em>Kotaku</em>, claiming the Discord was only used for sharing the information laid out in the&nbsp;<em>PMG</em> video, and that there were “strict policies” against sharing confidential updates on internal projects like&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>. The full statement reads as follows:</p> <div dir="auto" data-qa="virtual-list-item" role="listitem" aria-roledescription="message" data-qa-hover="true" data-qa-unprocessed="false" data-qa-placeholder="false" id="message-list_1763998870.447709" tabindex="0" aria-setsize="-1" data-item-key="1763998870.447709"> <p>“Obviously we can’t get in the minds of Rockstar management to know what they were referring to when they referred to leaked information – they’ve provided us with about as much (or less) information than they have put out in public statements. We can confirm that the Discord was only used for discussing information related to organising, such as the decision to remove Slack channels and pay and bonuses as the video mentions, and that there were strict policies about sharing confidential information.”</p> </div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Galaxy Watch 7 is currently <strong>ranked #1 as Amazon’s Best Seller in smartwatches</strong>, ahead of all Apple Watch models. Sales are skyrocketing on Black Friday, with one simple truth: value trumps brand loyalty when the price is right. This <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5766/">2024 model is down to nearly half price at $129 from its original $249 (48% off)</a>. You’re taking here zero risk on a smartwatch that thousands are buying.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5766/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Galaxy AI That Understands Your Body</h2>
<p>It uses <strong>Galaxy AI analysis to calculate your physical readiness</strong> every morning. The watch builds up data on yesterday’s activity, quality of sleep, variation in heart rate, and recovery measures. Your phone then processes the information overnight and gives you a personalized score that lets you know how hard to push today. Low energy days indicate lighter workouts or rest, while high scores show your body is ready for intense training.</p>
<p><strong>Heart rate monitoring gets a serious boost from Galaxy AI</strong> filtering that takes into consideration the movement of the body. Conventional optical sensors are hardly accurate during high-intensity exercises when your arm is always in motion. The Galaxy Watch 7 introduces sophisticated algorithms that separate your actual heart rate signal from motion artifacts. You get reliable readings during high-intensity intervals, running, cycling, and strength training. This kind of accuracy matters when you’re training in specific heart rate zones or monitoring cardiovascular health.</p>



<p>Detailed analysis of sleep stages and quality goes beyond basic time-in-bed measurement. The watch tracks your sleep cycles throughout the night, monitoring light sleep, deep sleep, and REM phases of your sleep. Galaxy AI analyzes this data and gives you meaningful insights into your sleep patterns and habits. This feature screens for moderate to severe sleep apnea that may need medical attention. And you also get personalized recommendations to improve the quality of sleep based on your sleep patterns.</p>
<p>Wellness tips provide <strong>personalized recommendations that adjust to your real behavior and objectives</strong>. Your watch tracks detailed health information all day and night. Your connected phone then uses Galaxy AI to create relevant tips from those insights. Recommendations may include adjusting the time you work out, drinking more water, or going to bed earlier. Advice changes as your habits change and you receive coaching that remains pertinent to your life</p>
<p>Performance tracking lets you compare current workouts to previous efforts in real-time. Running the same route? The watch shows whether you’re ahead or behind your last pace. Cycling your regular loop? See instantly if you’re improving or struggling today. It’s this type of comparative data which encourages you to push that little bit harder or helps you realize when your body might need recovery.</p>



<p>The <strong>40mm case size fits comfortably on smaller wrists</strong> without looking oversized. The Green colorway provides a fresh alternative to standard black and silver options. Battery life reaches approximately <strong>30 hours with typical use</strong>, covering a full day plus some buffer. Charging happens via the included wireless charger that snaps magnetically to the back. <strong>Water resistance up to 5ATM</strong> protects during swimming, showering, and sweaty workouts.</p>
<p>The <strong>touchscreen display stays readable in bright sunlight</strong> and dims automatically in darkened rooms. Rotating bezel navigation comes with tactile control that works with sweaty or gloved fingers. From minimalist time displays to data-rich fitness dashboards, watch faces can be customized as needed. Notification mirroring from your phone keeps you connected without constantly needing to check your device. The <strong>watch works both with Android and iOS</strong>, though Android users get deeper integration features.</p>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 provides AI-powered health tracking at almost half the retail price this Black Friday for $129. This happens to be the #1 best-selling smartwatch on Amazon because the feature-to-price ratio finally makes sense. Want comprehensive health tracking without paying Apple Watch prices? This record-low deal takes every excuse off the table.</p>

<p>Your graphics card is going to get even more expensive. According to a new report from Taiwan’s UND, AMD is set to raise the cost of its GPUs due to rising memory costs.</p>



<p>This follows recent rumors that the company had begun notifying its board partners of the plan. </p>



<p><strong>“The continuous rise in memory prices has led to a sharp increase in graphics card costs,”</strong> <a href="https://money.udn.com/money/story/11162/9158350?from=edn_maintab_index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the report says</a> via machine translation. <strong>“Industry sources indicate that AMD, the second-largest graphics card manufacturer, has notified its partners of a second price increase across its entire product line. </strong></p>



<p><strong>“The increase is estimated to be at least 10%.”</strong></p>



<p>As of writing, you can still get AMD graphics cards for somewhat affordable prices. This new price point is likely to go into effect for new builds and next-gen cards. </p>



<p>It’s worth noting that AMD has yet to officially confirm its plans, so this claim should still be taken with a grain of salt until it happens. That said, Insider Gaming has reached out to AMD for clarification on what graphics cards will be impacted and if ones already manufactured will be hit with a price increase. Should a response be received, it will be added to this article.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>As a cyclist, I have a <a href="https://aftermath.site/zohran-mamdani-scavenger-hunt/" rel="noreferrer">bad habit</a> of ignoring directions and navigating by vibes. I'll look at whatever route Google Maps spits out, agree it seems reasonable, and then completely ignore it in favor of getting somewhere based on a deeply personal sense of how I think roads fit together, using landmarks like "It's the street with the bar where I fought with my ex once" or "I think it's near the place that had good vegan sandwiches 20 years ago." This almost always works <em>eventually</em>, even if it's inefficient. My friends don't get it, but <a href="https://aftermath.site/despelote-review/" rel="noreferrer"><em>Despelote</em></a><em> </em>creator Julián Cordero gets it.</p><p>Cordero's <em>Bike Race: New York City</em> was one of four games I saw at Saturday's <a href="https://gamecenter.nyu.edu/event/no-quarter-2025/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">No Quarter</a> exhibition at the NYU Game Center. No Quarter is an annual showcase of games commissioned by the game design department; the event is always a fun time, and the games are always the good kind of weird. Cordero described <em>Bike Race</em> in a written blurb by saying that, as a daily cyclist, "I tend to be very late to things and I always think I can catchup on time by biking faster. This is a game about that."</p><p><em>Bike Race</em> uses two repurposed Citi Bikes as controllers. (Game Center chair Naomi Clark told me one of the bikes had been found abandoned, and the other had been decommissioned recently.) The bikes are imposed onto a scan of New York City, similar to a <a href="https://youtu.be/VIHZYGKbjp4?si=rSF9cRmgSlAaHhlJ&amp;t=4719&amp;ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">late game level</a> in <em>Despelote</em>. Two players have to race to a real location, while the game encourages spectators to use Google Maps and shout out directions to help them get there.</p><p>The bikes aren't easy to control; turning is imprecise, and pedaling feels like it's on a kind of delay that made it hard to keep up my momentum. This meant a lot of careening up buildings or flying off the tops of cars, though wrestling with the bike <em>did</em> feel a lot like riding a real Citi Bike. All of this is made more difficult by the scan of the city, which turns a place I've biked for decades into a blobby nightmare of vaguely familiar buildings and streets.</p><figure data-kg-thumbnail="https://aftermath.site/content/media/2025/11/noqmov2_thumb.jpg" data-kg-custom-thumbnail="">

        <img src="https://aftermath.site/content/media/2025/11/noqmov2_thumb.jpg"></figure><p>When I played, I was tasked with getting to the <a href="https://www.tenement.org/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">Tenement Museum</a>, a place I have biked by approximately ten million times and even have a friend who worked there. I knew it was downtown somewhere; I had an intense <em>feeling</em> of who I was when I was regularly nearby, and vivid memories of navigating the neighborhood on a bike I had kitted out in distinctive bands of red and black gaffer tape. But trying to turn all that into lefts and rights, especially without street signs, was thrillingly hard. The people watching me eventually surmised our game had started in midtown and we needed to go south, but I quickly ended up too far south, though quite how far wasn't clear until someone recognized a white building and realized we'd somehow gone to City Hall. Trying to get from City Hall to the Tenement Museum– again, a ride I have made countless times--became a stressful, dreamy, impossible journey. I swapped places with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/yussef-cole?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">games journalist</a>  <a href="https://bulletpointsmonthly.com/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">Yussef Cole</a> and quickly Google Mapped the museum. Yussef was able to identify its location of Delancey Street, but we couldn't locate the cross streets in <em>Bike Race</em>'s version of NYC; going east, we hit the Williamsburg Bridge without finding it, and as Yussef peddled frantically back toward the west, the other player beat us to it.</p>

<p>Some players I spectated had to get to No Quarter, which means Brooklyn must be in the game too. Other games I watched ended up by the Intrepid on the west side and the spot at the bottom tip of Manhattan where you can see both the Brooklyn and Manhattan bridges. But there were lesser, more personal landmarks too: a random bank placed just so on a corner that made me realize we were near my undergrad college, or a storefront that made me yell unhelpfully "we're on that street in Chinatown with all the lamp stores!" </p><figure data-kg-thumbnail="https://aftermath.site/content/media/2025/11/noquartvid_thumb.jpg" data-kg-custom-thumbnail="">

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-breaks-its-own-pricing-rules-airpods-max-hits-a-wild-black-friday-low-2000646662</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple-breaks-its-own-pricing-rules-airpods-max-hits-a-wild-black-friday-low.1362778/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Discounts on Apple’s products are few and far between. This is true for both the latest releases and most older generation models that still perform well. But thanks to Black Friday and Cyber Monday, that changes today.</p>
<p>Even though the events are technically still a few days away, early deals have started popping it. There’s a wide range of items to grab, from tech essentials to kitchen appliances, games, outdoor gear, and even toys! We also just spotted Apple AirPods Max — one of the best wireless headphones out there — at a discount.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5865/">These headphones usually sit at $550, but they can be yours for $430 today. That’s after a sweet 22% discount.</a> The offer applies to blue, orange, starlight, and purple color options. Those after the classic black version can grab it for $479. There are no weirdly long coupon codes or complicated checkout processes to worry about. Just add the product to your cart, and the discount applies automatically. Prime members will also enjoy free shipping on their orders.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5865/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Pro-Level Active Noise Cancellation</h2>
<p>The headphones don’t just look good; they are comfortable to wear, too. The pair is designed with a knit-mesh canopy and memory foam ear cushions that fit nicely to seal the sound in. Unlike most over-ear headphones, these don’t apply unnecessary pressure to the ears, which means you can wear them for longer without feeling uneasy.</p>
<p>Carring them around safely won’t be a problem either, thanks to the color-matched smart case that’s included in the box for free. Plus, since there are multiple fresh colors to choose from, you can pick one that suits your aesthetics the best. Like your audio gear a bit on the minimal side? The black or starlight options can be a great pick. Want something with a bit more personality? The purple version is stunning!</p>
<p>Performance-wise, these are packed with a dynamic driver and the Apple H1 chip for rich, high-fidelity audio. There’s Active Noise Cancellation that blocks all background sound for a more immersive experience, even in noisy, chaotic settings. This feature is great for when you really want to focus on a task (or vibe to a track) without any distractions. Just put these on, and block the outside world for as long as you want.</p>



<p>Of course, that doesn’t work for every situation. Sometimes, it’s better to be aware of what’s happening around you. For that, you’ve got the Transparency mode. This one lets ambient sound in while still delivering deep, quality audio. You can enjoy what’s playing, plus stay in touch with the world. This mode is best when you’re travelling and don’t want to miss your stop, or when you’re in a cafe and want to hear the barista call your name.</p>
<p>Spatial Audio is supported, too. This mode pushes sound that suits your unique ear shape for a 3D experience. The headphones are also smart enough to pause the audio automatically when you take them off! Tweaking other settings doesn’t require pulling your phone out, either. You can adjust volume, mute yourself on calls, skip tracks, and more using the digital crown right there on the headphones.</p>
<p>Pairing these with your device is straightforward. You can place the headphones near your iPhone, iPad, or Mac, and just tap Connect on the screen to get started.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5865/">The current deal brings the price of this high-end pair to $430.</a> We know it’s still a bit of an investment, but the discount somewhat makes these a bit more approachable. If you’ve been wanting to grab premium headphones from Apple for less, today is the day to make the move.</p>

              <p>Both storage variants of the Galaxy S25 Ultra have <strong>crashed to all-time low prices</strong> on Amazon for Black Friday: The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4640/">256GB model drops from $1,299 to $949</a>, while the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4640/">512GB version falls from $1,419 to $1,019</a>. With these prices well undercutting Samsung’s own website, Amazon is the clear winner on this flagship purchase. At these lower prices, the S25 Ultra competes with the iPhone 17 Pro, and many would argue Samsung gives you more features for less cash.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4640/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Best Smartphone</h2>
<p>The screen of the <strong>6.8-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X runs at a native 3088 x 1440 resolution</strong> with adaptive <strong>refresh rates from 1Hz to 120Hz</strong>. Lowering its refresh rate to 1Hz while displaying static images, this screen dynamically adjusts its refresh rate depending upon content; it ramps up to 120Hz in the case of gaming and scrolling. The peak brightness goes up to 2600 nits for great outdoor visibility even under direct sunlight. This <strong>display supports HDR10+</strong> for stunning color reproduction in compatible content. It also has the toughened Gorilla Glass Victus 3 to protect it against scratches and drops with undiminished touch sensitivity.</p>
<p>The <strong>Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chip</strong> represents the most powerful mobile silicon currently available. This custom variant happens to run slightly faster than the standard Snapdragon 8 Elite in other flagship phones. The octa-core architecture handles demanding games and 4K video editing, and heavy multitasking without breaking a sweat. AI processing happens locally on the device through dedicated neural processing cores.</p>



<p><strong>Battery capacity reaches 5000mAh</strong> to provide all-day endurance even for demanding users. This efficient processor and adaptive display work together to make the most of your day. <strong>Fast 45W charging takes the phone from zero to 65% in about 30 minutes</strong>. Wireless charging at 15W offers cable-free convenience when at a desk or nightstand. You will be able to top up Galaxy Buds or a friend’s phone by merely placing them on the back of your S25 Ultra with reverse wireless charging.</p>
<p>The camera system consists of a <strong>quad-lens setup that competes with independent cameras</strong>: The primary 200MP wide sensor captures exceptional detail that can be used for aggressive cropping without losing quality. A 50MP periscope telephoto delivers 5x optical zoom on subjects far away. The secondary telephoto provides 3x optical zoom for portraits and shots in the middle distance; it has a resolution of 10MP. The 12MP ultra-wide captures wide-screen shots with a field of view up to 120 degrees.</p>
<p>Video capabilities <strong>encompass 8K recording at 30fps or 4K at 60fps with exceptional stabilization</strong>. Super Steady video mode removes shake during walking or running. Director’s View lets one see all camera angles simultaneously and seamlessly switch between views when recording. Pro video controls give filmmakers manual exposure, focus, and audio level adjustments.</p>
<p>The <strong>built-in S Pen</strong> turns this phone into a productivity powerhouse: Taking handwritten notes feels natural on the responsive stylus, feeling like pen-on-paper feedback. Annotate screenshots, sign documents, and even sketch out your next idea without needing any extra accessories. The pen stores inside the phone body, where it is always ready should inspiration strike.</p>
<p>Starting at $949 for 256GB or $1,019 for 512GB, Galaxy S25 Ultra offers flagship performance that has never been this affordable on Black Friday. If you want the best Android phone available, period, these record-low prices finally make the premium features accessible.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/what-is-hytale-hytale-v-minecraft-comparison-explained.1362769/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The thought-lost Hytale project has arisen. Hypixel Studios has resumed work on the upcoming sandbox game, and it’s drawing plenty of comparisons to Minecraft. If you’re unsure of what the game is and why people are so excited, this guide has a full explainer for you.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/riot-games-shuts-down-hypixel-studios-cancels-hytale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hytale was officially canceled</a> in mid-2025 after 10 years of development. The title’s complexity was deemed one of the main factors in the game (and Hypel Studios) closure. There were also suggestions that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-hytale-dev-says-issues-were-all-internal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘issues were all internal’</a>. </p>



<p>However, merely months later, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-back-reacquired-hypixel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hytale was brought back to life</a> by founder, Simon Collins-Laflamme. </p>







<p>Here we are in late 2025 with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-early-access-release-date-announcement-coming-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hytale about to enter early access</a>, and many still don’t know what it is.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-hytale">What Is Hytale?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Lots to do and explore. Credit to Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Hytale is a sandbox game that allows you to create, build, and explore a procedurally generated world.</strong></p>



<p>From its blocky art style to the ability to uncover and unearth your innermost building skills, Hytale bears resemblance to another popular sandbox game (more on this later), but has more than enough of its own nuances to stand out.</p>







<p>Hytale was initially devised as a Hypixel server in Minecraft. After the spin-off server’s revenue potential was stunted by Mojang-enforced EULA changes in 2014, the idea was coined to make Hytale a standalone game.</p>



<p>Here’s how the official Hytale website describes the game:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Hytale blends the freedom of a sandbox with the momentum of an RPG: explore a procedurally generated world full of dungeons, secrets, and a variety of creatures, then shape it block by block. Our Early Access release focuses on polished core systems – exploration, responsive combat, and robust building – alongside creator‑first tools for making your own content, crafting minigames, and running community servers.</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 id="h-is-hytale-an-mmo">Is Hytale An MMO?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, Hytale is described as an MMO (Massively Multiplayer Online) game as players will be able to interact and share the same game space in servers.</strong></p>



<p>In the developer’s words: “Why not invite a friend or two to share the experience and leave a mark on the world together?”</p>



<p>The game features player-run servers and encourages the Hytale community to bond and come together. It’s unclear how many people can be in one server at a time, but make no mistake that the MMO aspect is real.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-hytale-like-minecraft">Is Hytale Like Minecraft?</h2>



<p><strong>Despite being developed as a Minecraft server within Minecraft, meaning it is like the game, to an extent, Hytale is its own game, and doesn’t claim to be like Minecraft.</strong></p>



<p>The Minecraft comparison feels obvious at first glance. However, once you watch the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-early-access-coming-soonand-shows-off-16-minutes-of-minecraft-like-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hytale gameplay</a> and understand the devs’ vision, it might be more appropriate to describe it as ‘the <em>next </em>Minecraft.’</p>



<p>An emphasis on variety with creation tools, mini-games, and the encouragement to share worlds and have players in your server is a big part of Hytale’s identity. The combat is more extensive, and it leans further into RPG elements.</p>



<p>You should check out a 16-minute gameplay trailer to see it for yourself.</p>

<p>You better believe that Hytale will be very popular once it hits early access.

            <p>Charlie Cox won himself a Game Awards nomination for his work voicing Gustave in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>. However, while the actor is understandably delighted to see his contribution recognised, he says as much of the credit needs to go to Gustave's motion performance actor, Maxence Cazorla.</p>
<p>Cox recently reacted to his Best Performance nomination while speaking at a panel (<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@posta.entretenimiento/video/7575433617237642517">recorded by POSTA Entretenimiento</a>). "Yes, I'm thrilled for this nomination," Cox said, before immediately praising Cazorla's part in bringing the Clair Obscur character to life.</p>

<p>"I've said this before, and I think it is important to say that there's an amazing French actor by the name of Maxence Cazorla who did almost all of the motion capture for that role," Cox shared with the audience.</p>
<p>"And so, any nomination or any credit I get, I really have to give to him, because I really believe that the performance of that character is down to him, and my voice was just part of that process."</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Cox admitted that while Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has been met with critical acclaim, he personally feels "like a total fraud". Why? Because it turns out that the actor recorded <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/daredevils-charlie-cox-feels-like-a-total-fraud-following-clair-obscur-expedition-33-praise">most of his lines in only about four hours as part of a voice over gig set up by his agent</a>.</p><p>Cox is not the only Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 cast member to be up for the Best Performance award at this year's Game Awards. Both Ben Starr and Jennifer English have also been nominated for their part in Sandfall's turn-based RPG. Meanwhile, the title is also up for Game of the Year, alongside <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> and Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2.</p>
<p>With 12 nominations to its name, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has made Game Awards history by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-makes-game-awards-history-as-most-nominated-game-ever">becoming the most nominated game since the show's conception</a>.</p>

<h2>Dungeons &amp; Dragons Holiday Gift Guide</h2>

<h3>Dungeons &amp; Dragons - Starter Set: Heroes of The Borderlands</h3>

<p>There is nothing better to buy for someone that wants to get into <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> with some friends or family than the Heroes of the Borderlands Starter Set. It comes with everything a brand new player and DM will need to get started playing the game. It's the perfect gift for someone that's been curious to give the game a try.</p>

<h3>Dungeons &amp; Dragons Stranger Things: Welcome to The Hellfire Club Adventure Game</h3>

<p>For many, <em>D&amp;D</em> caught their eye when <em>Stranger Things</em> came out. If you're a fan of the show, this lets you play as the <em>D&amp;D </em>heroes the characters of the show actually play as. This is great for people new to <em>D&amp;D</em>, with a lot of the same things as the Starter Set above. But, it's also a good time for <em>D&amp;D</em> veterans who want some<em> Stranger Things</em> flavor.</p>

<p>Check <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-5e-2024-dungeon-masters-guide-review-true-dms-best-friend" rel="nofollow">our review</a> for more specific information, but if you have anyone you know that's interested in becoming a DM for <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, this is THE book to get. It has all of the information they'll need to get going and is considered one of the core rulebooks of the game. The starter sets may be a better option for someone just dipping their toes, but this is great for someone that's ready to jump in fully.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024 Player's Handbook</h3>

<p>If you already have the 2014 Player's Handbook and some of the expansions released later, this probably isn't needed. And if someone in the player group has one already, you probably don't need one of your own. But, this is still one of the "core" books for<em> D&amp;D</em> that includes all of the nitty gritty details to play the game. Everything a player would need to know.</p>

<h3>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024 Monster Manual</h3>

<p>This is the final core book that would flesh out just about everything anyone would need to know to play as expansive a game of D&amp;D as they would want. It details all of the most popular monsters in <em>D&amp;D</em>, how to make a monster and use them, and everything else. With the updated layout that is easier to use, this is a great pick up for a veteran <em>D&amp;D</em> fan who may not have sprung for the newer manual yet.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dji-neo-mini-drone-reaches-its-lowest-price-that-makes-it-easier-than-ever-to-pick-up-this-black-friday.1362733/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Comparing today’s drones to the ones from just 10 short years ago isn’t&nbsp;<em>quite</em> like comparing a MacBook to the UNIVAC, but the differences are truly incredible. One of the best examples of how drones have become infinitesimally smaller, more user-friendly, and priced for everyone is the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5864/">DJI Neo, a palm-sized 0.3-pound wonder that’s a terrific early Black Friday deal at just $159 at Amazon.&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>What the DJI Neo does best is something its ancient ancestors from 2015 could never even dream of doing — AI-powered subject tracking that allows it to follow you and keep you in frame while you’re in motion, all while shooting 4K Ultra HD video and somehow not crashing into anything. Unlike its predecessors that were mainly geared toward big sweeping landscape shots — and only after you mastered the art of flying it — the Neo accomplishes all of its many fun photographic features while not even requiring a remote control.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5864/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Long-Haul Flight</h2>
<p>The DJI Neo has 18 minutes of flight time per battery charge, which gives you ample time to have it follow and shoot amazingly stable 4K Ultra HD video of you or another subject, hover or circle for beautiful group photos, or go on fast acrobatic flights that result in amazing action videos.</p>
<p>Getting started with the Neo could not be easier. Take it in your palm, press the mode button to select how you want to shoot (including Circle mode where the drone orbits you at a fixed altitude to shoot amazing 360-degree video, among other great action modes), and it takes off from your hand. When it’s done, it returns and lands in your hand. It has built-in guards for its four propellers to protect both your hands and the drone itself, and also to make indoor flight and shoots an option.</p>



<h2>Tag, Shoot, Enjoy</h2>
<p>The Neo is incredibly easy to control, and by many methods. Add the DJI Fly app to your smartphone and the Neo becomes a voice-controlled flyer that responds to spoken flight directives. The app can also be used as a remote, with virtual joysticks appearing on the screen and point-of-view images from the Neo’s camera. If you’re locked into the idea of a remote, DJI’s RC-N3 Remote Controller (sold separately) will do the trick.</p>
<p>Our favorite potential method of flight control? DJI’s Goggles (either the 3 or the N3) combined with the RC Motion 3 or FPV Remote Controller 3. They’re all sold separately, and you’ll probably want to wait until you totally have the hang of flying the Neo, but the goggles are an incredible and immersive experience where you feel like you’re the one flying. The Neo is also able to transmit video from up to 10 kilometers, so there are virtually no limits on your flight range.</p>
<p>It can be a little unnerving to see the tiny Neo fly out of your sightline, but the Return to Home command can be delivered to the drone via app (or by hand motion if it’s close to you), with failsafe navigation that brings it home safely.</p>
<p>The DJI Neo is an incredible holiday gift option thanks to its virtually limitless possibilities for creating amazing videos, its ease of use, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5864/">its even more accessible than usual price of just $159 during this Amazon pre-Black Friday Deal.&nbsp;</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sonos-goes-zero-profit-on-beam-brand-new-soundbar-is-now-cheaper-than-used-refurbs-2000646822</link>

              <p>Sonos has earned its reputation as the <strong>premium choice in home audio</strong> through years of engineering excellence and ecosystem refinement. The Beam soundbar (now second generation) is their <strong>most accessible entry point into high-quality soundbar</strong> territory, and it punches well above its weight class.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5728/">$349, down from $499, this Dolby Atmos soundbar has hit an all-time low price on Amazon</a> for Black Friday. Competing soundbars from Samsung and Bose struggle to match the combination of sound quality, features, and ecosystem integration that Sonos delivers at this price point.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5728/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Dolby Atmos That Makes a Difference</h2>
<p><strong>Dolby Atmos’ 3D surround sound effect</strong> creates an immersive audio experience that will totally change movie nights. Height channels bounce the sound off your ceiling to create overhead effects during action sequences and atmospheric moments. Helicopters fly over your head, rain falls from above, and explosions surround you from every side. The Beam Gen 2 achieves <strong>this spatial audio through psychoacoustic processing</strong> and some seriously clever speaker placement inside the compact bar.</p>
<p><strong>Crystal clear dialogue reproduction</strong> ensures you never miss the important conversations or plot details. This is ensured by a dedicated center channel that focuses on vocal frequencies carrying speech. Background music and sound effects stay separated from dialogue, avoiding the muddy mix that plagues cheaper soundbars. You can finally stop reaching for the remote to adjust the volume when scenes switch between quiet dialogue and loud action.</p>



<p>The bass performance is well above expectations for such a compact soundbar: The lively low-end adds weight to movie soundtracks and music playback without overwhelming other frequencies. You feel the rumble of engines and the thump of music bass lines. The bass stays tight and controlled rather than boomy or muddy. Many users find the bass output sufficient without adding a separate subwoofer, though Sonos makes it easy to expand later if desired.</p>
<p>The Sonos app is your key to intuitively<strong> controlling all your audio settings and streaming services</strong>. You’ll tweak EQ settings, manage multiple Sonos speakers across your home, and access music from dozens of streaming services. Music streaming works independently when the TV is off, turning your soundbar into a capable music speaker. Radio, podcasts, and audiobooks all play through that superior sound system you’ve already installed for your TV.</p>



<p>Set up is simple, requiring just two cables: <strong>one to your TV via HDMI and one to a power outlet</strong>. A single HDMI ARC or eARC connection for audio input to the soundbar also enables TV remote control pass-through. Control volume and power with your existing TV remote; no programming or separate controls are required. Apple AirPlay 2 support lets you stream directly from iPhones and iPads.</p>
<p>At $349, the Sonos Beam Gen 2 is offering high-end soundbar performance for 30% off retail this Black Friday. None of the competing Samsung or Bose soundbars at this price offer the complete package you’re getting here from Sonos.</p>

<p>Palworld’s Ultrakill crossover finally has a release date, and the update is scheduled to arrive on December 17, 2025. </p>



<p>Pocketpair announced Palworld’s crossover with the fast-paced, ultraviolent retro FPS, Ultrakill, back in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworlds-next-crossover-is-with-ultrakill/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">September 2025</a>; however, at the time, we were only told that players would be able to experience iconic weapons from the FPS. Now, a new trailer reveals all the content the crossover entails, along with a tease for update 1.0.</p>



<h2 id="h-home-sweet-home-update-as-ultrakill-collab-along-with-new-base-customization-options">Home Sweet Home Update as Ultrakill Collab Along with New Base Customization Options</h2>



<p>The new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq8ey7cKfYo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">trailer</a> kicks off with an Ultrakill character showcasing all the latest weapons players can use in Palworld with the upcoming update. A few of these weapons have shots that can change their trajectories mid-travel to hit their targets, and some have explosive capabilities as well. Some weapons also have the ability to deflect some attacks right back at the Pals with the help of coins. The Home Sweet Home update will also add the ability to colour your bases, along with the new customization option. </p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>That’s not all: towards the end of the trailer, we cut to a black screen, with the music and theme completely changing. For a split second, we see a humongous Pal’s silhouette intimidating the characters in the area before the trailer ends with the words, “Palworld 1.0 -2026”. For those unaware, the release of Palworld 1.0 will mark the game’s exit from early access, and its release window was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-1-0-release-window-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> earlier this year. </p>



<p>In other news, Nintendo’s patent in the Palworld dispute is being reexamined by the USPTO. Additionally, an anti-Palworld patent was recently rejected in Japan.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-suffers-worst-launch-in-20-year-history/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-ops-7-suffers-worst-japan-launch-in-20-year-franchise-history.1362724/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It wasn’t beyond the realms of possibility for Black Ops 7 to struggle in 2025. The shooter market is fierce, and the impact of rival franchises seems to have hit Black Ops 7 hard, as it’s recorded the worst Japanese retail launch sales ever in the series.</p>



<p>The poor reception to Modern Warfare 3 didn’t stop Black Ops 6 from bringing the franchise back with a bang. It was a tough task for Black Ops 7 to repeat this success, and early gameplay footage and trailers didn’t do much for the game’s hopes. The realisation hit home hard when it was reported that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-sales-are-down-50-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7 sales were down 50% in Europe</a>.</p>



<p>Japan’s Black Ops 7 sales have hit a new low.</p>







<h2 id="h-lowest-call-of-duty-retail-sales-in-japanese-history-for-black-ops-7">Lowest Call of Duty Retail Sales In Japanese History For Black Ops 7</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Time for some soul-searching. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7’s first week retail launch sales (shown by <a href="https://x.com/Zuby_Tech" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@Zuby_Tech</a>) were <strong>12,311</strong>—with the PS4 version reportedly adding to this by allegedly selling under 1,800 copies.</p>







<p>According to a graphic, this is lower than 2007’s Call of Duty 3, which registered 14,117 retail launch units. It doesn’t include the first two Call of Duty titles, but there’s every chance that the result would be the same.</p>



<p>The Japanese market certainly isn’t one of the most popular for Call of Duty games. However, when we’re looking at overall data—factoring in Europe sales again—patterns are emerging across the board. Black Ops 7 isn’t being well-received.</p>



<p>It would be interesting to see how Black Ops 7 would have done without competition, but the fact is that Battlefield 6 and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-soared-sales-two-days-market/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a> are both doing exceptionally well with sales and player count numbers. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-player-count-black-ops-7-player-count/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 versus Black Ops 7 player count</a> debate was over in one week.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Interest in Call of Duty is currently as low as it’s been for years. Head to the Insider Gaming Discord Server and share your thoughts on whether this is a wake-up call for Activision or not. What does the company need to do for Call of Duty 2026 to rectify the situation?</p>

                <p>Valve will not say what the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-machine-release-date-price-everything-we-know/1100-6536286/" data-ref-id="1100-6536286">Steam Machine</a>'s price is just yet, and in this information vacuum, people are offering <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-much-will-steam-machine-cost-heres-what-valve-had-to-say-about-pricing/1100-6536161/" data-ref-id="1100-6536161">all kinds of different theories and guesses</a> as to what the six-inch cube-like system may cost. Now, Valve has yet again commented on the pricing question, providing potentially the best clue yet, while also saying the company cannot or will not disclose pricing yet due to "a lot of external things."</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=SskFh89ieBarjGmu&amp;v=yvu66Y2VLq8&amp;feature=youtu.be" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Skill Up</a>--which is co-hosted by GameSpot's Lucy James--Valve software engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais said people can expect the price of the Steam Machine to be close to what it might cost to build a PC with "basically the same level of performance."</p><p>"I think that if you build a PC from parts and get to basically the same level of performance, that's the general price window that we aim to be at," he said, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valve-confirms-steam-machine-will-not-be-subsidized-hardware-like-consoles-and-some-are-questioning-that-strategy-while-bracing-themselves-for-a-current-pc-market-price" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as reported by IGN</a>. "Ideally we'd be pretty competitive with that and have a pretty good deal, but we're working on refining that as we speak. Right now is just a hard time to have a really good idea of what the price is going to be because there's a lot of different things… a lot of external things."</p><p>Those "external things" could be elements like tariffs, which have contributed to growing prices for all manner of goods in 2025 since US President Donald Trump controversially rolled them out.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmKrKTwtukE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OmKrKTwtukE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Also in the interview, Griffais confirmed that Valve is not going to take the approach that Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo have in the past in terms of selling the system at a loss and making up the difference with game and accessory sales.</p><p>"No. It's more in-line with what you might expect from the current PC market. Obviously, our goal is for it to be a good deal at that level of performance," he said.</p><p>The Steam Machine price will also take into account the system's unique small form factor and the noise level that Valve says it's achieved. "We're excited that people are going to find out how quiet this thing is," he said. The Steam Machine also integrates HDMI and CEC, and allows people to turn their TV on and off straight from the device. Additionally, it makes use of new Bluetooth and wireless connectivity systems that Valve designed. "That's all hard to do," Griffais said.</p><p>"So being able to sit down on your couch, press one button on your controller, and the whole thing lights up like you'd expect for a thing that's in your living room, I think that's really valuable. And there's not really a price point to that because it's not really something that exists in the PC market right now," he explained.</p><p>Another factor to consider is that your time is money, and some people would rather pay a little more for a company like Valve to do the work for them. "For me one of the benefits of Steam Machine is, I'm someone who used to build my PC in college and I am too old and tired to do that now!" designer Lawrence Yang explained.</p><p>Predictions about how much the Steam Machine may cost are all over the place. One expert believes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-much-will-steam-machine-cost-heres-what-valve-had-to-say-about-pricing/1100-6536161/" data-ref-id="1100-6536161">$400 is the sweet spot</a> for the entry model, while others believe it could be more than $1,000. Others believe it may be priced similarly to the PS5.</p><p>"Tariffs, surging memory / storage costs, supply chain volatility, and an inability to subsidize to the same extent as traditional console manufacturers are all working against Valve at the moment," <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1991311485323063443" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad said</a>. "That being said, the specs suggest Valve wanted this to be in line with PS5 pricing."</p><p>Officially, Valve has only said its goal is for the Steam Machine to be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-much-will-steam-machine-cost-heres-what-valve-had-to-say-about-pricing/1100-6536161/" data-ref-id="1100-6536161">"affordable" and priced according to the value it offers</a>. This is pretty much what every company says about their products, so these comments don't tell us much of anything.</p><p>The Steam Machine launches in 2026, but preorders are not yet open and the exact launch timing has not been confirmed as of yet.
