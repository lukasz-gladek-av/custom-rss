            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/epic-games-store-to-give-devs-100-revenue-for-first-1m-per-year-from-june.1179612/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-games-store-revenue-share-100<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Epic has announced changes to its Epic Games Store revenue share model, and the new terms, which will kick in next month, are pretty favorable for developers.</p>

<p>In a news <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/new-epic-games-store-webshops-and-revenue-share-update" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on its website, Epic says that from June, it will give developers 100% revenue for the first $1m they earn each year, and that's on a per-app basis as well. From then, the standard 88-12 revenue share (that's 12% to Epic) will kick in.</p>

<p>Epic says it thinks this revenue share will provide "an even better deal for developers", and given that player counts on the Store are <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-games-store-year-in-review-2024" rel="nofollow">continuing to rise</a>, this seems like a good time to introduce those terms.</p>

<p>Epic is specifically referring to mobile ecosystems like Android and Apple's iOS, which the company says "charge exorbitant fees". Thanks to recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-apple-500-million-euro-fine" rel="nofollow">legal rulings</a> in Epic's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-google-victory-play-store" rel="nofollow">favor</a>, however, devs can now send players outside of those ecosystems to alternative webshops with different payment systems.</p>

<p>Additionally, if you spend any money in Epic's Webshops, you will "accrue 5% Epic Rewards" on all of your purchases. If there's something you've got your eye on and it's in an Epic Webshop, then it might be a good idea to opt for that instead of the alternatives.</p>

<p>Admittedly, the new revenue share model and the Webshop system will likely benefit developers and publishers more than players, but if more devs get better deals with Epic, then perhaps they'll have more cash left over to make more games, eh?</p>

            <p>Open world crime blockbuster <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> has been delayed until next year, say Rockstar, telling fans that they "need this extra time to deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve". It's not the biggest surprise - delays happen. But it's a slightly embarrassing announcement given that Strauss Zelnick, big boss of publisher Take-Two, has twice publicly reassured investors that the game would release on time in autumn this year. The announcement comes with some sense of relief, however, as Rockstar have now set a firm date in Spring.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto">Grand Theft Auto</a> VI is now set to release on May 26, 2026," say the studio in <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/258aa538o412ok/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-now-coming-may-26-2026">a post on their website</a>. "We are very sorry that this is later than you expected. The interest and excitement surrounding a new Grand Theft Auto has been truly humbling for our entire team."</p>
<p>It's the first time the developers have set a concrete day for the game's release. Previously they had only revealed a broad release window sometime this autumn - a vagueness that was causing some consternation in the industry, as various big games played <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-4-launching-early-has-literally-0-to-do-with-gta-6s-release-date-marathon-or-anything-save-confidence-says-gearbox-boss">release date chicken</a> in an effort to avoid the ultraviolent giant. At least now other studios may breathe easy and make solid plans for their own games to release this autumn and winter. </p>
<p>Delays are normal in the industry, and the result is often a more polished game. We already knew as far back as March last year that Rockstar was<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-release-date-could-slip-to-2026-under-rockstar-fallback-plan-according-to-reports"> considering a long delay as a "fallback plan"</a>, thanks to a report by Kotaku. So this was always a possibility. Jason Schreier of Bloomberg claims <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lo6qieb3wc2x">it was inevitable</a>, according to his own sources at Rockstar.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar Games</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Yet the delay is notable for being at odds with the publisher's past statements. Strauss Zelnick, CEO of Take-Two, made various confident nods to money folks in shareholder conference calls, intimating that the game's upcoming release wouldn't slip. The boss was supposedly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-release-date-wont-slip-to-2026-take-two-assure-theyre-highly-confident-about-fall-2025">"highly confident"</a> about the game's previous release window, according to his words in a meeting in 2024. Earlier this year, in another money-minded call, he <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/grand-theft-auto-6-is-still-hitting-consoles-in-autumn-says-take-two-boss-promise">repeated those reassurances</a>. Later, Zelnick said that the company was staying quiet on an exact release date <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sorry-other-game-devs-but-rockstar-is-still-keeping-quiet-about-a-release-date-in-the-name-of-maintaining-anticipation">to build "anticipation"</a>.</p><p>

"We support fully Rockstar Games taking additional time to realize their creative vision for Grand Theft Auto VI," said Zelnick in <a href="https://www.take2games.com/ir/news/take-two-interactive-software-inc-reiterates-expectations">a statement released today</a> by Take-Two. "While we take the movement of our titles seriously and appreciate the vast and deep global anticipation for Grand Theft Auto VI, we remain steadfast in our commitment to excellence... we expect to deliver a multi-year period of growth in our business and enhanced value for our shareholders.” 

</p><p>Uh-huh. Anyway, there's still no PC release date for the game, sorry to say. And we only really have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-put-gta-6-trailer-live-early-after-leaks-across-social-media-confirms-2025-release-date">that one trailer</a> to go off so far. That might change this summer, as we in the press traipse slowly toward the territory of the Summer Games Fest, where we will be hacking down game announcement after game announcement with a machete of words in a dense jungle of trailers. The moment we spot a big video from Rockstar, we'll send word.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It was due out fall 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a statement, Rockstar apologized for the significant delay to the game, expected to be the biggest entertainment launch of all time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We are very sorry that this is later than you expected," Rockstar said. "The interest and excitement surrounding a new Grand Theft Auto has been truly humbling for our entire team. We want to thank you for your support and your patience as we work to finish the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"With every game we have released, the goal has always been to try and exceed your expectations, and Grand Theft Auto VI is no exception. We hope you understand that we need this extra time to deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We look forward to sharing more information with you soon."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar's statement at least confirms the GTA 6 release date, but there were no new assets released, which means the wait for Trailer 2 continues. There's also no mention of launch platforms, which some are already speculating leaves the door open to GTA 6 releasing on PC as well as PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S in May 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Look, there's always a risk of slippage and I think as soon as you say words like absolutely, you jinx things," Strauss Zelnick, the boss of Rockstar parent company Take-Two responded <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/boss-of-gta-6-and-borderlands-4-owner-take-two-says-it-will-time-its-releases-to-respect-the-consumers-need-to-spend-a-lot-of-time-playing-these-hit-games-before-they-go-on-to-the-next">when IGN asked how confident he was that Rockstar would hit fall 2025 for GTA 6</a>. "So we feel really good about it." That was back in February.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Commenting in a new note to the investment community issued today, May 2, Zelnick said he supported the decision to delay GTA 6 into Take-Two's 2027 financial year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We support fully Rockstar Games taking additional time to realize their creative vision for Grand Theft Auto VI, which promises to be a groundbreaking, blockbuster entertainment experience that exceeds audience expectations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“While we take the movement of our titles seriously and appreciate the vast and deep global anticipation for Grand Theft Auto VI, we remain steadfast in our commitment to excellence. As we continue to release our phenomenal pipeline, we expect to deliver a multi-year period of growth in our business and enhanced value for our shareholders.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The delay to GTA 6 opens up the second half of 2025 to a number of other games, perhaps now with more breathing room to succeed. The likes of Gearbox's Borderlands 4, EA's Battlefield, Bungie's Marathon, and Sony's Ghost of Yotei will no-doubt breath a sign of relief. Nintendo, which is preparing to release the Switch 2, will surely benefit from GTA 6's delay, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other developers and publishers who perhaps rushed their games to launch ahead of GTA 6's expected fall 2025 release window won't be so happy, of course. And if you had a game planned for launch in or around May next year, you'll probably have to rethink your release strategy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

You’ll also know all about that shocking death that arrives just before you make your final escape and, blinking, emerge into the beautiful open world of Cyrodiil.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Warning!</strong></em><em> Spoilers for The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered follow.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The shocking death I’m talking about here is of course the assassination of Emperor Uriel Septim, an assassination he knows is coming and has come to terms with. Veteran fans have replayed Oblivion enough at this point to know it’s coming, too. But back in 2006 when Oblivion first came out, it became a rite of passage to try to save him from the inevitable Mythic Dawn backstab that kicks off the story.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Hundreds of arrow shots later and players soon discovered that there was nothing that could be done to save poor old Septim, not without tinkering with the game with mods or console commands. Oblivion only really makes sense if the Emperor dies at the beginning, so it stands to reason that the developers at Bethesda forced it to happen no matter what the player did to try to stop it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And now, 20 years later, a new generation of Oblivion fans is trying to save the Emperor, and by that I mean trying and failing in much the same way. Players are waiting, bow and arrow primed, for the assassin to emerge from the shadows in a bid to kill him before he stabs the Emperor, but alas, it is no good.</p><blockquote cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@_elderscroller/video/7498837496252370206" data-video-id="7498837496252370206"> <section> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@_elderscroller?refer=embed" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" title="@_elderscroller" rel="noopener noreferrer">@_elderscroller</a> A new generation must close shut the Jaws of Oblivion!  <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/oblivionremaster?refer=embed" data-cy="styled-link" title="oblivionremaster" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#oblivionremaster</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/oblivionremastered?refer=embed" data-cy="styled-link" title="oblivionremastered" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#oblivionremastered</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/obliviongameplay?refer=embed" data-cy="styled-link" title="obliviongameplay" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#obliviongameplay</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/oblivionclips?refer=embed" data-cy="styled-link" title="oblivionclips" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#oblivionclips</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/oblivion?refer=embed" data-cy="styled-link" title="oblivion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#oblivion</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/obliviontok?refer=embed" data-cy="styled-link" title="obliviontok" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#obliviontok</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/obliviontiktok?refer=embed" data-cy="styled-link" title="obliviontiktok" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#obliviontiktok</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/skyrimtok?refer=embed" data-cy="styled-link" title="skyrimtok" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#skyrimtok</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/skyrimtiktok?refer=embed" data-cy="styled-link" title="skyrimtiktok" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#skyrimtiktok</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/elderscrollsoblivion?refer=embed" data-cy="styled-link" title="elderscrollsoblivion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#elderscrollsoblivion</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/fyp?refer=embed" data-cy="styled-link" title="fyp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#fyp</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7498837444293397279?refer=embed" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - ElderScroller" rel="noopener noreferrer">♬ original sound - ElderScroller</a> </section> </blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Some newcomers to the game didn’t even know they were supposed to talk to the Emperor in the first place, and so ended up with a room full of dead assassins as the endless stream of Mythic Dawn goons emerged to battle the group.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Others are seeking out their revenge on the Mythic Dawn, piling those corpses high.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Newcomers are also discovering that the assassins will just keep on coming if you don't talk to the Emperor.

            <p>Publisher Take-Two fully supports <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a> following its decision to delay <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> into next year.</p>
<p>GTA 6 was initially <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-6-publisher-highly-confident-of-autumn-2025-release-window">slated for an unspecified release this Autumn</a>. However, just this afternoon, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-delayed-to-2026">developer announced it was delaying the release until 26th May, 2026</a>. "With every game we have released, the goal has always been to try and exceed your expectations, and Grand Theft Auto 6 is no exception. We hope you understand that we need this extra time to deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve," Rockstar said today.</p>
<p>Now, <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250502895390/en/Take-Two-Interactive-Software-Inc.-Reiterates-Expectations-to-Achieve-Sequential-Increases-in-and-Record-Levels-of-Net-Bookings-in-Fiscal-2026-and-2027">Take-Two's head Strauss Zelnick has responded to the delay</a>, stating the company supports "fully Rockstar Games taking additional time to realise their creative vision", adding on its release GTA 6 will be "a groundbreaking, blockbuster entertainment experience that exceeds audience expectations".</p>

<p>Said Zelnick: "While we take the movement of our titles seriously and appreciate the vast and deep global anticipation for Grand Theft Auto 6, we remain steadfast in our commitment to excellence. As we continue to release our phenomenal pipeline, we expect to deliver a multi-year period of growth in our business and enhanced value for our shareholders."</p>
<p>The Take-Two head added he still expects the company to have a prosperous 12 months, even with GTA 6 being a little further off on the horizon, now releasing during the company's 2027 fiscal year.</p>
<p>In a press release, Take-Two said the expectation is that "the company will achieve sequential increases in, and record levels of, net bookings in fiscal 2026 and 2027".</p>
<p>Take-Two is slated to release its next financial results on 15th May.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/wizkids-adult-adamantine-dragon-review-steel-yourself-for-this-challenge<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I don't think that I'm the only person to believe that you can never have enough dragon miniatures. While it's great to have some that reside in <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="72283661-e76b-4c88-a508-3288a167599c" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/wizkids-return-of-dragons-review" rel="nofollow">Dungeons</a>, it's also important to have some Dragons coming from <em>Planescape</em>. Ahead of it's release we got to look at Wizkids Adult Adamantine Dragon in both it's painted and unpainted variant.</p>

<p>The Adult Adamantine Dragon, featured on the cover of last March's Pathfinder: Monster Core book, is one of the primal and skymetal dragons. This is a lumbering dragon caught in mid flight (and mid chomp) as it's elevated from it's 75mm clear base.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizkids-adult-adamantine-dragon-dragon-and-box.jpg?itok=E8f4Kmwh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizkids-adult-adamantine-dragon-dragon-and-box.jpg?itok=RkJ0mPD7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Looking over this dragon it's fierce at every angle. From the front you can see it's focused eyes and large gaping maw, claws are forward ready to strike, and even the points of it's wings and tail look like they're ready to dig in and cause some damage.</p>

<p>These fearsome tactics are reflected in the creatures stat block as well. With melee options for it's jaws, claw, and tail the miniature wants to make sure you're away to watch out for it's apendages.</p>

<h2>Attacks Represented In Motion</h2>

<p>All of that is not even mentioning what you can't see from the monster including an Avalanche Breath that will have the creature belching a mass of boulders (maybe some nice rocks from outside will accompany this dragon nicely).</p>

<p>A lot of incredible detail has been done on the Adamantine effects of the dragon. No matter which part of it you're looking at it's very clear to see where the flesh and scales of the dragon make way for the tougher metals that protrude from it's body.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizkids-adult-adamantine-dragon-back-of-dragon.jpg?itok=kuLe4gKD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizkids-adult-adamantine-dragon-back-of-dragon.jpg?itok=qLSXsKrj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Some particularly fantastic points of detail are the armoring around the neck, allowing enough protection while also giving the dragon full movement, down the tail and to the tip almost looking like a mace in its own right, and the sprawl of patterning on Adamantine chunks on the wing make it look just as beautiful as it is powerful.</p>

<p>For the texture I've seen a lot of work that Wizkids has done where through slightly rough patterning is able to recreate a feel somewhat similar to leather, here the bulkiness of the chunks of armor do a fantastic job to show just how sturdy an opponent this is.</p>

<p>The patterning and look of this dragon also do a great job of prompting the DM for not only their positioning, but understanding the scale and where a dragon such as this could be laying in wait. While we know that the Adamantine Dragon is proficient at digging whose to say a party moving through a quarry of metals doesn't walk by a pile that is in fact the dragon itself.</p>

<h2>Unpainted And Primed To Fight</h2>

<p>Alongside the painted edition I also got to see how it looks unpainted. For someone ready to challenge themselves this would be an excellent dragon form to lend some color to. While it retains it's powerful and imposing form you'll get to put your painting skills to the test trying to fill it out.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizkids-adult-adamantine-dragon-unpainted.jpg?itok=7FjaMbEw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizkids-adult-adamantine-dragon-unpainted.jpg?itok=ZyuT9DFT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Quite interestingly, while I already loved the look of the Adamantine, skin, and color shift in the wings when you put the fully painted version next to the unpainted edition it shows you even more just how fantastic this dragon looks.</p>

<h2>Adult Adamantine Dragon Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>It's always a good day when you can approach your RPG table and drop a dragon down before them. The Adult Adamantine Dragon is great because it can fit with almost any mountainous terrain, or even deep in mines where rare minerals could be found.</p>

<p>Wizkids has created an impressive dragon here that shows off the power of it's form, while also so perfectly nailing the aesthetic of the skymetal that covers this dragon from head to spiny tail.</p>

		<p>Rockstar has announced the release date for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gta-6">Grand Theft Auto VI</a>, but the game won’t be coming out in 2025. Instead GTA 6 will launch on 26th May 2026.</p>
<p>The statement on <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/258aa538o412ok/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-now-coming-may-26-2026">the Rockstar site</a> reads:</p>


<p>:Grand Theft Auto VI is now set to release on May 26, 2026. We are very sorry that this is later than you expected. The interest and excitement surrounding a new Grand Theft Auto has been truly humbling for our entire team. We want to thank<br>
you for your support and your patience as we work to finish the game.</p>
<p>With every game we have released, the goal has always been to try and exceed your expectations, and Grand Theft Auto VI is no exception. We hope you understand that we need this extra time to deliver at the level of quality you expect and<br>
deserve.</p>
<p>We look forward to sharing more information with you soon.</p>

<p>Sincerely,<br>
Rockstar Games</p>
<p>This is both good and bad news for the rest of the games industry. Many companies were looking at late 2025 with trepidation, given that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/17/gta-6-targets-late-2025-release-date-as-take-two-narrows-launch-window/">Take Two had constantly been stating that GTA 6 was on target for this year</a>, so even big budget games like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/05/the-next-battlefield-is-set-to-release-before-april-2026/">the next Battlefield were being tentatively given a movable release window</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, that might have given developers the sense that they could easily slip back to 2026 if they needed the time, and there will suddenly be pressure to try and push for a 2025 release instead. Thankfully, with GTA 6 not coming until May 2025, there’s still a good window from late February through to early April 2026 that could still look like a good launch window for a game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer 1" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QdBZY2fkU-0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto VI takes us all back to Vice City for another crime story. The announcement trailer introduced us to Lucia, the series’ first female protagonist, as well an as-yet-unnamed male counterpart. Lucia seemingly starts off the game getting out of prison after a bit of “bad luck”.</p>
<p>It’s clearly a modern day setting in the fictionalised state of Leonida, with a handful of things like social media shown in the trailer, but that won’t stop there being plenty of iconic classic cars and inspirations from the breadth of American culture in the South East of the country and Florida in particular. From packed beaches to going across the swamps on hover craft, and partying at the tops of skyscrapers, there’s also jokes thrown into the trailer about battling crocodiles in back garden swimming pools, “Floridaman” antics – Leonidaman in the game – and plenty more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-vi-release-date-delay<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rockstar and Take-Two have announced the&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto VI&nbsp;</em>release date at long last, but if you were hoping for the game to be released this year, then you're going to be disappointed.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://x.com/RockstarGames/status/1918265468076605706" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X,&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto VI&nbsp;</em>will be launching on May 26th next year, which Rockstar acknowledges is "later than you expected". The studio gives a pretty standard reason for the game's delay; it needs time to "deliver at the level of quality" players expect, and it wants to "try and exceed your expectations".</p>

<p><em>Grand Theft Auto VI&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-released-early-following-leak-coming-in-2025" rel="nofollow">first unveiled in December 2023</a>, with the game's debut trailer achieving a staggering <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-achieved-crazy-90-million-views-in-24-hours" rel="nofollow">90 million views in just 24 hours</a>. At that point,&nbsp;<em>GTA VI&nbsp;</em>was slated for a fall 2025 release.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/grand-theft-auto-vi-release-date-masks.jpg?itok=SSe1GD3u 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/grand-theft-auto-vi-release-date-masks.jpg?itok=waBZng3p 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Grand Theft Auto VI&nbsp;</em>finally has a release date, but the game has also been delayed out of 2025.</figcaption></figure><p>Since then, Rockstar and Take-Two haven't released much information about&nbsp;<em>GTA VI&nbsp;</em>at all; the game still only has one trailer, and no gameplay footage has been released yet.</p>

<p>Despite that, as late as February this year, Take-Two head Strauss Zelnick was claiming that&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto VI&nbsp;</em>would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gta-6-still-on-track-for-fall" rel="nofollow">still be releasing in the fall</a>, despite the fact that rumors (which turned out to be correct) were swirling at the time pertaining to the game's delay.</p>

<p>Of course, although this probably isn't the news Take-Two was hoping to deliver, it'll come as a relief to many publishers, who can now presumably breathe sighs of relief and release their games towards the end of 2025 without fear.</p>




<p><em>Grand Theft Auto VI&nbsp;</em>will serve as the sixth numbered installment (although it's far from the sixth game overall) in the&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto&nbsp;</em>series.</p>

<p>We don't know much about the game at the moment; it'll be set in the fictional US state of Leonida, in which can be found the Miami-esque Vice City, and it'll feature the series' first major female protagonist. Other than that, it's all up for grabs.</p>

<p>Rockstar will release&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto VI&nbsp;</em>on May 26th, 2026 for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. Stay tuned for more.</p>

<p>If at some point over the last 20 years you’ve found yourself in an Internet argument or had a question in your head you just couldn’t seem to get rid of, chances are good that you’ve relied on an online wiki.</p>
<p>And you probably used <i>the </i>online wiki: Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. But for video games, Wikipedia provides a more general, top-down view, painting in broad strokes what a game is about, how it was made, when it was released, and how it was received by players.</p>
<p>In addition, many games and franchises have their own dedicated wikis that go a step further; these wikis are often part game guide, part lore book, and part historical record.</p>
<p>But what does it take to build a game wiki? Why do people do it? I looked to one of my all-time favorite games for answers.</p>
<h2>The Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages</h2>
<p>It had been at least 10 years since I last played <i>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</i> before this past fall, when I decided somewhat arbitrarily to put another 80-or-so hours into a new save. Rushing through the first few parts of the main questline, it felt like I was visiting home, right up until I was named “Hero of Kvatch.”</p>
<p>Then, though, it quickly began to feel like I was playing the game for the first time, and, to put it mildly, I was getting beaten to a pulp across Cyrodiil.</p>
<p>While it was great to re-explore the game that consumed so many hours of my life and discover again what made the 2006 release an instant classic, I was frustrated that I had forgotten how the game worked.</p>
<p>Without the official manual that came with my now surely sold-to-GameStop Xbox 360 edition of the game or the Official Prima Strategy Guide, I quickly found myself (as countless others do) on<a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Main_Page"> The Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages</a>.</p>

<p>Broadly, UESPWiki is an impressive information repository of The Elder Scrolls franchise. It also documents the dense, often convoluted lore of the franchise, as well as books and merchandise sold alongside the games, and the multiple tabletop games.</p>

<p>For all its uniqueness—the sort of early “Web 2.0” design style, limited advertisement space, and its namespace-centered way of organization—the UESP is an independent wiki at its core. It has all the bone structure that makes a wiki accessible and easy to use and is driven by a dedicated community of editors.</p>
<p>The wiki currently maintains over 110,000 articles. The phrase “We have been building a collaborative source for all knowledge on the <i>Elder Scrolls </i>series since 1995” is written at the top of the home page. This year, UESP is celebrating its 30th anniversary.</p>
<p>“The phrase I always say is ‘we’re older than Google,’” said 51-year-old Dave Humphrey, founder of the UESP. “Obviously, we’re not as big or as popular as Google, but we’re older than Google, and we’re older than a lot of websites. In fact, I don't think there's any other Elder Scrolls-related website that's older than us.”</p>
<p>The earliest version of the UESP wasn’t a wiki at all and is just a little older than 30 years. It was a message distributed through USENET called Daggerfall FAQ, originally published in the fall of 1994, and it featured prerelease content about <i>The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall</i>.</p>
<p>A year later, the Daggerfall FAQ would become a webpage, and a few months after that, it would become the Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages, which was just a webpage at the time, to include information about The Elder Scrolls games.</p>
<p>When <i>The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind</i> released, it was the franchise's biggest game at that point, and Humphrey quickly became remarkably busy. He wrote hundreds of entries for the game and its two DLCs while maintaining his regular job. But the more he did, the more reader emails suggesting new entries and edits to the site came in. In 2005, UESP officially became a wiki.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          

<p>“It was too much for me to do as a full-time or second full-time job sort of thing,” Humphrey said. “That's when I decided instead of having a regular webpage, we’d move to a wiki-based format where instead of people, you know, emailing me, they can edit their own tips.”</p>
<p>In 2012, Humphrey officially made the UESP his full-time job, but he is largely no longer involved in the content side of the wiki. He instead maintains more of an overseer role, doing most of the back-end server maintenance, programming, and cluster design for the site.</p>
<p>What sets UESP apart, at least from Humphrey’s perspective, is the creativity and decision-making capacity derived from its independence. This allows the team to run the ads they choose and implement new utilities like the ESO Build Editor.</p>
<p>“We've been asked to join larger wiki farms before, and while it might make sense from a technical standpoint, we would lose a lot of what makes UESP unique and long-lasting,” said Humphrey.</p>
<p>In fact, UESP has been slowly expanding over the years and is starting to host wiki sites beyond The Elder Scrolls. In August 2023, the site launched the <a href="https://starfieldwiki.net/wiki/Home">Starfield Wiki</a>, which already maintains over 10,000 articles and has unofficially taken over all the construction set wikis for the Elder Scrolls and Fallout franchises. Currently, Humphrey said, UESP is looking at hosting a few more existing game wikis later this year.</p>
<p>As for the Elder Scrolls series itself, <em>The Elder Scrolls VI</em> is still well into the future. But at the time of my interview, the <em>Oblivion</em> remaster was just social media speculation. Still, Humphrey predicted how the game might change the wiki.</p>
<p>“It comes down to the organization of the site. We sort of have to deal with that a bit with DLCs. There’s the base game, and then there’s the DLCs; for the most part, DLCs are their own contained area, but they do modify the base game as well,” said Humphrey.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>“We’d probably take a similar approach with it, creating their own namespace underneath <em>Oblivion </em>and putting all the remake information there,” he added.</p>
<p>It’s always a challenge to determine how to organize things like DLCs and remakes into the wiki, Humphrey said. He noted that he would ultimately leave it up to the editors themselves.</p>
<p><span>Since the release of&nbsp;<em>Oblivion Remastered</em>, the game has, in fact, received its own namespace, and editors are already documenting some of the changes.</span></p>

<p>When it was still the Daggerfall FAQ, Humphrey wasn’t thinking about what it would look like in 2025 or how a community could be built around a website; he was simply someone with a passion for the game who liked building things.</p>
<p>But as time went on and Humphrey began attending conventions and Elder Scrolls-related meetups, he started to realize the kind of community that had naturally formed around the site.</p>
<p>“It's not something I planned on doing, but it's really neat, and it's something I'm more aware of now in terms of doing community-related stuff,” Humphrey said.</p>
<p>That community, which has over 23,000 users with at least one edit in its history, measures the success of the wiki not by the quantity of content but the quality of the pages themselves. Humphrey leaves most of the content decisions up to those editors.</p>

<h2>Scraping and editing</h2>
<p>Robert “RobinHood70” Morley—a 54-year-old native of Ottawa, Canada—has been editing the pages since May 2006, just a short time after UESP turned into a wiki, while playing through <i>Oblivion</i>.</p>
<p>He explained that he found the wiki at a critical time, shortly after he fell ill with a sickness that doctors struggled to diagnose.</p>
<p>“Getting involved in the wiki provided a bit of a refuge from that,” Morely wrote through Discord. “I could forget how I felt (to some degree) and focus instead on what was going on the wiki. Because I couldn't really leave the house much anymore, I made friends on the wiki instead and let that replace the real-life social life that I couldn't have anymore… That continues to be the case even now.”</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>He didn’t necessarily set out to find that kind of community, which was much smaller at the time, but he recognized that it was helping him cope with things. Not only did editing give him a sense of accomplishment, but he enjoyed seeing what others were able to do.</p>
<p>Over the years, Morely’s involvement in the wiki has grown. He’s gone from a regular user to an admin to a bureaucrat. He’s the only editor with access to the servers other than Humphrey. He now does the critical job of running bots through the game pages that add bulk information to the wiki.</p>
<p>“In some sense, a bot is like any other editor. It adds/changes/removes information on the wiki. The difference is that it does so several thousand times faster,” Morley said. “Bots are often used to bulk-upload information from the game files to the wiki. For example, they might provide the initial documentation of every NPC in a game… They would provide the hard stats, but afterward, people would expand the page to provide a narrative for each character.”</p>
<p>When an<span><em> Elder Scrolls Online </em>update goes live, for example, Morley quickly deploys the bot, which detects any changes in the new versions of the game, such as</span> skill and stat adjustments. All that added information is dumped into the wiki to provide human editors with a base to start from.</p>
<p>That’s similar to the process of creating pages for a brand-new Elder Scrolls game. The game would be scraped shortly after it was released, and editors would get busy trying to figure out how those pieces fit together.</p>
<p>Once created, the pages would be edited and continuously retouched over time by other editors.</p>
<p>Those editors include people like 26-year-old Dillon “Dillonn241” D., who has been a part of the wiki for over half of his life. He first discovered and began editing pages of the UESP at 11 or 12 years old.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>While his activity on the wiki has ebbed and flowed over the years based on interest and the demands of daily life, he says the community is a big part of what keeps him coming back—the near-endless nature of collaboratively working on a project. He enjoys the casual conversations on the wiki's Discord server, as well as the more focused and pragmatic discussions about editing through internal channels.</p>
<p>He has since become a prolific editor and was awarded a “gold star” on his talk page last year for editing more pages than anyone in 2024, with a total of 18,864 edits.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to call it an addiction because that makes it sound bad, but it’s kind of like—you know, I guess I have an hour here. I'll just hop on UESP and edit a few pages or see how things I’ve edited have been doing.”</p>
<p>Most of those edits, he explained, were likely minor, things like fixing grammar, sentence structure, and formatting to better conform to the wiki’s internal style guide. In this way, he considers himself a “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiGnome">WikiGnome</a>”—someone who makes small, incremental edits to pages and makes changes behind the scenes.</p>
<p>When he’s in the mood to do some editing, he’ll jump around the wiki using the random button for a couple of hours and make changes.</p>
<p>All those hours have given him not only refined copy editing skills but also a serious familiarity with the pages. Dillion says he can jump on just about any page and find at least one of his edits on it.</p>

<p>He has done a lot of work on the namespaces for the <em>Tamriel Rebuilt</em> mod and essentially rewrote the entire namespace for <i>The Elder Scrolls Adventures: Redguard</i>, a game he doesn't particularly enjoy playing but started on a whim.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>“At some point, I stumbled across the wiki section for it and was like, well this is nothing, this is awful,” he explained.</p>
<p>He recalled getting stuck on a section of the game, and the wiki wasn't able to help him. He was able to stumble through the game but decided he would completely fix its entries so they would be more helpful to future players.</p>
<p>Now, the <i>Redguard</i> namespace includes detailed descriptions of the quests, characters, and items, along with photos, most of which Dillion took himself. He says that if the game and all its files were somehow wiped from the earth, developers would be able to remaster the entire game in Unity based just on what’s in the wiki.</p>

  </div>
      </figcaption>
      </figure>

<p>“I guess that’s kind of the end goal,” he said, “and some of the namespaces are kind of close, like <i>Oblivion</i> I would say is kind of close to where the things that you can still add to the page are getting minimal.”</p>
<h2>Efforts all over</h2>
<p>While Dillion is a more prolific editor than most and Morley plays a more specific role in the wiki than others—and Humphrey represents the original jumping off point for the former two—it’s the combined effort of thousands of editors like them that make the UESP what it is.</p>
<p>And across the Internet, there are equally involved editors working on an endless number of wikis toward similar goals. In a way, they are remaking the games they love in a text-based format.</p>
<p>At their core, these community efforts help players get through games in a time when physical guides often no longer exist. But in the aggregate, deeper, centralized insights into these games can ultimately contribute to something new. A record over time of how a game changes and how it works can lead to discovery and debate. In turn, that could spark inspiration for a mod—or a new game entirely.</p>

            <p>
Apple has formally updated its App Store guidelines to reflect the dramatic decision laid down by a US judge around alternative app store payments. 
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-offers-peace-proposal-to-apple-after-court-decision-tears-into-iphone-maker-accuses-execs-of-lying-under-oath">fiery injunction passed this week</a>, Apple was told it could no longer dissuade app makers from offering other payment methods by applying a 27 percent commission on their proceeds. The move allows apps and games to offer direct - and potentially cheaper - options for in-app purchases, at least in the US.
</p>
<p>
Apple said it disagreed with the judgment and would appeal the decision, though would comply as instructed in the meantime. The company has now updated its App Store rules, and developers are rushing to take advantage.
</p>
<p>
"On the United States storefront, there is no prohibition on an app including buttons, external links, or other calls to action, and no entitlement is required to do so," Apple's rules now state (thanks, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/05/01/apple-app-store-guidelines-external-links/">9to5Mac</a>). 
</p>
<p>
"The prohibition on encouraging users to use a purchasing method other than in-app purchase does not apply on the United States storefront," Apple continues. "The External Link Account entitlement is not required for apps on the United States storefront to include buttons, external links, or other calls to action."
</p>
<p>
Last night, music streaming service Spotify said it had already submitted an app update to Apple which directs users to its website, bypassing payment via the App Store where Apple takes its 30 percent cut. 
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2025-05-01/following-landmark-court-ruling-spotify-submits-new-app-update-to-apple-to-benefit-u-s-consumers/">blog post announcing its move, Spotify said</a> users would finally be able to "see how much something costs in our app", such as subscriptions and information on promotions - and in the future, potentially easier-to-buy audio books.
</p>
<p>
Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney has stated that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> will return to the iPhone App Store in the US next week, after an absence of five years. 
</p>
<p>
The company has also offered a "peace proposal" to Apple, and suggested it would "drop current and future litigation on the topic" if Apple rolled out these changes worldwide. Seems unlikely, but you never know.
</p>
<p>
Sweeney previously said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tim-sweeney-no-regrets-on-fortnite-app-store-drama-as-epic-game-store-launches-on-mobile-in-europe">Fortnite had lost around $1bn in missed revenue from taking on Apple</a> and getting kicked off its app store for deliberately breaking the rules - but that it had been worth it.

			<p>A new The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered unofficial patch is now available for download, addressing a huge number of bugs.</p>
<p>The patch, which can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/477" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a> and requires game version 0.411.140.0, addresses a massive number of issues, including script, quest, NPC, object, item, dialogue bugs, and more. The main goal of the unofficial patch is to eventually fix every bug in Oblivion Remastered that won't be fixed by the developers within the capabilities of the Creation Kit and other community-developed tools. The complete changelog for the latest version of the unofficial patch can be found <a href="https://www.afkmods.com/Unofficial%20Oblivion%20Remastered%20Patch%20Version%20History.html">here.</a></p>
<p>As the game still uses the original's Gamebryo engine, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered features the usual selection of bugs and issues that have become tradition for Bethesda games. Even with these bugs and performance issues on PC, the remaster of the fourth entry in the beloved series is a more than worthy purchase for any role-playing game fan, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/">review</a>.</p>
<p><em>Enhancing the original where it mattered most while preserving what made it truly unique, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered stands as the definitive way to experience Bethesda’s classic. Although the shift in atmosphere and noticeable performance issues will put some players off, as will the dated gameplay, the game couldn't have debuted on current gaming platforms in a better way.</em></p>
<p>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-another-trailer/">Grand Theft Auto VI</a> has been delayed from its Fall 2025 release window, and will now launch next year on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
<p>Today, Rockstar Games confirmed on <a href="https://x.com/RockstarGames/status/1918265468076605706?t=Px5bjAPYlpMHJab6nnPEdQ&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X</a> the highly anticipated new entry in the series will not launch this year as expected, and will now release on May 26, 2026 worldwide on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S. While apologizing to fans for launching the game later than expected, the developer highlighted how their goal has always been to try and exceed their exceptions and with Grand Theft Auto VI, they want to do no different. As such, extra development time is required to reach the quality that players expect and deserve. More information on the game will be shared soon, so hopefully another look at the game won't take too long.</p>
<p>While it is disappointing to learn that Grand Theft Auto VI will not be released later this year on consoles, it is most definitely not that surprising. Considering their long history of delays, it would have been more surprising for Rockstar Games not to delay what is going to be, regardless, the biggest entertainment launch of all time to date, according to <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-expected-to-be-the-biggest-entertainment-launch-of-all-time-but-a-performance-below-expectations-could-impact-the-entire-industry/">analysts</a>.</p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto VI launches on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S on May 26, 2026. We will update you as soon as Rockstar Games shares more information, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

That’s all now thrown for a loop, with the game now set to be released on May 26, 2026.</p><p>“We are very sorry that this is later than you expected,” Rockstar <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/RockstarGames/status/1918265468076605706&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/RockstarGames/status/1918265468076605706" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted to X</a></span>. “The interest and excitement surrounding a new <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> has been truly humbling for our entire team. We want to thank you for your support and your patience as we work to finish the game.”</p><p>Delays at this stage are not unusual, as teams take stock and realize that another half a year isn’t going to be enough to get the game ready for launch. But given <em>GTA 6</em> has been in development for many years already, it does take on rather more significance. Not least for Rockstar owners Take-Two, whose shares took a sharp pre-market dip in the minutes following the announcement, losing over nine percent.</p><p>“With every game we have released,” Rockstar’s statement continues, “the goal has always been to try and exceed your expectations, and <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> is no exception. We hope you understand that we need this extra time to deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve.”</p><p>Take-Two Interactive, via 2K, already have quite a busy fall, with <em>Mafia: The Old Country</em> and <em>Borderlands 4</em> due, alongside the likes of <em>NBA 2K26.</em>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-date-moved-up-gta-6-2k-randy-pitchford-1851778271&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-date-moved-up-gta-6-2k-randy-pitchford-1851778271"><em>Borderlands 4 </em>has only just moved it own release date ahead 11 days</a></span>, fueling much speculation that it might be moving out of the way of <em>GTA 6</em>. We now of course know this is definitely not the case, but could have been an early sign of the publisher rearranging things ahead of the announcement.</p><p>This delay will have enormous implications across the entire industry, given the wide expectation that the game will sell record-breaking numbers of copies. Not releasing ahead of the holidays will likely hit console sales extremely hard, given <em>GTA 6</em> will be a game many are waiting for before upgrading to the current generation. It will also be a real blow for physical gaming stores.</p><p>Still, for the regular player, these delays might suck, but are invariably good news in the end. A finished game later on is always better than a broken one earlier. But gosh, this remains a seismic announcement that’ll ripple across the whole gaming industry.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Rockstar has delayed the launch of GTA 6 to 2026.
</p>
<p>
The highly-anticipated sequel will now arrive for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on 26th May 2026, Rockstar announced today in a short statement. 
</p>
<p>"Hi everyone, Grand Theft Auto 6 is now set to release on 26th May, 2026," the company wrote in a statement shared via social media.</p>
<p>"We are very sorry that this is later than you expected. The interest and excitement surrounding a new Grand Theft Auto has been truly humbling for our entire team. We want to thank you for your support and your patience as we work to finish the game.</p>
<p>"With every game we have released, the goal has always been to try and exceed your expectations, and Grand Theft Auto 6 is no exception. We hope you understand that we need this extra time to deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve.</p>
<p>"We look forward to sharing more information with you soon. Sincerely, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a>."</p>

<p>Today's news comes ahead of parent company Take-Two's next financial results briefing, set for 15th May, and days after Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-not-the-reason-for-borderlands-4-release-date-change-randy-pitchford-insists">Borderlands 4's recent launch date change was nothing to do with any other game</a>.
</p>
<p>No other information was announced by Rockstar today - and there's certainly no sign of a new GTA 6 trailer. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-first-trailer-released-early">Rockstar released GTA 6's first - and so far only - look at the game back in December 2023</a>, at which point it was set for launch this year.</p>
<p>Rockstar's confirmation of a delay follows months of speculation over whether the game would still make its 2025 launch window, despite assurances from Take-Two that the game was still on track. 
</p>
<p>In November 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-doubles-down-on-gta-6-release-date-after-delay-rumours">GTA 6's publisher insisted the game would arrive in autumn 2025</a> despite whispers of a delay, something it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-still-coming-this-autumn-confirms-take-two-despite-ongoing-delay-rumours">doubled down upon again just a few months back</a> in February.</p>
<p>"This calendar year is shaping up to be one of the strongest ever for [Take-Two], as we plan to launch <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sid-meiers-civilization">Sid Meier's Civilization</a> 7 on 11th February, Mafia: The Old Country in the summer, Grand Theft Auto 6 in the fall, and Borderlands 4," the publisher noted in a now-outdated earnings report. </p>
<p>And just a month ago, Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6s-release-date-is-still-secret-because-take-two-boss-wants-to-maintain-the-anticipation-and-excitement">the publisher was still keeping the GTA 6 date close to its chest to "maintain the anticipation and the excitement"</a>. Still, reading back through his comments now, there is a suggestion of caution around announcing a firm date too early. Here's what he said:</p>
<p>"We do have competitors who will describe their release schedule for years in advance, and we found that the better thing to do is to provide marketing materials relatively close to the release window in order to create that excitement on the one hand, and balance the excitement with unmet anticipation," Zelnick noted.</p>
<p>The delay is at least good news for other games hesitant to lock down a launch date towards the tail end of 2025. Indeed, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/with-gta-6-looming-ea-says-its-willing-to-delay-its-biggest-ever-battlefield-to-make-its-launch-all-it-needs-to-be">EA boss Andrew Wilson previously said the company would be willing to delay its next Battlefield</a> - currently expected to release before April 2026 - if "some things happening in the year" meant that "wasn't a great window for us".</p>
<p>Sony, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-yotei-release-date-announced">waited until last week to confirm an October launch date for Ghost of Yōtei</a>, likely its biggest PlayStation launch for the year. Its hard to imagine the company did that without knowing the game would not clash with Rockstar's behemoth.</p>
<p>Rockstar <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta6-active-development-now-well-underway-rockstar-says">first confirmed GTA 6 development was "well underway" back in 2022</a>, following reporting that stated the game's initial scope had been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/early-grand-theft-auto-6-plans-reportedly-featured-four-protagonists-and-three-cities">pared back to allow for a smoother development and the ability to grow the game's world post-launch</a>.</p>
<p>
As it is, GTA 6 will be set in a modern day version of Vice City - the Grand Theft Auto version of real-world Miami - and star a Bonnie and Clyde-style pair of protagonists. Here's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">everything we know about GTA 6</a> for more.

            <p>Survival hellscape <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rust">Rust</a> has added a tropical jungle biome to its procedurally generated maps, the biggest change to the landscape of the game in nine years. It'll appear close to where new players spawn and hides a number of threats and fun. Poisonous snakes will skitter through the undergrowth and riverside crocs will chew your face given the chance. There are ruins and temples hidden among the trees, housing some basic loot. And you can swing from vines, perhaps inspiring a whole new life in the canopy. Probably for the best, considering there are now tigers and panthers stalking the ground below.</p>

<p>Developers Facepunch detailed all the changes in an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/252490/view/498319683381887523">update post on Steam</a>. Maps are still procedurally generated (they've been this way since the nudist murder sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rust-new-version-review">moved to Unity 5 in 2016</a>) but until now maps have been basically a mix of arctic, temperate, and desert biomes. So this does seem a significant new addition to the deadly dog-eat-dog dangerzone. </p>
<p>To help out with that, there are two new weapons: a boomerang that returns to the player, and a blowpipe "for those who enjoy causing problems quietly." It can be loaded up with different types of dart ammo, including an "incapacitate" dart that slows its victims and obscures their vision for a time. Or a "radiation" dart that simply stacks radioactive ill-health onto your foe. Hideous behaviour, and not one bit surprising for Rust. The new wildlife sounds equally brutal. </p>

<p>"The tiger may be the deadliest animal you'll ever encounter [in] Rust," say the devs. "It closes in extremely slowly from behind, and only strikes when it's sure to kill. A moment of inattention in the jungle is all it takes."</p>
<p>To make sure that enemy's AI doesn't feel "unfair and bullshit," the animal will have a set of cues that you have to watch and listen for while roaming the fern-ridden floor. "It'll be on you to experiment and discover those hidden signals."</p>
<p>The overgrown temples (an ancient ziggurat, for example) will hide some mysteries, we're told. And slightly less weathered ruins will contain "low-tier supplies and maybe even a few surprises tucked away". The place is also a botanist's delight, from the sounds of things.</p>
<p>"The jungle biome features a large variety of completely new foliage," they say. "This includes new types of bushes, such as bromeliads and monstera. New undergrowth plants like arrowroot and calathea. As well as [a] variety of new trees like trumpet trees, jungle palms and sandbox trees. The biggest of them all are enormous kapok trees that you will be able to climb and swing from." </p>

<p>There's a bunch of other stuff accompanying the update (here's the <a href="https://rust.facepunch.com/news/jungle-update">full patch notes</a>), including beefing up of servers, and a DLC pack with an Aztec-flavoured AK-47. If only Moctezuma had had one of these... </p>
<p>I'm not going back to Rust, even with all this lush-looking leaf rendering. I haven't visited its randogen den of misdeeds in over a decade, when I chronicled <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rust-diary">a nine-life misadventure</a> with its chaotic players. But even I can see the game has changed a huge amount since then, adding <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rust-adds-boasts">boats</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rusts-next-dlc-pack-adds-pools-tubes-and-water-guns">water pistols</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rust-has-submarines-spearguns-and-sharks-now">submarines</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rusts-new-instruments-dlc-lets-you-shred-the-shovel-bass">musical instruments</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rust-now-has-npcs-who-can-give-you-missions">NPC quest-givers</a>, and even - oh my god - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rust-is-finally-adding-backpacks-to-kick-off-its-second-decade">backpacks</a>. No wonder it remains one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">best survival games</a>. If you're made of sturdier stuff than I, this could be a good time to go camping. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
