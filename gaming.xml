<p>Even more psychological manipulation awaits in Poppy Playtime Chapter 5. If you’re eager to be reunited with Huggy Wuggy, we’ve got the latest release date details and when it could be expected.</p>



<p>Chapter 4 apparently wasn’t enough for Poppy Playtime fans, which is why <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/poppy-playtime-chapter-5-teaser-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chapter 5</a> is on the way. The lovingly-named Huggy Wuggy and his minions are waiting to massacre you once again, and no doubt you’re here because you’re excited at the prospect, instead of running away—you have ZERO survival instincts, people!</p>



<p>That said, if you’re eager to enter a new area of the factory, let’s get into it.</p>

<figure><figcaption>It’ll happen, so be ready. Credit to Mob Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Mob Entertainment hasn’t revealed Poppy Playtime Chapter 5’s full release date yet, but Steam shows that we shouldn’t expect the new DLC until 2026 at the very earliest.</strong></p>



<p>If you head to Steam, you’ll see quite clearly: “<strong>Planned Release Date:&nbsp;2026</strong>,” under the usual launch details section.</p>



<p>A Halloween announcement for Chapter 5 understandably had the Poppy Playtime community excited. Was the new release a shadow drop? Was it an announcement to say that it was coming during Holiday 2025? Unfortunately not.</p>



<p>We’ve done the research, checked the game’s Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 – Teaser Trailer, and searched on the main website to no avail. Interestingly, all the top comments on the Chapter 5 teaser trailer are from fans and creators asking for the developer to <strong>take their time with the game</strong>.</p>



<p>Chapter 4 debuted with some technical issues and bugs at launch, which marred the game for many. If Mob Entertainment does this, we might not see Chapter 5 until well into 2026, maybe even closer to next Halloween.</p>



<p>You can check out the full Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 teaser trailer right here if you’ve not seen it.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/the-art-i-stole-from-nintendo</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/feature-the-art-i-stole-from-nintendo.1341205/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="f8697cacf056a"><a title="Karen McKenna SMRPG" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f8697cacf056a/karen-mckenna-smrpg.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nathan Lockard / Karen McKenna</em></figcaption></figure><p>It began with a Zelda T-shirt.</p>
<p>I was wearing my <em>“It's dangerous to go alone! Take this.”</em> shirt while running a quick errand at the bank. The teller spotted it. He was at least 20 years younger than me, but his “Nice shirt!” comment kicked off a lengthy conversation about our shared Nintendo fandom.</p>
<p>Before long, he pulled out a tablet and showed me <a href="https://grantgm.com/">his digital fan art</a>. It was awesome: detailed, dynamic sketches of Mario, Pokémon, and (my favourite) Metroid characters. His passion was apparent.</p>
<p>I told him I was thrilled by his drawings, because I know how much that work means. You see, years ago, I had a job at Nintendo that involved seeing hundreds of pieces of original Nintendo fan art. And I took some home.</p>
<p>This is the story of that collection, and how a handful of drawings, once marked for the landfill, became some of the most meaningful pieces of my gaming collection.</p>
<figure data-uuid="5c6e10cdfd6c9"><a title="Super Mario Characters" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5c6e10cdfd6c9/super-mario-characters.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://grantgm.com/">Grant GM</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<h2><strong>Player’s Pulse and a Pile of Precious Paper</strong></h2>
<p>This will definitely date me, but I interned at Nintendo during the second half of 1996. Before long, I was given complete control of Player’s Pulse, the letters to the editor section. I chose fan letters, wrote responses, and, most importantly, picked the envelope art that was displayed on those pages.</p>
<p>Mind you, this was nearly three decades ago, so the letters and the artwork were on real, physical paper, sent via snail mail. This was before the days of email and file shares.</p>
<p>I absolutely loved sifting through the envelope art because it was pure fandom: earnest, expressive, and often beautiful.</p>
<p>I was shocked to learn that it was Nintendo's practice to destroy all artwork after it had been screened and scanned for the magazine! That meant dozens, maybe hundreds, of amateur art pieces in the trash bin each month.</p>
<p>It felt criminal to toss that effort, so I kept all the artwork that came across my desk during my short internship.</p>
<p>Here are five pieces of art that define the long journey of that collection:</p>
<h2><strong>Naomi Chiba’s Envelopes</strong></h2>
<p>Years after I left Nintendo Power, I read a <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-power-helped-a-shy-fan-show-her-art-to-the-wor-1786871046">Kotaku article</a> about <strong>Naomi Chiba</strong>, easily the most prolific Player’s Pulse artist ever. While reading, I remembered that I had three of her original envelopes in my collection!</p>
<figure data-uuid="097d8e4038545"><a title="Two published and one unpublished art piece by Naomi Chiba" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/097d8e4038545/two-published-and-one-unpublished-art-piece-by-naomi-chiba.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nathan Lockard / Naomi Chiba</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>With help from the author, I connected with Naomi and arranged to return her artwork.</p>
<p>Doing so was surprisingly emotional. I hesitated when it came time to seal the envelope, but then it occurred to me that she might be the first person to ever get back the artwork that they had sent to Nintendo Power.</p>
<p>That’s when it hit me: this coloured paper meant something.</p>
<h2><strong>Quid pro Quo with Seth</strong></h2>
<p>The success with Naomi led me to find more artists.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/hatlandous/">Seth Hatland</a> came next. He was so grateful to get his <strong>Mega Man X</strong> and <strong>Mario</strong> drawings back that he insisted on trading them for a brand-new piece of art as a thank you. “I’ve gotten slightly better,” he said.</p>
<p>What an understatement!</p>
<p>He sent me an incredible piece of Link that has hung proudly in my office ever since.</p>

<h2><strong>The Big Trade</strong></h2>
<p>After returning art to several more creators, I was connected with Stephan Reese (aka <a href="https://x.com/ArtofNP">ArtofNP</a>) and his non-profit <a href="https://www.interactiveartcollection.org/">Interactive Art Collection</a>. They specialise in original Nintendo Power artwork, although he hadn’t seen much in the way of envelope art - probably because Nintendo had destroyed it all.</p>
<p>I ultimately agreed to add most of my remaining collection to his museum.</p>
<figure data-uuid="2682f716b2d85"><a title="Envelope art from Nintendo Power" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2682f716b2d85/envelope-art-from-nintendo-power.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nathan Lockard</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>In return, Stephan sent me an original, professional piece made for the promotional brochure of the Nintendo Super System arcade, circa 1992. I love it almost as much as the amateur stuff, plus I’m happy to know that the rest of the fan art is in a better place than a binder on my shelf.</p>
<figure data-uuid="00245d417ff8f"><a title="Original art for the Nintendo Super System arcade brochure" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/00245d417ff8f/original-art-for-the-nintendo-super-system-arcade-brochure.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nathan Lockard</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>(I'm the "ex-Nintendo employee" mentioned in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/the-art-of-nintendo-power-exhibit-a-guided-tour">Nintendo Life post</a> about Stephan’s exhibit a couple of years ago.)</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/retro/related-articles:155542 @ 1762014423 -->
<h2><strong>The One I Kept</strong></h2>
<p>After all that wheeling and dealing, I was left with one volume's worth of envelopes, which hangs in my game room. Here’s Volume 92 in all its glory:</p>
<figure data-uuid="c6f322714c9cb"><a title="Framed fan-art from Nintendo Power Volume 92" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c6f322714c9cb/framed-fan-art-from-nintendo-power-volume-92.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nathan Lockard</em></figcaption></figure>
<h2><strong>Family Fan Art</strong></h2>
<p>The most recent additions to my art collection are courtesy of my own kids. Is there anything better than a child’s imagination and fandom put to paper?</p>
<p>My oldest is studying art at Utah State University, but her early work continues to remind me that fan art isn't just a fun hobby; sometimes it’s a training ground.</p>

<hr>
<p>When I look at my art collection, I don’t see discarded mail. I see a bond between the creatives at a massive entertainment company and their fans.</p>
<p>My new bank teller friend, with his portfolio of beautiful, detailed digital sketches, is part of a timeless, vital tradition. He's doing what fans, including my own daughter, have done for decades: translating their hobby into a personal act of creation.</p>
<p>I may have initially 'stolen' art from Nintendo, but in the end, that art taught me a lesson: the true heart of a gaming community isn't some corporate office. It's the enduring, incredible passion of its talented fans.</p>

                <p>The day has finally arrived--after months and months of leaks and rumors, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-in-fortnite-simpsons-season/2900-7202/" data-ref-id="2900-7202">Fortnite's Simpsons season launches today</a>. Just not quite yet, because Fortnite is offline for maintenance following the "Welcome, Our Alien Overlords" event, during which players were treated to a Simpsons short film that explained how they ended up being a part of the Fortnite omniverse.</p><p>As is standard operating procedure for Epic, Fortnite goes offline when it's time for a major update. While this usually happens during the middle of the night on a weekday, this season launch is a special event, and as such, it'll kick off on a Saturday evening. That's why it's offline for maintenance now--Epic wants the launch of Fortnite x Simpsons to arrive during primetime on a Saturday night.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_GXjh_Xi2I" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/j_GXjh_Xi2I" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2>When is Fortnite Simpsons season expected to launch?</h2><p>Epic is planning to bring Fortnite back online for The Simpsons season at 2 PM PT / 5 PM ET, though that time is an estimate and not set in stone. In reality, Fortnite maintenance rarely ends on schedule, as it's simply done when it's done--which actually often means sooner than expected. Fortnite maintenance usually lasts between four and seven hours, and the planned start time here splits the difference exactly at 5.5 hours of downtime. So don't be surprised if the season starts a little before or a little after that time.</p><p>When the season does start, everything will be different. This Fortnite x Simpsons event is introducing an entirely new cel-shaded map based on Springfield from the series, and it'll have a Simpsons-themed battle pass and revamped loot pool. This may just be Fortnite's most thorough collaboration ever.

<p>Don’t Scream Together brings back the terrifying horror of the original and amplifies the fear by allowing you to have multiple friends join you. We’re seeing if Don’t Scream Together has a PS5 or Xbox Series X|S future.</p>



<p>If you’ve somehow not heard of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dont-scream-is-taking-the-horror-world-by-storm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Don’t Scream</a>, it’s probably better for your sanity. The 2023 indie sensation quickly went viral with its retro-looking graphics, palpable tension, and the game’s simple premise: DON’T SCREAM. 2024 saw the game’s full 1.0 launch, and it’s been such a hit that developer Digital Cybercherries is working on Don’t Scream Together—and it would be better on PS5 and Xbox.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-don-t-scream-together-come-to-ps5-consoles">Will Don’t Scream Together Come To PS5 Consoles?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We’d run too. Credit to Digital Cybercherries</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>It can’t be ruled out for the future, but for now, Don’t Scream Together won’t be launching on PS5 consoles</strong>.</p>



<p>So far, developer Digital Cybercherries has made it quite clear that the new multiplayer version of Don’t Scream is targeting a Steam release, meaning it’s only on PC at launch.</p>



<p>On the game’s official <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1128949867457302530/1156475689789304842/1431060015195881482" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Discord</a> server, a community post outlines this quite clearly:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We’re incredibly proud to announce DON’T SCREAM TOGETHER, an improved and expanded version of DON’T SCREAM will be <strong>launching on Steam soon!</strong>“</p>
</blockquote>



<p>There’s no mention of consoles, and it’s not even addressed anywhere in the news or info threads.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-don-t-scream-together-come-to-xbox-series-x-s-consoles">Will Don’t Scream Together Come To Xbox Series X|S Consoles?</h2>



<p><strong>We also have to say that Don’t Scream Together isn’t scheduled for any Xbox consoles right now: The Xbox Series X|S or even the Xbox One, to extend the reach a bit more.</strong></p>



<p>This answer is much the same as our PS5 verdict. It seems like Digital Cybercherries is firmly fixed on getting Don’t Scream Together right on PC before even contemplating a PS5 or Xbox Series X|S console release.</p>



<p>But keep reading, because interested Don’t Scream onlookers might like what we have to say next! </p>



<h2 id="h-is-don-t-scream-coming-to-ps5-or-xbox-consoles">Is Don’t Scream Coming to PS5 or Xbox Consoles?</h2>



<p><strong>A Don’t Scream developer has hinted that the original single-player experience “may find itself on other platforms in the future.”</strong></p>



<p>It’s not all doom and gloom then. While we’ll have to wait for Don’t Scream Together on console, a console port for 2024’s full Don’t Scream debut could be on the cards.</p>



<p>When asked about Don’t Scream Together crossplay, developer [DCC] Dec (on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2692990" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a>) said this:</p>



<blockquote></blockquote>



<blockquote>
<p>“Crossplay is not in the works currently for this title. The classic DON’T SCREAM singleplayer experience may find itself on other platforms in the future though.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s up to you if you take this as a win. If you’re looking for a console port of Don’t Scream, you should at least be getting a taste of the OG game that set the Don’t Scream Together wheels in motion.</p>



<p>We’ll have more on its console port later when the news is announced. Are you picking up Don’t Scream Together at lunch? Or are you hungry for horror on PlayStation and Xbox consoles?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Recently, a claim surfaced that Activision’s studios were preparing to announce an earlier release date for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. That was more or less refuted by Treyarch, the lead development studio piecing the game together, but now a new claim has hit the airwaves.</p>



<p>In a recent post on social media, famed dataminer ‘PlayStation Game Size’ dug up information about the install sizes, pre-load dates, and <strong>release times </strong>for Black Ops 7 on <strong>PlayStation 4</strong>. While a disclaimer highlighted that things can change, the data found suggests that the Black Ops 6 campaign and Zombies platform will go live on November 10, rather than November 14.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-black-ops-7-s-campaign-coming-early">Is Black Ops 7’s Campaign Coming Early?</h2>



<p>It’s worth stressing that Black Ops 7’s campaign (and the Zombies offering) is almost certainly <strong>not </strong>being released earlier than intended. This is something that would have been telegraphed by Treyarch to drive up pre-orders, and that hasn’t been the case.</p>



<p>In the comments under <a href="https://x.com/PlaystationSize/status/1984367269372145836">their post</a>, PlayStation Game Size suggested that the ‘current release time’ listed in the files could be a PSN error:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Current Release time</p><p>Maybe PSN Error!</p></div>— PlayStation Game Size (@PlaystationSize) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlaystationSize/status/1984367615729618976?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 31, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Activision’s studios rarely detach the campaign portion of a new Call of Duty game from the multiplayer platform, but it’s not unheard of. In a way, it’s a good thing, as it allows fans to complete the campaign without worrying about falling behind with everyone else flooding the multiplayer platform.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>That’s not the case this year, as Activision hasn’t arranged a way for players to access the campaign early, regardless of what the data seems to suggest.</p>



<p>Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you’d like to play the Black Ops 7 campaign early – or Zombies!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>We’re living in a wonderful period for puzzle games. Seemingly everyone, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/25/24279439/news-games-crossword-wordle">from<em> The New York Times</em> to Linkedin</a>, has fun puzzles to play, so every morning I have plenty of options to accompany my first coffee of the day. Lately, though, much of my daily puzzle time has come from an unlikely source: the Playdate.</p><p>Panic’s little yellow handheld is best known for being home to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/705348/playdate-season-2-review">oddball indie games you can’t find anywhere else</a>, many of which utilize a crank to play. But it has also amassed a library of excellent puzzle games that are playable in quick bursts. It makes it easy to stick a Playdate in your pocket and grab it when you need to kill a few minutes; this is particularly useful if you’re someone, like me, who is actively trying to avoid reaching for your phone in those moments. Here are a few of my recent favorites.</p><p>Like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23025390/playdate-handheld-portable-gaming-console-review">the Playdate itself</a>, <a href="https://play.date/games/lexgrid/"><em>Lexgrid</em></a> feels like something from an alternate universe. It’s sort of like a word search crossed with a crossword puzzle. In each level you’re tasked with finding a series of words in a grid of letters. The twist is you are given a clue as to what the word is you need to find, instead of the word itself. Complicating things even further is that the clues can mean different things; as you progress, you’ll uncover different symbols, each of which has a particular meaning. One might require you to find the opposite of the clue word, another will have you seeking out a synonym. They’re kind of like modifiers for words.</p><p>The symbols get more complex and strange the further you go, but the really tricky part is that you get no actual instructions. Instead, you have to figure it all out on your own. This is both the best and worst part of <em>Lexgrid</em>; it feels incredible when you solve a particularly obscure puzzle, but there were plenty of times I found myself struggling. Thankfully, the game generally gives you multiple puzzles to solve at once, so you can bounce around whenever you’re stuck.</p><p><a href="https://play.date/games/togglebot/"><em>Togglebot</em></a>, meanwhile, reminds me of an even more lo-fi take on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/5/18526921/boxboy-boxgirl-review-nintendo-switch-puzzle-game">Nintendo’s <em>Boxboy</em> series</a>. You play as a little guy in a black-and-white world, and your job entirely is to flip some switches to get to the next level, where you flip some more switches. Those levels are bite-sized and limited to a single screen, but are still (almost always) very satisfying to solve.</p><p>You have a very limited array of options at your disposal; really, all you can do is push some boxes and switches around, and change color by entering into weird portals. These are important because you can only walk on squares when you are the opposite color. This simplicity in terms of both moves and mobility means the levels require a great deal of spatial awareness to solve, and for me at least, quite a bit of experimentation. Luckily there’s a rewind button that encourages you to try things out with no repercussions.</p><p>I also love <a href="https://play.date/games/what-time-is-it/"><em>What Time Is It?</em></a> Few games have such a perfectly descriptive title. It’s like a puzzle book where each page is a single image, and from that you have to determine the time of day. It could be a string of numbers, or a bunch of playing cards, or maybe even just a single word. And from there you have to work out what time it is. There is a hint system, but for the most part it’s just you staring at an image and trying to determine what it’s telling you. Inputting the time means turning the Playdate’s crank to adjust a watch, which is a fun twist, and the 50 included puzzles can be solved in any order you want. Which is good, because some of these are <em>tough</em>. But again, that makes your eventual victory all the more gratifying.</p><p>There are plenty of other examples if you browse <a href="https://itch.io/games/tag-playdate">Itch.io</a> or <a href="https://play.date/games/">the Catalog shop</a>. All to say that if you own a Playdate, you can very easily turn it into the place to get your <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/25/24279439/news-games-crossword-wordle">daily puzzle fix</a>.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/811497/playdate-puzzle-game-reviews-lexgrid-togglebot-what-time-is-it]]></content:encoded>

<p>Call of Duty games are notorious for intruding on your storage space. Black Ops 7 is the biggest and latest CoD title to make its mark on the series, and its early preload details and file size guidelines might be known already.</p>



<p>There have been so many conversations about Black Ops 7 that it’s hard to keep up. The topics of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-skill-based-matchmaking-sbmm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Skill-Based Matchmaking</a> and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-season-one-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season One Roadmap</a> are just two of many. But its potential file size and preload details are another we have to talk about, and while information is limited right now, it might be good news! </p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-preload-date-amp-file-sizes-could-have-you-smiling">Black Ops 7 Preload Date &amp; File Sizes Could Have You Smiling</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Pointing us in the right direction, are you Activision? Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/PlaystationSize" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Game Size</a>, you can start preloading Black Ops 7 from November 9 at 10 AM PT—making this a full five days before the game’s full November launch.</p>



<p>The page does say that multiple details here are subject to change, so bear this in mind, but PlayStation Game Size is usually very accurate when it comes to these details. </p>



<p>If so, here’s a quick look at when you can expect to preload Black Ops 7 in your region.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Black Ops 7 Preload Times</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">10 AM—November 9</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">12 PM—November 9</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">1 PM—November 9</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">6 PM—November 9</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Standard Time (AST)</td><td data-align="center">5 AM—November 10</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Also, while it’s only the PlayStation 4 file sizes that have been noted for now, there’s every chance this could translate to the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S as well.</p>



<p>Here’s a look at the latest details on the game’s file sizes:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Campaign</strong>: 11.9 GB</li>



<li><strong>Multiplayer</strong>: 11.6 GB</li>



<li><strong>Zombies</strong>: 320 MB</li>
</ul>



<p>This would be very generous and useful, especially if you have Warzone installed as well. We’ll keep you updated on any changes to the preload or file sizes.</p>

<p>Red Dead Redemption 2 is often hailed as one of the greatest games ever made. It’s a timeless classic (or a modern classic, at least) that allowed players to explore an expansive, emotional, and immersive story at the end of the Old West, a time when outlaws were being… Well, <em>outlawed</em>.</p>



<p>In a recent interview, Rockstar Games co-founder Dan Houser admitted that Red Dead Redemption 2 almost fell flat and ‘wasn’t coming together’ because it was so over budget and behind schedule that everyone started doubting the project.</p>



<h2 id="h-red-dead-almost-died">Red Dead Almost Died</h2>



<p>In a recent interview with Lex Fridman (a three-hour interview!), Dan Houser opened up about all things Rockstar Games and beyond, addressing his tenure with the legendary studio and what happened to him after he resigned from the firm in 2020.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>







<p>One segment led to Houser and Fridman talking about Red Dead Redemption 2, the 2018 open-world epic that blew everyone’s hair back with intense realism, granular detail, and an incredible story and cast.</p>



<p>Even though the end product was a phenomenal game that won awards and remains a top-selling title today, it wasn’t all smooth sailing for the cowboy caper. Dan Houser revealed to Fridman that Red Dead Redemption 2 <strong>was almost </strong>in trouble:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I think with Red Dead 2, we were behind schedule. We were over budget so much I didn’t want to think about it.</p>



<p>And you’re making a game about a cowboy dying of TB, and the game’s not coming together. Turns out a lot of people doubt you at that moment, you know, it’s not that fun. I think that was a lot of pressure.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Houser took a moment to praise his old team, stressing that what they did to deliver Red Dead Redemption 2 was nothing short of mythical. Even today, Red Dead Redemption 2 is one of the most talked-about and widely appreciated games.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I think that the West and all of the themes around the West really lend themselves to that. And then the gunplay was fantastic, and the horses were incredible. So I think you had this combination of technical know-how, a very, very strong team, and really strong material.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>(Thanks to <a href="https://thegamepost.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TGP</a> for the quotes)</em></p>



<p>Red Dead Redemption 2 has been in the news recently as fans await an overhaul that brings it up to spec on current-gen consoles, including an update to allow to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-2-60-fps-update-arthur-morgan/">game to run at 60 FPS</a>.</p>

<p>Fans for years clung to the faint hope of Agent still being released by Rockstar Games. The Cold War shooter was set to expand on the company’s already stellar portfolio, but development stalled, and the game was officially canceled after 11 years.</p>



<p>It’s rare to hear either <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rockstar-games-working-closely-with-remedy-entertainment-on-max-payne-1-2-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rockstar Games</a> co-founder speak so candidly about the gaming empire they created. In a three-hour chat, one co-founder—Dan Houser—explained about the history of Rockstar, and the subject of Agent came up.</p>



<h2 id="h-agent-was-canceled-by-rockstar-games-because-it-wouldn-t-work">Agent Was Canceled By Rockstar Games Because It ‘Wouldn’t Work’</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Deep and honest. Credit to Dan Houser: GTA, Red Dead Redemption, Rockstar, Absurd &amp; Future of Gaming | Lex Fridman Podcast #484</figcaption></figure>



<p>Dan Houser sat down with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@lexfridman" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Lex Fridman</a> and opened up on a wide variety of Rockstar-related topics and answered some of the most burning questions we’ve all had for years.</p>



<p>Arguably, the one that got away for Rockstar Games was Agent. First teased in 2007, Agent was set in the 1970s—during the Cold War—and you were to play a spy, getting embroiled in the deep-seated political world tensions at the time.</p>



<p>It was formally announced in 2009, but that’s about all we got for the next 10 years. Houser explained in the Fridman interview why Agent never panned out:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We worked a lot on multiple iterations of an open-world spy game, and it never came together. Agent had about five different iterations. I don’t think it works, I concluded. I keep thinking about it sometimes, I lie in bed thinking about it, and I’ve concluded: What makes them really good as film stories makes them not work as video games, or I need to think through how to do it a different way as a video game.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Interestingly, Houser explained that the public perception of the game’s 70s Cold War setting was only one version of Agent.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>That was one of the versions. There was another that was set in current [times]…we had so many different versions of this game, we worked on it with so many different teams.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>After further explanation, Houser concluded with an interesting statement: “I question if you can make a good, open-world spy game.” </p>



<p>You can check out the video below, and it automatically plays from the moment Dan opens up on Agent.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Dan Houser: GTA, Red Dead Redemption, Rockstar, Absurd &amp; Future of Gaming | Lex Fridman Podcast #484" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o3gbXDjNWyI?start=6998&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>It does bring up a good point. The closest thing in recent memory is a game that’s not even out yet—<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-theme-song-lana-del-rey-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">007 First Light</a>. IO Interactive’s spy thriller isn’t an open-world game, but it does feature semi-open sections. This could play into Houser’s point even more, that there’s an obvious disconnect between an open-world game and the serious, race-against-time narrative a spy thriller usually tells.</p>



<p>Do you think Dan Houser is right? Was Rockstar’s goal for Agent too ambitious? Is it too late for Rockstar or Houser’s new company (Absurd Ventures) to give it another go?

<p>ARC Raiders isn’t safe from cheaters or hackers, and most games aren’t. There’s a chance you could have some of your inventory stolen or taken through nefarious or illegal means at any point. If this happens, Embark Studios has your back with lost items in ARC Raiders.</p>



<p>Finding and losing items is part of the extraction shooter formula. You win some, you lose some—that’s how it goes. But there’s an ick when you lose hard-earned goods to cheaters. It can happen, and people are more than happy to extort your efforts for their own gain. </p>



<p>However, if it does happen in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-review-refreshing-extraction-shooter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>, you should automatically get your stuff back.</p>

<figure><figcaption>The chicken, well, Embark, has spoken. Credit to Embark Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>As shown by <a href="https://x.com/ARCRaidersNews" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ARC Radar</a> (via u/Jfourmes), if you’re targeted by a hacker, your items will be returned.</p>



<p>“Your items were lost due to unfair play, but we managed to get them back for you! They’re now available for you to claim and take with you on your next journey Topside. We’re committed to building an environment where gameplay is about skill, teamwork, and fun, not unfair advantages. Thank you for being part of this mission! Together, we’re building ARC Raiders into a fair and fun experience for everyone,” says the official in-game message.</p>



<p>We did some digging into the original <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1olbx4i/i_didnt_know_we_get_refunded_is_someone_cheats_o/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> post, and it seems the original user didn’t report the cheater or submit a report; it was an automatic message from the devs informing them of what had happened.</p>



<p>It’s also unclear what constitutes “unfair play.” Still, we imagine anything pertaining to cheating, hacking, or items being stolen that shouldn’t ordinarily be allowed to be taken falls under this umbrella.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Have you encountered any hackers or cheaters in ARC Raiders so far? Let us know if you’ve experienced this message pop-up, and what happened for more details. You can let everyone know through the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-sidekicks-customization-explained/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Sidekicks are finally coming to Fortnite after months of speculation, giving players pets to accompany them across all game modes, but there are some specific customization choices that are permanent.</p>



<p>The first Sidekick is coming in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-the-simpsons-battle-price-all-rewards-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Simpsons Battle Pass</a>, with additional Sidekicks being <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-announces-return-of-companions-with-new-sidekicks-arriving-next-season/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">added to the Item Shop from November 7</a>, and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-sidekick-leak-shows-prices-will-be-the-same-as-collab-skins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked prices indicate they will cost around the same as a Collab Skin</a>.</p>



<p>With a high price and restrictions to some customizations, Sidekicks have caused a stir in the community, and we have all the details on the customization rules.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-fortnite-sidekick-customizations-are-permanent">What Fortnite Sidekick Customizations Are Permanent?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Big additions. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Each Fortnite Sidekick has a one-time customization changes to their appearance that are applied before you can equip the item.</strong></p>



<p>These are the major customization choices with each Sidekick, impacting the base colours, any color accents, or major features, like the style of ears, body size, and similar. The final permanent choice is the name for a Sidekick.</p>



<p>Once locked in, these choices are permanent and cannot be adjusted. However, you can purchase the same Sidekick again and make a fresh style, though this, of course, incurs the cost of splashing out on the same item.</p>



<p>This is a big difference to The Mandalorian Warrior outfit, for example, which allows for constant cosmetic changes and the ability to save different appearances in your loadout. </p>



<p>Understandably, there has been some backlash to the permanence of some of the big customization choices for Sidekicks, and it remains to be seen whether Epic Games change their approach, or add a purchaseable item that allows you to edit a Sidekick again. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-fortnite-sidekick-customizations-are-repeatable">What Fortnite Sidekick Customizations Are Repeatable?</h2>



<p><strong>Not all customization choices for your Sidekick in Fortnite are permanent, with additional accessories and some cosmetics being freely available to change.</strong></p>



<p>In the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N0m9H13pGM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">trailer for Fortnite Sidekicks</a>, a screen showing editable Styles offers a tease of what will be freely interchangeable with Sidekicks, with the example being clothing for a dog. In the video, two styles are shown, each with a different color and look.</p>



<p>Based on this, it’s expected that style choices for accessories like clothing, collars, and similar attire will all be able to be changed as many times as you want. What isn’t clear, however, is how you will gain access to these items, and whether there will be a deep supply of them.</p>



<p>As the amount of Sidekicks in Fortnite grows though, expect more customization options for attire to be added.</p>

		<p>It’s pinch, punch, first of the month time, and since it’s November, I hope you managed to survive last night with only treats and no tricks. Thankfully my supply of sweets was just enough to survive the glut of kids of all ages knocking on our door, so I didn’t have to break into my <em>actual</em> stash of sweets to appease the last kids in the final crowd that knocked.</p>
<p>But now that we’re free from this terror, what’s on the agenda for this weekend? Perhaps some ARC Raiders? Maybe avoiding the Battlefield battle royale? Perhaps some Football Managering?</p>

<p>Fortnite fanatics with an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate membership had the blow of price increases to the service softened with the announcement Fortnite Crew was being added as a perk, and we’ve got all the details of when that comes into effect.</p>



<p>Price rises for Xbox Game Pass subscriptions caused a stir last month, rising <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-raising-game-pass-ultimate-price-by-50-and-changing-tier-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as much as 50% in some cases</a>, though it was also announced that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-battle-passes-will-now-be-included-in-xbox-game-pass-ultimate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite Crew would be included</a> in some memberships.</p>



<p>The wait for that perk to come into effect continues, however, and if you’re wondering exactly when Fortnite Crew is added to a subscription, particularly with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-the-simpsons-battle-price-all-rewards-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Simpsons-themed Battle Pass</a> landing, we can tell you the exact release date for the bonus perk.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-fortnite-coming-to-xbox-game-pass">When Is Fortnite Coming to Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>New bonus. Image via Microsoft</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Fortnite Crew will be included in Xbox Game Pass Ultimate memberships from November 18, 2025, Epic Games has confirmed.</strong></p>



<p>Announced as part of the pricing structure changes to the Game Pass service in October, Fortnite Crew is being added as an additional perk for subscribers to <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/10/01/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-premium-essential-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</a>.</p>



<p>The inclusion was not immediate, however, and players are still waiting for this bonus to be unlocked—but it’s on the horizon, with the perk adding to memberships from November 18, as stated by an <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/help/en-US/fortnite-battle-royale-c-202300000001636/billing-and-payment-c-202300000001723/fortnite-crew-availability-with-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-a202300000020476" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Epic Games blog post</a>.</p>



<p>No additional cost will be added to the monthly Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription price, though the previously announced price rises are in effect, but the bonus will soften the blow for Fortnite players.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-included-in-fortnite-crew">What’s Included in Fortnite Crew?</h2>



<p><strong>Fortnite Crew membership includes full access to all the Battle Passes added in Fortnite across all modes, with a total of four passes in Fortnite.</strong></p>



<p>The main Battle Pass, OG Battle Pass, Festival Pass, and LEGO Pass are all included in the membership, along with the Rocket Pass Premium in Rocket League.</p>



<p>Additional bonuses include 1,000 V-Bucks every month, available to spend on cosmetics in the Item Shop, and an exclusive monthly Crew Pack that provides a new Outfit alongside a matching accessory—a Glider, Pickaxe, or Emote.</p>

<p>Chapter 6 in Fortnite is rapidly approaching a conclusion but, before the big jump into Chapter 7, a mini-season themed around The Simpsons is taking center stage, with a new Battle Pass to enjoy.</p>



<p>Kicking off with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-simpsons-live-event-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">live event on November 1</a>, The Simpsons takeover of Fortnite will see a smaller map brought onto the scene, representing Springfield, with lobby sizes in battle royale reduced from 100 to 80 as a result.</p>



<p>There’s also the long-awaited <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-announces-return-of-companions-with-new-sidekicks-arriving-next-season/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">introduction of Sidekicks</a>, Fortnite’s new pets feature, and the Battle Pass is stacked full of Simpsons goodies.</p>

<p><strong>The Simpsons Battle Pass in Fortnite costs 1,000 V-Bucks to unlock, though it’s also available as part of a Fortnite Crew subscription.</strong></p>



<p>It’s a cheaper price than usual Battle Passes in Fortnite, due to the shorter duration of the season and fewer rewards, but there’s still plenty to sink your teeth into. 1,000 V-Bucks are purchasable for a base price of $8.99, though you may be able to find cheaper codes and better value for money if you purchase a larger amount.</p>



<p>Remember, Fortnite Crew will also be included with an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription starting from November 18, so don’t splash out twice if you have a membership!</p>



<h2 id="h-all-rewards-in-the-fortnite-x-the-simpsons-battle-pass">All Rewards in The Fortnite x The Simpsons Battle Pass</h2>



<p><strong>There are seven pages of rewards in The Simpsons Battle Pass in Fortnite, not including the bonus rewards that become available once the basic pass is completed.</strong></p>



<p>As usual, all of the bonus rewards are yet to be revealed, but we do know there will be an Evil Homer skin style available, alongside a Springfield Peely.</p>



<p>The full list of rewards in The Simpsons Battle Pass is shown in the table below.</p>

<h2 id="h-is-the-fortnite-x-the-simpsons-battle-pass-worth-it">Is The Fortnite x The Simpsons Battle Pass Worth It?</h2>



<p><strong>For fans of The Simpsons, the Fortnite Battle Pass is certainly one of the best in a long while and highlights just how great Epic Games’ creativity is.</strong></p>



<p>With appearances of fan-favorite characters Ned Flanders, Marge Simpson, and Homer Simpson, alongside an abundance of fun easter eggs and references with Emotes, Pickaxes, and Back Blings, The Simpsons Battle Pass is worth every dollar.</p>



<p>On top of that, the Battle Pass includes a return of 900 V-Bucks, plus potentially more when the bonus rewards are revealed later this month, so you’ll pretty much get your money back in V-Bucks that can be spent on other Simpsons items in the shop.</p>

<p>A Rare Fortnite skin has returned to the Item Shop for the first time in half a decade, making its first appearance since 2020.</p>



<p>Fortnite has an abundance of skins players can use across all modes, and, with hundreds to choose from, some of those introduced take a long while to be brought back into the Item Shop.</p>



<p>These skins with limited appearances have been dubbed ‘rare’ by the community, with those owning them being able to flex on rival players—but the door has opened for players to finally get their hands on one of the rarest skins.</p>



<h2 id="h-dante-returns-to-fortnite">Dante Returns To Fortnite</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Returning. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>As leaked by <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1984395460040126887">ShiinaBR</a>, Dante returned to the Item Shop for the first time in five years on November, marking the first appearance of the skin since the same date five years ago.</p>



<p>Initially released on November 2, 2018, the Dante skin had featured just eight times in the Item Shop prior to its return today, with yearly reappearances in the Item Shop around Halloween.</p>



<p>That trend came to an end in 2020, however, with Dante not appearing for five consecutive years until the streak was broken with today’s appearance.</p>



<p>Priced at 1,500 V-Bucks, the Dante skin is available to pick up until November 4, and has the added bonus of being reactive and glowing in the dark.</p>



<p>Though the wait for Dante has been a lengthy one, it pales in comparison to some of the other rarest skins in Fortnite, with the likes of Reflex and Summit Striker not appearing in the shop for over 2,400 days.</p>

Well, either way, it's the weekend, so let's do a quick recap of the week before we dive into what we're playing, shall we?</p>
<p>Naturally, the biggest news of the week was the announcement from Nintendo that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> would be making a comeback, with both a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/everything-included-in-the-animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition-and-free-3-0-update">free update planned for all owners alongside a paid Switch 2 Edition</a> in the new year.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/luigis_mansion">Luigi's Mansion</a> is also <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/nintendo-expands-switch-2s-gamecube-library-today-with-a-spooky-classic">now available on the Switch</a> via an NSO + Expansion Pack subscription, so hopefully a few of you have been playing this one for Halloween.</p>
<p>And finally, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/resident-evil-requiem-pre-orders-live-switch-2-pro-controller-and-amiibo-confirmed">a bunch of announcements</a> for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> revealed that a special Pro Controller will be launching alongside the game, with a Grace Ashcroft amiibo following in Summer 2026.

<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer<br></h2>
<p>I recently picked up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/two-point-museum">Two Point Museum</a>, and it really is delightful. The performance issues on Switch 2 are definitely apparent, but it's really got its hooks in me. I find myself constantly tweaking little bits of my museum, taking "just one more" expedition to nab another fossil or skeleton for my collection, and simply sitting back to admire my handy work. Lovely stuff.</p>
<p>I'd like to play some more <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection">Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection</a>, but I'm tempted to put it aside for a little bit until the online issues are resolved.</p>
<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I have friends staying over this weekend, so I expect a fair amount of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Mario Party Jamboree</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, and probably a little <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nintendo_switch_sports">Nintendo Switch Sports</a> — what can I say? I’m a sucker for a few holes of Golf!</p>
<p>All this does mean that the final Mission or two of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> will probably have to take a back seat for a couple of days. I’ll finish it soon, I promise!</p>

<h2>PJ O'Reilly, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I'll be splitting my time between doing some review stuff and insulating my loft this weekend. Honestly, I wish I was joking. So, not much time for gaming, really, but I definitely will still be chilling with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</a> at some point, as I've got to get back to that before I forget the story.</p>
<p>Other than this, it'll be quick blasts of BALL x PIT (unbelievably addictive, be warned) and I'm afraid I've gone and bough the Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection, so hopefully the online issues Ollie <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection">pointed out in his review</a> will get sorted down the line. I'm still more than happy to have it portable, to be honest, as online isn't my preferred way to play the old fighting games. Too much stress, mate.</p>
<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/final_formation">Final Formation</a> has no right to be this good. Jaleco’s original outing was a staple in Famiclones back in the day and it remains a stellar unlicensed Macross tribute, but this new remake dials everything up to eleven.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The stands are filled with cheering, jeering fans. The bits of bone and blood have been cleared away from the pitch. The sun is high in the sky, and your team of rambunctious rabble rousers are ready to take the field. This is&nbsp;<em>Blood Bowl</em>, Games Workshop's tongue-in-cheek take on American Football. GW sent us the latest big box release for the game, which coincides with a new third season edition of the rules - so join us at the 50 yard line as we check out the new&nbsp;<em>Blood Bowl: Third Season Edition</em>&nbsp;box set.</p>

<h2>What Is&nbsp;<em>Blood Bowl</em>?</h2>

<p><em>Blood Bowl: Third Season Edition</em>&nbsp;is the newest edition of&nbsp;<em>Blood Bowl,&nbsp;</em>a miniature game based loosely around the rules of American Football. In the game, you take on the role of the coach of a team, guiding them toward victory. Each coach brings a team of at least 11 players to the game, and you'll attempt to move a ball down the field and score against your opponent.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/blood-bowl-third-season-edition-midfield-action.jpg?itok=u6Q3fPhh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/blood-bowl-third-season-edition-midfield-action.jpg?itok=RR2Ezk13 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Teams can generally be divided into several different archetypes with different specialities. There's your bruiser-heavy team who wants to smash and grab your opponents, barreling their way down the field and sending as many of your opponent's players into the injury box (or the grave!) as possible. Then there are your more agility-focused teams, who want to move swiftly down the field, passing and catching and playing a proper game of American Football.</p>

<p>Finally, there are stunty teams, who use trickery and funny little hacks to get their way to victory. It's teams like this that usually let you chuck your teammate (with ball in hand) down the field - just like in American Football!</p>

<p>The game takes place over two halves, with each team getting eight turns per half. But here's the fun catch - if your active player drops the ball, goes out of bounds, or falls over - you end your turn with a turnover and have to hand the action over to your opponent. So even though sixteen turns per player&nbsp;<em>seems</em>&nbsp;like a lot, games usually move pretty swiftly once the action gets going.</p>

<h2>What's Different In&nbsp;<em>Blood Bowl: Third Season Edition</em>?</h2>

<p>Fans of this classic tabletop sports game will be pleased to know that there haven't been many changes between the Second Season edition of the game and&nbsp;<em>Blood Bowl: Third Season</em>&nbsp;<em>Edition</em>. The core stats of players haven't changed, and the field remains its standard size.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/blood-bowl-third-season-edition-dice.jpg?itok=qeHCCo-4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/blood-bowl-third-season-edition-dice.jpg?itok=SO_DXInS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The biggest changes are all in the service of clarity. The rules have been rewritten to make it clear who's doing what, and who's being referred to in the text. Also new template markers have been created to make it clear who's been knocked down, and who's been stunned (normally, you'd have to lay your figure either face down for being Prone, or face up for being Stunned). It's an obvious and easy upgrade, and it makes a huge difference in the game.</p>

<p>This box is the first place to get the new rules, but they'll come out alongside two new Spike journals later on in the year. If you want to get into the action with the clearest rules possible, this is the way to go.</p>

<h2>How Does&nbsp;<em>Blood Bowl: Third Season Edition&nbsp;</em>Play?</h2>

<p>The box set comes with two teams: the Brionne Barons, a wholly new army hailing from Bretonnia, and the Nehekhara Nightmares, a classic team who are reproduced in this box (with great plastic sprues) with very little in the way of updates or changes. Even with this combination of a brand new team and a&nbsp;<em>very</em>&nbsp;old team, the game is wonderfully approachable for newcomers.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/blood-bowl-third-season-edition-team-lineup.jpg?itok=OuedLeVK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/blood-bowl-third-season-edition-team-lineup.jpg?itok=KdIuDGuk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In the box, each team has a quick-start cheat sheet, which really helps in tracking down their abilities and stats. In our test games, we found the match-ups incredibly balanced. The Brionne Barons are a very agile, fast team with great passing and catching abilities, but they're pretty easy to lay flat on the battlefield.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Nehekhara Nightmares are a sturdy team, who are slower (they are ancient undead shambling mummies, after all), but can really whollop your enemies. This balance between the two teams - with one being more proficient in the&nbsp;<em>game</em>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<em>Blood Bowl</em>&nbsp;while another team is better at the fight-y aspects of the game - perfectly represents the wonderful push and pull of the game.</p>

<p>The miniatures also look amazing, with very evocative poses for each team. That's what I love most of all about&nbsp;<em>Blood Bowl</em>. Unlike other Games Workshop properties,&nbsp;<em>Blood Bowl</em>&nbsp;has a truly outrageous, over-the-top sense of humor. There's a playfulness on display here that we don't always see in a GW game, and it perfectly fits the theme of an epic sporting brawl.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/blood-bowl-third-season-edition-table.jpg?itok=j37jDSHX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/blood-bowl-third-season-edition-table.jpg?itok=-UuIAIau 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2><em>Blood Bowl: Third Season Edition&nbsp;</em>- Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>While any&nbsp;Games Workshop release has its own barriers to entry -- you have to build the models, you have to learn from a fairly thick rulebook --&nbsp;<em>Blood Bowl: Third Season Edition</em>&nbsp;is just about as approachable as you can hope for a wargaming product. It's high-flying fun, and this box set has everything you need to get into the action.</p>

<p>My only real quibble with the box set is the fact that the cheat sheets, while incredibly helpful, still have you flipping through the rulebook to find the exact description of all of your players' special abilities. This led to our first games featuring lots of forgotten special abilities, meaning we weren't getting the true full potential out of our teams. But after multiple play-throughs, we quickly picked up on everything our teams could do.</p>

<p>So if you're looking for a new tabletop wargame to get into, this is a great, fun, lighthearted entry into the genre. And if you're a returning player, the box set has the newest rules, all the tools and dice you could ever dream of, and two great new teams ready to rock.</p>

			<p>Grand Theft Auto (GTA) developer Rockstar Games has been mostly exempt from the rounds of layoffs that have rocked the industry throughout the last three years or so. This week, they have fired between 30 and 40 employees across offices in the United Kingdom and Canada, but not due to financial problems (which they do not have). <a href="https://iwgb.org.uk/en/post/staff-at-rockstar-fired-en-masse/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to the Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB)</a>, this has been an act of 'union busting', as all the developers fired were attempting to unionize.</p>



<p>Alex Marshall, president of the IWGB, said in a statement: </p>



<p><em>Rockstar has just carried out the most blatant and ruthless act of union busting in the history of the games industry. This flagrant contempt for the law and for the lives of the workers who bring in their billions is an insult to their fans and the global industry.</em></p>



<p><em>Despite this calculated attack on workers organising for a collective voice and to improve their difficult working conditions, the Rockstar Union remains undeterred. They will keep organising for respect and better conditions whilst continuing to pour their blood, sweat and creativity into games that are loved by millions. The IWGB will pursue every legal claim possible to ensure our members are reinstated and receive interim relief.</em></p>



<p>Spring Mcparlin-Jones, Chair of the IWGB Game Workers Union, added: </p>



<p><em>Next year, GTA VI is expected to make upwards of $10 billion. That’s enough to end world hunger for a year. Such a flagrant attack on workers’ rights from such a valuable studio sends a very clear and shocking message to the world, that money matters more than people.</em></p>



<p>Alan Lewis, Head of Global Corporate Communications at Take-Two Interactive (the parent company of Rockstar Games), <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-31/-grand-theft-auto-studio-accused-of-union-busting-after-firings?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MTkzOTg3MSwiZXhwIjoxNzYyNTQ0NjcxLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNTBISEpHUFFRNkMwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.9NYooKXrBMU_quRYMOSw6uACDogcIuS-E27t4GD8f2g&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told Bloomberg</a> that the employees were fired for 'gross misconduct', adding that Take-Two supports the GTA studio's approach in the matter.</p>



<p>Unionization has been increasingly common over the last three years in the industry, with studios like <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-testers-from-blizzard-albany-win-the-right-to-unionize/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blizzard Albany</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/phil-spencer-says-raven-software-qa-union-will-be-recognized-after-activision-blizzard-acquisition-goes-through/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Raven Software</a>, Blizzard Irvine (the World of Warcraft team), <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-overwatch-2-team-at-blizzard-just-unionized-the-second-wall-to-wall-union-at-blizzard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blizzard Orange County</a> (the Overwatch 2 team), <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-workers-united-qa-union-haved-reached-a-tentative-deal-with-microsoft-the-first-deal-reached/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ZeniMax</a> (as ZeniMax Workers United), and <a href="https://wccftech.com/disco-elysium-zero-parades-studio-zaum-workers-alliance-union-uk-branch-iwgb/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ZA/UM</a> (which unionized recently and is represented by the IWGB) opting to unionize. </p>



<p>As a reminder, GTA VI is scheduled to be released on May 26, 2026 for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X after slipping the original Fall 2025 launch window. Additional delays could still happen, though, as history tells us that Rockstar's previous game, Red Dead Redemption 2, was delayed from the second half of 2017 to the first half of 2018 and then again to October 26, 2018, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/red-dead-redemption-2-living-outlaw-life/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">when it launched to unanimous critical acclaim</a>.</p>

<p>The BLAST R6 Major Munich will follow the well-established format typical for these types of tournaments.

Before the Finals come around, the bottom eight organizations will be eliminated from the running.</p>



<p>Here’s how the tournament schedule works:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Opening Stage: </strong>November 8 – 13 (no public access)</li>



<li><strong>Playoffs: </strong>November 14 – 16 (live audience)</li>



<li><strong>Grand Final: </strong>November 16</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re taking part in a little esports betting or want to watch the BLAST R6 Major Munich with some knowledge in your back pocket, here are the latest predictions for the tournament.</p>



<p><strong>FaZe Clan </strong>comes into the running in Munich with the tightest momentum and best esports betting odds. They’re the reigning Six Invitational champs with a clean roster that has had a decent year already.

<p>It was Team Secret that secured the trophy at the Esports World Cup, closely followed in second place by <strong>G2 Esports</strong>, the next top pick for winning it all in Munich. It would be a phenomenal thing for G2 Esports to win the Munich Major on home turf.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders Review—The Most Refreshing Extraction Shooter Ever Made]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-review-refreshing-extraction-shooter/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-raiders-review%E2%80%94the-most-refreshing-extraction-shooter-ever-made.1341034/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders has finally hit the market after years of development at Embark Studios. It comes from the creative minds that brought us The Finals and, once upon a time, games like Battlefield. It’s a retro-futuristic, post-apocalyptic, extraction shooter epic that has been turning heads for months, and now it’s finally here, it’s <strong>screaming up the charts</strong>.</p>



<p>Being a fan of the extraction genre, I was all too eager to leap head over heels into ARC Raiders. I’d waited until the full release of the game to experience it, as I wanted the most polished version possible, and what I’ve been treated to is nothing short of sumptuous.</p>



<p>This is the most refreshing, entertaining extraction shooter I think we’ve ever had. Read on for my full ARC Raiders review.</p>



<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-is-accessible-but-remains-challenging">ARC Raiders is Accessible but Remains Challenging</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-steams-most-popular-extraction-shooter/">ARC Raiders</a> is perhaps the most accessible game to land in the genre, which is typically tougher and less welcoming than almost every other genre out there (except perhaps Soulslike). It takes the extraction shooter concept and makes it more ‘arcadey’ and inviting, while retaining a solid sense of challenge that keeps the more talented players engaged.</p>



<p>That balance is flawless, in my eyes. I generally hate games that are challenging for the sake of it, but ARC Raiders manages to keep you entertained even <strong>while you’re losing</strong>, and there are mechanics built into the game to make sure you can keep playing even when you’re on your last buck.</p>



<p>Given that ARC Raiders is available on PlayStation, Xbox, <strong>and </strong>PC, it already has a step up on the competition, which is almost exclusively refined to PC platforms. For instance, Escape from Tarkov, arguably the spearhead of the extraction genre, has spent almost a decade confined to a proprietary launcher on PC, and is only just coming to Steam later this month.</p>



<p>If you choose to invest the $30 or so to secure a copy of ARC Raiders, you’ll be getting what might be one of the best introductions to the extraction shooter genre imaginable.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Team up, betray, or just gun down? The choice is yours in ARC Raiders</figcaption></figure>







<p>ARC Raiders takes players and throws them into a post-apocalyptic world ravaged by an invasion of robotic enemies called ARC. The human race has been driven underground into a settlement called Speranza, and ‘going topside’ is a risky and ambitious concept reserved only for foolhardy Raiders, scavengers who want to claim the riches still left above ground.</p>



<p>It’s a third-person action-based shooter with some light RPG and survival mechanics, large-ish environments to explore, and intense combat systems that make fighting both human enemies and AI-driven robots a satisfying romp.</p>



<p>I’ve said it’s effectively Fortnite crossed with Fallout, and fused with Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>You’ve got the third-person perspective, rapid movement model, and elements like skin packs and emotes, combined with the post-apocalyptic, war-torn setting, and extraction-based gameplay loop.</p>



<p>What’s different about ARC Raiders is that it holds your hand quite nicely without being too forgiving. You can get free loadouts at any point if you’re down on your luck, you have a companion named Scrappy (he’s a chicken) who collects crafting items for you to use, and the early-game missions are tutorials that help you understand the core facets of the title.</p>



<p>I think the earliest quests had me fully understand every angle of the game, including trading, crafting, extraction, healing, and more, within an hour flat. You don’t get that in a game like Escape from Tarkov!</p>



<p>But with that being said, ARC Raiders can quickly ramp up the difficulty, depending on your circumstances. The ARC enemies are notoriously tough, and fighting <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-boss-kill-58-times/">something like a <strong>Queen</strong></a><strong> </strong>is absolutely impossible without a dedicated effort by a well-armed team with a key strategy to follow.</p>



<p>As you could imagine, resources are scarce, the post-apocalyptic arsenal is reminiscent of Fallout’s ‘pipe weapon’ range, and there are no armor items to find and upgrade, just energy shields and the warm flesh of your Raider.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Don’t even hope to tackle an ARC Queen</figcaption></figure>







<p>Bungie stressed that Marathon, an upcoming extraction shooter that was plagued by bad press earlier this year, would be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-wants-marathon-to-be-a-social-extraction-experience/">the first ‘social’ extraction shooter</a>. It was said it would hit the market with elements of accessibility and would promote teamwork and collaboration over mindless slaughter.</p>



<p>That’s what ARC Raiders is doing. In the raids that I’ve played, I’ve had more positive interactions than in any other extraction shooter or battle royale title. I’ve teamed up with other players, helped them into the extraction sites (elevators that take you back to Speranza), and even earned apologies from players before they brutally knocked me out and sent me to the abyss.</p>



<p>Even when I do get into a fight, I feel like it’s pretty balanced, even if the RPG-style skill-based pathways lend themselves to the whole ‘unemployed gamers are more powerful’ vibe. As you rank up your character, you unlock multiple benefits that might make a brand-new player feel a bit hard done by, but that’s the nature of the game, and you just need to deal with it.</p>



<p>If you grind, you’ll get there yourself at some point. There are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/does-arc-raiders-have-a-wipe/">no wipes in ARC Raiders</a>, except for the optional ‘Expedition Projects’ that crop up after you’ve hit level 20, so you can chug along at your own pace, have fun meeting people and enjoying the world around you, and not worry about losing all your progress once every six months.</p>



<h2 id="h-everything-i-wanted">Everything I Wanted</h2>



<figure><figcaption>ARC Raiders’ maps encourage multiple playstyles, which is superb</figcaption></figure>







<p>I was holding fire on ARC Raiders for the longest time, but I need to admit that it’s everything I’m looking for in an extraction shooter.</p>



<p>There are plenty of places to loot and explore, the resource pool is diverse, and the core concept of the game is intriguing and engaging. I’m a huge fan of the combat, which invites you to try out a range of fighting styles and approaches, and I love how accessible the game is, catering perfectly for casual players just as much as die-hard veterans of the genre.</p>



<p>Embark Studios has done a phenomenal job with ARC Raiders. It looks brilliant on-screen, runs quite nicely, and has a diverse collection of maps, enemies to fight, and quests to complete. There are 63 quests to contend with right now, but the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-will-add-10-years-worth-of-content/">ARC Raiders roadmap</a> for the path ahead has been revealed, and plenty more content is coming.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-tarkov-1-0-being-released/">Escape from Tarkov’s 1.0 release</a> on November 15 and the launch of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-release-date-start-times/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> on November 14 might disrupt ARC Raider somewhat, but I’m confident that this shooter has plenty of meat on the bones and fuel in the tank, more than enough to retain a core community that will keep the game up on their shoulders.</p>



<p>If there is <strong>one thing </strong>I would ask for, it’s a PvE mode that takes out the extra challenge of PvP battles. I’d be perfectly happy playing only with friends or running solo in a world populated by ARC, but I imagine that’s already set for development…</p>



<h2 id="h-verdict-4-5-great">Verdict: 4/5 – Great</h2>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gta-actor-gta-6-100-price-tag/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gta-actor-thinks-grand-theft-auto-6-%E2%80%98warrants%E2%80%99-a-100-price-tag.1341028/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Grand Theft Auto 6 is mere months away from hitting the market (we hope), and fans are still busy theorizing over how much the game will cost. The price is yet to be set, and many feel that it could be the first standard game to hit the market with a $100 price tag.</p>



<p>The nature of that price tag has been widely debated by many, including the folks here at Insider Gaming. It’s believed that if any game can carry that price tag, it’s Grand Theft Auto 6. That’s a sentiment that was shared by a Grand Theft Auto actor during a recent interview with The Escapist.</p>



<h2 id="h-should-grand-theft-auto-6-cost-100">Should Grand Theft Auto 6 Cost $100?</h2>



<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.escapistmagazine.com/jay-klaitz-exclusive-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Escapist</a>, Jay Klaitz, the actor behind the notorious Lester Crest in Grand Theft Auto 5, sat down to talk about all things GTA. He touched on his experiences acting the character and performing alongside the trio of leads in the game that debuted a whopping 12 years ago.</p>



<p>Talk naturally turned to Grand Theft Auto 6 and Klaitz’s expectations of the game, including the long-rumored price point.</p>



<p>He’s in the camp suggesting that, owing to the investment poured into creating a Grand Theft Auto game, it’s more than worth a $100 label.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Yeah dude. I mean, GTA V was so heavy on the mocap. I assume that GTA VI will be the same way, and these games take so long to make. Years and years and years. It’s not like they’ve just been hanging out, chilling and then just started doing the work last year. They finished GTA V and then started on GTA VI more or less immediately thereafter.</p>



<p>This shit takes forever and as we saw with GTA V the game will come out and there will be other versions, there will be downloadable content, it will be online. You’re almost buying multiple games when you buy the one.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I would also like to see it made more accessible to more fans so I get that side of the argument too to make it affordable for folks. That’s cool too. Maybe there’s like a way to split the difference, but I share the sentiment that this game warrants that price tag. Yeah, I get that.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Klaitz was talking about the post-launch window of Grand Theft Auto 6, which is set to drop in May 2026. He addressed hopes that Rockstar Games would ‘bring back old Lester’ in some kind of expansion that revisits the character.</p>



<p>It would work, given how we see heist footage in the newest GTA 6 trailers, and that fits nicely into Lester Crest’s wheelhouse.</p>



<p>Do you think Klaitz is right and that Grand Theft Auto 6 should cost $100? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-november-1-874/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nyt-connections-hints-today-874-%E2%80%94clues-and-answers-for-saturday-november-1.1341019/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s November! That came around <strong>very fast</strong> this year, didn’t it? Halloween is now over and done with, and we can start looking to the festive season, and after that… 2026! Today, though, we’re looking a little smaller on the scale of time and considering today’s NYT Connections hints and answers.</p>



<p>I’ve got the best solutions you need to wrap up today’s NYT Connections puzzle and get on with your day. Read on to get all the hints you need to smash today’s challenge.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-november-1">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (November 1)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #874:</p>



<ul>
<li>RAVEN</li>



<li>PINKY</li>



<li>CHIP</li>



<li>JET</li>



<li>INKY</li>



<li>ROCKY</li>



<li>FILE</li>



<li>CLYDE</li>



<li>HARDY</li>



<li>SUE</li>



<li>TELLER</li>



<li>CHARGE</li>



<li>INDICT</li>



<li>ITCHY</li>



<li>PITCH</li>



<li>CHER</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>These are all legal actions that initiate or escalate a case.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>Each of these words is commonly used to describe a deep, rich black color — poetic and evocative.</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>A fun twist — these are the “second” names in iconic duos.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>All animated rodents who take top billing in their respective pairs.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, November 1.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-november-1-874">NYT Connections Answers for Today, November 1 (#874)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– CHARGE, FILE, INDICT, SUE</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – INKY, JET, PITCH, RAVEN</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – CHER, CLYDE, HARDY, TELLER</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – CHIP, ITCHY, PINKY, ROCKY</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>
