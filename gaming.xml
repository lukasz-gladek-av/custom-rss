		<p>Amazon’s TV adaption of Sony’s God of War games has landed an Emmy award-winning director for the first two episodes. Frederick E.O. Toye has signed up and should be familiar with historical violence having directed Shogun for Disney, and also The Boys for Amazon.</p>
<p>He joins Ronald D. Moore, creator of the highly acclaimed Battlestar Galactica remake, who will be the showrunner for the two seasons that have been ordered. The series was announced in 2022 with Rafe Judkins as the showrunner, but he left the project in 2024 due to creative differences.</p>


<p><em>“’God of War’&nbsp;is a compelling, character-driven franchise that we believe will captivate our global customers as much with its expansive and immersive worlds as its rich storytelling,”</em> Vernon Sanders, head of global television at Amazon Studios, said. <em>“We are honored to share in the adventure of exploring the&nbsp;God of War&nbsp;mythology in such a momentous way with Sony Pictures Television, PlayStation Productions, and Santa Monica Studio.”</em></p>
<p>Sony has a Horizon Zero Dawn movie in the works and a sequel to the Uncharted movie was announced years ago, but that seems to be dead in the water, perhaps due to Tom Holland’s busy schedule.&nbsp; Sony Pictures are also producing the Metal Gear Solid movie.</p>

            <p>
Around May last year, the one and only <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/ron-gilbert">Ron Gilbert</a> of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-curse-of-monkey-island">Monkey Island</a> fame announced an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> that was meant to be some kind of mix between classic Zelda, and Diablo, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/thimbleweed-park">Thimbleweed Park</a>, that last one being another of the game designer's notable works. It never got a full reveal, or even a name, and unfortunately it seems it never will, as it's essentially been canned.
</p>
<p>
Gilbert recently spoke with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/12/after-40-years-of-adventure-games-ron-gilbert-pivots-to-outrunning-death/">Ars Technica</a> about his career, including his most recently released game, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ron-gilberts-new-death-by-scrolling-rpg-about-never-ending-grind-and-the-absurdity-of-social-media-is-out-now">Death by Scrolling</a>, which just launched this October, but the interview kicks off by discussing his unnamed RPG. The designer explained that after working on adventure games like Thimbleweed Park and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/return-to-monkey-island">Return to Monkey Island</a> for a good many years, he was "thinking about something new."
</p>
<p>
That something new resulted in Gilbert hiring an artist and another designer, putting a year's worth of time into the aforementioned RPG. The problem? Not enough people, and as is the case with most of life, not enough money. "I just [didn’t] have the money or the time to build a big open-world game like that," Gilbert explained. "You know, it’s either a passion project you spent 10 years on, or you just need a bunch of money to be able to hire people and resources."
</p>
<p>
For Gilbert, bringing in funds was tougher than he thought it would be. He tried pitching the game to various places, but "the deals that publishers were offering were just horrible." He continued, "Doing a pixelated old-school Zelda thing isn’t the big, hot item, so publishers look at us, and they didn’t look at it as ‘we’re gonna make $100 million and it’s worth investing in.' The amount of money they’re willing to put up and the deals they were offering just made absolutely no sense to me to go do this."
</p><p>
Crowdfunding sites like Kickstarter don't work so well these days either, as Gilbert's Thimbleweed Park also went that route, and while it wracked up more than $600,000, the game dev noted that it still had private investors providing half of the game's final budget.
</p>
<p>
This is mostly just another reminder that making games isn't just hard because they're technically complex, but they have material necessities that can't always be met due to external forces. Would be nice if someone did something about that. Revolution anyone?

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/splinter-cell-remake-director/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Splinter Cell Remake director David Grivel has returned to Ubisoft to finish what he started in 2021.</p>



<p>Announced on his LinkedIn profile, David Grivel announced that he’s rejoining Ubisoft Toronto as the project’s Game Director for the Splinter Cell Remake. </p>







<p>The Splinter Cell Remake originally started development in 2021 under the codename ‘North’, with not much else being said on the game since. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-update-on-splinter-cell-remakes-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming exclusively reported</a> in 2024 that the game is currently in development on the Snowdrop engine, with a tentative release date of 2026. It’s likely given the projects (and Ubisoft as a whole) issues that this release date is no longer accurate, but we will update our readers when we learn more.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming received footage of the project in early 2025, which showed Irving Lambert speaking to Sam Fisher in a superb cinematic. As it’s understood, the Splinter Cell Remake is a fully-fledged remake from the ground up, which will include being built around a modern audience from the ground up, rather than a simple graphic rehaul.</p>



<p>It’s understood that the game is in development for the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and PC.</p>



<p>As for what Grivel’s return to the game means for the game’s immediate future is unclear, but the news that development continues on the game will be a warm welcome to those who were skeptical of the project’s future.</p>

                <p>Humans aren't exactly on the top of the food chain in Squanch Games' <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/high-on-life-2/" data-ref-id="5000-681576">High on Life 2</a>. This first-person shooter takes place in a universe where aliens came to Earth to use humanity as ingredients for intergalactic pharmaceutical drugs. Now, a new trailer for the game facetiously markets itself to alien consumers as it encourages them to use Humanzapro, a new wonder drug made from humans.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkTG28-CZbI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KkTG28-CZbI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The trailer is done in the style of pharmaceutical ads that typically run on American TV. All of the tropes of those ads are present, including the footage of happy aliens after they've taken the drug. Intriguingly, the ad warns humans that they shouldn't be taking Humanzapro because of side effects. That makes us wonder if this particular drug will be a power-up during the game.</p><p>High on Life introduced players to the Rick and Morty-esque talkative sci-fi weapons, which was fitting since the first game was produced by Rick and Morty co-creator--and Squanch Games co-founder--Justin Roiland, who also voiced a sentient alien weapon. Roiland was forced out of Squanch Games and Rick and Morty following <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/justin-roiland-abuse-allegations-what-we-know-1826967" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a series of allegations</a>.</p><p>The sequel is introducing a new feature that will let players skateboard into battle and incorporate it into their offensive moves. Alternatively, players can use the boards to perform tricks.</p><p>High on Life 2 will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on February 13, 2026. It's also slated to be a day-one Game Pass Ultimate release for PC and Xbox Series X|S. Outside of the game, it was reported that a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-success-story-high-on-life-getting-a-tv-show-with-one-of-its-hilarious-voice-actors/1100-6525587/">High on Life animated series</a> is in development.</p>

<figure data-uuid="1122ece876094"><a title="Sonic the Hedgehog 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1122ece876094/sonic-the-hedgehog-3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Paramount Pictures</em></figcaption></figure><p>Paramount has revealed some of its future movie plans, but for us, the biggest draw is that Sonic the Hedgehog will be getting a brand new spin-off movie in 2028.</p>
<p><a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/sonic-spinoff-movie-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-live-action-film-2028-release-dates-1236596459/">Variety</a> reports that this upcoming spin-off is currently untitled, but it's being referred to to as the "Sonic Universe Event Film". It will launch in cinemas on <strong>22nd December 2028</strong>. More than three years away!</p>
<p>Note that this <em>isn't</em> the planned Sonic the Hedgehog 4 movie, which is coming out in <strong>March 2027</strong>.</p>
<p>We have no other details right now, but there are a lot of opportunities to branch out in the Sonic universe, with tons of untapped characters and other video games the movies can draw from.</p>
<p>Plus, it seems like a no-brainer to expand the Sonic movie universe — the first three films have all received warm critical reception, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/12/round-up-the-reviews-are-in-for-the-sonic-the-hedgehog-3-movie">particularly Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a>, and fans seem to absolutely love them.</p>
<p>Collectively, the franchise has made over $1 billion at the box office and spawned a TV show focusing on Knuckles the Echidna, so more movies surely means more money.</p>
<p>We at least have some idea of who will feature in the Sonic 4 movie, so we'll have to excitedly wait and see on what the Sonic Universe movie will bring.</p>

              <p>Extraction shooter <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-review-extraction-loot-shooter-embark-2000642198"><i>Arc Raiders</i></a> sells you the fantasy of being either a lone wanderer or part of a ragtag crew, rummaging through the wreckage of a fallen civilization to rebuild something better. Along the way, you can expect brutal gunfights with deadly machines and <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-pvp-betrayal-bounty-rat-camp-2000649163">traitorous fellow raiders</a>. It <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-extraction-shooter-constantly-dying-2000649095">makes for a great adrenaline rush</a> as you exchange fire with man and machine.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-extraction-shooter-constantly-dying-2000649095"><i>Arc Raiders </i>Is So Good I Keep Playing No Matter How Much I Suck</a></p> <p>But recently, I had the pleasure of chatting with a player who’s found a different role to play in <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ post-apocalyptic Italy: that of a fruit salesman.</p>

 <p>Reddit user GrumbleGrits recently shared a video of this experience, putting down firearms in exchange for fruit and other harmless goods. Check it out <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oxoism/welcome_to_the_fruit_shop/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">here</a>:</p>   <p>This moment speaks to what I love about the extraction shooter genre and how it breaks open the expected routine of what we do in these kinds of games. The simple premise of getting in, grabbing loot, and getting out leaves a wide open space in between for unexpected emergent outcomes and creative playstyles, and that includes subversive ways of interacting with others. In a game where you can just as easily <i>not</i> shoot other players as you can otherwise murder them, why not consider peace? Why not find a new way to ascend the game’s meta?</p>

 <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-pvp-betrayal-bounty-rat-camp-2000649163"><i>Arc Raiders</i> Fans Have A New Tool For Revenge Against Assholes</a></p> <p>That’s what GrumbleGrits and others have done. We recently chatted a bit over DM on Reddit about his experience as a post-apocalyptic fruit farmer setting up shop in an abandoned newsstand.</p>

 <p>Though he was quick to point out that <a href="https://youtu.be/wGr0f4vxfic">there are others in <i>Arc Raiders</i> setting up trade shops</a> (and many people coordinate on Reddit and elsewhere to arrange a trade for various hide-to-find pieces of loot) and insisted that he doesn’t want to receive any special credit for his efforts, setting up a fruit stand in the game certainly requires work.</p>

  <p>“I always try to have different stock each time,” he told me. “Sometimes I bring as many harvestable plants as I can, typically focusing on the materials needed to train Scrappy.” He’ll even trade non-edible goods as well, such as the many forms of loot that exist for no other reason than to sell to the in-game NPCs.</p>

 <p>But fruits and plants, which are needed to level up the player’s pet rooster that dispenses materials after every match, are important and, critically, often hard to come by. <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ typically unexpected and excessive violence can make holding on to these materials all the way to extraction hard enough as it is. That violence is something GrumbleGrits has to contend with when trading his goods.</p>

 <p>“It’s not all sunshine and rainbows,” he said, “getting to the chosen location for my storefront, clearing out Arc, and surviving any aggressive raiders along the way can be really difficult and occasionally results in tragedy. Once I reach the spot and get situated, I usually don’t have much issue with being attacked by other raiders.”</p> <p><b>Read More: </b><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-field-depot-crate-off-radar-down-to-earth-2000642525">This Is The ‘Easiest’ Field Depot In <i>Arc Raiders</i></a></p> <p>It’s a very different kind of fantasy than many are used to when it comes to <i>Arc Raiders</i>: venturing out not to just find what you can and keep it for yourself, but doing so with the intention to trade it with others, and putting in the work to establish a safe trading zone.</p> <p>It’s not the only way GrumbleGrits plays, of course. “Between working a real-world job and engaging with all the various other systems of <i>Arc Raiders</i>, and collecting items to trade away in the first place, it can be difficult to find time to goof off and set up these little shops,” he said. While trading fruit makes for a unique way to interact with others and use the game’s loot system, GrumbleGrits isn’t throwing down his weapons permanently any time soon. Just recently, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1pb39k2/goodbye_big_lady_my_first_queen_kill/">he shared some footage of his first Queen kill</a>. But who knows, maybe the loot he’ll earn from this battle might show up on a store shelf soon.</p>

 <p>Of course, the experience is not without its theatrics. “I once had a couple of guys duel to the death with their melee weapons for a stack of mushrooms,” he said, recounting one of the more unique situations. “It was a violent and quick battle,” he said, “a testament to how sought-after mushrooms can be. They’re difficult to find if you don’t know where to look.”</p> <p>Thankfully, GrumbleGrits and other players not only know where to look for hard-to-find loot, but they’re also willing to share the wealth.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>It's been nearly four years since <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2021/12/15/splinter-cell-remake-announced-by-ubisoft" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2d7f08d7-a850-4def-a34c-dea649945f96" data-entity-substitution="canonical">Ubisoft announced its Splinter Cell remake</a>, but the developer doesn't have much to show off quite yet, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2022/11/17/new-splinter-cell-remake-concept-art-and-details-revealed-in-anniversary-video" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d24df20a-5973-4edd-9a2e-bb04b04c2d46" data-entity-substitution="canonical">outside of a few pieces of concept art</a>. Last week, however, we did get a minor production update on the project from someone with firsthand knowledge of the game. David Grivel is returning as Splinter Cell remake's game director, a role he held years ago before leaving to work at EA.</p><p>"Today, I am very, VERY happy to announce that I'm rejoining Ubisoft Toronto as Game Director on the Splinter Cell Remake!" <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/davidgrivel_today-i-am-very-very-happy-to-announce-activity-7397680267999686656-ZvKU/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAACOWhuwBwYrSgCaAXycFQL8Ess7nITKi_yU">Grivel's LinkedIn post announcing the news reads</a>. "A very special team and project to me," the message concludes, complete with a heart emoji. (Thanks to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/stealth/after-3-years-and-a-brief-tenure-on-battlefield-6-former-splinter-cell-remake-game-director-rejoins-ubisoft-for-sam-fishers-big-comeback-a-very-special-team-and-project-to-me/"><em>GamesRadar</em>, which noticed this post before we did.</a>)</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HH1_ZCSf_HY"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HH1_ZCSf_HY" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>According to his LinkedIn profile, Grivel worked at Ubisoft from 2011 to 2022, spending most of his time at the Toronto offices as a senior or lead game designer, with credits on projects like Assassin's Creed Unity, Far Cry 5, 6, and Primal, and most importantly, Splinter Cell: Blacklist. Starting in 2021, he transitioned to being the game director on the Splinter Cell remake, a position he held until late 2022, when he left to work on Battlefield 6. He briefly returned to Ubisoft in 2024, but left to join a studio, Worlds Untold, that unfortunately shut down right as he was supposed to be starting.</p><p>Now, Grivel has returned to the team he left three years ago, though it's unclear what, if anything , this means for the remake, especially since the last update came a month or so after he left, before any real impact would have been clear. At the very least, it's a sign of life that confirms Ubisoft still intends to follow through with the project. Here's hoping we'll see a more concrete update sometime soon.</p><p>[<em>Source: </em><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/stealth/after-3-years-and-a-brief-tenure-on-battlefield-6-former-splinter-cell-remake-game-director-rejoins-ubisoft-for-sam-fishers-big-comeback-a-very-special-team-and-project-to-me/"><em>GamesRadar</em></a>]</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/12/01/game-director-david-grivel-rejoins-splinter-cell-remake-after-leaving-in-late-2022]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Amazon's God of War TV series is currently <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-god-of-war-tv-show-begins-filming-march-2026/">set to start filming in March 2026</a> after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-series-starts-from-scratch-with-battlestar-galactica-for-all-mankind-producer/">show was rebooted with Ronald D. Moore</a> now at the helm as showrunner. Now, a new report from <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/12/god-of-war-frederick-eo-toye-production-casting-2-season-order-1236630007/">Deadline</a> reveals that Amazon has ordered two seasons of the show, and that the first two episodes of season one will be directed by Emmy award-winning director Frederick E.O. Toye of Shogun and The Boys.</p>



<p>Moore is still leading the charge on the show as its showrunner, writer, and executive producer, but Toye will take the directing reins for the first two episodes, the two episodes that, arguably more than the ones that will follow, will set the tone for the series.</p>



<p>Deadline's report also adds that, ahead of filming in March, the show has already started pre-production in Vancouver. It's currently unclear what elements of the God of War series the show will pull from, though we know that the show will pull from God of War (2018) and God of War Ragnarok, rather than the original Greek mythology-focused God of War games.</p>



<p>Casting for Kratos and Atreus is currently underway, as the big question around the show is who will be chosen to fill those iconic roles. Christopher Judge, who plays Kratos in the new rebooted version of God of War, has previously talked about throwing his hat in the ring, but also adds that he has no animosity towards whoever gets the role. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Switch 2 Mario Kart World Bundle Just Got A Surprise Discount]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Nintendo revealed its Black Friday 2025 deals last month and there was no <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-is-on-amazon-pre-order-invite-usa-available-1851785835">discounted Switch 2 among them</a>. This was not surprising, given that the new hardware became the fastest-selling console launch ever this year. What is surprising is that Walmart decided to do its own discounted Switch 2 <em>Mario Kart World</em> bundle for Cyber Monday, and Amazon followed suit.</p> <p>Earlier today, <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Nintendo-Switch-2-plus-Mario-Kart-World-Bundle/16422361549">Walmart</a> crashed the fake internet retail holiday with the best deal on a Switch 2 yet. It was $50 off the <em>Mario Kart World</em> bundle, which includes the $80 game and is usually priced at $500. At just $450, it essentially gave customers the game for free. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-SwitchTM-Pok%C3%A9monTM-Legends-Switch-2/dp/B0FC5FJZ9Z?tag=kotaku01-20">Amazon</a> then followed up with its own match, and at least as of the time of writing, I was able to get one in my shopping cart for the discounted price (the Walmart one wasn’t working).</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Nintendo Switch 2 Mario Kart Bundle still available for $449 at Walmart (price in cart) <a href="https://t.co/BHwEEWL35g">https://t.co/BHwEEWL35g</a> <a href="https://t.co/eqFxtps9Kk">pic.twitter.com/eqFxtps9Kk</a></p> <p>— Wario64 (@Wario64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1995527157121224954?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 1, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>It’s unclear how much longer the deal will last, or if it might sporadically come back throughout the holiday season. Is it an extremely limited discount, or are Walmart and Amazon just that desperate to get people through their online doors? Or maybe it was a last-minute decision in a hyper-competitive holiday season, as people get more discerning about their purchases while everything shoots up in price.</p>

 <p>The only other console maker doing big discounts this year is Sony, which took $100 off the price of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-ps5-black-friday-deals-dualsense-edge-controller-2000645182">PS5 Pro and standard model</a>, both of which had already been marked up due to recent tariff-fueled pricing adjustments. Nintendo, on the other hand, seems happy to have customers pay full price for most of its new games and even its old consoles.</p> <p>A Switch <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em> bundle that had been a mainstay of the company’s Black Friday sale lineup for years <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-black-firday-sales-2025-mario-zelda-2000642413">was MIA this year</a>. I guess it didn’t want to be caught competing with itself. The Xbox Series X/S, more expensive than ever, didn’t get a discount either.</p>

<p>The live-action God of War from Amazon Prime Video has found a director for its inaugural episodes in an Emmy winner. Furthermore, the show has already been greenlit for a second season.</p>



<p>PlayStation’s bloody God of War series has entertained players since 2005. While it has likely been attempted, a Hollywood adaptation has never been successfully done. In 2022, Prime Video announced that the reboot duology would be brought to streaming as a show, with many of the game’s crew helping with the production. While rumors of casting and filming have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-tv-amazon-casting-call-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made their way online</a>, it seems the show is already far into production.</p>







<h2 id="h-amazon-prime-video-s-god-of-war-gets-frederick-e-o-toye-to-direct-first-episodes-casting-and-pre-production-underway">Amazon Prime Video’s God of War Gets Frederick E.O. Toye to Direct First Episodes, Casting and Pre-Production Underway</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/12/god-of-war-frederick-eo-toye-production-casting-2-season-order-1236630007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">an exclusive report from Deadline</a>, the outlet revealed that director Frederick E.O. Toye has been tapped to direct the first two episodes of God of War for Prime Video. The acclaimed director has done many shows for Amazon like The Boys and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-season-2-release-date-when-is-the-new-season/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout</a>, but is most known for his Emmy-winning work on Shogun and the episode “Crimson Sky”. It’s unclear if E.O. Toye will direct any other episodes in the first or second season.</p>



<p>As mentioned above, the show has already been renewed for a second season, as it was pitched to have a two-season order. Pre-production for God of War is already underway, with casting also currently going on. That means that, if <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-amazon-filming-march-2026-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the February film date is true</a>, fans may know who Kratos and Atreus are in the next two months. Many names for Kratos, like Dave Bautista and Winston Duke, have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kratos-actor-shortlist-outlined-by-movie-insider/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">floated around</a>, but it seems fans will know quite soon. With a second season, it does look quite likely that it will adapt both God of War and God of War: Ragnarok.</p>

            <link>https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/12/after-a-witcher-free-decade-cdpr-still-promises-three-sequels-in-six-years/</link>
            <guid>1369738</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>It’s been over 10 years since the launch of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/05/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-review-hunting-fiends-for-fun-and-forever/">the excellent <em>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</em></a>, and nearly four years since <a href="https://www.thewitcher.com/us/en/news/42167/a-new-saga-begins">the announcement</a> of “the next installment in The Witcher series of video games.” Despite those long waits, developer CD Projekt Red is still insisting it will deliver the next three complete <em>Witcher</em> games in a short six-year window.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2025/11/transcript-q3-2025-earnings-3.pdf">a recent earnings call</a>, CDPR VP of Business Development Michał Nowakowski suggested that a rapid release schedule would be enabled in no small part by the team’s transition away from its proprietary REDEngine to the popular Unreal Engine <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/03/the-witcher-will-return-as-a-triple-a-rpg-shifting-to-unreal-engine-5/">in 2022</a>. At the time, CDPR said the transition to Unreal Engine would “elevate development predictability and efficiency, while simultaneously granting us access to cutting-edge game development tools.” Those considerations seemed especially important in the wake of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/12/cd-projekt-red-offers-refunds-to-unsatisfied-cyberpunk-2077-console-players/">widespread technical issues with the console versions of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em></a>, which CDPR later <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/01/cdpr-ceo-blames-in-game-streaming-for-cyberpunks-console-problems/">blamed on REDEngine’s “in-game streaming system.”</a></p>
<p>“We’re happy with how [Unreal Engine] is evolving through the Epic team’s efforts, and how we are learning how to make it work within a huge open-world game, as [<em>The Witcher 4</em>] is meant to be,” Nowakowski said in the recent earnings call. “In a way, yes, I do believe that further games should be delivered in a shorter period of time—as we had stated before, our plan still is to launch the whole trilogy within a six-year period, so yes, that would mean we would plan to have a shorter development time between <em>TW4</em> and <em>TW5</em>, between <em>TW5</em> and <em>TW6</em> and so on.”</p>
<h2>Don’t start the clock just yet</h2>
<p>To be clear, the “six-year period” Nowakowski is talking about here starts with the eventual release of <em>The Witcher 4</em>, meaning the developer plans to release two <em>additional</em> sequels within six years of that launch. And CDPR <a href="https://www.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-cd-projekt-q3-2023-sees-strong-sales-and-strategic-growth-93CH-3947581">confirmed earlier this year</a> that <em>The Witcher 4</em> would not launch in 2026, extending the window for when we can expect all these promised new games.</p>

<p>The biggest surprise is the absence of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> from the top 40. Yep, despite the latest Kirby game almost squeaking inside the top ten last week, the Switch 2 sequel has unfortunately slipped out of the top completely.</p>
<p>The top ten is very similar to last week, with a few new (returning) additions. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</a> has seen the biggest jump in numbers, going from 24th last week to 6th this week; most of those sales have come from the PC and PS5 versions, but the Switch 2 release has pulled in a solid 9% of sales. Similarly, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/just_dance_2026_edition">Just Dance 2026 Edition</a>, a Switch 1 exclusive, has also made a huge leap, going from 27th to 9th this week.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067imgpjl&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>

<p>Otherwise, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ea-sports-fc-26">EA SPORTS FC 26</a> (With 21% on sold Switch 1, and 8% on Switch 2), <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/call_of_duty_black_ops_7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> have all retained their spots from last week.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> has swapped places with <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/battlefield_6">Battlefield 6</a> for 4th. The Switch 1 and Switch 2 split remains close there, with 54% opting for the Switch 1 version, while the remaining 46% grab it on Switch 2. This obviously doesn't include those who buy the Upgrade Pack separately.</p>
<p>So, business as usual, then! Perhaps <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> will shake things up next week, hm?

I can only assume that Halloween's proximity to Christmas is the reason as to why there is so much winter holiday <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> media. Perhaps it's even just as simple as the fact that people like it when Christmas is a little bit messed up! Either way, I do actually enjoy some Chrimbo horror, so I'm pleased to see the return of Haunted PS1's Madvent Calendar this year, which just so happens to have launched today.
</p>
<p>
For those that need the rundown on how the whole thing works, it's essentially a package of 24 different games, all vaguely horrory and Christmassy in one way or another. This year's iteration, Madvent Calendar 5: Post Mortem, is no different, bringing with it a gaggle of goodies that, I should note, are varying degrees of polished. Expect the kind of bits you might see in a game jam, basically.

<p>
You can play every single game on offer as soon as it's been downloaded, though that technically defeats the point of an advent calendar. Still, to give you an idea of what to expect, I'll run you through a few of the games on offer. Spoiler warning I suppose? Stand clear if you want to discover them for yourself!
</p><p>
Day one puts you in a fuzzy, pixelated world where you can do two things: rip, and knock. It throws you in with little context, making it genuinely quite unnerving. Sort of felt like I was being born at one point? Weird stuff! Another entry puts you in the role of a zombie girl who has been recruited by an eye-patch wearing Santa to help with the war on Christmas. This one's kind of a cross between <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crash-bandicoot">Crash Bandicoot</a> and Spyro, and is just quite a little neat 3D platformer that with some extra finessing could feature some solid movement mechanics.
</p>
<p>
I'm always a fan of all the Haunted PS1 demo discs, their Madvent Calendars, and the odd one of projects too. It's a real boon of bite sized creativity, and well worth dipping into if the holiday season feels just a tad too cheerful for your liking. You can pick it up for free on itch.io right <a href="https://hauntedps1.itch.io/madvent5">here</a>.

              <p><span>We know </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-4-film-sequel-confirmed-march-spring-2027-sega-1851744323"><i><span>Sonic the Hedgehog 4</span></i></a> <span>is coming in 2027, but it looks like another live-action </span><i><span>Sonic </span></i><span>movie is coming not too long after. Is this the rumored Shadow-centric spin-off we’ve been hearing about? It better be, Paramount.</span></p> <p><span>According to </span><a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/sonic-spinoff-movie-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-live-action-film-2028-release-dates-1236596459/"><i><span>Variety</span></i></a><span>, Paramount has added a new “Sonic Universe Event Film” to its schedule that will premiere on December 22, 2028, four years after </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-hedgehog-3-review-shadow-keanu-reeves-jim-carrey-1851726797"><i><span>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</span></i></a> <span>debuted last December. </span><i><span>Variety </span></i><span>notes this movie will be a spin-off, which means it likely won’t follow the blue blur and his friends. There have been longstanding </span><a href="https://www.sonicstadium.org/articles/sonic/rumor-shadow-movie-officially-in-development-at-paramount-they-want-to-do-an-amy-rose-project-r3181/"><span>rumors</span></a><span> that a spin-off movie about Shadow the Hedgehog, Sonic’s black-and-red rival played by Keanu Reeves, was on the table if </span><i><span>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 </span></i><span>did well, and it got around half a billion at the box office.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Shadow was the antagonist of most of </span><i><span>Sonic 3</span></i><span>, and seemingly sacrificed himself to stop his original plan to destroy the world. The movie’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-hedgehog-3-4-post-credits-amy-rose-metal-shadow-1851726285"><span>final post-credits scene</span></a><span> shows him recovering his inhibitor rings that fell to Earth in the film’s climactic space battle, implying that he would return in a future movie or television series.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>What we know so far about </span><i><span>Sonic 4 </span></i><span>makes it sound like Shadow won’t be in the next numbered film, so a spin-off starring him would be the next best thing. Could this be when the film series finally introduces the other members of Shadow’s Team Dark: treasure hunter Rouge the Bat and Eggman’s estranged robot Omega E-123? Please, Paramount. I need Shadow to find his new family after losing everything in </span><i><span>Sonic 3</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>Whatever this movie is, it will premiere just about a year and a half after </span><i><span>Sonic 4</span></i><span>, which is set for theaters on March 19, 2027. The fourth film will focus on newcomers Metal Sonic and</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-3-post-credits-amy-reverse-sonamy-relationship-1851730058"><span> Amy Rose</span></a><span>, who were teased in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/new-sonic-3-concept-art-may-clear-up-that-confusing-pos-1851743775"><i><span>Sonic 3</span></i><span>’s post-credits scene</span></a><span>, and seems to be a loose adaptation of </span><i><span>Sonic CD</span></i><span>.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/nightreigns-bell-bearing-carion-draconic-tree-sentinel-2000649218</link>
            <guid>1369717</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>‘s first DLC, <em>The Forsaken Hollows</em>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-dlc-forsaken-hollows-artorias-dark-souls-2000643101">is out later this week</a>. Ahead of its release, publisher Bandai Namco spilled the beans on which of the roguelike multiplayer game’s field bosses have killed players the most. Anyone who has played for any length of time probably expected Bell Bearing Hunter to be crowned the most deadly, but that honor has actually gone to the Royal Carian Knight. Quiet frankly, I don’t believe it.</p> <p>The newly released info graphic lists the “<a href="https://www.bandainamcoent.com/news/elden-ring-nightreign-eye-of-the-storm-infographic">8 most deadly field bosses</a>.” Field bosses are the major enemies that exist at various points on the map during the day. Strong ones give players better loot and more levels. Also an early grave. Here’s the ranking according to Bandai Namco:</p>

 <ol> <li>Royal Carian Knight</li> <li>Draconic Tree Sentinel</li> <li>Erdtree Avatar</li> <li>Bell Bearing Hunter</li> <li>Pot-Troll</li> <li>Black Blade Kindered</li> <li>Death Rite Bird</li> <li>Ulcerated Tree Spirit</li> </ol> <figure id="attachment_2000649223" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000649223"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000649223">FromSoftware / Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <p>The top two aren’t completely out of left field. Both horseback bosses have tons of mobility, are brutal up close, and will wreck you with long-ranged magic attacks, especially if you’re trying to escape. Most of the times I’ve died to one of them, I wasn’t even trying to fight them, just climb up a cliff. Erdtree Avatar is a little more surprising to me. He’s brutal if you’re not ready to fight him, but pretty predictable and easy to avoid once you’ve got decent levels and equipment. So is Death Rite Bird at number seven. I always avoid the Bird at all costs.</p>

 <p>Speaking of avoiding bosses, that brings us to Bell Bearing Hunter. The unsuspecting field boss walks softly but carries a big sword. Many a <em>Nightreign</em> player has encountered him, though “oh yeah, I got this,” and then after landing their first attack and nearly being one-shotted in response, immediately realized “oh no, I actually don’t got this at all.” He’s become a meme in the community for being the one boss everyone knows to avoid. You can tell you’re playing with a new player if you encounter Bell Bearing and they don’t immediately keep running.</p>

 <p>So what’s he doing at number four? There are two possibilities here. 1.) He’s not actually the hardest, and despite his legendary status on the <em>Nightreign</em> subreddit and Discord, players have a way harder time with the Royal Carian Knight and Draconic Tree Sentinel. Or 2.) Bell Bearing has killed fewer players because they never bother fighting him to begin with. It all comes down to whether Bandai Namco is measuring total body count or averaging those proportional to the actual number of encounters. Carian Knight might have killed more players, while Bell Bearing actually has a higher win-rate against them.</p> <p>I’ve asked Bandai Namco for clarification. The <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-deep-night-hard-mode-time-changes-2000624664">mythmaking around <em>Nightreign</em>‘s most legendary boss</a> is at stake. All I know for sure is that when <em>The Forsaken</em> <em>Hollows</em> goes live on December 4, I’m running past both Carian Knight <em>and</em> Bell Bearing.</p>

            <guid>1369708</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I've been annoyingly busy lately, and haven't had as much time as I would have liked to dive into World of Warcraft's housing feature, which is now live in the World of Warcraft: Midnight beta. So even though I've now had multiple tours of its features and possibilities at this point, I was blown away when I poked my head into the community and saw this: </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And this:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And, holy smokes, this:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Come on. There's no way we're going to be able to make that! Well, okay, maybe no way I, a deeply mediocre interior decorator, will be able to make that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nevertheless, early testing for housing in WoW is proving to be quite the success. In fact, amid a lot of controversy around both <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/world-of-warcrafts-next-expansion-is-seemingly-about-to-kill-the-games-biggest-mods">add-on removal</a> and <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/world-of-warcraft/wows-proposed-transmog-overhaul-is-1-step-forward-2-steps-back-and-has-azeroths-fashionistas-rioting-blizzard-truly-are-the-masters-at-snatching-defeat-from-the-jaws-of-victory/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">transmog</a>, it's nice that there's one new feature everyone's just sort of unanimously positive about.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, there are still plenty of questions still up in the air about how housing will work once it gets into the full game, and what its long-term future is going to be. I sat down with Jesse Kurlancheek, housing lead and principal game designer, and Joanna Giannullis, senior UX designer, to pepper them with questions specifically about housing: how will it work, what features can we expect down the line, and what the future holds. Here's our full interview below, which has been lightly edited for length and clarity:</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: So in the past we've sometimes seen Blizzard introduce new features and then drop them at the end of the expansion, like Pandaria's Farms, and the Garrisons in Warlordsof Draenor. Can we be reassured that housing is going to continue to be supported with new content and added to with each new expansion?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jesse Kurlancheek:</strong> I will reassure you as much as possible that that is the case. We have a short-term, medium-term, long-term list of features and content that we want to add. We talk about what are we doing in 12.0 and 12.1 and 12.2 and beyond pretty regularly. One of the things that's most exciting about housing is that, if I ask you, "Hey, what are the three things you want most from housing?" Just rattle off, and I ask Jo[anna Giannullis] and I ask Aramis [the PR representative on the call] and I ask 10 players, I will get a dozen different answers ranging the gamut, but chances are 90, 95% of those things totally make sense in housing. It's such a wide, open field that you can't really say no to a lot of stuff, and because of that, it's really exciting to add all of these things. And you can see a through line as we talk about stuff, we want players to have this area to express themselves, to be creative, to build sort of what they want, their ideal home in Azeroth.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But then we also say, "But we want you to be amongst other players. We want you to be with your friends or Guildies. We want to give you a space that is not just yours but is ours." And then from there, where do people get excited? What sort of sparks your joy? What lights your eyes up? What do players do on day one, on month one that they want to keep doing, that they want to build on? So, we have our roadmap. We have the things that we think are really exciting. We have the things that we know players want. We know that, yeah, you want more content, you want more decor, you want more of this culture or that culture or this expansion stuff or that expansion stuff. You want to be able to have access to these types of features and we want more customization.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We want better quality of life. We want to be able to do things together that we can't right now. But then, we have things that you don't necessarily think about. When you say, oh, when we announced neighborhoods back in the spring, you'd see people sort of be like, "Oh, now that we have this sort of collaborative space, what does that mean for us?" And watching people have conversations about the what ifs with housing is very gratifying. Hopefully, that very long-winded answer reassures you that we're thinking about things as not just a single feature release, that this is a very long-running thing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>You were talking about having a space for people to hang out in. So, I log in and I go do dungeons or whatever it is I do and I play, but there's also sort of a home base that I tend to hang out in. And generally in the history of WoW, that's always been a capital city, because there's an auction house and a bank, and a bunch of other people there. And I'm wondering how you're thinking about the tension between, do I want to hang out in my house where there's no bank and no auction house, or do I want to hang out in a capital city? But if I don't hang out in a capital city, is the capital city going to be empty? How are you kind of thinking about that?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Joanna Giannullis:</strong> I think we are expecting players to sort of settle into different types. We made sure that a lot of things that you go to the capital city for, that's still where you have to go to do that. You got to go and visit your professions trainers, do your crafting orders, visit the bank, the auction house. A lot of those things are still going to be central in the city. You may still want to go there so you can see the Brutosaur parades or whatnot. There's still going to be a lot there for you. But we also wanted the neighbors to be a space where you could be more social with your friends and your Guildies because that's a little bit harder to do in those hub cities. So, we're hoping that there's a nice balance. We're also not making you choose where to put your Hearthstone, we're going to give you a hearth to your actual home so you'll be able to quickly go to either location to do the things that you need to do while you're waiting for raid or what have you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I<strong>s there any thought to making there be practical benefits to being in the house though? I know you probably don't want to put a bank there because then everyone would just sit in there all the time, but I wonder if there's anything else? I saw this thing where tourist NPCs were coming by and taking pictures, which is really cute. I don't know, could NPCs come visit? Could there be a reason to just sit there and hang out that's practical and gameplay oriented?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Giannullis:</strong> Right now, we do have cooking stations in your house. There are a couple small things and I'm sure there's things that will happen in the future, but there are some things that you might find more enjoyable to just do in your home or your plot or your neighborhood, and there's a lot of reasons to keep returning to your neighborhood. We've got endeavors coming up with the launch Midnight and that's something that you're going to be participating in, but then those are also going to send you back out into the world. So, there should be a lot of give and take there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kurlancheek: </strong>We do a fairly hard line on sort of the player power aspect of stuff not coming into housing. You should never feel that, "I have to go engage in a housing loop because if I don't, I can't attune to a raid, or I won't have a 3% DPS boost or whatever." So, that sort of practical stuff is really not on the table. What you mentioned about NPCs coming by and doing cutesy, neighborly, things like that, I think is very much a part of housing. Feeling like this little part of the world that is yours and your friends is alive is important. Seeing the NPCs put the little umbrellas up when it starts raining, seeing them sort of queue up for the shops and things like that really just gives a life and a vibrancy to this place. But it's not practical, right? It's all just vibes, man.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">World of Warcraft Early Access Housing Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Is there any thought to eventually doing something where two people could have possession of a house together or you could give other people permission to decorate your house? I feel like there's a budding scene of potential interior decorator professions that could spring up around this.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kurlancheek:</strong> Yeah, one comes up a lot is, "I'm not especially creative or I'm not great with a tool set. Can my friend come over and sort of deck out my apartment or deck out my house?" Yeah, it's certainly on our radar.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Was there anything that you had to leave on the cutting room floor for this initial launch that you really wish you could have gotten in? And are you willing to say what it is?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Giannullis:</strong> So much. So much. I mean, one of the things that's known is we were able to get the outdoor rooms in for the testing, but those won't be available to players until we actually launch Midnight, just due to some technical reasons, but we were really excited to get them out. We're glad we got them out early so players could give feedback and test them and see what they like about him. But there's some things like that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kurlancheek:</strong> There's exterior lighting we had to disable during alpha or beta, I can't remember what, just because of the performance impacts. If everybody in your sight line put 100 lights on their lawn, that was going to cause a problem. So, we had to disable those. We're going to fix it up, get them working post-launch, post Midnight launch. Yeah, I think there've been a number of things that sort of people held near and dear to their hearts that we had to just not cut, but just be like, "That's going to wait a little bit and then we'll get to it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>In the future, there might be more to types of neighborhoods, right? We have an Alliance and a Horde neighborhood look and then there's set places in those, but are you thinking about other environments you might want to do down the line?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kurlancheek:</strong> Yeah, I think there's, letting players make a space that they vibe with. I'm sorry, I say vibe a lot with housing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>It's very vibes-based.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kurlancheek:</strong> It's very vibes-based. But getting players a space that they feel like they can make theirs is really important. In designing the neighborhoods, we are very intentional about trying to hit a very broad spectrum of, here are players, here are houses that are for very hermit players, that they don't want to live next to anybody. Here are houses that are in a little cute cul-de-sac, so there's 2, 3, 4 houses that a small group of friends can live in. Here's houses on the ocean, here's houses in the woods, here's houses sort of in all of these aspects. But that's not going to necessarily hit everybody's thing, and so figuring out what the large missing pieces there are is part of the early post-release sort of conversation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Giannullis:</strong> Another thing to add to that, something that we've made an effort is going out and looking in the world, especially even in old content and finding decor or foliage, things that we could add as props and decor so that the players can make their space into what they want. So, if they've always loved a specific zone in the game, great, let's add some of those trees and some of those flowers as decor that they can buy and then put in their yard. And that's something that we're working really hard, I think, to get a variety of decor that feels like every little part of the game has its place, and you can go back to old content and get those things and then you can put them in your house.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Going back into old content and finding things, from each of you, what is the most surprising or weird or favorite thing that you found that you're like, "Oh, I have to put that in housing."</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kurlancheek:</strong> So, there's literally a spreadsheet or a form that people can fill out for, "Oh, this thing was something we should add." It's a little bit unfair being me because I can sort of nudge things a little bit harder to go in and say, "Hey, Jay," Jay's the decor lead. I'm like, "Can you add this for me? Literally just for me. I don't know if anyone else cares about it, but I would like it." And he'll be like, "Yeah, fine, that's fine."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I think the more interesting thing has been, this is a massive game, right, and seeing players pull up props that have long been forgotten about. They're like, "That was a cool prop. We should get that in." Someone posted this, it was a shark, it was a new asset. So, probably from Battle for Azeroth if I had to guess. But it was a shark that had been caught, but that was maybe still alive, I'm not quite sure. But it was a very nice, they wanted to make a fishing village on their lawn. And I was like, "That's great." And so, having people post what they're looking for is really useful for us because stuff like that shows up and we're like, "That is a great asset."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Giannullis:</strong> We also have had a lot of, this is oddly internal too. This is, everybody really wants goblin items and then trash items. Those get requested a lot. It's really fun. Yeah, people love them and one of the ones I think we added was the Johnny Trash pile. So, if you get the achievement with him back in Battle for Azeroth, and it's so funny, it's like who wants that? But as soon as you see it, you want it. You are like, "I have to have that. I don't know what for, but I know I need that." And it's so fun to see people get excited about those sort of sort of decor.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kurlancheek:</strong> String lights. Everybody loves the string lights.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Would you ever consider making certain housing items super rare or super secretive? I'm thinking about a decoration equivalent of the Time-Lost Proto-Drake or something that's the reward at the end of a secret quest, like the Hivemind or something?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kurlancheek</strong>: Let's see how I'm going to answer this. So, there's the catalog that shows you all the items in the game, all the decor in the game. There's a flag we can say to hide items until you've earned them. So, yeah, that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Would you ever lock anything behind world first or make something fairly exclusive?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kurlancheek:</strong> I think depends on your definition of fairly. So, meta achievements for expansions are pretty exclusive. And so, we have decor for meta achievements. I think where it's maybe require more conversation of stuff that's time limited. We try to generally err away from things that if, you're like, "Oh, I just need this green placard or whatever, but it was only available for some weird event or something," that kind of feels bad.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Giannullis: </strong>We've also, we talked a while back about what sort of decor would we reward for something like PvP, because we'd like to have, and this is no secret, you can get housing decor from everything in game. If there's a way you can earn something in game, we're going to let you get housing decor that way. So, we wanted to do something for PvP and it was like, okay, well if we do this and then other people that don't PvP want it, is that going to feel bad? And so, the concept of trophies came up and you can see some of that early stuff is showing up on the beta. So, I think there's been real conscious effort to make sure that if it's something that you can get from something very exclusive, it's not something that we expect everybody to want to have a ton of in their house or it's something that you can get a version of another way. But if you see that specific version, you know they did something awesome to get it. It's a balance there.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There's been real conscious effort to make sure that if it's something that's very exclusive, it's not something that we expect everybody to want to have a ton of.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>When I log in on December 2nd and I have access to this feature, I'm just immediately going to have a bunch of decor already, right? Because I have achievements that exist, I have things that I have done before, so I should just have a bunch of stuff?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kurlancheek:</strong> You will, if you've been playing hard for 5 years, 10 years, 20 years, you will potentially log into 150, 200 things that you will just get spammed with and showered with and be able to be like, "Oh yeah, I remember when I did that quest in MoP or something and it gave me whatever it gave me." And the meta achievements kick in and you start with this very eclectic mix.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I'm sure whatever I have is totally mismatched and makes no sense.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Giannullis: </strong>Well, we also start you with the starter packs, which have some more streamlined modern items. Yeah. So, you'll have a mix of some wild stuff and then some, okay, at least I have a bed and a chair. So, we're going to start you with a good mix of things, I think.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Are you looking into any eventual copy-paste functionality or the ability to save custom item combinations? I know that's something a lot of people have been asking about.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Giannullis:</strong> A lot of people have asked about that. Definitely copy-paste. Being able, once you get something just right in advanced mode, not having to do it all over again. We're definitely keeping an eye on everything that people are asking for. There's a lot of things that people want. There's a lot of things we want to do, so it's just trying to decide what's going to help players the most.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yeah, I mean the next question is basically the same one about export strings. If people want to decorate a house, show people and then have someone else copy it if they have those items.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kurlancheek:</strong> Yeah, I think when we talk about any feature that's sort of in housing, it's what is sort of maximally useful across that spectrum of different players. And so, when you talk about something like importing or exporting strings of stuff, that helps the interior designer type player who wants to sort of provide services. It helps the players that are not necessarily super creative, right, are not really jazzed about the mechanical side of decorating. They have a vision but don't want use the tool set.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It helps the players that they like to browse. You just sort of, I have a room for this and room for that, a room for this and a room for that. And also, I think maybe the most compelling part about it is it helps players have a sense of ownership where you might not already. So, if you're a great decorator and I'm a less good decorator, and you make your little pirate cave and like a great pirate cave, "I'm going to take that pirate cave, but I don't like that she doesn't have sharks in the water," or whatever. And then, I throw a bunch of sharks in the water. Now that's sort of mine in a way that remixing of content in general is sort of a part of the internet. Being able to do that in game is also really valuable.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>How are you thinking about things like housing contests and stuff like that? I don't know. I think about Race to World First and how that's a tune-in event, and I feel like I would watch an interior decorating show.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Giannullis: </strong>The thing is we've already seen a bunch of creators pop up that are like, "I'm a housing creator, this is what I'm doing." And they're starting to run their own challenges and contests, and so that's really exciting to see. I think we're all kind of watching that to see what sort of activities the players are getting up to.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kurlancheek: </strong>Yeah, and how we can sort of build tools to support whatever that sort of shenanigans of being, right? A Trial of Style kind of thing. What do players need to be able to do that? What sort of functionality makes sense to better enable that?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Giannullis:</strong> I remember talking about how many people you can even have in your house at a time, and it was something that we were working really hard to make sure we could get that to a good place because we know people want to have parties, they want to do all these different things and we're trying to make sure that what we're building is supporting that and can handle that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Is there a limit to how many people can come into your house at a time?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kurlancheek:</strong> There is, there is. We're still figuring out where the line is. We do our stress testing and throw a ton of bots into a very decorated house. What happens? In the neighborhoods, regardless of what the solution or whatever the number is there, everybody who lives in the neighborhood can come into the neighborhood. So, if there's 55 players and the max number of players is 100, say, then we reserve those 55 lots or 55 places for people that live there. So, you can always come into your house.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>So I know we can decorate the exteriors of our houses. Is there any thought to stuff like, okay, my guild has our neighborhood together. We can collectively decorate the parts of the outside that are not attached to a house. Can we build a little community center?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kurlancheek:</strong> Yes. The idea of us building together is super compelling, I think. As soon as players can build something themselves, we want to build things together. And so, what that ends up being depends on what people are trying to do or what is interesting for them. If it is just us coming together in the town square and hanging up balloons or whatever, because we're having a birthday party, what does that look like? Versus we want to build a racetrack for our mounts around the outside of a town and what does that look like? Versus we want to do prop hunts and dueling things and all of these different potential pieces of stuff. What's juicy? </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>It feels really wild to talk about it. It feels like we're almost discussing a completely different game than WoW, like a game within a game. I could very easily just do this all the time and then my raid team would wonder why I'm not there.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kurlancheek:</strong> That's an actual problem, by the way, that there are people that are finding housing really compelling and be like, "I don't know if I can make it to a raid tonight. I'm busy with my house."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I don't know that that's a problem you even need to solve, but you were talking about having creators that just want to do housing. And I don't know, has that changed the team's perspective on how they approach this? Has that changed the perspective of the holistic design of the game?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Giannullis:</strong> I think we've already always started wanting to make sure that we were kind of in it for the long haul. This is a feature that we know is going to live in the game for some time to come, and we're going to be adding more to it with every, not just every patch, but in future expansions and we want to keep growing it. And so, when you say like, "Oh, well what about all these things we got?" It's like, yeah, over time, yeah, let's do it. Tell us what you want and let's see what we can do.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The idea of us building together is super compelling, I think. As soon as players can build something themselves, we want to build things together.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>This is how we eventually get the dance hall. This is the way.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kurlancheek:</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Oh, dance hall is, that's a real low hanging fruit. People are going to toss that together right quick.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I'm sure they already have.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">What is the biggest piece of feedback you're seeing from players right now and what do you plan to do to address it?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kurlancheek:</strong> I'm going to reframe that to critical feedback because the biggest piece of feedback is just, "We want, give us more decor, give us more features, give us more of this, that and the other thing." I think one of the things that gets talked about most frequently is outdoor decor limits are too low. People want to be able to build more stuff outside their house. We're trying. We're going to see where things land and sort of, we want players to be as creative as they want to be. And placing restrictions on folks is never the goal in any of our sort of guiding principles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Giannullis:</strong> I know a lot of players are giving feedback about bits and pieces of the UI and the UX for the actual act of decorating, and there's not a strong one. There's a lot of things and things that we know will help players decorate. I think we're just trying to keep all of those in mind. We're keeping accessibility in mind a lot as well. We know that there's some things that might work for one player but not another. So, we're just keeping in our eyes open to what we're seeing and trying to make sure that's all stuff that we'll be able to address in the future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

                <p>Industry leaders in Japan recently gathered to honor Tomonobu Itagaki, the creator of Dead or Alive and the 3D Ninja Gaiden series, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/legendary-dead-or-alive-and-ninja-gaiden-creator-tomonobu-itagaki-has-died/1100-6535478/" data-ref-id="1100-6535478">who passed away in October at age 58</a>. The memorial venue was filled with heartfelt tributes, including copies of his games, artwork, swords, and pieces of his iconic clothing. Photos shared by attendees showed just how much he meant to the gaming community.</p><p>Itagaki was a major figure in Japanese game development. He founded Team Ninja in the late 1990s and helped shape modern action and fighting games. At the memorial, Koei Tecmo executive Yosuke Hayashi shared memories of meeting him in 2001. Hayashi recalled being assigned to Itagaki's team and being told there was no work for him.</p><p>"I was assigned to your department as a game planner. You told me you had no work for me. That’s what you told me. Two weeks after I was assigned, I really had no work, haha. At the time, I lamented my bad luck, thinking it was the worst possible encounter," he said (via a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ninjagaiden/comments/1p8ttbe/yosuke_hayashis_eulogy_about_itagaki/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Redditor translator</a>).</p><p>Hayashi's strongest memory was developing Ninja Gaiden for the Xbox between 2003 and 2004. He said the project felt chaotic and sometimes impossible, but Itagaki never gave up. "The two of us spent 12 hours every night checking every adjustment to the game," he said. When talking about his former mentor, Hayashi added, "You were so pure and cool," showing how much respect he still held for him.</p><p>Itagaki left Tecmo in 2008 after legal disputes, though he had been declared <a href="https://gamespot.com/articles/itagaki-and-tecmo-settle-lawsuit/1100-6252501/" data-target="true">innocent of harassment charges</a> in court the year before. He <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/itagaki-and-tecmo-settle-lawsuit/1100-6252501/" data-ref-id="1100-6252501">later reached a settlement</a> with Koei Tecmo over unpaid bonuses for Dead or Alive 4 and went on to create Devil's Third at Valhalla Game Studios. Before leaving Tecmo, he told Hayashi, "Don't change the logo," a message Hayashi remembered for years.</p><p>Hayashi also shared the final message he received from Itagaki: "Thank you for remembering our promise. Times have changed ... selling a million copies doesn't earn you much recognition anymore. Please keep making great products from now on."</p><p>After his death, a final note appeared on Itagaki's <a href="https://www.facebook.com/tomonobu.itagaki" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook page</a>. "My life was a continuous battle which I kept winning. I caused a lot of trouble for others too," it read via Facebook translation. "I take pride in having fought to the end, and having followed my convictions. I have no regrets, but I am deeply sorry that I could not deliver new works to my fans. I'm sorry. So it goes."</p>

Both the Artifact and Zune sweaters are available for $79.95, and the Xbox sweater can be pre-ordered for $59.95.</p><p>Microsoft first started sending out ugly sweaters to Windows fans in 2018, and then <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21779499/microsoft-windows-ugly-sweater-paint-xp-95-girls-who-code">sold them to customers</a> from 2020 onwards. For some reason the software maker didn’t ship an ugly sweater in 2024, but this year’s sweaters can be purchased through Microsoft’s <a href="https://microsoftmerchandise.com/Shop/#/catalog/3286-Holiday-Shopping">online company store</a> or its brick and mortar version in Redmond, Washington. Microsoft will also have its holiday sweaters available at its Microsoft store (experience center) in New York City.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/835130/microsoft-ugly-sweater-clippy-zune-brown-xbox]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>1369690</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em><a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-review-is-it-good-xbox-ps5-rpg-1851770647">Assassin’s Creed: Shadows</a>,</em> Ubisoft’s latest big open-world RPG, makes the long-rumored leap to Switch 2 this week, and footage of the game running on Nintendo’s console looks as impressive and playable as the publisher’s previous port of<em><a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-port-patch-is-ithttps://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-port-patch-is-it-good-2000624465good-2000624465"> Star Wars: Outlaws</a>.</em></p> <p>When <em>Assassin’s Creed: Shadows</em> launched earlier this year, <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-graphics-seasons-screenshots-1851770252">I called it one of the best-looking open-world video games of the generation</a>. Ubisoft’s digital recreation of Feudal Japan featured multiple seasons, incredible draw distances, gorgeous lighting, rock-solid performance, and highly detailed environments. So when Ubisoft officially announced the long-rumored Switch 2 port of <em>Shadows</em> was real and launching on December 2, I was nervous. Sure, the publisher pulled off a technical marvel by getting <em>Outlaws</em> to run on Switch 2. But would <em>Shadows</em> work as well on Nintendo’s machine? The answer is yes. Yes, indeed.</p>

 <p>Ahead of its Tuesday launch, some folks who have already been playing <em>Shadows</em> on Switch 2 began sharing direct comparisons of the new port with how the game looks on PS5 and Xbox. <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh5sCdKyVlc">YouTube channel ElAnalistaDeBits</a> posted a great video comparing all three versions, and perhaps the biggest takeaway is that while <em>Shadows</em> on Switch has, understandably, cut some graphical corners, it’s still remarkable how alike all versions of the game look side-by-side.</p>

   <p>Like <em>Star Wars: Outlaws</em> on Switch 2, which impressed us earlier this year, <em>Shadows</em> runs at 30 FPS on Nintendo’s console with no option to play at 60FPS. That’s a shame, but also not surprising. It should also be noted that <em>Shadows</em> on Switch 2 isn’t a rock-solid 30, but pretty dang close. And hey, while it might lack a higher-framerate option, the <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/news/3eHpj3aktX4nWY150OEHJL/assassins-creed-shadows-deep-dive-into-the-nintendo-switch-2-system-port">Switch 2 port of <em>Shadows</em> lets you manipulate the map using the touchscreen</a>, which is handy.</p>

 <p>The biggest visual cuts found in<em> Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> on Switch 2 involve reduced draw distance, a less sharp image, and water reflections. In particular, reflections are completely gone in most places on the Switch 2 port, which can make rivers and lakes look dull and flat. On the flipside, texture quality is good and looks more than fine when playing the game in handheld mode. In fact, a lot of these changes will be much harder to spot when playing on the Switch 2’s screen compared to a big 4K TV.</p> <p><em>Star Wars: Outlaws</em> and now <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> seem to indicate that Ubisoft is taking the Switch 2 very seriously as a platform. The publisher has delivered two of the best-looking and playing <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ports-cyberpunk-2077-ps4-ps5-xbox-dlss-outlaws-1851782817">open-world games on the console this year</a>, and I imagine past Ubisoft titles will likely be making the leap in the future. And with cross save across all consoles and PC, the Switch 2 might become a very popular way for Ubisoft open world sicko fans, like myself, to enjoy these big games on the go or when traveling.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[New Sonic the Hedgehog Film Gets December 2028 Release]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/new-sonic-the-hedgehog-film-december-2028-paramount-spinoff/</link>
            <guid>1369687</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Paramount Pictures has announced that a new Sonic the Hedgehog film is set to release in December 2028. This is on top of the already-announced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-4-confirmed-for-2027/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sonic the Hedgehog 4</a>, releasing in March 2027.</p>



<p>Released in 2020, the live-action Sonic the Hedgehog films have been a surprise hit with fans and newcomers alike. Despite backlash for the original design, Paramount has turned the Blue Blur into a box-office smash hit. The latest release, Sonic the Hedgehog 3, has made over $492 million, making it the third-highest-grossing video game movie of all time behind <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/a-minecraft-movie-awards-campaign-warner-bros-oscars/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A Minecraft Movie</a> and The Super Mario Bros. Movie. Now, it seems there’s a lot more left to explore in the universe, even after the upcoming fourth film.</p>







<h2 id="h-untitled-sonic-the-hedgehog-movie-set-to-release-on-december-22nd-2028">Untitled Sonic the Hedgehog Movie Set to Release on December 22nd, 2028</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/sonic-spinoff-movie-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-live-action-film-2028-release-dates-1236596459/">an article from Variety</a>, Paramount revealed the dates for two new upcoming films: a live-action Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and an untitled Sonic the Hedgehog movie, with Sonic releasing on December 22nd, 2028. The article mentions it’s a “Sonic Universe Event Film, so it’s unclear if the film is going to be a spinoff and, if so, what that spinoff could be. Fans have already gotten one in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/knuckles-series-release-date-and-official-trailer-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paramount+’s Knuckles show</a>, but it seems this is an actual film. It’s also unknown who will be directing and producing, especially since longtime collaborator Neal H. Moritz is now helming the TMNT film series.</p>



<p>In any case, it’ll be interesting to see what the new Sonic film could be. Fans have been asking for Team Chaotix and Shadow to get their own projects, so perhaps it could be that. With Sonic the Hedgehog 3 introducing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amy and Metal Sonic</a> in the post-credit scenes, maybe there’s a spinoff somewhere in there. Either way, more Sonic is never a bad thing and, luckily, Paramount has a good streak going.</p>

In February next year, it'll be joined by the brand new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties">Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties</a> which is much more than a remake of Yakuza 3, says RGG Studio director Yokoyama Masayoshi.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://game.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/interview/2066901.html">GameWatch</a> (translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties-include-major-hints-about-where-the-like-a-dragon-series-is-headed-rgg-studio-lead-says/">Automaton</a>), Masayoshi-san has said that this remake "contains some major hints about the future direction of the series."</p>
<p>"We haven't officially announce anything related to that yet," Masayoshi continues "But once you play it, I think you’ll get an idea, or rather, a pretty solid sense of what we intend to do with the series going forward.”</p>
<p>Well, considering there are five more mainline games (not including spin-offs such as Judgment or Gaiden) set <em>after</em> Yakuza 3, that's a little surprising!</p>
<figure data-uuid="e4f4ecc176b6f"><a title="Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e4f4ecc176b6f/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Dark Ties is the major new content, but other changes may well be coming — <em><span></span> Image: SEGA</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>None of those are on Switch consoles either, and with <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/yakuza_like_a_dragon">Yakuza: Like A Dragon</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/like_a_dragon_infinite_wealth">Infinite Wealth</a> both starring a different protagonist (though Kiryu does pop up, because of course he does), it certainly leaves us with some questions.</p>
<p>Masayoshi also insists that the new story starring Yoshitaka Mine, Dark Ties, is "extremely shocking", stating that it's one of the "darkest" stories in the series' history: "if you think Yakuza Kiwami 3 is just a remake, you’d be hugely mistaken."</p>
<p>Well, even without that little hint, it certainly sounds like a lot more than a rehash of the original PS3 release.</p>

<p><em>Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties comes to Switch 2 on 12th February 2025. Will you be picking the game up? What do you think is in store for the series' future? Get pumped up in the comments below.</em></p>

			<p>At the time of this writing, The Game Awards is only ten days away, which means that we're getting close to the end of 2025 and that we're potentially days away from seeing the biggest reveals for the video game industry in 2025. The nominees for <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-nominees-full-list/">almost every category were already announced</a>, save for the only category that is decided entirely by public vote: the Player's Voice Award.</p>



<p>The Player's Choice Award is decided over three rounds of voting, and the first round <a href="https://thegameawards.com/brackets/players-voice">was pushed live to The Game Awards website today</a> for players to check out and vote on. It starts with 30 games, of which players can pick their favourite 10 to potentially move into the next round.</p>



<p>You can head to the website to select your preferred 10 now, and it's recommended that you do so sooner than later if you want your vote to count in each round, since the voting for round one will end as of Tuesday, December 2, at 6pm PT / 9pm ET. </p>



<p>Unsurprisingly, all six games nominated for Game of the Year made the cut for the Players' Voice. In fact, most of the 30 games are nominated in at least one other category for this year's Game Awards. There are, however, a couple of games that aren't nominated anywhere else save for Players' Voice, including Delta Force, Genshin Impact, Warframe, and REPO.</p>



<p>You can check out the full list of the 30 games nominated for Players' Voice here:</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>It’s been almost three months since right-wing commentator Charlie Kirk was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-kirk-shooter-helldivers-bullet-engraving-2000625439"><span>assassinated in September</span></a><span>. When it happened, the right was quick to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sucker-punch-charlie-kirk-ghost-yotei-boycott-2000646987"><span>tear down anyone who didn’t suddenly forget his prejudiced rhetoric when he was killed</span></a><span>, but in the months since, a lot of the fallout of Kirk’s death has been in memes, whether that be in </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@anaylhc/video/7574231060104465686?lang=en"><span>“Kirkifying” images</span></a><span> by photoshopping his face on anything you can find, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-kirk-assassination-bandai-namco-ai-model-gunpla-2000626472"><span>AI mock-ups of gunpla sets</span></a><span> of his death, or </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nba-2k26-charlie-kirk-character-creator-neck-tattoo-2000629891"><span>creating characters that look like him in video games</span></a><span>. In the past few weeks, an AI-generated song about Kirk has begun spreading throughout the internet, and you’ve probably heard it in fandom spaces online.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUHpUXlsvbI"><span>“We Are Charlie Kirk”</span></a><span> is a three-and-a-half-minute, AI-generated slop song by AI “artist” Spalexma. As the name implies, the song is meant to be a tribute to Kirk, and a declaration that his supporters will “carry the flame” of his right-wing views. It is absolutely one of the most ostentatious, dramatic pieces of “music” I’ve ever heard. The song was originally posted just a week after Kirk’s death, but it has gained significant traction on various platforms in the weeks since.</span></p>

  <p><span>The AI singer is belting with the passion you’d typically hear in an ‘80s power ballad, all about how those still on Earth will pick up the torch now that Kirk is gone. Whether the AI slop was meant as a genuine tribute to Kirk or a musical encapsulation of the right’s self-important made-up war on behalf of Christianity, the song has, like much of the reaction to Kirk’s death, been swept up in the shitpost factory, and the internet has been littered with videos set to the song with more views than the original. Some videos play it straight, simply using its hokey, anthemic instrumentation as a backdrop for dramatic imagery. Others have basically made it a modern-day Rick Roll, a musical rugpull meant to troll anyone who passes by it online.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Disney has updated the ‘GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY’ soundtrack after several music licenses expired.</p> <p>(via: Disney+) <a href="https://t.co/7VGxePHyOv">pic.twitter.com/7VGxePHyOv</a></p> <p>— Wong Updates (@WongUpdates) <a href="https://twitter.com/WongUpdates/status/1994897434758320635?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote>               <p><span>While a lot of “We Are Charlie Kirk’s” appearances are rooted in internet-poisoned irony, a lot of people are using the song to make fun of the right’s cult-like admiration for its political figures, like this video in which someone saw a truck covered in images of Kirk and the American Flag. There’s a comment under this one that says, “They don’t even treat Jesus like this.”&nbsp;</span></p>     <p><span>“We Are Charlie Kirk” is currently Spalexma’s most-popular song on streaming services like Spotify, but even there, its streams are dwarfed by the views videos using it have gotten over the past three months. So it seems like most people aren’t listening to it unironically. The AI “artist” has several other songs that seem to be Christian in nature, so I assume this song was meant to be an earnest tribute to Kirk, but the internet has definitely not taken it that way, and continues to run it into the ground.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">"what are we?" we are charlie kirk girl</p> <p>— brandon (@BR0IG) <a href="https://twitter.com/BR0IG/status/1992709018201317653?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 23, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">some kids on the bus started blasting we are charlie kirk &amp; the hooded guy in front of me turned round to look at them and it was riz ahmed <a href="https://t.co/QhWZnWVbyC">pic.twitter.com/QhWZnWVbyC</a></p> <p>— lú (@botaniyya) <a href="https://twitter.com/botaniyya/status/1994448939764904010?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 28, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">“We are Charlie Kirk, we carry the flame, we fight for the gospel, we'll honor his name.” <a href="https://t.co/WzQhLav68c">pic.twitter.com/WzQhLav68c</a></p> <p>— Just a Random JOLLY Person 🎄☃️ (@aRandom_acc_) <a href="https://twitter.com/aRandom_acc_/status/1994122109195563292?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 27, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">"We are all Charlie Kirk" <a href="https://t.co/hZUO5F3ivT">pic.twitter.com/hZUO5F3ivT</a></p> <p>— TheRealThelmaJohnson (@TheRealThelmaJ1) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheRealThelmaJ1/status/1992828878029828213?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 24, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">teto: we, are, charlie kirk. we are charlie kirk</p> <p>miku: we, are, charlie kirk. we are charlie kirk</p> <p>neru: we, are, charlie kirk. we are charlie kirk</p> <p>all 3 together: we, are, charlie kirk. we are charlie kirk <a href="https://t.co/RV1PMnafpv">pic.twitter.com/RV1PMnafpv</a></p> <p>— REIKA (@0_ka815) <a href="https://twitter.com/0_ka815/status/1991768913039004058?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">GTA 6 will reportedly feature a “We Are Charlie Kirk” radio station that loops the track for roughly 6/7 hours 🔥‼️ <a href="https://t.co/6dkjoNxxja">pic.twitter.com/6dkjoNxxja</a></p> <p>— GTA 6 Info (@GTASixInfo) <a href="https://twitter.com/GTASixInfo/status/1993760858368078228?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">this is part of the reason why the "we are charlie kirk" and "kirkification" memes went insanely viral. you can't mandate reverence for a generation that saw their classmates get slaughtered in school shootings. <a href="https://t.co/LQkovzmD7f">https://t.co/LQkovzmD7f</a></p> <p>— hasanabi (@hasanthehun) <a href="https://twitter.com/hasanthehun/status/1994510376046834132?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 28, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

The reel was quickly scrubbed off the internet, but Redditors found and posted mirrors of it. And as viewed by GameSpot, the clips do look like early GTA 6.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> History of Grand Theft Auto</p>
      </div>
<p>One clip shows a male character detach a "LomBike"--likely a parody of the IRL LimeBike rental service--from its docking station, turn it around, and sit on it. Seconds later, that same character returns the bike to its dock.</p><p>The other two clips show a female character getting off a pick-up truck in two different ways. In the first, she swings her legs out from inside the bed and jumps down. The second sees the same female character, standing atop the roof of the same pick-up truck, jump down into the bed before vaulting over and landing on the ground.</p><p>This isn't anything new for GTA. You can hijack and drive cars, so of course Rockstar Games would be creating multiple animations for how you get in and out of them, or climb onto and jump off of them. You can also ride bikes in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grand-theft-auto-san-andreas/" data-ref-id="5000-18357">GTA: San Andreas</a> and other games in the franchise, and as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-development-footage-leaks-online-before-being-scrubbed-from-the-internet-but-it-didnt-reveal-much-at-all-and-weve-even-seen-part-of-it-before-in-an-official-screenshot" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN noted</a>, "LomBike" made a small appearance in <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/VI/_next/image?url=%2FVI%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2FVice_City_03.9b0e117a.jpg&amp;w=1024&amp;q=75" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an official screenshot</a> from earlier this year. So, it's very likely that you can rent and ride bikes in GTA 6, and that's maybe the most fascinating part of this leak: It suggests what we could expect from the game when it comes out.</p><p>This seemingly real leak comes not long after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-generated-gta-6-gameplay-leaks-are-going-viral-following-delay/1100-6536534/" data-ref-id="1100-6536534">AI-generated leaks of the game went viral</a> on social media.
