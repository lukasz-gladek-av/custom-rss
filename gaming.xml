                <p>Amidst Xbox's multiplatform publishing strategy, Sony is reiterating its commitment to prioritizing the PlayStation 5. During a recent <a href="https://www.irwebmeeting.com/sony/vod/20250613/x8R5srwN/bsm_02_en/1_GNS/fireside_chat/index.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sony business meeting</a> and "fireside chat," PlayStation Studios CEO Hermen Hulst stated the company is taking a "very measured, very deliberate approach" when it comes to deciding if and when a first-party title appears on other platforms like PC.</p><p dir="ltr">Sony has been porting many of its marquee titles to PC for years. Some of its more recent live-service titles, like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/helldivers-2/" data-ref-id="5000-589428">Helldivers 2</a> and the short-lived <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/concord/" data-ref-id="5000-589443">Concord</a>, released day-and-date on console and PC, while tentpole single-player games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/god-of-war-ragnarok/" data-ref-id="5000-519021">God of War: Ragnarok</a> or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ghost-of-tsushima/" data-ref-id="5000-474583">Ghost of Tsushima</a> typically release on PS5 first and arrive at least a year later on PC.</p><p dir="ltr">When asked about the industry's move towards multiplatform titles and how Sony is looking to protect the "value" of the PS5 console, Hulst indicated that Sony isn't looking to change its current strategy.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's important to realize that we're really thoughtful about bringing our franchises off console to reach new audiences and that we're taking a very measured, very deliberate approach in doing that," Hulst said. "Particularly on the single-player side, our tentpole titles, they're such a point of differentiation for the PlayStation console."</p><p dir="ltr">He went on to say that Sony's first-party titles are meant to be a showcase for the PS5 hardware, and that the company wants players to "get the best experience" from these titles playing on PS5.</p><p dir="ltr">"We're very thoughtful about how and if and how we bring these titles to other platforms," Hulst said.</p><p dir="ltr">It's an approach that appears to be working, even as Microsoft doubles down on its multiplatform game strategy of releasing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-games-are-doing-super-well-on-playstation-store-publisher-tops-preorder-charts/1100-6531273/" data-ref-id="1100-6531273">Xbox titles on PS5 with positive results</a>. When asked about Microsoft's strategy and whether or not it's a good thing, Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO Hideaki Nishino said he believed competition in the industry is good and creates innovation, but that Sony is "confident and committed to our current strategy."</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to discussing how its approaching platform exclusivity, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-re-commits-to-live-service-games-says-bungies-marathon-wont-suffer-concords-fate/1100-6532419/" data-ref-id="1100-6532419">Sony reiterated its commitment to live-service titles</a>, with Hulst stating he doesn't believe Bungie's upcoming shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marathon/" data-ref-id="5000-589442">Marathon</a> will suffer the same fate as Concord.</p>

                <p>Microsoft is shaking things up with its new strategy of launching its own games on rival platforms, and now Sony has reacted to Microsoft's latest moves. As part of an<a href="https://www.irwebmeeting.com/sony/vod/20250613/x8R5srwN/bsm_02_en/1_GNS/fireside_chat/index.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> investor fireside chat</a>, Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO Hideaki Nishino was asked to respond to speculation from investors that Microsoft is "moving away from the console."</p><p>To be clear, Microsoft has made no announcements about moving away from building hardware, and in fact, the company has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-xbox-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6525379/" data-ref-id="1100-6525379">already said it's working on its next console</a>. In any event, Nishino responded by saying Microsoft trying something new and creating an additional competitive element in the gaming landscape by launching more of its games on rival systems is "healthy and pushes us to innovate."</p><p>"There are multiple participants who together drive the overall game industry, and while there are new engagement models being explored, we ultimately think this is a good thing," he said. "However, as I mentioned earlier, we are confident and committed on our current strategy, and there isn't an urgent need for us to pivot. We will continue to monitor play patterns and invest appropriately as required."</p><p>The next big Xbox game to come to PlayStation is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-reloaded-multiplayer-beta-how-to-get-in-whats-in-it-start-times-and-more/1100-6532379/" data-ref-id="1100-6532379">Gears of War Reloaded</a>, which debuts in August, representing the first time the Gears franchise will be available outside of Xbox and PC. Microsoft recently launched Doom: The Dark Ages on PlayStation, and the company's biggest series, Call of Duty, is developed for both Xbox and PlayStation systems.</p><p>Microsoft's Xbox platform is understood to be the lowest-selling of the main three when compared against Sony's PlayStation and Nintendo's Switch devices. Microsoft is no longer pushing Xbox hardware as much as it once was, as it's rolled out a new marketing campaign saying <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-xbox-campaign-reminds-people-xbox-is-more-than-just-the-console/1100-6527759/" data-ref-id="1100-6527759">you don't need to buy an Xbox</a> because many of the products you may already own can play Xbox games.</p><p>Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-explains-why-microsoft-doesnt-need-you-to-buy-a-new-xbox-this-holiday/1100-6483787/" data-ref-id="1100-6483787">Xbox's goal is to increase the number of people playing on Xbox</a>, but "playing on Xbox" doesn't mean a dedicated Xbox console. "It means somebody who is logging in and playing a part of our ecosystem, whether first-party or third-party. And it could be on an Android phone. It could be on a Switch. It could be on a PC. That's how we think about it," he said.</p><p>Game consoles make money, but games and services are more lucrative. This is why Microsoft is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsofts-secret-weapon-for-nextgen-is-xbox-game-/1100-6477138/" data-ref-id="1100-6477138">pushing Xbox Game Pass so hard.</a> Creating more subscribers gives Microsoft a regular and recurring revenue stream. Bringing Xbox games to PlayStation and Nintendo devices is another way Microsoft can make more money as well.</p><p>Spencer has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-boss-says-hes-accountable-to-microsoft-for-running-a-good-business/1100-6532338/" data-ref-id="1100-6532338">time and again repeated his comments that Xbox is a business</a>, and his job is to grow that business, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-defends-xbox-studio-closures-layoffs-i-have-to-run-a-sustainable-business/1100-6524121/" data-ref-id="1100-6524121">even if it means laying people off, closing studios, and cancelling games. </a></p><p>Also during the presentation, Sony management <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/for-ps6-sony-is-betting-on-hardware-power-not-the-cloud/1100-6532420/" data-ref-id="1100-6532420">briefly discussed the PlayStation 6</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-doesnt-sound-too-concerned-about-switch-2-even-after-a-record-breaking-debut/1100-6532425/" data-ref-id="1100-6532425">responded to the record-breaking launch of the Switch 2.</a> Sony also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dont-expect-playstations-current-pc-port-strategy-to-change-anytime-soon/1100-6532428/" data-ref-id="1100-6532428">discussed its strategy for PC releases.</a></p>

<header><section>
<p>For the dreamers!</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure><a title="switch 2 demo kiosks" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5c0f6cb2fc69d/switch-2-demo-kiosks.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Joey Chiu / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>It's been absolutely flipping ages since this particular writer has had a go at a good old-fashioned demo kiosk for a Nintendo console (although many, many hours were spent on a SNES one in my local Woolworths back in the day), and so it's very exciting to see them out in the wild and being deployed for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-guide-ultimate-resource">Switch 2</a>. Nostalgia: it gets us every time.</p>
<p>Yes, we love a good demo kiosk, as you can maybe tell, and we're excited to see that gamers are beginning to spot Switch 2-flavoured kiosks being delivered and set up at various locations in the US, this time in a Target, for instance.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1l9uqpc/nintendo_switch_2_demo_kiosks/">As seen over on Reddit</a>, the Nintendo-red setups enable anyone to get a shot on a bunch of titles. There's no half-measures here, you don't even have to get an angry staff member to switch the cart out when you want to try something else. Now that's progress.</p>

<p>As you can see from the selection of images above, it seems as though potential Switch 2 owners (or people like us who just can't walk past a chance to play something, even if we already own it) can select from the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Mario Party Jamboree</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>. Nice!</p>
<p>The images also show a kiosk with both a Switch and Switch 2 demoed side by side, and everything seems reasonably peaceful. So, no sibling rivalry has set in just yet, then.</p>
<p>Demos on the kiosk in the pics apparently last 10 minutes, and a quick press of the Home button allows you to get back to selecting something else. We sort of want one of these now. Does anyone have Mario's phone number?</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Have you seen any Switch 2 demo kiosks around? In fact, when was the last time you even had a shot on a demo kiosk?</em></p>

			<p>Koei Tecmo has announced that Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; The White Guardian will launch on PC, PS5, and Nintendo Switch, on&nbsp;<strong>September 26, 2025</strong>. It will also release on PS4, though the PS4 release will only be made available in Japan.</p>
<p>A new 'first look' into the game from Koei Tecmo debuts the first new trailer for the game since it was first announced last year, digging into the new characters introduced in Atelier Resleriana, and a first look at some gameplay.</p>
<p>The story of Atelier Resleriana follows two protagonists on the continent of Lantarna, Rias Eidreise and Slade Clauslyter, who are charged with figuring out why citizens of Hallfein have disappeared, while simultaneously trying to restore their own hometown.</p>
<p><iframe title="Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian - First Look" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Aw0Sq119Yfk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This release will be the second game in the Atelier series to come out in 2025, after Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; The Envisioned Land came out on consoles and PC this past March.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/atelier-yumia-the-alchemist-of-memories-the-envisioned-land-make-aladiss-great-again/">In his review, Wccftech's Kai Tatsumoto wrote</a>, "<em>Sometimes too over-simplified, Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; The Envisioned Land charts a new path for the series as they try to draw in new players that might have found the mandatory crafting and time limits of earlier Atelier titles too daunting.</em>"</p>
<p>We'll see in September if this latest entry into the series will continue that trend, and if Koei Tecmo and developer Gust have been able to find a new balance between keeping things simple for new players while also complex enough for veteran players to dig into the minutiae of the game's systems.</p>

However, there’s one set I want to draw attention to, and it’s the character posters Volta worked on for each party member, as well as for Varric, the player’s dwarven peepaw, and the elven trickster god Solas.</p><p>A lot of <em>The Veilguard</em>’s marketing campaign focused on the party above all else. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-best-companions-lucanis-taash-neve-1851688830&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-best-companions-lucanis-taash-neve-1851688830">The characters you befriend and woo</a></span> are typically the draw of BioWare’s games, so it makes sense that the studio would want to spotlight them as much as possible in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-dreadwolf-teaser-trailer-xbox-1851528812&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-dreadwolf-teaser-trailer-xbox-1851528812">trailers</a></span>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-companions-podcast-vows-vengeance-1851629597&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-companions-podcast-vows-vengeance-1851629597">podcasts</a></span>, and promotional art. At some point, this included some incredible character art for the team that is maybe some of the best art we’ve ever had of the group. Each piece captures a particular character’s personality, aesthetics, and story in one clean shot.</p><p>To call out a few favorites, I really love the Solas, Davrin, and Emmrich pieces. The cool blue tones on Solas give him an air of god-like power, and his dread wolf namesakes appear alongside him as loyal pets. He wasn’t intimidating when he debuted in 2014’s <em>Inquisition</em>, but he sure is here. Davrin is my <em>Veilguard</em> boo, but I promise I’m not being biased giving him a shoutout here. He and our griffon son Assan look fucking sick here, with the beast perched on the Warden’s back and defending him with his wing. That being said, I think the Emmrich piece is my favorite. Seeing the mage surrounded by adoring skeletons, including one that lovingly caresses his face, captures both his love of necromancy and his gentle romantic side. Click through to see all nine.</p><p>All this concept art is cool to look back on, but it does bring to mind the sad state of BioWare after publisher EA <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-5-bioware-dragon-age-veilguard-dlc-layoffs-1851750767&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-5-bioware-dragon-age-veilguard-dlc-layoffs-1851750767">gutted the studio</a></span> following <em>The Veilguard</em>’s disappointing sales. Those that remain are currently working on the fifth <em>Mass Effect </em>game.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/cronos-the-new-dawn-stars-you-as-a-soul-collecting-time-traveler<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Squash mutated monsters, transport souls through time…and rescue cats, too.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">After scoring a major win with the critically-lauded Silent Hill 2 remake, Bloober is ready to show the world what they can do next – with a slight change of pace – in an action-oriented horror game called Cronos: The New Dawn. I got a chance to sit down with Bloober’s time-hopping latest and find out what makes the world of Cronos so compelling.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cronos puts you in control of a character called The Traveler, a woman tasked with going into areas ravaged by a human-eliminating virus that is rapidly transforming them into monsters. The Traveler’s goal is to not only log her observations and find human survivors, but also to lay a path for Travelers that come after her – just as those who came before her did. But that task is easier said than done.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The theme of this game is merging and changing into something new,” co-director Wojciech Piejko explains, before adding, “Hey, this is not a good way to actually play this game, but watch this.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Piejko proceeds to wake up a sleeping enemy with a stomp that can only be described as Dead Space-esque. Upon waking, the enemy noticed that the corpses of other monsters were littered around, and quickly went to consume one. Then another. Then a third. By the time the infected human had finished feasting (uninterrupted by Piejko), it had “merged” several times, essentially leveling up its monster type. In doing so, it became stronger, harder to kill, more aggressive, and had access to new abilities to take The Traveler out, such as spitting toxic bile at her. After a fair amount of ammo, it finally goes down.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>“This is the core of Cronos,” Piejko says. “Manage your resources, take risks when appropriate, and survive.”</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The only way The Traveler could have prevented this happening is to kill the monster before it has a chance to feast or rid the area of corpses using fire, a precious resource that can’t be used capriciously. That said, bigger monsters mean bigger rewards, so it is sometimes a good choice to burn some resources for a bigger payday of crafting materials.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This is the core of Cronos,” Piejko says. “Manage your resources, take risks when appropriate, and survive.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Cronos: The New Dawn Bloober Team Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Just because a monster does not awaken does not mean The Traveler is safe, however. Anyone that tries to hoard resources will soon discover when backtracking through areas that enemies have a tendency to pick inopportune moments to pop up and start merging with other corpses on the ground. Not being aware of your environment can be a deadly mistake in Cronos, but wasting resources may be even worse.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The demo I participated in takes place in Nowa Huta, an eastern district in Krakow, Poland that was once an industrial hub of the former Soviet Union. In the future, it has been torn apart by the monster-plague infecting the world. It is the Traveler’s duty to identify important people that live or lived in the city and employ time-travel to rescue them from the pre-plague age of the 1980s. Since only The Traveler can hop through time, rescuing them involves digitizing their souls to carry around with her to take back into the present.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Traveler is limited in how many souls she can carry with her, which leaves the choice up to the player to decide who gets saved and who does not. This can affect Cronos’s narrative, as different people will have different reactions to things The Traveler encounters and places she goes. As an example, The Traveler can rescue someone in the past and bring them to the future, wherein she visits that person’s apartment decades later and the former tenant describes their life before it all went to hell.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Traveler is limited in how many souls she can carry with her, which leaves the choice up to the player to decide who gets saved and who does not.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In another example given, two of the souls in possession have a history and go back and forth with each other.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bloober says that Cronos will contain an emphasis on the studio’s trademark psychological horror despite the action bent. After Silent Hill 2 released, which was developed in parallel with Cronos, the Cronos team absorbed their colleagues (or “merged,” to keep it thematically on-brand) to help finish the game out.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Oh, and throughout Nowa Huta, The Traveler will come across some less conversational survivors: cats. Kitties are locked away safely in various rooms throughout the game and, upon being rescued, help with resources for The Traveler. All the cats in the game are based on the pets of the developers at Bloober.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We had so many submissions we had to start casting for them to decide who would get in,” Piejko says.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As part of their 1-2 punch with Silent Hill 2, Bloober is hoping Cronos proves the studio’s mettle as an industry-leading horror game developer. The New Dawn’s premise and designs are helping it start off on an interesting foot as part of Bloober’s journey there.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2-camera-an-elegant-but-nonessential-gamechat-companion<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Switch 2 Camera 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/25f0089c56124/switch-2-camera-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>In the lead-up to the Switch 2 launch, one of the biggest talking points from Nintendo was the new GameChat feature and accompanying camera. Heck, the company even reunited with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/paul-rudd-returns-in-an-awesome-snes-style-switch-2-commercial">actor and SNES legend Paul Rudd</a> for a new commercial showcasing the technology: <em>“Now you’re playing together,”</em> as if the previous four decades of multiplayer functionality on Nintendo consoles meant absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>With the confirmation that pretty much any USB-C camera will work with the Switch 2, just how does the official camera actually hold up, though?</p>
<p>Well, it’s a bit of a mixed bag, overall. It’s a pretty slick piece of hardware that blends in really well with both the Switch 2 itself and whatever TV setup you happen to be rocking at home (oh, and you can also plug it into a laptop and use it as a webcam, if you like). But despite its 1080p resolution, the actual image quality can look a little muddy, particularly if you have to zoom in. Considering its <strong>£49.99 / $54.99</strong> price tag, this is definitely a tad disappointing.</p>

<p>Looking at the camera itself, it’s a surprisingly dinky little thing. I don’t know why I thought it was much bigger prior to launch, but getting my hands on it for the first time revealed that it sits at just 17cm in height. That’s pretty small! In practice, it’s probably just a tad shorter than the length of my hand from the base of my palm to the tip of my middle finger. So definitely nice and inconspicuous.</p>
<p>The base and stand feel as though they’re made from metal, pretty solid and slightly cool to the touch. Meanwhile, the base is cushioned to prevent any scratches on the device or whatever surface you happen to place it on. The camera at the top is housed in a circular casing which feels slightly hollow — brittle, even, like one drop on a hard surface could crack it — but the light weight makes it easy to adjust the viewing angle.</p>

<p>As standard, the camera comes with a USB-C cable which you can use to plug it into the top of console via its secondary USB-C slot, while the other end slots into the camera around its backside. About three-quarters of the way down the camera’s stand is a small clip to tidy the cable away slightly. Finally, a thin dial is situated around the lens: turning this anti-clockwise shields the lens with a small, built-in white cover, definitely handy for when you’re not using the camera but can't be bothered to unplug it.</p>
<p>All in all, it’s a pretty well-made piece of kit; solid, sleek, functional, and inconspicuous enough to simply blend into the background. Where things get a <em>little</em> messy is when you actually start using it.</p>
<p>Thankfully, setup is an absolute breeze. Once you’ve got it plugged into the Switch 2 (and you can use it in docked or handheld mode), you simply create or join a GameChat session, navigate to the quick settings on-screen, and select the camera icon to turn it on. By default, it’ll show your surroundings, but you can activate a filter to remove this.</p>

<p>The main issue is resolution. I imagine that most, like myself, will have the camera set up next to a TV while docked. In an average family environment, chances are you’re going to be sitting a couple of meters away on a comfy couch. This means that the default image is quite far away, and so you’ll appear pretty small on-screen. Great for showing groups of people during gameplay, sure, (and the camera can pick out four faces), but not if you're on your own.</p>
<p>Now, the good news is you can zoom in via settings to the point where your head takes up most of the image space, but in doing so, the image gets extremely fuzzy.</p>
<p>Of course, the other option is to place the camera a bit nearer, if you’re able. In a lot of living room settings, this might not be entirely feasible, but if you’re playing in a small office environment on a desk or something, then you can probably get pretty close and alleviate those resolution issues.</p>
<p>In addition to the zoom functionality, you can also apply the aforementioned background filter to the image (a system-wide thing and not limited to the official camera). It’s nothing too extravagant, but the two options effectively remove your immediate surroundings. One keeps the overall composition intact, but makes it so that only you display in the image. This is reasonably well done, but be prepared to see a bit of jank around your head and body.</p>

<p>The other display option crops the image down to just your head within a small circle, again applying the same filter to remove anything in the background. The jank from the previous filter still crops up here, and it can be a little irritating in isolation, but when you’re knee-deep in a Knockout Rally on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, chances are you won’t notice it.</p>
<p>What's odd, however, is that Mario Kart World specifically recommends this filter, and I can't quite nail down why. I imagine it's to really hone in on the 'fun, whimsical' nature of the game, but the default setting with no filters applied looks undeniably cleaner.</p>
<p>The only other thing worth noting is that there’s no way to mount the camera on the Switch 2 itself when playing in handheld mode. This is an advantage currently enjoyed by Hori's Piranha Plant Camera, which you can plug into the USB-C slot at the top and carry about with you; I imagine that would definitely come in handy for those quick handheld sessions on the go.</p>
<p>That said, Nintendo's camera does boast a higher resolution, so which you ultimately opt for will depend on what you value more: slightly higher image quality or more flexibility.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Given the elegant, sleek design of the official Switch 2 camera, we would have expected the same kind of 'wow' factor to be present in the actual image quality on display. Alas, despite the 1080p resolution, any scenario in which you need to zoom in at all makes the image incredibly fuzzy.</p>
<p>That said, in practice, the novelty of seeing your friends' faces after you've chucked a Blue Shell at them in Mario Kart World is a genuine blast and, in that context, concerns about image quality generally fade away. We've no doubt that third parties will come out with more accomplished, feature-rich cameras in the future, but for now, Nintendo's official offering is a solid, albeit nonessential option.</p>

        <p>And it made me do a tweet</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>There aren't many games lately which have compelled me to do a tweet, or skeet, or whatever you prefer to call ejaculating one's thoughts out onto the socials. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3219410/The_Trolley_Solution/">The Trolley Solution</a>'s Steam Next Fest demo not only did that, it convinced me to post a tweet I didn't even write.</p>
<p>It's a game from indie dev <a href="https://x.com/byDanDans?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">byDanDans</a> that starts off as a series of moral quandaries, each inspired by philosopher Philippa Foot's famous and now also thoroughly memed-to-death Trolley Problem. That being a thought experiment which forces you examine the ethics of either letting nature take its course to deliver one outcome that could cause harm to others, or actively intervening to cause another that might do the same in a different fashion. I didn't go in expecting to become enraptured in what I can only describe as a tragic rail romance.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>At first, things were as I'd anticipated. Upon firing the game up, you're transported to a main menu that fittingly sees you move a tram along some tracks to different stations, each of which takes you to a minigame offering some fresh twist on the classic Trolley Problem.</p>
<p>Sometimes you're choosing whether to let five people tied to one track die, or flick a lever that'll doom a person on another track instead. In one case, your girlfriend and best friend are on the two tracks, having cheated together without the friend knowing it was your partner they were engaging in hanky-panky with. Also, the friend has a terminal disease and will die in a month anyway.</p>
<p>You know, the standard stuff very smart people think about while washing their pits in the shower. One makes you choose between virtual people dying, and the game asking for permission to post <a href="https://x.com/MrMarkWarren99/status/1932533689813967122">a very controversial tweet</a> via your very real Twitter account, assuming you've not abandoned the Musk platform because using carrier pigeons is far superior.</p>

<p>Then, not long after a game based around picking which track didn't have a cat hiding under the giant plastic cup perched on it, I pulled into a station dubbed "Mai tomori sama romansu". It soon became apparent this was not your standard tram stop.</p>
<p>I found myself flung headlong into a visual novel-style story about a schoolgirl named Tameko, her best mate Tomadochi, and their mortal enemy, a superficial and popular former friend named Teki. Added to this triple T triangle is a Trolley, because this still is The Trolley Solution, lest you forget. I'll not spoil what happens in this short multiple-choice and marvellously meta mirage amid the funny puzzling, save for one thing.</p>
<p>Tameko falls, to a degree of your choosing, in love with a tram. He goes by Trolley-San and keep pulling up and saying "Ding Ding" in what I can only assume by Tameko's reactions to be an incredibly suave and seductive fashion. This and all the rest of the game - and I can't emphasise this enough, are a right hoot, a great laugh, and a throaty chuckle.</p>
<p>So, if you find yourself at the Steam Next Fest intersection and aren't sure which direction to pull the big games lever, I can thoroughly recommend yanking it The Trolley Solution's way. Especially since the full thing's set to come out in Q4 2025.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Set in two eras—the decaying future and 1980s Poland—players are plunged into a world inspired by the real Krakow district—Nowa Huta, where survival means bending time itself. You play as a Traveler, an agent of the mysterious Collective, emerging from a dystopian future to dive back into time and extract people before they perish in the apocalypse. As you explore a world on the brink of annihilation, you’ll encounter grotesque enemies known as the Orphans.</p><p><strong>Don’t Let Them Merge</strong></p><p>The new gameplay trailer reveals intense survival moments inside the Orphans’ nest, offering a closer look at these terrifying creatures. Orphans are twisted, body-horror monstrosities born from humanity’s darkest nightmares. The trailer showcases their behavior—exceptionally aggressive and relentless—turning every encounter into a desperate fight for survival. Most importantly, players must prevent them from merging. As previously shown, defeated enemies must be burned immediately. If not, they risk being absorbed by other foes, triggering a merge that creates an even stronger and faster enemy. </p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Exploring the Twisted Realms of the New Dawn</strong></p><p>Additionally, the exciting new trailer reveals part of the story of a mysterious Predecessor—Traveler ND 3500—and their cryptic travel log.

                <p>It looks like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a> could carry forward a feature from GTA 5 with famous real-world artists getting their own in-game radio stations. Rapper Jermaine Dupri said in a new interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le8zt-XrrNg&amp;t=399s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rory and Mal</a> (<a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/drake-will-have-his-own-radio-station-in-gta-6-according-to-fellow-rapper-3214593/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via Dexerto</a>) that he's heard that hugely popular rapper Drake "got his own radio station in Grand Theft Auto."</p><p>Dupri didn't mention GTA 6 by name, but Drake has never had a radio station in the GTA series before, so it's assumed he was talking about the new game due out next year. Dupri himself said he was asked as well to "do Grand Theft Auto," but he didn't elaborate on if he signed on or not.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> GTA 6 (Grand Theft Auto VI) - Official Release Date Reveal | Trailer 2</p>
      </div>
<p>Dupri went on to say that GTA 6's Drake radio station will give Drake the ability to upload music that no one has ever heard before, suggesting artists might debut new music inside GTA 6. In addition to Drake, it's been reported that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-will-have-dj-khaled-in-game-radio-station-report/1100-6529567/" data-ref-id="1100-6529567">DJ Khaled will have his own in-game radio station in GTA 6 as well.</a></p><p>Drake has a connection to Miami, which is a stand-in for GTA 6's Vice City. The music video for his song "God's Plan" was filmed in Miami, and <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2018/2/drake-donates-175k-gods-plan-music-video" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Drake gave out more than $175,000 to Miami locals.</a> DJ Khaled, meanwhile, got his start in the music business in Miami.</p><p>In GTA 5, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-adds-a-frank-ocean-radio-station-and-it-has-/1100-6455605/" data-ref-id="1100-6455605">Frank Ocean had his own in-game radio station</a>, while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rockstar-pays-tribute-to-gta-4-radio-station-host-roy-ayers-who-just-passed-away/1100-6529946/" data-ref-id="1100-6529946">GTA 4 had a radio station hosted by the late Roy Ayers</a>. Music has long been a major component of the GTA series, and that's expected to continue with GTA 6.</p><p>One <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gta-6-fan-theories/2900-6585/" data-ref-id="2900-6585">popular theory</a> is that music in GTA 6 won't be limited to when you're in a car. The character Lucia is seen wearing headphones in some GTA 6 images, prompting theories that players will be able to listen to music while they're walking down the street.</p><p>GTA 6 launches in May 2026 for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. It was originally set to launch this year before being delayed so the developers at Rockstar Games could refine and improve the experience for launch.</p>

The company <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple-silicon/about-the-rosetta-translation-environment">has also confirmed</a> that Rosetta 2 will only be available through macOS 27. “Beyond this timeframe, we will keep a subset of Rosetta functionality aimed at supporting older unmaintained gaming titles, that rely on Intel-based frameworks,” Apple says.</p><p>You can <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/276C-85A0-C531-AFA3">try out the Steam beta</a> by opening the app on your Mac, selecting <strong>Steam &gt; Settings &gt; Interface</strong>.

                <p>Sony's PS5 console will turn five years old in November, and with an eye on the future, the company recently revealed its thoughts on what's next for PlayStation. During a <a href="https://www.irwebmeeting.com/sony/vod/20250613/x8R5srwN/bsm_02_en/1_GNS/fireside_chat/index.html" rel="nofollow ">business presentation</a> hosted by several top Sony executives, president and CEO Hideaki Nishino responded to a query about future PlayStation hardware and if a next-gen PS6 console was even necessary when cloud gaming has improved over the years.</p><p>According to Nishino, while cloud gaming is "progressing well from a technical standpoint," certain challenging aspects like end-to-end network stability remain out of Sony's control. Nishino added that cloud-based gameplay is still a viable option for gamers and allows them to access more content, but the "local execution" of games--via physical media or content downloaded directly to console hardware--remains in high demand by the majority of PlayStation gamers.</p>

<p>"Cloud gaming is increasingly providing an additional option for players to access content, but our belief is that the majority of players continue to want to play and experience gaming through local execution without dependency on network conditions," Nishino said. "PS5 and PS5 Pro have validated this thesis, I believe."</p><p>On the topic of the next-gen PlayStation console, Nishino remained tight-lipped. "Our console business has evolved into a multi-faceted platform, and we now have a large ecosystem of highly engaged players across both the PS5 and PS4 generations, so naturally, there's a huge interest in our next-generation console strategy," Nishino said. "While we cannot share further details at this stage, the future of the platform is top of mind. We are committed to exploring a new and enhanced way for players to engage with our content and services."</p><p>What we do know about the PS6 is that it likely won't be out for quite a while yet. Former PlayStation executive Shuhei Yoshida recently said that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-revealed-aims-to-double-the-power/1100-6526357/">if the next PlayStation comes out in 2028</a>, that would feel right to him, given how current console generations typically run for around seven years now.</p><p>In 2024, it was reported that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps6-powered-by-familiar-chipmaker-report/1100-6526499/">Intel made a big push to produce chips for the PS6</a>, but Sony decided to stick with AMD. While PlayStation gamers will be in for a long wait, Sony did introduce a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-review-powerful-on-paper-ordinary-in-action/1100-6527571/">mid-gen PS5 refresh last year in the form of the PS5 Pro</a>.</p>

			<p>During Sony's <a href="https://www.irwebmeeting.com/sony/vod/20250613/x8R5srwN/bsm_02_en/1_GNS/movie/index.html">annual investors presentation</a>, the company confirmed that as of March 31, 2025, for the first time in this console generation, PS5 monthly active users have surpassed PS4 monthly active users, which means that more players on PlayStation are finally starting to make the transition to the current generation of hardware.</p>
<p>Just last year, when Sony gave this presentation in May 2024, Sony confirmed that the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/half-of-all-playstation-gamers-are-yet-to-upgrade-to-ps5-sony-stats-reveal">split between PS5 and PS4 players was still 50/50</a>. For one reason or another, four years into the PS4 generation, players were not leaving their old consoles behind. In the past year though, that's changed.</p>
<p>While Sony Interactive Entertainment president and chief executive officer Hideaki Nishino was speaking, the presentation featured this slide, showing that PS5 players are taking up the majority of PlayStation's 124 million monthly active users.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>It's also worth noting that the new 124 million active users figure is an increase from the previously reported <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-network-registers-new-123-million-monthly-active-users-record-in-december-2023/">123 million active users PlayStation saw in 2023</a>, which was already a record-setting figure for Sony.</p>
<p>"<em>Our platform is stronger than ever</em>," said Nishino. "<em>We continue to attract more players, and we now have over 124M monthly active users. Through the wide range of content and services we provide, these players are more engaged than ever, which has resulted in record-high gameplay hours. Our platform is also more accessible than ever. The PlayStation 5 offers the best way for players to experience our content, and as such, this player base has continued to grow</em>."</p>
<p>"<em>These players are highly engaged, spending more on the content and services than in prior generations,</em>" Nishino continued. "<em>However, the PlayStation 4 remains an important access point for existing players to experience our content and services, and we remain committed to serving them</em>."</p>
<p>During the lead-up to the PlayStation 5's launch, there was plenty of talk about <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sonys-jim-ryan-its-time-to-give-fans-something-that-can-only-be-enjoyed-on-playstation-5">PlayStation believing in generations</a>, only for the company to confirm that most of its big titles coming to PS5 would also be coming to PS4. It's clear that things have changed at this point, with the PS4 still being a big chunk of PlayStation's player base.</p>
<p>In the same annual presentation, PlayStation even confirmed that it is committed to its <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-is-committed-to-exploring-a-new-and-enhanced-way-to-engage-with-content-and-services-multiplatform-strategy-set-to-remain-the-same-for-the-foreseeable-future/">multiplatform strategy going into the next generation</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/dosa-divas-preview-cooking-up-storm<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Welcome to our establishment. On today's menu, our special is <em>Dosa Divas</em>, an upcoming title from developer Outerloop Games and publisher Outersloth. It mixes elements from popular JRPGs into one delicious meal. Here's our thoughts from the time we had with it at Summer Game Fest 2025.</p>

<p>Let me preface by saying&nbsp;<em>Dosa Divas</em>&nbsp;seems to focus heavily on narrative, but due to the nature of the demo, I wasn't able to get a real feel for it. With a timer giving me just 30 minutes, I wanted to consume as much gameplay as I could.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Taking Inspiration From the Greats</h2>

<p>From what I could gather, though, the story involves two sisters and an "ancient spirit-mech," which you can also control as a party member (it is pretty freakin' cool). An evil fast food empire is the main enemy faction we'll contend with throughout the duration of&nbsp;<em>Dosa Divas</em>&nbsp;playtime.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I went into&nbsp;<em>Dosa Divas</em>&nbsp;fairly blind; I saw something that looking cool, so I decided I wanted to play it. Because of this, I was quite surprised to find how much&nbsp;<em>Dosa Divas</em>&nbsp;plays like some of my favorite JRPGs.</p>

<p>You have an overworld -- it's kind of this 3D, side-scrolling like area a la&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/series/paper-mario" rel="nofollow">Paper Mario</a> --&nbsp;</em>and combat is also inspired by the same game's timing mechanics. More recently, we can look at games like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-french-revolution" rel="nofollow"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a>&nbsp;using this more interactive, turn-based JRPG combat style.</p>



<h2>Food Fighting in&nbsp;<em>Dosa Divas</em></h2>

<p>So when you engage in combat, you can pick your standard attacks, special attacks, and the like. There's a little visual indicator to showing players can press a button again, during combat animation, to get an extra attack. Timing seems pretty generous for this.</p>

<p>The timing for attacks will depend; for an example, attack has a boomerang effect that, if you keep timing it correctly, can bounce for quite a long time. Nothing I'm saying here is extraordinarily different from other JRPGs that have similar mechanics, but&nbsp;<em>Dosa Divas</em>&nbsp;has a few tricks up its sleeve.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There's a culinary theme throughout the entire game. Attacks are based on cooking utensils for the most part, so you have your spatulas, pot lids, punches from a spirit-mech... okay, maybe the last one isn't a cooking utensil, but man, I can't get over how cool this mech is!</p>

<p>As I went around defeating enemies in the overworld, I helped liberate a village from the fast-food empire, the reputation with the settlement would increase. This actually gave me skills for my characters, so it seems like character progression is tied to these villages to some large degree.</p>



<h2><em>Dosa Divas</em> Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Besides that, though, I love the way&nbsp;<em>Dosa Divas</em>&nbsp;handles items. You're not buying your standard health potion like a normal JRPG; instead, you cook it up yourself. There's a cooking aspect involved, and depending on what ingredients you use, you get a different result.</p>

<p>So while you might be able to buy certain ingredients, it seems like you'll have to make your own utility items. There are little mini-games that make this aspect more interactive, so cooking can be a grand 'ol time.</p>

<p>If anything,&nbsp;<em>Dosa Divas</em>&nbsp;seems like a neat little JRPG-inspired game. It doesn't necessarily do anything super new or wild, but it doesn't need to. It's an honest take on the genre that is legitimately fun, so I'm excited to see how this one pans out when it launches next year.</p>

            <p>Good news, people who're still interested in giving <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mindseye">MindsEye</a> a go for reasons that don't involve gleefully watching as a poor NPC undergoes a sudden glitchy elongation. Developers Build A Rocket Boy have just pushed out the first in a series of updates designed to swat a bunch of the performance and crash-related issues that've plagued the game's launch.
</p>
<p>If you were busy with other hobbies such as arctic exploration or hardcore spelunking earlier this week, the GTA/Cyberpunky Mindseye suffered a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mindseye-launches-to-clips-of-atvs-glitchily-spaghettifying-a-bloke-named-seb-but-a-patch-is-on-the-way">pretty nightmarish debut</a>. The user reviews weren't totally negative right out of the gate, but it's fair to say it didn't land in the fashion ex-Rockstar bigwig Leslie Benzies' studio probably hoped.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Cue the release of today's <a href="https://x.com/MindsEyeGame/status/1933482714444730741">first hotfix</a> for the game, which has arrived "on an expedited timeline as the first in a series of patches" designed to address the myriad of technical issues players have been having and act on their feedback.</p>
<p>Out now on PC and PS5, with Xbox soon to follow, the patch includes "CPU and GPU performance improvements, along with memory optimizations" - as part of that last bit, the memory leak that had been identified as the cause of a number of different crashes has been rectified. Build A Rocket Boy have also introduced new "pop-up warnings" on PC that'll tell you if Hardware Accelerated GPU Scheduling is disabled or if you've got a machine with a CPU which has "potential crash issues". I assume these pop-ups'll be something like little text boxes that say 'uh oh'.</p>
<p>The hotfix makes MindsEye's CPR mini-game easier, in what could be construed a as wonderfully ironic metaphor for the situation the game's ended up in performance-wise. It also adds in the ability to mess around with the depth of field, and fixes issues with "missing controls in the MineHunter and Run Dungeon mini-games".
</p>
<p>"Performance optimisation is our number one focus and an ongoing commitment that will take further time," Build A Rocket Boy pledge in the hotfix's notes, adding: "We will continue to provide frequent and transparent updates. Our team is committed to do everything possible to urgently action your feedback."</p>
<p>We'll have to see if these efforts are enough to turn the game's fortunes around, with first impressions being as important as ever for games, regardless of whether they've got ex-GTA bloke buzz.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p><em>At Remap, we've never tried to separate politics from video games. It goes all the way back to the earliest days of Waypoint, which itself as born out of Austin and Patrick's previous experiences at places like Giant Bomb, wherein they encountered friction while keeping the two top of mind. </em></p><p><em>Depending on how you experienced Summer Game Fest last weekend, it either felt like equal parts ominous and impressive or merely a slideshow of trailers that blurred into nonsense. Patrick was playing games while helicopters circled, while Rob probably went on a long dog walk.</em></p><p><em>But while only one of them was in Los Angeles, both of them have actually lived in the city at different times. It is hardly the city portrayed on TV, even at its worst. To characterize "Los Angeles" with a broad brush reveals you've never spent meaningful time there. That is true of many cities, but especially true of one as sprawling as Los Angeles.</em></p><p><em>Which brings us to this week's letter series, as Rob and Patrick the strangeness of the past week and what it was like from both perspectives.</em></p><hr><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> Finding your way to Sega’s section at Summer Game Fest requires you to briefly head outdoors. It’s a nice and semi-open space that made for an awfully comfortable way to play one of my favorite games at the show, a deliciously slick updated take on Sega’s <em>Shinobi</em> series called <em>Art of Vengeance</em>. The game rules. But in the opening moments, your clan is invaded, and in the background, you can faintly see tanks rolling through. I slowly blinked, and that’s when I realized I could also hear the soft hum of helicopters circling overhead, related to the ongoing anti-ICE protests that kicked off around the same time as Summer Game Fest itself.&nbsp;</p><p>(Just days prior, ICE raids had taken place in a notable LA area called the Fashion District that surrounds Summer Game Fest. Elements of the protest even began blocks from the event.)</p><p>I took a deep breath in-between my admiration for <em>Art of Vengeanc</em>e’s ugly beauty, a kinetic and satisfying mess of grace and violence, and tried to ignore my stomach turning into knots. When I left the demo, forcing me outside for a moment, the helicopters were closer, the buzzing louder. You could always look around and catch someone looking into the sky and trying to shake it off.</p><p>Moments later, tucked back inside with endless kiosks running a parade of different games, the aerial white noise disappeared. Here, I could be <em>a gamer</em>. I don’t even mean that as a joke, really. It was a welcomed relief from wondering whether I should just head back to the airport, a notion that was affirmed whenever my phone would buzz with a new alarming push notification.</p><p>“Trump is…”</p><p>“Trump announced..”</p><p>I flicked my notifications off 24 hours, shuffled over to an appointment for a game called <em>Relooted</em>, where a group of thieves decide to reclaim stolen African artifacts from Western museums. The game’s made (largely) in South Africa, and when I ask for an interview, the game’s (white) creative director sighs and informs me the other (black) members of his team that were supposed to be in attendance had their travel visa applications immediately denied.</p><p>The game—think <em>Mirror’s Edge</em> meets <em>Ocean’s 11 </em>with a little sci-fi—is looking cool, though.</p><p>Little moments like this were everywhere at Summer Game Fest. One team couldn’t have their planned dinner because part of the highway was shut down. Another developer asked to cut our interview time in half because they were afraid to stick around and wanted to head to the airport. Our server for dinner on Monday offered a heartfelt apology for departing halfway through the meal because the overzealous march of the police was reportedly gathering around their home.</p><p>We’ve joked in the past at the awkward ways Geoff Keighley tries to dance around politics, industry controversies, and the steady beat of crisis layoffs amidst what’s essentially a big ass marketing event. But what made this year’s Summer Game Fest notable, at least to the people who were attending in person, was how the outside world’s events became utterly inescapable.&nbsp;</p><p>I do not know how much that came through, or was felt, to outsiders. What was it like for you?</p><figure><figcaption><span>GameDiscoverCo is a really good newsletter, btw.</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Rob:</strong> Far more normal, because news is covered as a series of discrete topics rather than events happening in a place where the rest of life is happening alongside the major news story. So “LA protests” are a thing that were all over my news pages, but not electronics or culture pages. I was startled every time I saw someone at SGF post about hearing the discharge of crowd control munitions of passing by a police rally point on their way to a hotel, because it served as such a vivid reminder that the neat division of subject matter that exists in how we consume news media is entirely artificial.</p><p>That feeling is probably amplified a bit by the New York and D.C. bias that exists in a lot of mainstream media, where LA is especially poorly understood because it’s so different from eastern cities. Janet talked a bit about this on the podcast, but I think you and I have both experienced it ourselves: we went to live in LA with a set of expectations for the city, and then found it mocked those expectations and generalizations. But in a moment like this, living outside LA, you see the city as it is so often depicted: flattened by a high-angle helicopter shot through clouds of tear gas, portraying acres of concrete covered in riot police and protestors.</p>

The recently released Space Marine - Master Crafted Edition, however, may be Warhammer 40,000’s first video game misstep in some time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine - Master Crafted Edition is a re-release of Relic Entertainment’s 2011 action game, Space Marine. Both Games Workshop and publisher Sega are not calling this a remaster. Instead they point to quality-of-life and graphical improvements "that take the Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine experience to the next level."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These include higher fidelity and improved textures, 4k resolution, "improved" character models, a modernized control scheme and interface overhaul, and remastered audio.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine - Master Crafted Edition launched on June 10 across Xbox Series X and S and PC, and straight into Game Pass (there’s no word on a PS5 version). It’s going down better on Game Pass, where gaming is often more disposable and subscribers are free to try games out and discard them on a whim if they don’t like what they see. On Steam, however, where Space Marine - Master Crafted Edition costs $39.99 / £34.99, it’s getting destroyed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Space Marine - Master Crafted Edition currently has a ‘mostly negative’ user review rating on Valve’s platform. Complaints revolve around the high price of the game relative to the changes it makes over the Anniversary Edition, and, on those changes, bemusement in response to what many believe is worse usability.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This, coupled with struggles to find others to play with online, has caused some to call Space Marine - Master Crafted Edition a "cash grab."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I was very excited for the idea of this being updated but honestly? I prefer the older version,” reads one negative Steam user review. “It feels better and looks better. Why couldn't this just be an update or something? And for the price tag it just feels very meh. And this is one of my all time favourite games too. Just gonna install the older version and play through that.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Too bad, I really wanted to play this game,” reads another. “No players in PvP multiplayer. No players in co-op Exterminatus horde mode. FOV problem, aiming down sight makes 1000000x zoom. No option to change FOV. Maybe get it on sale after upgrades and updates and working enabled crossplay matchmaking. Refunded, sadly.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I bought and get refund” said one disgruntled customer. “Buy the Anniversary Edition, it's almost the same but it isn't a cash grab (around 7€ for a key).”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Look how they massacred my boy,” declared another.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine - Master Crafted Edition Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a similar sentiment across social media, Discords, and subreddits. “Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine Master Crafted Edition is a mess,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Spacemarine/comments/1laagiu/warhammer_40000_space_marine_master_crafted/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said redditor KitsuneLynx</a>, highlighting problems even on Xbox.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This game came out a few days ago and has shown itself to be an absolute mess and disappointment. When I heard this remake was coming out, I was so hyped, I was curious what they'd do and was excited to play it on Xbox after having played it on PC a while back. I was disappointed to say the least.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This game is a buggy, janky mess that didn't bother to fix anything and instead made a worse UI, odd visual changes, etc. Why make the Orks all Goffs now? The colors helped recognize each unit, now they all blend together to the point it's hard to decipher which is which. WHERE ARE THE DEDICATED SERVERS? Not to mention the NEW jank and bugs that came with this release that weren't present in the previous remaster. It didn't bother to fix the jank or make the game feel revitalized, this IS the definition of a lazy cash grab. Charging this game for 40+ USD is criminal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Crossplay is off by default which just leads to the game shooting itself in the foot when it comes to vacant servers. My wife also just experienced a bug which is more common than it should be where when you boot up the game, there is a chance for your save file to corrupt and reset ALL OF YOUR PROGRESS. Why hasn't this game received a patch yet? I can't imagine all the other bugs I haven't seen yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“If you're planning on playing this game, either get it on Game Pass or wait for a sale and mega patch, otherwise stay on Space Marine 2 or play the remaster on PC.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting that there <em>are </em>players who are having a reasonable time with the game, although anecdotally most of them appear to be on Game Pass. Similarly, those who have never played Space Marine before seem to be enjoying experiencing the events that lead into last year’s blockbuster hit, Space Marine 2. Steam, then, appears to be the focal point of the backlash.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The hope is that Sega will announce incoming improvements sooner rather than later, as Space Marine is generally remembered fondly by those who played it back in the day. In 2025, with Warhammer 40,000 at the peak of its popularity and with a flood of newcomers sparked by the success of Space Marine 2, it’s important Space Marine gets it right. The Inquisition, after all, is always watching.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/directive-8020-might-give-the-dark-pictures-saga-a-massive-upgrade<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">We played an early portion of the upcoming horror adventure game and had to reckon with some tough choices.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Developer Supermassive Games really made their mark on the horror game landscape with 2015's Until Dawn, but the Dark Pictures Anthology really brought the heat by offering gaming's closest analog to Netflix's Black Mirror series. With the latest installment on the way, the developers have plans for an ambitious return that finally ventures into sci-fi horror while also putting players in more direct control of the tense encounters that await the characters in this dark story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At Summer Game Fest 2025, we got to play a particularly fateful encounter from the upcoming Directive 8020, which continues the Dark Pictures saga. We also saw just how the sci-fi horror adventure game mixes things up with more real-time gameplay encounters that bring the series and its strong narrative hooks closer to a true survival horror experience.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Taking place in the far future, where Earth is on the verge of collapse, a crew of scientists and space colonists travel to a distant planet poised to become humanity's next home. But as you'd guess for a horror game, the planet is home to another malevolent entity, and the crew is forced to survive against a mysterious alien presence that can mutate and take the form of any living person on board their ship.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Actress Lashana Lynch – seen in The Day of the Jackal and Captain Marvel – leads the cast of characters as the pilot of the ship, and her early scenes in Directive 8020 make her such a compelling lead in this bleak story. The game leans into similar themes of paranoia, isolation, and fear of the unknown – which makes for an excellent setup for a Dark Pictures game. The developers were particularly inspired by sci-fi films like Event Horizon, Alien, and John Carpenter's The Thing, which helped establish the style of horror and sense of dread that Directive 8020 goes for.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">According to game director Will Doyle, who guided me through the SGF demo, Directive 8020 will still feature many of the hallmarks of a Dark Pictures experience. Still, it will also mark the start of more active gameplay sequences and choices that aim to increase the fear factor within this extended episode.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I've had this idea for more real-time threats in my mind for a long time and throughout season one of the Dark Pictures, and the main reason we wanted to do it was to increase the fear factor for the games," said the game director. "There's nothing more scary than when you're in direct control and the creatures are trying to hunt you down and kill you. That gets your heart pumping, and that was a significant part of our motivation. We also wanted to expand our audience with more engaging gameplay. It's still a cinematic, story-driven game, but it does have moments where you are making those decisions and actions with more direct control."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I got to see this real-time action sequence during a story segment where the Captain and another crew member were confronted by their alien impostors. Playing as the second crew member, the imposter mutates into a grotesque monster, and I have to evade it from within the maintenance area of the ship. This played out in a tense and unnerving stealth sequence that felt similar to Dead Space or Resident Evil, which lends Directive 8020 a classic survival horror-like feel. As this is a Dark Pictures game, permanent death is a thing, and if I hadn't gotten this character out away from his imposter, the main story would have evolved differently.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Permanent death is a thing, and if I hadn't gotten this character out away from his imposter, the main story would have evolved differently.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">However, Directive 8020 heightens the sense of paranoia and tension when making fateful survival choices. Given that Supermassive Games' pedigree of horror adventure games is about making decisions to keep a group of survivors and friends alive to the end of the story – the added twist in Directive 8020's story with your crew being replaced by alien imposters presents an unsettling wrinkle.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A fateful moment occurred when the Captain returned to the crew and had to decide where to shoot a crew member who had seemingly come in contact with the alien entity. Much like the games from the developers, these flashpoint moments are among the most consequential points in the story. Without giving away spoilers, I made a decision that I would come to regret. Still, according to the game director, these moments can also be rolled back using the turning point system – which acts as an optional story tracker and rewind system, allowing players to view different moments and choose a different path if they wish.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So far, Directive 8020 is set to be a welcome return to the Dark Pictures series. And with the focus on giving players more direct control of the action while also heightening the sense of distrust in your dwindling party of survivors, the next game looks to offer one of the more unique and game-changing episodes the series has seen yet.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

It also reduces the difficulty for the CPR mini-game, adds a new setting to disable or modify Depth of Field, and fixes missing controls in the MineHunter and Run Dungeon mini-games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On PC, there are new pop-up warnings for PCs that have Hardware Accelerated GPU Scheduling disabled, and PCs with CPUs that have potential crash issues.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Build A Rocket Boy said this patch also fixes the memory leak issue that had been causing most crashes reported by players. “Performance optimisation is our number one focus and an ongoing commitment that will take further time,” it added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We will continue to provide frequent and transparent updates. Our team is committed to do everything possible to urgently action your feedback,” Build A Rocket Boy said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Build A Rocket Boy has said that by the end of June, players can expect ongoing performance and stability improvements, a rebalanced ‘hard’ difficulty setting, animation fixes, and AI improvements.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The question is whether the developer, which was founded by former Rockstar North chief Leslie Benzies, can turn MindsEye around. On Steam, which does not paint the whole picture of MindsEye’s current popularity, the game hit a peak concurrent player count of 3,302 on launch, but had a 24-hour peak of just 786 players. At the time of this article’s publication, 435 people were playing on Steam, with a 'mixed' user review rating.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/03/06/devil-may-cry-5-review">Devil May Cry 5 review</a> returned a 9.5. We said: "Devil May Cry 5's trio of outstanding combat styles set a new high bar for the series, and its mysterious story keeps things interesting along the way."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Six years later, Devil May Cry 5 must go down as a blockbuster success for Capcom. “The title has garnered strong support from users due to its exceptional gameplay experience, leading to expanded sales as a catalog title since its release,” the company said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Capcom provided an even more advanced story and action elements in the game with the addition of a new playable character, and more recently, on April 3, 2025, the company released the new Devil May Cry animated series on Netflix, in line with the company’s Single Content Multiple Usage strategy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The animated series has garnered critical acclaim from around the world, and with more than 5.3 million views it ranked fourth during its first week globally in the "Shows | English" category, while also ranking in the top 10 for seven consecutive days in Japan. As a result of the game’s exhilarating action, and due to efforts to enhance brand awareness by leveraging the title beyond the scope of video games, including television adaptations, the title has now exceeded 10 million units in cumulative sales worldwide.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Devil May Cry 5’s success (the franchise as whole has sold more than 33 million units since the first game came out in 2001), begs the question: when will Devil May Cry 6 be released? It seems inevitable that another game will be greenlit, if it hasn’t already, given DMC5 has sold 10 million in the six years since launch in 2019.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 10 Best Devil May Cry Weapons, Ranked</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom isn’t giving anything away at this point, of course, and it has a lot on its plate already.

For instance, the Switch 1 version of PokémonLegends Z-A is selling for <a href="https://zdcs.link/QWYYo7?object_uuid=49ee0e52-4913-467f-9a7f-722fcc5abcdb&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">£49.99 both physically and digitally</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://zdcs.link/9Z11og?object_uuid=49ee0e52-4913-467f-9a7f-722fcc5abcdb&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">physical version on Switch 2 is selling for £58.99</a>, but you can buy it digitally for £57.99 through the <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qmnnb6?object_uuid=49ee0e52-4913-467f-9a7f-722fcc5abcdb&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch 2 Edition upgrade pack</a>.

Concord, Hulst said, was "insufficiently differentiated" in a "hyper competitive segment" of gaming, referring to live-service multiplayer games.</p><p>"We have reviewed our processes in light of this to deeply understand how and why that title failed to meet expectations and to ensure we're not going to make the same mistakes again," he said.</p><p>Hulst said Sony now has a "much more rigorous process" in place for "validating" the company's hypotheses as it relates to a game's creative and commercial possibilities.</p><p>For Marathon, Hulst said the aim is to create a "very bold, very innovative, and deeply engaging title." The response to the Marathon alpha test was mixed, and Hulst said the whole idea of offering early tests is to gain feedback that can then be used to improve the product.</p><p>"This cycle of test, of iterate, test again, that is such a key component of the live-service success, both leading up to launch but also throughout the life of the game," he said.</p><p>Hulst did not, however, comment on the controversy surrounding Marathon as it relates to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-responds-to-marathon-art-theft-claims/1100-6531591/" data-ref-id="1100-6531591">Bungie admitting it found stolen art assets in Marathon.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungies-marathon-is-a-polished-extraction-shooter-but-that-might-not-be-enough/1100-6530826/" data-ref-id="1100-6530826">GameSpot's Marathon preview</a> said, "In a world of free-to-play titles, a paid game that is light on content but full of hopes, dreams, and ambitions may not be enough to inspire in others the same confidence I have in Bungie."</p><p>Marathon is slated for release on September 23. Some theorized it could be delayed, but it remains on track, at least as of now.</p><p>In regards to Sony's live-service plans in general, Hulst said the company is "very, very committed to building a diverse and a resilient live-service portfolio."</p><p>In related news, it was confirmed this week that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-lays-off-30-of-days-gone-developer-bend-studio-after-canceling-live-service-game/1100-6532332/" data-ref-id="1100-6532332">Sony cut staff at the studio behind Days Gone after cancelling a live-service game at the studio.</a> Before this, Sony reportedly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-cancels-two-games-including-a-live-service-god-of-war-report/1100-6528869/" data-ref-id="1100-6528869">canceled a live-service God of War title</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-canceled-announces-naughty-dog/1100-6519973/" data-ref-id="1100-6519973">developer Naughty Dog canceled The Last of Us Online</a> back in 2023.

			<p>PlayStation executives <a href="https://www.irwebmeeting.com/sony/vod/20250613/x8R5srwN/bsm_01_ja/1_GNS/fireside_chat/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">engaged</a> in a fireside chat with investors earlier today. Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO and president Hideaki Nishino talked about the platform's future, as reported in this article, while Hermen Hulst, who now heads the Studio Business Group but reports to Nishino <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-leadership-changes-again-nishino-takes-over/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">following the latest shuffle</a>, talked about Sony's commitment to making and maintaining live service games following early successes (<a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-sales-surpass-59-2-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Helldivers 2</a>) and failures (<a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-shuts-down-firewalk-studios-maker-of-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Concord</a>). On that note, Hulst said that while much work went into Concord, the game launched into a hyper-competitive segment and was not unique enough to stand apart. Needless to say, the goal is to avoid repeating the same mistakes with PlayStation's next big live service launch, Marathon.</p>
<p><em>We remain very committed to building a diverse and resilient live service portfolio. We have MLB The Show, Destiny 2, and Helldivers 2. These are really good examples of the type of titles that we're looking to develop. These titles have already established an enduring set of player experiences and communities across quite a wide range of different genres. Together, that provides a really good foundation for our ambitions in this category. I would say that, additionally, we are continuing to invest in new live services, with Helldivers 2 providing such a great example of the level of success we can achieve if we get everything right. That game has been a true breakout success. It's been attracting and retaining a significant community. This ongoing success is further evidenced in how we deal with the monetization, as microtransactions now make more than half of that game's revenue. We're also very excited about Marathon's anticipated launch in this fiscal year.</em></p>
<p><em>With live service, we really see that as a great opportunity for us, but with that great opportunity, there are some unique challenges associated. We've talked about the early success with Helldivers 2, but we also faced some challenges with the release of Concord. I think that some really good work, actually, went into that title, some really big effort. But ultimately, that title entered a hyper-competitive segment of the market. I think it was insufficiently differentiated to be able to resonate with players. We have reviewed our processes to ensure that we're not going to make those mistakes again. We have introduced much more rigorous processes for validating our creative, commercial, and development assumptions, and we now do that on a much more ongoing basis.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>That plan will ensure we are investing in the right opportunities at the right time, all while maintaining much more predictable timelines. For Marathon, it's our goal to release a very bold, very innovative and deeply engaging title. It's going to be the first new Bungie title in over a decade, so we are really excited for that release. Going through the test cycle, we're monitoring the Closed Alpha that the team have just gone through. We're taking all the lessons learned and we're using the capabilities we've built to understand how audiences are engaging with the title. Some of that feedback, frankly, has been varied. But that's super useful; that's why you do this testing. When launch comes, we're going to give the title the optimal chance at success. This cycle of test, iterate, test again, it's such a key component of the live service success, both leading up to launch but also throughout the life of the game.</em></p>
<p>Marathon, an extraction first-person shooter game based on the old Bungie franchise, will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-showcases-marathon-gameplay-release-date-announced-for-september-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> on September 23 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atelier-resleriana-red-alchemist-white-guardian-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Koei Tecmo has announced the release date for upcoming RPG&nbsp;<em>Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian</em>.</p>

<p>The game, which was first announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atelier-resleriana-red-alchemist-and-white-guardian" rel="nofollow">all the way back in September last year</a>, will be launching across PS5, Switch, and PC on September 26th. It doesn't appear that a native Switch 2 port will be available at launch, at the very least.</p>

<p><em>The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian&nbsp;</em>will serve as a followup to&nbsp;the original&nbsp;<em>Atelier Resleriana</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atelier-resleriana-global-release-date" rel="nofollow">released last year as a free-to-play RPG</a>. Unlike its predecessor, however, this new game won't be an online-based gacha RPG, but instead a fully-fledged&nbsp;<em>Atelier&nbsp;</em>game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/atelier-resleriana-the-red-alchemist-the-white-guardian-release-date-sophie.jpg?itok=U-Qq1I7y 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/atelier-resleriana-the-red-alchemist-the-white-guardian-release-date-sophie.jpg?itok=9PYlGqeY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian&nbsp;</em>launches in September.</figcaption></figure><p>As revealed in a new trailer,&nbsp;<em>The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian</em>&nbsp;aims to fuse familiar&nbsp;<em>Atelier&nbsp;</em>elements with new, experimental features. It'll stand in contrast to&nbsp;<em>Atelier Yumia</em>, which, as Koei Tecmo says, "aimed to create the next generation of&nbsp;<em>Atelier&nbsp;</em>games" (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atelier-yumia-sales-300k-fastest-selling" rel="nofollow">rather successfully, it should be noted</a>).</p>

<p>The new game takes place in the fallen town of Hallfein, which has been devastated by a "mysterious disaster" that "caused most of its residents to disappear". After some time, however, two former residents of Hallfein, Rias and Slade, return to the town to discover the truth of what really happened.</p>

<p>Much like&nbsp;<em>Atelier Resleriana</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian&nbsp;</em>will also feature characters from previous&nbsp;<em>Atelier&nbsp;</em>games. Sophie, Wilbell, Totori, and Raze will all be making an appearance as playable characters "in segments of the game".</p>

<p>Koei Tecmo says&nbsp;<em>Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian&nbsp;</em>will revolve around "the core&nbsp;<em>Atelier&nbsp;</em>series gameplay cycle of exploration, synthesis, and battles", but that you'll also be able to develop the town of Hallfein, operating your own shop and selling what you make.</p>




<p><em>Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3259600/Atelier_Resleriana_The_Red_Alchemist__the_White_Guardian/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, PlayStation 5, and Nintendo Switch on September 26th.</p>
