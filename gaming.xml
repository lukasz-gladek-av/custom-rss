			<p>The Elder Scrolls VI development seems to be proceeding well, so much so that the expectations of the game appearing during this year's edition of the Xbox Games Showcase weren't just speculation, but an educated guess.</p>



<p>Speaking during the latest episode of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDr2ZSFIEXk&amp;t=4105s">XB2 podcast</a>, Windows Central's Jez Corden commented on the sixth entry in the series, saying that it is in a "quite playable" state, without providing any additional information, and that the game's current state is the reason why the game could have been expected to be shown at this year's Xbox Games Showcase. Unfortunately, the game's release window remains unknown, as Corden has no idea how far along the game is, as finding sources inside Bethesda is difficult.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>While it has been a long time since the release of the fifth entry in the series, fans of the Bethesda series can make the wait for The Elder Scrolls VI more bearable by returning to Cyrondiil with The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered. The remaster uses Unreal Engine 5 for rendering and the game's original engine for gameplay, offering an experience that is extremely faithful to the original while updating it where needed. You can learn more about the game by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/">review.</a></p>

            <p>As part of their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">mass layoffs</a> earlier this month, Microsoft cancelled an MMORPG that was in the works at The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-online">Elder Scrolls Online</a> developers ZeniMax Online Studios. Now, the union that represents a number of devs left in limbo by that game's canning have issued an update about the process of fighting for their futures.</p>
<p>ZOS' MMO, codenamed Project Blackbird, wasn't the only game Microsoft pulled the plug on as they let go of around 9k people. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rares-mysterious-nature-sim-everwild-has-been-cancelled-as-part-of-xbox-mass-layoffs-according-to-reports">Rare's Everwild</a> and The Initiative's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/perfect-dark">Perfect Dark</a> reboot were also wiped out, with the latter studio being shuttered to boot.</p>

<p>"Earlier this month, Microsoft indefinitely shelved an unannounced MMORPG at ZeniMax Online Studios, a shock to the 222 ZOSU-CWA developers working on the project," wrote ZeniMax Online Studios United (ZOSU), not to be confused with similarly named union ZeniMax Workers United. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/while-ceos-got-dressed-up-for-the-game-awards-461-workers-at-zenimax-online-studios-unionised">The former</a> represents web developers, designers, engineers, and graphic artists who were working on ESO and this unannounced MMO, while <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zenimax-qa-workers-have-reached-a-tentative-contract-agreement-with-microsoft-paving-the-way-for-better-wages-and-more">the latter</a> is focused on QA staff.</p>
<p>"Undoubtedly, a future has been stolen from many of us and our community will never experience an amazing game," they continued, "However, despite discussions regarding the status of our employment, the fact is: we have not yet been laid off."</p>

</span></p><p>The current state of play the union outline is that their "worker-volunteers" are busy bargaining with Microsoft on behalf of those affected members.</p>
<p>"Where Microsoft has failed to support the talented craftspeople who have generated billions in revenue, our union has stepped up to provide clarity and support," they wrote. "It is true that a layoff may be in the future for some of our members. However, as a result of our organising, we are able to ensure that those impacted will be able to depart with dignity."</p>
<p>While being able to "depart with dignity" potentially being the best outcome some of these devs can hope for doesn't sound all that comforting, one can only imagine how much worse a situation these devs might be in without something in place to help fight their case.</p>
<p>We've reached out to Microsoft for comment.</p>
<p>Here's hoping that if any of these devs do end up out of a job, they are able to at least go with favourable exit terms and compensation. It's the least they'd deserve following, in the union's words, a situation that's meant "lives were upended <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/romero-games-have-completely-closed-doors-but-theres-still-hope-for-the-doom-creators-new-fps">without prior notice or communication</a> from Microsoft leadership".</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zenimax-union-say-theyre-fighting-for-staff-left-in-limbo-by-microsoft-cancelling-mmo-as-part-of-mass-layoffs]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Octopath Traveller co-developer Acquire is working on three new original games, in a new deal with Middle Eastern publisher Red Dunes Games.</p>
<p>Acquire (owned by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftware-owner-kadokawa-acknowledges-takeover-interest-from-sony">FromSoftware parent company Kadokawa</a>) is best known for the likes of Tenchu and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/way-samurai">Way of the Samurai</a>, as well as supporting Nintendo's RPG <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-and-luigi-brothership">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</a> and co-developing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s Octopath Traveller games.</p>
<p>The three original games in development will be shown at this year's Tokyo Game Show in September, as reported by <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattgardner1/2025/07/14/tenchu-studio-acquire-and-red-dunes-games-unveil-global-co-dev-deal/">Forbes</a>, and will be released on PC and major consoles. The three games are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Project Tremor (featuring "city-shaking kaiju battles")</li>
<li>Project Umbra ("dark fantasy hunts")</li>
<li>Project Shadowcar ("a shadowy espionage thriller")</li>

<p>"As Acquire, a studio that has long valued originality from Japan in game development, we are thrilled to have found a wonderful partner in Red Dunes Games and embark on a bold new global challenge together," said CEO Takuma Endo.</p>
<p>"We've always believed in the power of originality. Now, with Red Dunes, we're building something truly international."</p>
<p>Red Dunes Games, based in Abu Dhabi, has until now focused on indie games, but is looking to expand its global footprint.</p>
<p>"Acquire is a legendary studio with a deep creative legacy, and we are honoured to work with them to build the next wave of original games," said Sultan Darmaki, CEO and creative director. "This partnership is a reflection of our belief that the future of gaming lies in global collaboration, where stories cross borders, and innovation knows no region."</p>
<p>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership released last year. "A relatively minor instalment, but in a series this magical, that's still good news," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-and-luigi-brothership-review">our review</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/octopath-traveller-co-developer-working-on-three-new-original-games-coming-to-tokyo-game-show]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/">John Wick Hex</a>, a wonderful tactical RPG, is being delisted off digital storefronts on the 17th July.</p>
<p>Developed by Bithell Games and released back in 2019, it will still be playable by those who already own the game. But after the cutoff date on the 17th, those interested in the game will no longer be able to buy it on Steam, GOG, or other platforms. <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/john-wick-hex?srsltid=AfmBOooyer8DpMqd436MKCQe94z8CNMu8sX5TbxfvFXkfbrBB6kRx61z">You can still grab it now on Humble</a> for a fraction of its standard price.</p>
<p>A statement released by the publisher Big Fan Games reads as follows: "After July 17th, 2025, existing owners of John Wick Hex will still be able to access the game via their digital libraries (PC/Console) and/or physical copies (Console), however new purchases of John Wick Hex will not be possible, regardless of platform or storefront."</p>

<p>Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/john-wick-hex-review-sweet-economy">reviewed John Wick Hex favourably</a>, as Donlan wrote: "There is a great game lurking in John Wick. This series is so infused with the spirit of games, its world-building is so gamey, how could there not be? I'm still not sure that John Wick Hex is actually that precise game, but who cares when it's pretty great in its own right?"</p>
<p>The story of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-john-wick-hex-ended-up-a-strategy-game-instead-of-a-shooter">how it turned out to be a strategy game rather than a shooter like you'd expect</a> is also interesting, with developer Mike Bithell stating: "I wanted to give players that sense of strategic thinking, that high-level choreography. Then came the process of making that, pitching that, working with them, and then getting all of the filmmakers from the movies involved. They were telling me how John makes decisions, and then we went 'OK how do we make that into a game that explores that', and that to me seemed way more interesting than doing a shooter."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/the-excellent-john-wick-hex-will-be-delisted-later-this-week-currently-on-sale]]></content:encoded>

He lives in a park with his mate Haniwa, who is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haniwa">Haniwa</a>. Haniwa's secret is that he's very good at calligraphy.

<p>It's from Cavyhouse, whose previous offering was “dungeon agriculturalization roguelite game” <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1396980/The_Sealed_Ampoule">The Sealed Ampoule</a>. The demo itself is a little too short to get a good feel for things, but if it's at all representative, the game is primarily about hanging out with good weirdos and poking objects.</p>
<p>You hang about in the park Kofun and Hanawa live in. You slide down a slide. Swing on a swing. Swing on a bar, an annoying object for its refusal to bend to the verb-noun symmetry found elsewhere. You collect points for doing all this, then spend them on pondering various objects. I very much enjoy the idea of a <em>pondering currency</em>, both conceptually and in practise. It's all suitably whimsical but then Kofun will occasionally gesture at the fact that he is, undoubtedly, a tomb. I am nothing if not curious to see where this all goes. <a href="https://www.artribune.com/progettazione/2025/07/anticipazioni-videogiochi/">Cheers to The Attribune</a> for the spot.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/finally-a-game-about-a-boy-who-thinks-hes-a-tomb-searching-for-a-dead-body-to-bury-inside-of-him]]></content:encoded>

The shuttering will purportedly result in 42 employees eventually losing their jobs. The news comes less than three years after </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.testroniclabs.com/testronic-owner-catalis-expands-its-service-offering-into-art-and-game-development-through-the-acquisition-of-secret-6/">Testronic purchased Secret 6</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which also has an office in Manila, for an undisclosed fee. To date, Secret 6 has worked on a litany of notable projects including </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Last of Us Part II—Remastered</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Diablo IV</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the days since we published that report, Secret 6 Madrid employees issued a scathing press release with backing from the Spanish labor union CGT that accuses Testronic of sentencing the Madrid office to a slow death by neglecting to provide any contract work, dismissing their CEO in December 2024 and failing to hire a replacement, and outright ignoring the team's repeated requests for support.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Testronic acquired Secret 6 at the end of 2022, with the promise of providing the necessary support to help it grow in the outsourcing market," reads the press release. "Two and a half years after the acquisition, the Madrid studio has not received a single contract from Testronic. The employees suspect that the initial intention was to drain the studio of its content and offshore the work. Along with CSVI and CGT union, the workers believe may be no valid reason for the redundancy plan."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/the-star-wars-battlefront-2-player-surge-exposes-a-major-flaw-in-ea-s-business-model" target="_self" data-discover="true">The Star Wars Battlefront II player surge exposes the flaws in EA's business model</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Secret 6 Madrid and CGT allege that Testronic wants to shutter the studio so it can focus on Secret 6 Manila, where they claim working conditions are "much more precarious and wages much lower." Those factors, they say, will enable Testronic to commit "more unchecked labor exploitation."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"As soon as the Madrid studio was acquired, the new leadership failed to take on the necessary responsibilities and tasks for client acquisition, a role that had been effectively managed by the previous CEO, who was dismissed after fulfilling his sales contract," continues the release.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Secret 6 Madrid is dedicated exclusively to art development for video games and lacks a department for actively seeking new clients, as it was assured that this responsibility would fall entirely on Testronic and its sales department. In this way, the Madrid studio was left to survive solely on the contracts it had maintained due to its strong reputation with previous clients.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ousted-unknown-worlds-founders-former-ceo-sue-krafton-for-breach-of-contract" target="_self" data-discover="true">Ousted Unknown Worlds founders, former CEO sue Krafton for breach of contract</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Given these circumstances, the managers of the Madrid studio tried to coordinate with Testronic's sales team to develop joint strategies that could bring new contracts to the studio. The proposed meetings never took place, and the email exchanges on this matter led nowhere; on several occasions, there was no response from Testronic."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the face of those issues, Secret 6 Madrid's management team claims it actively sought to attend industry events and contact studios directly to secure contracts and in turn their future. Testronic allegedly refused those requests and even prohibited Secret 6 from directly contacting potential clients.&nbsp; What's more, the Madrid team alleges that only Secret 6 representatives from Manila were allowed to travel to events, leaving them unable to effectively promote their arm of the business.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to the press release, Testronic also told the Madrid team to raise their fees to increase profit margins "despite repeated warnings from the Madrid managers that this decision would harm the studio and could lead to the loss of contracts—something that, in fact, occurred with two clients the studio had been collaborating with for several years."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Testronic's response was that if the clients did not agree to these price hikes, the contracts should be terminated immediately, even if this meant not having other projects for the Madrid studio to work on. These price increases were entirely unrealistic and risky, given the current state of the video game market, which is why workers and unions consider it to have been a 'suicidal decision' in every sense."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/exploring-sabotage-studio-s-strategy-for-balancing-creativity-and-sustainability-game-developer-podcast-ep-50" target="_self" data-discover="true">Exploring Sabotage Studio's strategy for balancing creativity and sustainability - Game Developer Podcast Ep. 50</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Secret 6 Madrid claims it proved to be "financially solvent" in terms of production capacity and earnings despite those challenges, and suggests it has a number of clients who wish to continue providing the studio with work.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;I fight for my team and my studio because I believe that we are worth it&quot;">"I fight for my team and my studio because I believe that we are worth it"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Four members of the Secret 6 Madrid team, including two studio managers, have now spoken to Game Developer to discuss the impact of their fight against their parent company. All four sources chose to remain anonymous for fear of reprisal, but explain how Testronic effectively abandoned Secret 6 Madrid as soon as it was acquired by the company.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"From day one it was quite clear what sort of intentions they had," said one source. "It's that they wanted [to expand their] presence in the Asian market. [...] That's the reason we were feeling a little bit afraid, because we could see that our offices in Manila were more attractive to them than us—even when the strong arm [of the business] is here in Madrid."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">They say Testronic's treatment of Secret 6 Madrid is like purchasing a plant and then refusing to water it, and emphasize that the only person at the company who was searching for new contracts under the Testronic banner was their former CEO. We're told how Secret 6 Madrid has received very little support or contact from their parent company, but that their first meeting with a Testronic sales exec made it clear they were "selling smoke" and had no intention of nurturing the Madrid studio.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For instance, multiple sources claim that when Testronic did eventually hire a sales person to assist the studio, they brought in someone who "didn't know the difference between 3D and 2D art." Given Secret 6 Madrid specializes in art outsourcing, it was a confusing decision that left the studio high and dry. "They couldn't sell art, basically." adds another source. "But that's what they told us: 'hey, you've got this person in case you want to use them.' But they didn't do anything."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another source claims that, the day after Testronic told staff Secret 6 Madrid would be closed, the studio was approached by a client who wanted to sign a contract worth a purported €800,000, but that Testronic remained entirely focused on dismantling the team.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Discussing those aforementioned price hikes, one person says that Testronic didn't advise the Madrid office to raise its prices but rather mandated the move. There was no room for discussion or compromise. "[We were told] 'you are going to raise the rates for every single client by at least 15 percent, and if they say no you are going to stop working for them immediately.' This is not a real strategy."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One source describes that approach was like being forced to play poker without the ability to do anything but go all in on each hand. "It was really, really dangerous for us," they add, noting that relationships with some clients turned sour as a result.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It has culminated in a dire situation that has left Secret 6 Madrid workers fighting for their livelihoods. In an ideal world, the team want to continue developing video games under the Secret 6 banner—but given the precarious situation they have been placed in are also attempting to secure solid severance packages in tandem with CGT.&nbsp;Right now, they haven't ruled out striking if discussions stall.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The first thing we want is to continue doing our labor. To continue being able to create games, and to continue having this amazing team of people creating games in the future," adds one source. "They don't want to let us continue—and they are saying 'no, we are going to close you down."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another employee agrees and says Testronic has never made a "serious" proposal that will enable the team to continue working. All four explain that watching Testronic slowly put their studio to the sword over the course of years has massively impacted their wellbeing.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"For me personally it has been awful," says one person. "You could actually see that we were running out of projects for a long time and we couldn't do anything. [...] It has been exhausting, because at some point we realized that we were trying to save something that someone else had decided should be left to die. That was very hard.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I feel like they took the opportunity for us to be able to keep growing as a team, and that really hurts because there are exceptional people here with a lot of talent and we are very close as a team. I admire every single person here that's in the office and all of our colleagues that are online, and they are great. The humanity that's here is exceptional."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another source feels Secret 6 Madrid wouldn't be facing closure if Testronic had "wanted to do their job" and claims that lives are being upended because their parent company has abandoned their responsibilities. Such is the feeling of injustice at the decision to shutter Secret 6 Madrid that at least one member of the team has traveled from another region in Spain to Madrid "to fight and sit on the negotiation table."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I fight for my team and my studio because I believe that we are worth it," they say. That passion is evident no matter who speaks up—although one source explains their frustration has now turned to anger. "They tried to choke us from the start of this whole process—and this is very very frustrating," they add. "[I'm feeling] both stress and fear. A mixture of emotions and feelings, but most of it is rage. We are raging about this whole redundancy process."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The real kicker, according to one person, is that Testronic "will most likely get away with it." As is so often the case when major conglomerates and corporations make sweeping cuts in the name of sustainability, growth, or whatever other buzzword they roll out to appease investors, the executives making those decisions are left unscathed and often escape accountability.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the case of Testronic, we have reached out multiple times to the company since word of the closure began spreading on social media. So far, we haven't heard back. One source explains they "would love" to hear what the company has to say publicly on the matter—not least because it seems the firm has been decidedly unresponsive when discussing the situation internally.&nbsp;"To be honest, I think they know what they have been doing is wrong," they add. "[But] it's quite clear they don't want to talk."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer has once again reached out to Testronic for comment.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

		<p>Publisher Big Fan Games has announced that John Wick Hex is going to be delisted from all platforms on July 17th, but a reason behind this delisting was not given. In a statement, Big Fan Games did state that anyone who has a digital copy of the game already on any platform will still be able to play John Wick Hex after the game is delisted, and physical copies of the game will not be impacted either.</p>
<p><iframe title="John Wick Hex - Release Date Trailer [October 8]" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7Qffi2DiBlY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The full statement about the John Wick Hex delisting from Big Fan Games reads, <em>“John Wick Hex will be removed from sale on all platforms beginning July 17th, 2025.After July 17th, 2025, existing owners of John Wick Hex will still be able to access the game via their digital libraries (PC/Console) and/or physical copies (Console), however new purchases of John Wick Hex will not be possible, regardless of platform or storefront.”</em></p>
<p>John Wick Hex was developed by Bithell Games, with Mike Bithell taking to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mikebithell.bsky.social/post/3ltxcisuy2c22">BlueSky</a> to give his own thoughts on the delisting, but he has not been able to give the reason for the delisting. He said, <em>“Pour one out (and pick up a copy asap if you want one). This one was a weird journey.. initially polarised folks, but now it’s one of the consistent favourites people wanna chat with me about when I’m doing public stuff. My first disappeared game, a weird feeling. It’s legacy will be that you can watch me getting my arse kicked on the John Wick 3 special features by the eventual director of Love Hurts. My pink face will echo through eternity.”</em></p>

<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/10/08/john-wick-hex-review/">John Wick Hex Review</a></h2>
<p>In our John Wick Hex review, Miguel said, <em>“John Wick Hex is the last form you might expect a John Wick game to take, but this unique, inventive puzzler kept my mind racing from beginning to end. While the gameplay and interesting story shed light on some important aspects of the film franchise, the sometimes punishing difficulty and surprising lack of focus on John Wick himself left me a little disappointed. This isn’t a perfect video game adaptation of a film, but it’s certainly the most original one I’ve ever played.”</em></p>

<p>Square Enix's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_quest_i_and_ii_hd-2d_remake">Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</a> is due out on the Switch and Switch 2 this October, and ahead of release, an official FAQ has shared an important detail.</p>
<p>It's been confirmed there's no upgrade path currently available or planned, so if you want to play it on a particular platform, you'll need to buy it on that system.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Can copies of the Switch version of DRAGON QUEST I &amp; II HD-2D Remake be upgraded to the Switch 2 version?</strong></p>
<p>No, there is no upgrade path currently available or planned. Please buy your copy for whichever system you would like to play it on.</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067vglsqj&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>As you can see in the text of the image above, it's mentioned how the Switch version "cannot be upgraded" and there are "no plans for such an upgrade path in the future". Additionally, Switch 2 DLC codes for the game can only be used with the Switch 2 version (and vice versa with the Switch release and codes).</p>
<p>So, there you go – if you are buying the game on the Switch with hopes of upgrading it at some point, now you know you can't do that. And keep in mind a 'Game-Key Card' release for the Switch 2 version has also been confirmed.</p>

<figure><a title="Super Mario 3D All-Stars" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/628c7da503aad/super-mario-3d-all-stars.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Since the arrival of the Switch 2 last month, Nintendo has been busy updating many of its first-party Switch titles. This even includes an update for its "limited-time" release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_3d_all-stars">Super Mario 3D All-Stars</a>, and following an update for the Switch 2 today, another patch is now available.</p>
<p>Much like the Version 1.1.2 update, <strong>Version 1.1.3</strong> also addresses "several issues" to improve the overall gameplay experience on the hybrid system. Although there's not much revealed in the official patch notes, returning players on the new platform will hopefully have a better time with the game.</p>
<p>Here's the full rundown (via Nintendo's support page):</p>
<h2>Super Mario 3D All-Stars: Ver. 1.1.3 (Released July 14, 2025)</h2>
<h6>The following updates have been made when playing the game on Nintendo Switch 2:</h6>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Several issues have been addressed to improve gameplay on Nintendo Switch 2.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: The software update is required to play on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<hr>
<p>This isn't the only Mario Switch release to receive some love on the Switch 2, with Nintendo also recently rolling out updates for games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a> and even titles like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/new_super_mario_bros_u_deluxe">New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe</a>.</p>
<p>Once again, this update to Super Mario 3D All-Stars for the Switch 2 has rolled out alongside a new system firmware update. You can find out more about this in our previous post:</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-salute-to-the-13.1243659/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Godot is a game engine that is both free and open source, meaning it's a great option for budding, first-time developers. The kind of people who, thanks to their youth and/or inexperience, may not have learned things the hard way.</p><p>By that I mean look at this statistic:</p><p>I've seen a lot of developers respond to this with either some form of "oof" or some shade of "by <em>God</em>, what are you <em>doing</em>?", and I understand the sentiment. Not using<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> version control</a> is akin to writing up a Word doc without autosave turned on, only <em>worse, </em>because you risk losing so much more work<em>. </em>It opens these projects up to the possibility of absolute catastrophe.</p><p>And yet...I do not want to admonish these 19.1% of people. Particularly the 13% who know what version control means and refuse to engage in the practice anyway. Rather than view this 13% as reckless, I want to salute their bravery.</p><p>See, I've spent my entire career writing in the CMS (Content Management System), which is the media's equivalent. That means I open up the platform we publish stories on--in Aftermath's case as of July 2025, a modified version of Wordpress--and write all my stories straight into it. No Notes app, no Google Docs, no Word–I write drafts and outlines straight into the CMS, edit it from there then eventually hit publish.</p><p>Writers often gasp at this as audibly as game developers have at that 19.1% of respondents to that survey, because it's risky. CMS autosave functionality is questionable at best, there are no grammar checkups, it makes it harder to share and edit your work; when it comes to reasons not to do it, the list goes on forever.</p><p>But I don't care. The cowardly shall not see heaven. If this is the platform I publish my writing on then I want to be able to tailor it to that platform--its length, its appearance, everything--from the very beginning of my writing, and if that's dicey behaviour then so be it. Let me live a little.</p><p>Same goes for this 13%! Modern life is so full of handrails and automation and supervision and authority over our platforms and actions that who are we to look at their position and assume they're in line to learn a lesson. Maybe they know what they're doing is bad and <em>do it anyway</em>, because the danger of losing their work is a slow-burning thrill, one of the few avenues left where they can exercise any kind of control over their lives on the internet.</p><p>Or maybe they're just idiots. They can, like me, be both at the same time.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/horror-anime-crunchyroll-netflix-hikaru-takopi"><h3>Your Guide To Feel-Bad-Anime Summer</h3></a><p>The Summer Hikaru Died and Takopi’s Original Sin are a throwback to the disturbing, horrifying anime of yesteryear</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/high-wheel-bike-race-frederick"><h3>The Penny Farthing Is Alive And Well In 2025</h3></a><p>The National Clustered Spires High Wheel Race takes place every summer in Frederick, Maryland</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-disability-pride-last-of-us-forza"><h3>Why Disability Journalism In Games Needs To Evolve Beyond Marketing</h3></a><p>"We’ve conditioned ourselves to believe that we’re all one big happy family"</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/godot-version-control-statistics-cms]]></content:encoded>

<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/45a8eb1719156/nintendo-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has rolled out another firmware update for the Switch 2 and it also happens to be the first one for the month of July.</p>
<p>According to the official patch notes on the customer support page, it resolves some fixes tied to the Parental Controls and also includes general system stability improvements, which are sure to make your system super stable. Here's the official rundown:</p>
<h3>Switch 2 - Ver. 20.2.0 (Released July 14, 2025)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Fixed an issue where Parental Control settings were not transferred from Nintendo Switch to Nintendo Switch 2 in certain circumstances during a system transfer.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>General system stability improvements to enhance the user's experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>It's worth mentioning how this same firmware update is now also available on the Nintendo Switch, bumping this system up to Version 20.2.0.</p>
<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/oatmealdome.bsky.social/post/3ltxqqi5d4s2h">Dataminer 'OatmealDome'</a> has investigated this patch, noting how this update "fixes some problems with Switch 1 backwards compatibility" including being able to "personally confirm" <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/portal_companion_collection">Portal 2</a> "no longer crashes" after updating to the latest firmware.</p>
<p>The same source encourages Switch 2 owners to try out any games they were having issues with, to see if the experience has changed after this latest update.

<p>This latest update follows a few firmware patches in the Switch 2's launch month, which also included some "stability improvements".</p>

<p>"Announcements are coming"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/22299e6f9294c/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>As you've likely seen by now, there's a new rumour from the latest Nate the Hate podcast about a Nintendo Direct potentially taking place some time <em>after</em> the launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>.</p>
<p>In the same episode, the YouTuber and podcaster has touched on the subject of future third-party support for the Switch 2, and how although it might not look like there's much on the way beyond the initial announcements, there are apparently multiple developers holding back reveals (<em>possibly for Nintendo's broadcast</em>).</p>
<p>Nintendo is also supposedly looking to reassure everyone that its new hybrid system is a "viable platform" for "big" third-party titles going forward. As for the announcements, they're expected to be coming from many of the major publishers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Announcements are coming... I also know studios like Capcom, Sega, Ubisoft, Bandai Namco and many others are just waiting. They have games they want to announce for the platform. They have a lot of support for this platform.</p>
<p>"...It's going to be a very important Direct for Nintendo, to say 'this is the third-party support we have, look at the games, they can stand up to those other systems' be it from a visual or performance standpoint, and 'we are a viable platform for you to select moving forward' to experience third-party releases."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He also adds how Microsoft is still expected to be a "big supporter of the system", with Activision's title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-plus-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</a> arriving on Switch 2 last week.</p>
<p>Of course, games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> and Square Enix's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> are arriving later this year as well. FromSoftware's Switch 2 exclusive <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/duskbloods">The Duskbloods</a> is also scheduled for next year, and last week, 2K locked in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nba-2k26">NBA 2K26</a> for the new platform following its confirmation of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/wwe-2k25">WWE 2K25</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">One of my favorite pastimes on the playground growing up was having heated debates with my friends about which of our favorite TV or video game characters would win in a fight. While it’s been a few decades since those days on the swingset, pitting two individuals from different properties against one another in a deathmatch is no less relevant today – just look at games like Fortnite, Call of Duty, and Magic: The Gathering. One trading card game has been doing it far longer. It's called <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/universus-collectible-card-game">UniVersus</a>, and the team at UVS Games has recently released the final set in their Attack on Titan line – Apocalypse – featuring cards and characters from the final arc of the manga and anime. At last, we can find out if Eren Yeager, in his final form, can take on Godzilla or the various members of Critical Role’s Vox Machina.</p><div catalogid="8a1b0961-2202-4b69-9ae2-b045db9308ec" id="225306"><div id="225306" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>UniVersus Attack on Titan: Apocalypse</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">For those unfamiliar with UniVersus, previously known as “UFS - Universal Fighting System”, it's a card game akin to games like Magic: The Gathering or Yu-Gi-Oh, but whose identity is based around creating wild cross-over fights. Players construct decks, picking a Character to lead their deck, which also dictates how much life they start with and their maximum hand size. UniVersus’ mechanics are centered around checks that players make to play their various kinds of cards, from attacks to other resources. Each card has a challenge value on it that must be met or exceeded for the card to be successfully played, requiring the player to flip the card on top of their deck and compare its check value against the challenge value of the action to be played. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Successes allow the action to be taken, such as attacking your opponent, while a failure ends your turn. A player’s turn continues until either they pass or fail one of these checks, with each subsequent check increasing the challenge value. It’s an interesting system, and adds an extra element of tension with every check from the top of your deck. However, it can be a bit overwhelming at times, especially when you get to blocking attacks, which have their own set of similar checks to deal with. UniVersus as a whole, I feel, is one of the more complex card games out there on the market today.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This latest set is focused around the final arc of the Attack of Titan series. It continues to build on the previous sets that UVS released – Battle for Humanity and Origins of Power. Much like those other sets, <a href="https://zdcs.link/Q47mOX?object_uuid=cc73bee0-b622-4f94-aae0-aecac6c88b54&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Apocalypse</u></a> retains the unique manga-esque card art, with most of the artwork framed in manga panels, with brand new artwork done by series creator Hajime Isayama. While his art style may not be everyone’s cup of tea, I personally prefer the art of the anime more, but there is no denying that it is neat to have these unique prints included in the set. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">From a gameplay standpoint, not much sets Apocalypse apart from the other AoT sets UVS has released in the past year, but that isn’t really a bad thing, as I’ve enjoyed the previous sets quite a bit. I am especially fond of the double-sided Titan cards that allow characters to shift from their human form into their Titan form during the game, allowing for deeper strategies and tense moments in my games, and it feels just as good here in this final set as it did in the first. I have my fingers crossed that the team will find ways to incorporate this feature in future non-AoT sets.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Coming in at over 180 cards, Apocalypse offers players roughly the same amount of new cards as the previous Origins of Power set did, so unfortunately, if you were hoping for another large set like the titanic (pun intended) Battle for Humanity and its 300+ list, you’re out of luck. It is a bit of a bummer that there aren’t more cards. One feeling, though that I couldn’t escape as I looked through this set, was how it felt more like a set aimed more at collectors than at players. Maybe it’s just my imagination, resulting from the marketing focus on the new Isayama artwork and special chrome cards, but I feel like with the set's release, and even before, I heard more about those parts of this release than specifics on new cards or abilities of the set. To Apocalypse’s credit, the cards are all very neat and the chrome cards are beautiful, but for prospective new players, I don’t know what they could really learn about the set from a quick google search about specifics outside of “look, new art” which leads into the biggest issue that continues to hound UniVersus as a whole – learning resources.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Again, this is a complicated game and on the spectrum of simple to complex card games, I would put UniVersus somewhere around 3 out of 4 mark. Even after dabbling in the game for the past year or two, there are still a number of areas – resource symbols for example – that seemingly make little sense to me. To the team’s credit, they realize the game has an <a href="https://uvsgames.com/all-news/designing-uvs-one" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>onboarding problem</u></a>. I’ve played Magic a long time, so the idea of color identity, the idea that a specific color is tied to a style of gameplay, is something that makes sense to me, and symbols are, in essence, the UniVersus version of this idea. But UniVersus has 12 symbols, with abstract things like “All”, “Good”, and “Chaos” as just a few examples. I haven’t progressed far past the idea of just using the same symbols as the character who is leading my deck, but I wish the learning resources available did far more to help explain the systems, or were presented better. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While some resources are available, examples such as the <a href="https://44595267.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/44595267/2025%20Learn%20to%20Play%20Resources/2025%20Anatomy%20of%20a%20Turn.pdf" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>phase breakdown</u></a> and <a href="https://44595267.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/44595267/2025%20Learn%20to%20Play%20Resources/2025%20How%20to%20Play%20Step-by-Step.pdf" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>play-by-play of a turn</u></a> are walls of text without a single accompanying image to help. The <a href="https://uvsgames.com/all-news/universus-design-team-learning-about-the-symbols" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>symbols guide</u></a> features outdated card art and symbol designs, and the currently available basic “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcSojOdcJwI" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>How to Play</u></a>” video that teaches the most basic concepts of the game doesn’t touch on half of the card types that the game uses or even mention those resource symbols. In fact, they are omitted completely even from the art on the cards used in the demonstration. Thankfully, various content creators have published resources that potential new players can watch to learn the game, but the bright side of things is that they know that this is an issue and are working to address it, slowly but surely. I enjoy my time when I play, but finding good information on how to play or build decks in this game is so hard to come by that it makes UniVersus a hard sell to my card-game-playing friends.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Where to Buy</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/z7Ol4E?object_uuid=cc73bee0-b622-4f94-aae0-aecac6c88b54&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">See it at TCGPlayer</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QKgApY?object_uuid=cc73bee0-b622-4f94-aae0-aecac6c88b54&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">See it at UVS Games</a></li></ul></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jul 14, 2025 7:56 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Despite frustration around some of the rules, I do still enjoy the times I get to play UniVersus, and this Attack on Titan: Apocalypse set is fun to play. I still got a kick out of Eren taking Boimler and the crew of the U.S.S. Cerritos from Star Trek Lower Decks, or Armin busting out All Might’s Detroit Smash while having Vox Machina’s Trinket the bear helping him out. The outlandish situations and moments that UniVersus presents players is straight out of a schoolyard argument, and I love it. Attack on Titan: Apocalypse sends off the setting on a good note with a lot of new cards to play with and strategize around, adding to an already fun game, despite its shortcomings, teaching players its mechanics.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/attack-on-titan-apocalypse-card-set-review]]></content:encoded>

<section><p>Like gaming, Formula 1 replicates the feeling of perfecting a build to overcome an obstacle, and having to repeat the process again and again.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Formula 1, also known as F1, is a hot topic as of late and one of the world’s most popular sports. Whether it's topping the box office with a film starring Brad Pitt, or literally building a track smack in the middle of Las Vegas and hosting a race there, there’s a surging interest in the highly popular international motorsport. While on the surface, Formula 1 seems to be another Grand Prix sport in which drivers test their mettle on the track, diving deeper into the sport reveals a highly competitive battle of technical prowess on and off the track. In many ways, Formula 1 is like playing a video game, in which your gear and build matters right down to the very last detail, making it feel unlike any other sport out there. In fact, I'd argue Formula 1 is <em>the </em>sport to check out if you’re into gaming.</p><p dir="ltr">Let's start with the basics, namely: what is Formula 1 and how exactly does it differ from other Grand Prix racing leagues that are fairly common but far less popular? In most other leagues, drivers and teams are required to use the same chassis and vehicle specifications. For example, in NASCAR, every driver uses the same type of vehicle, and the racing advantage comes down to pure skill in the moment-to-moment racing. That’s not the case in Formula 1.</p><p dir="ltr">Each F1 team is instead given a series of broad guidelines, specifications, and a budget: a “Formula” for them to follow. Using these guidelines, the teams literally build their race vehicles from scratch, using a fleet of engineers and mechanics. Because every team is able to build their own vehicle, the teams look for every advantage they can in the design and build, right down to the smallest detail. This results in vehicles that have more in common with jets and spacecraft than they do the average car you would see on the street.</p><p dir="ltr">To make matters more interesting, each team has to actually build their vehicle <em>twice, </em>because in the rules of Formula 1, each team is required to have two drivers and two vehicles. And while these drivers cannot communicate with one another, having two racers makes it vital that they are in constant communication with their team boss and engineers. Through radio contact, teams can switch up strategies and make changes to gameplans situations on the fly in the heat of a race, much like how teammate communication would work in a first-person shooter or MOBA video game.</p><p dir="ltr">Once the cars are built, it's finally time to hit the track. Grand Prix events, a series of races in a championship series, in Formula 1 are typically split up into four different races: two practice rounds, one qualifier, and the Grand Prix race itself. In the practice rounds, drivers do exactly what is implied: they practice. In racing leagues such as NASCAR, the tracks are typically a round oval-like shape, providing a consistent driving experience throughout the race. Formula 1 shakes things up by featuring tracks that are filled with sharp turns and straightaways throughout. Because of this--and the fact that highly experimental vehicles are being used--drivers need to acquaint themselves with the track. Using these practice rounds, teams can also make adjustments to their vehicles and factor variables such as weather and track temperature into their final modifications and tire selection. Imagine it like playing a particularly difficult track in a racing game to learn it before hopping into an online match.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4531998-ss_41e2dc99ae68ff3f7628403fac109aa9b784fa8b.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4531998" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4531998-ss_41e2dc99ae68ff3f7628403fac109aa9b784fa8b.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4531998"></a><figcaption>EA's F1 25 is the latest entry in the popular series.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4531998-ss_41e2dc99ae68ff3f7628403fac109aa9b784fa8b.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Actually, let's talk a bit more about games here. Most racing games pride themselves on being accurate simulations of their respective motorsports. From Gran Turismo to EA’s yearly F1 franchise, recreating the motorsport experience is a priority for these games. Simulations are also essential to Formula 1 as well, as drivers use advanced simulators to recreate their cars and tracks without ever having to step on the pavement. With state of the art technologies and a smart use of screens and driving rigs, drivers are able to run <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/sim-racers-rejoice-f1-champ-max-verstappen-says-youre-getting-a-90-to-95-percent-accurate-experience-even-without-that-megabucks-motion-rig/" rel="nofollow ">near-exact replicas</a> of situations they’ll face in the race.</p><p dir="ltr">After practice is where it really starts to count. With all the knowledge the drivers and teams have gained during the practice rounds, they race in a qualifier to compete for starting position in the race. The coveted pole position also known as “P1,” the frontmost starting position, is what the teams strive for, and every further position is considered a disadvantage that could literally add seconds to lap time.</p><p dir="ltr">After starting positions are established comes the real-deal race, in which the teams earn points for the season score based on finishing position. It’s no-holds-barred, and teams are expected to operate at peak performance right down to the smallest detail.</p><p dir="ltr">During the race, when drivers are forced to make pit stops for tire swaps and repairs, the pit crew is expected to have the drivers back out on the course in two seconds or less--and often do. Even choosing when to have these pit stops is considered a tactical decision that is given a great deal of thought and consideration. That’s why teams not only earn points for driving, but also for pit and engineering teams. The Grand Prix event repeats multiple times throughout the season, and at the end, the winning team is crowned for their technical and physical skills, on and off the track. The outcome affects budgets for teams in the following year' the winning team receives less budget to work with than runner-up teams, meaning that other teams will have a chance to catch up from a tech standpoint.</p><p dir="ltr">In many ways, Formula 1 feels like gaming--even for someone who is not actively participating. In most sports, gear and builds don’t factor into performance, but Formula 1 replicates the feeling of perfecting a build to overcome an obstacle, and having to repeat the process again and again.</p><p dir="ltr">Take, for example, Nico Hulkenberg’s third-place podium win from a P19 starting position, making it his first podium win in 239 races, a feat not thought possible from a “weaker” team. As someone who’s heavily into Diablo, I can’t help but see parallels between streamlining and tinkering with a character build of mine for the highest damage output and putting it to the test in endless repeatable dungeons, and seeing a Formula 1 team made adjustments and modifications to shave seconds off of their fastest lap time. When everything clicks in, gaming and Formula 1 actions can run like clockwork and provide a grand sense of accomplishment especially when critical thinking is applied.</p>

The segment may have come about from producers reading <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/feb/15/theres-no-stress-gamers-go-offline-in-retro-console-revival&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/feb/15/theres-no-stress-gamers-go-offline-in-retro-console-revival" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">repeated</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/apr/02/why-are-younger-generations-embracing-the-retro-game-revival&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/apr/02/why-are-younger-generations-embracing-the-retro-game-revival" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stories</a></span> about the resurgence of retro gaming in <em>The Guardian</em>. Who doesn’t love a nice trip down memory lane back to the ‘80s and ‘90s, when gaming was still a novel escape from the drudgery of life and not associated with the battle cries of the worst people you’ve ever encountered online?</p><p>But the segment went off the rails immediately when the camera zoomed in on the props: a ZX81, a Nintendo Wii, and a SNES with an NES cartridge stuffed into it. There’s no way to harp on this without reinforcing the worst <em>Simpsons</em> comic book guy stereotypes, but, I mean, come on folks. This is like stuffing a VHS tape into a DVD player. I hope anyone planning to get back into retro gaming took it as a helpful warning of what not to do. <br></p><p>“As Nick shared on the programme, it’s no surprise that older titles and classic consoles are back in demand,” UKIE posted on LinkedIn. “Retro gaming taps into a powerful sense of nostalgia and community, offering players a way to reconnect with their past and share the games they loved with a new generation.”</p><p>The organization later denied responsibility for&nbsp;the retro gaming debacle. “For transparency, the studio team set up the in-studio display independently and handled the placement of the consoles—unfortunately, we couldn’t adjust it whilst on air,” a spokesperson <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/i-want-to-report-a-crime-bbc-mocked-for-its-wonky-nintendo-setup/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/i-want-to-report-a-crime-bbc-mocked-for-its-wonky-nintendo-setup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>VGC</em></a></span>.<br></p><p>In fairness, the SNES’s lack of backwards compatibility <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTzyz2TgGls&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTzyz2TgGls" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">confounded news broadcasters</a></span> back when it came out as well. The fact that it couldn’t “mix-and-match” games with the NES was seen as part of Nintendo’s uphill battle to sell parents on a pricey next-gen upgrade. That’s a problem the Switch 2 doesn’t have. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/bbc-mario-bros-nes-snes-retro-gaming-switch-2-1851786266]]></content:encoded>

In the game’s recreation of <em>THPS 3</em>'s iconic Canada level, someone has been removed: The dude pissing off the edge of the map. I decided to reach out to the developers at Iron Galaxy to get to the bottom of this very important issue. We also talked about other stuff, too, I guess. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197562" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="THPS 3+4 Does Away With The OG 4's Career Mode, Here's Why" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="118" data-playlist="197562,195618,196358" data-current="197562"><div><p>THPS 3+4 Does Away With The OG 4's Career Mode, Here's Why</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197562/197562_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197562/197562_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197562/197562_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23086.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>First up, I had to know, why did Iron Galaxy remove the pissing man from Canada? Is this some grand conspiracy? What’s going on? Well, according to Iron Galaxy, the pissing man wasn’t removed from <em>THPS 3+4</em>. But he does have better bladder control. </p><p>“Overall, we’ve made a few changes to the game so we could cast skating in a more positive light,” said Kurt Tillmanns, <em>THPS 3+4</em>'s director. “Our old Canadian friend is not gone, he has just learned some much-needed bladder control. There is even a pro goal where you can help him hydrate.” </p><p>When I asked about other changes players have spotted in <em>THPS 3+4</em>, like a ramp being in a different spot or an area being slightly re-themed, Tillmans said that the studio’s main goals for levels are to make something “cooler” and “more fun.” </p><p>“Our goals for environment design are to create a visual spectacle and provide interesting opportunities to skate. Those two motivations inform all our decisions,” said Tillman.</p><h2 id="h307182"><a id=""></a>Missing levels and big changes</h2><p>Speaking of changes, the biggest and most controversial change (besides the ever-important presence of the pissing dude) was to<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-remake-remaster-thps4-original-career-mode-ps5-1851779836&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-remake-remaster-thps4-original-career-mode-ps5-1851779836"> how <em>THPS 4</em>'s levels work in the remake</a></span>. They aren’t open-world anymore and instead work like <em>THPS 3</em>'s levels, with two-minute timers and a list of goals to complete in that time. I asked if there were ever plans to do the <em>THPS 4</em>'s levels as open-world playspaces, but it was never an option. </p><p>“We set out to create a game that joins and embodies the best of what both of the classic games offered. The two-minute timer is the emblematic<em> Tony Hawk</em> gameplay loop,” said Tillman. “Players who aren’t as interested in that can customize the length of the timer, up to an hour. Many goals from <em>THPS 4 </em>return, and we can share goals and gameplay across both titles, bringing gameplay like Skitchin’ and COMBO goals to the <em>THPS 3 </em>parks. We feel that this best-of-both-worlds approach is a benefit to both games.” </p><p>And while the new levels—like Waterpark—in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-photo-mode-option-tool-tony-hawks-pro-skater-1851786140&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-photo-mode-option-tool-tony-hawks-pro-skater-1851786140"><em>THPS 3+4</em></a></span> are good, I had to ask about the missing levels, like<em> THPS4</em>'s Chicago. According to Tillman, they were cut as part of the process for delivering a “unique experience rather than just a predictable remaster.” </p><p>“When it came to rebuilding the parks from the ground up, we prioritized the ones that seemed to be the favorites, according to the community consensus. Passing on Chicago and Carnival freed us up to build Waterpark, Pinball, and Movie Studio, the first brand-new [<em>THPS</em>]<em>&nbsp;</em>parks in over a decade.”</p><p>Oh, and here’s Tillman’s full response about Eric Sparrow appearing in the game for all big fans of Tony Hawk’s Underground. </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Every game needs a villain. We just thought this would be a fun callback to the <em>Underground</em>. A lot of time has passed, so this is a chance to find out the path he has led himself down with his treacherous ways.</p></blockquote><p>Hmmmm.... That’s not confirmation of <em>Underground </em>getting a full remake one day, but at least it’s nice to know the devs behind <em>THPS 3+4</em> know their Tony Hawk lore. Looking forward, Iron Galaxy still has an “opportunity to update the game post-launch.” We know at least one change that will be made in a future update, as the developer confirmed after this interview that it was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-tony-hawk-banjo-guitar-hero-easter-egg-trash-1851786211&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-tony-hawk-banjo-guitar-hero-easter-egg-trash-1851786211">going to remove a joke from the Waterpark level.</a></span>&nbsp;</p><p>“We’re watching like a hawk as players drop back into the parks. We still have an opportunity to update the game post-launch, so we’ll keep an eye on their feedback.”</p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-remake-peeing-guy-canada-level-removed-censor-1851786232]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I spent about 35 hours in <em>Hitman World of Assassination</em> this past weekend—interrupted mostly by the non-optional need to sleep and occasional concerns over the health of my GPU running for so long in a non-air conditioned apartment room in New York City in the summer. But I was determined to find out if the Agent 47 experience could really satisfy the stealth nerd in me. As it turns out, I’ve been so, <em>so </em>wrong to neglect modern <em>Hitman</em>’s potential as a third-person stealth game; I thought it fell drastically short in that regard, but in fact it’s quite capable of delivering the hide-and-seek thrills I came to love in games like <em>Metal Gear Solid</em>.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196394" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Killing Your Heroes, And More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="97" data-playlist="196394,197541,196013" data-current="196394"><div><p>The Week In Games: Killing Your Heroes, And More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196394/196394_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196394/196394_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196394/196394_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196394/196394_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21942.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>I blame my failure to recognize the freedom to go off-script and sneak around like Sam Fisher on the way the game foregrounds certain specific approaches you can take to each hit, which come with defined objectives that had me waiting around for the right costume to reveal itself, or for some waiter to leave an unattended glass nearby so I could slip some poison into it at just the right time. As I milled around waiting on these narrowly defined opportunities, I found myself wanting to just obsessively crouch-walk around every map, rarely changing outfits, slipping in and out of rooms never to be seen, but always lethally focused on my target. But can <em>Hitman</em> actually be played like this? Yes, I hear the diehard fans screaming right now, you always could just go off-script and do your own thing.</p><p>In my defense, <em>Hitman</em>’s default settings and game modes make it tough to ignore those narrative opportunities at first. These sub-quests are usually triggered by snippets of overheard NPC dialogue, followed by your handler narrating a bit of what’s going on. You’re then treated to a bright bluish-green lightbulb icon you can follow to victory through the whole map. Play the scenario right, and you probably never even have to crouch or stay out of sight. Hell, you could probably just play the game using the mini-map alone at that point. Straying from these narrative moments also results in a serious difficulty spike; guards are quite perceptive on higher difficulties, and there are more enforcers who can see through your disguises. So it’s easy to get discouraged and come to the conclusion that, yes, the easiest way to take out your hit is to wait for that perfect disguise, or that quick turn of a wrench on some piece of machinery that will crush your target. </p><figure id="" data-id="fd717e15f10615e787441aaea327765c" data-recommend-id="image://fd717e15f10615e787441aaea327765c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A person in a mascot outfit leans out from the corner." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A person in a mascot outfit leans out from the corner." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->IOI / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fd717e15f10615e787441aaea327765c" data-recommend-id="image://fd717e15f10615e787441aaea327765c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A person in a mascot outfit leans out from the corner." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The comically macabre story scenarios are an undeniable part of the theater of <em>Hitman</em>. But once I shut the guides off via Master difficulty, I found a very similar experience to the kinds of stealth games I grew up playing—and, dare I say, <em>Hitman</em> might even offer more interesting stealth opportunities? Before I knew it, I was clearing levels while going almost entirely unseen, rarely changing outfits, and waiting for <em>my</em> opportunity to land the killing shot. While some maps feel very familiar to ones I’ve played in other stealth games, <em>Hitman</em> also excels at providing types of maps that few dedicated stealth games seem willing to experiment with.</p><p>When was the last time Solid Snake had to infiltrate a suburban residential neighborhood? When did Sam Fisher ever have to break into a bank vault in the middle of the day while also assassinating the greedy, evil CEO? Yet here I was, using techniques and instincts baked during my many years spent playing as one of the many Snakes. I was surprised by just how organically it felt to crouch-walk everywhere while timing my takedowns with split-second urgency, instead of waiting for them to line up at just the right moment for me to deliver a low-effort execution by flipping a switch or turning a wrench on faulty equipment.</p><figure id="" data-id="c8dd5fea288e3c25aaec0100794066cb" data-recommend-id="image://c8dd5fea288e3c25aaec0100794066cb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Agent 47 waits around a corner to strike his opponent." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Agent 47 waits around a corner to strike his opponent." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->IOI / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c8dd5fea288e3c25aaec0100794066cb" data-recommend-id="image://c8dd5fea288e3c25aaec0100794066cb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Agent 47 waits around a corner to strike his opponent." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>To be clear, some <em>Hitman</em> levels are easier to play in the style of <em>Metal Gear</em> or <em>Splinter Cell</em> than others. But the variety of environments, from a militia compound to a bougie high-tech hospital in Japan, makes for a nice mix of the familiar with unexpected scenarios that I’d never come across in the standard milsim milieu in which many stealth games operate. And even if I largely opted to ignore the narrative approaches the game offers to its various scenarios, they still exist on the periphery of my playstyle, making the maps feel more alive, sometimes presenting opportunities to get out of a sticky situation. I feel like I’m trespassing into spaces occupied by real people, not just mindless drones endlessly repeating a watch shift. And even when you don’t interact with them, turning a corner to find two NPCs flirting with each other, for example, makes these places feel occupied. You get the sense that you’re intruding not just because the HUD tells you that you’re trespassing, but because you’re clearly spying on or are within earshot of something you’re not supposed to be. </p><p>The narrative moments also helped me survive some failure burnout. As I consider getting spotted a fail state, I have a decades-learned habit of hitting “Restart Mission” every time a wrong move ruins my perfect stealth run. It’s not unusual for me to drill the same part of a mission over and over again until I can slip through, preferably without even firing a shot or taking down a guard. I aim for ghostly runs as often as I can. </p><figure id="" data-id="32d707119da59c088b49adb040cf85bf" data-recommend-id="image://32d707119da59c088b49adb040cf85bf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Agent 47 crouches below an office desk to hide from two NPCs." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Agent 47 crouches below an office desk to hide from two NPCs." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->IOI / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="32d707119da59c088b49adb040cf85bf" data-recommend-id="image://32d707119da59c088b49adb040cf85bf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Agent 47 crouches below an office desk to hide from two NPCs." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But stumbling upon a possible narrative opportunity during my stealthy trips around the map can be something of a release valve, helping me let go of the frustration of getting spotted. Or sometimes I’ll give in and disguise myself as a security guard. The fact that the game allows for this versatility is what helped me rack up 35 hours of play this weekend, and it’ll continue to call me back for future missions as well.</p><p>If you, too, have found that <em>Hitman</em> hasn’t been as stealthy as you wish it was, start changing the HUD settings and ramping up the difficulty; you’ll find a sneaking experience that might even make Big Boss sweat a little.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/hitman-woa-stealth-metal-gear-splinter-cell-freelancer-1851786255]]></content:encoded>
