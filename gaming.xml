			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-is-coming-to-pc-xbox-consoles-in-2026/">At Tokyo Game Show 2025</a>, Playground Games and Turn10 announced its next installment in its series of Forza games with Forza Horizon 6, which will be set in Japan and will arrive on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC sometime in 2026. Now that we know what the studios have lined up next, they confirmed the inevitable, though still disappointing news for players, that Forza Motorsport will no longer receive new content updates.</p>



<p>The news was buried in <a href="https://forza.net/news/forza-year-in-review-2025">a lengthy blog post on the official Forza website</a>, which provided a recap for the year with some community highlights and a look back at what was added to Forza Horizon 5 and Forza Motorsport.</p>



<p>Shifting to focus on Forza Horizon 6's development was the reason cited by the studios, writing, "<em>As our team shifts its focus toward delivering the best possible experience with Forza Horizon 6 in 2026, we do not plan to introduce new cars, tracks, features, or regular bug fixes for Forza Motorsport.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>However, we will continue supporting the game by keeping online servers active, hosting special events and competitions, and reintroducing previously released Featured Tours and reward cars on a monthly basis, until all content is available for you to enjoy anytime</em>."</p>



<p>At least players can still look forward to competitions in the new year and will get the chance to grab reward cars they may have missed the first time they came around. Forza Motorsport has always offered more of a simulation-based experience compared to a slightly more arcade-y feel in Forza Horizon, so it's good to know that servers and in-game events aren't going away for the foreseeable future.</p>



<p>In the meantime, Turn10 and Playground Games have to try and ensure they live up to the expectations players have for Forza Horizon 6 <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-blow-away-fans-open-world-japan/">and the expectations they're setting for themselves</a>. According to a recent rumour, we'll be able to see if Forza Horizon 6 hits its mark <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-targeting-h1-2026-launch-window-says-insider/">when it arrives sometime in the first half of 2026</a>.</p>

In addition, 1.6 million units of hardware were sold in the US in November, which is “the lowest total for a November month since 1995 (1.4 million).”</p><p>The rising costs of consoles probably didn’t help. The PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series of consoles both turned five in November, but customers looking to pick up one of the consoles brand new are having to grapple with higher prices following <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/762410/sony-ps5-price-hike-raise-digital-pro">price</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/782079/microsoft-xbox-console-price-increase-us">hikes</a> this year. Those hikes have led to an “all-time November high” for the average price paid for a new unit of video game hardware of $439, Circana says — a number that’s up 11 percent from 2024. (In November 2019, the average price was $235, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3ma6vnwvjmk2h">according to Circana analyst Mat Piscatella</a>.)</p><p>In November, the PlayStation 5 was the month’s best-selling hardware, “in both units and dollars,” which happened for the first time since the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2, according to Circana. The Switch 2 was 2nd in both units and dollars. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/844380/nex-playground-outselling-the-xbox">Nex Playground</a> was 3rd in terms of units sold, but the Xbox Series consoles ranked 3rd in dollars.</p><p><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> was the best-selling game of the month, but the <em>Call of Duty</em> franchise experienced “a double-digit percentage full game dollar sales decline when compared to November 2024.” Activision announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/841290/activision-call-of-duty-modern-warefare-black-ops-back-to-back">last week</a> that it would be switching up its <em>Call of Duty</em> release strategy to not release <em>Modern Warfare</em> or <em>Black Ops</em> games back-to-back anymore.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/846693/video-game-hardware-sales-november-2025-circana]]></content:encoded>

              <p>Every classic game deserves a wild Game Boy version. Roblox has to clean up its platform predator problem before it can get a Marvel collab. And a record-breaking Charizard sale has me thinking of every paper collectible I ever threw in the trash. Which presents am I currently buying my children that might one day be worth a small fortune? Or is the nostalgia-fueled millennial collectible market just another bubble everyone will forget about a decade from now?</p> <p>Welcome to the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture, which just broke its own record for the latest in the day it’s ever been published. Not quite as impressive as the Game Awards breaking its previous record for viewership with <a href="https://t.co/S6gFmiMa9w">over 170 million livestreams for this year’s show</a>, but who’s counting?</p>

 <h2>An incredible<em> Resident Evil</em> demake just resurfaced for the holidays</h2> <p>London-based studio HotGen’s journey to get a PS1 game playable on Game Boy Color was left incomplete, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/a-98-complete-version-of-the-cancelled-game-boy-color-resident-evil-port-has-been-shared-online/"><em>VGC</em> reports</a>. But preservationists <em>Games That Weren’t</em> has now shared what appears to be an almost entirely playable build of the fascinating curio from the turn of the century.</p>

 <p>“[We’ve] now preserved a final version of [the] game at the point of cancellation and we have it here for you today to check out thanks to Pete Frith providing everything,” the group <a href="https://twitter.com/fgasking/status/2001216784850927920?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2001216784850927920%7Ctwgr%5E8948a42e68905b40041ecb0f0d37a081003ca5cc%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkotaku.com%2Fwp%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost-new.php">announced on X today</a>. “Again, it isn’t 100% complete (perhaps now 98% – based on Pete’s estimates) – but there is more content and it *might* actually now be completable. Due to time constraints, we’ve not been able to sit and play through the title fully to confirm, as there might be scenes that glitch/bug out – if you find that it is, please do let us know!”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Our first big Christmas update is with an amazing recovery of the final build of Resident Evil on Gameboy Color. Hotgen's impressive conversion that got canned. This is much closer to completion, and seems completable too.

 <p>Meanwhile, a Roblox ban in countries like Russia has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/russian-ban-roblox-gaming-platform-sparks-rare-protest-2025-12-14/">provoked a rare outburst of protest</a>. Players there recently held up signs saying “Hands off Roblox” and “Roblox is the victim of the digital Iron Curtain.” Pissing off gamers is basically the 2025 equivalent of invading Russia during the winter.</p>

 <h2>A mint-condition Charizard card just sold for half a million at auction</h2> <p>The PSA 10 First Edition Base Set Charizard went for $550,000 including the buyer’s premium <a href="https://comics.ha.com/heritage-auctions-press-releases-and-news/-550-000-psa-10-charizard-breaks-record-leads-all-time-high-5.27-million-total-at-heritage-trading-card-games-auction.s?releaseId=5371">at a recent Heritage auction</a>. It breaks the <a href="https://www.dicebreaker.com/games/pokemon-trading-card-game/news/charizard-holo-shadowless-pokemon-card-auctioned">previous record</a> of $420,000 set back in 2022, though it’s still a pittance compared to the $5 million an Illustrator Pikachu <a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/content/article/The-20-Most-Expensive-Pok%C3%A9mon-Cards-Ever/4e15f8c9-b6eb-49c9-a5ee-3dc806693c3e/">once sold for</a>.</p>

You grab the IP because you believe the IP had something, but there’s no traces of the DNA of that IP in your game. That’s weird to me.”</p> <p>The new version includes co-op and a roguelike mode. It has less than 1,000 reviews on Steam and a middling rating of just 55 percent positive. “I didn’t play it,” Chmielarz said. “I played the beta when they had it, and I disagreed with every single thing they’ve done in it, and that’s it.”</p> <h2>Warner Bros. says no to Paramount</h2> <p>The company’s board of directors <a href="https://ir.wbd.com/news-and-events/financial-news/financial-news-details/2025/Warner-Bros--Discovery-Board-of-Directors-Unanimously-Recommends-Shareholders-Reject-Paramount-Tender-Offer/default.aspx">basically accused CEO David Ellison</a> of lying and saying he’s not good for the money. “Despite having been told repeatedly by WBD how important a full and unconditional financing commitment from the Ellison family was – and despite their own ample resources, as well as multiple assurances by PSKY during our strategic review process that such a commitment was forthcoming – the Ellison family has chosen not to backstop the PSKY offer,” it told investors.

            <title><![CDATA[First Fallout 5 Details Confirmed by Bethesda’s Todd Howard]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/bethesda-todd-howard-confirmed-fallout-5-details/</link>
            <guid>1386487</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Todd Howard, one of the head honchos at Bethesda Game Studios, has given up the first solid details we’ve ever gotten for Fallout 5. In a recent interview, the visionary developer confirmed that Fallout 5 <strong>will be impacted </strong>by the ongoing television series, which shares the same universe as the games.</p>



<p>It started with a Fallout 76 crossover, and it will eventually evolve into Fallout 5’s setting or story bleeding into what has happened, or is yet to happen, in the Prime-backed television show.</p>



<h2 id="h-huge-news-for-fallout-fans">Huge News for Fallout Fans</h2>



<p>In a recent interview with the BBC, Todd Howard sat down on his marketing spree to talk about the second season of Fallout, which debuted today. The second season is already proving to be a hit with fans and critics alike, scoring extremely well in early reviews.</p>



<p>The interview <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvgr488vlmmo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with the BBC</a> unveiled a juicy titbit that Fallout fans will go giddy over.</p>



<p>When asked if Fallout 5 will be impacted by the developing television series, Todd Howard simply said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In short, yes.</p>



<p>Fallout 5 will be existing in a world where the stories and events of the show happened or are happening.</p>



<p>We are taking that into account.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>That means you’ll need to watch the television show unravel with a keener eye, as what happens in the series might serve as a nod to what’s <strong>going to happen </strong>in Fallout 5.</p>



<p>It stands to reason that Fallout 5 will be set further in the future than any other game to date. That’s currently an accolade bestowed upon Fallout 4, which is set in 2287, while the television series starts in 2296.</p>



<p>Fans have theorized that Fallout 5 could very well be set around 2300, following the events that are set to unravel in the next few episodes of the Fallout television show, <strong>and beyond</strong>.</p>



<p>This would push Fallout into uncharted territory. History is already written, and in some ways, Bethesda Game Studios going back to the origin of it all with Fallout 76, which is set in 2102, was an error, as it meant some elements of the series’ lore had to be retconned.</p>



<p>With Fallout 5 being (potentially) set after the television series, or even in a parallel timeline, Bethesda has the opportunity to unleash some creative freedom and really push the boat out.</p>



<p>But if we’re being honest, it will most likely be another five years <strong>at least </strong>before we get our hands on anything serviceable in the Fallout 5 stakes.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-was-the-most-watched-tga-ever/</link>
            <guid>1386484</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Game Awards 2025 was a resounding success. In a post on social media, show organizer and host Geoff Keighly revealed that the 12th annual show was the most-watched The Game Awards in history.</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/2001381987278581942" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Keighly revealed</a> that there were more than 171 million global livestreams of the full show. That’s an 11% year-over-year increase from the 151 million <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2024-most-watched-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">livestreams in 2024</a>.</p>







<p>The total count only includes those who watched the full broadcast on the available platforms. It doesn’t include any shorts or clips on the various channels for The Game Awards, nor does it include any data from Prime Video.</p>



<p>Aside from Prime Video—which aired the show for the first time this year—The Game Awards 2025 was available on YouTube, Twitch, Steam, TikTok, Twitter, Kick, Facebook, and Instagram. As far as concurrent viewership goes, Streamcharts, per <a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/game-awards-2025-viewing-record-livestreams-worldwide-1236611146/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Variety</a>, have the pek number at 4.4 million, which is also higher than 2024’s 4 million total.</p>



<p>There were even 23,000 co-streams of the show on YouTube and Twitch. That’s up 50% compared to last year’s event.</p>







<p>Whether you enjoyed the reveals and the overall awards presentation or not, there’s no denying just how well the show performed and a viewership level. The show was carried by a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">number of major reveals</a>, including Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic. As far as the Awards themselves, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gamescom-2025-awards-all-award-winners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won in nearly every category</a> it was nominated for. The game even broke the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-broke-all-time-the-game-awards-record/">record for the most wins</a> in The Game Awards history with nine awards.</p>

                <p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/silent-hill-f/" data-ref-id="5000-574203">Silent Hill f</a> became the first game in the series to ditch the small American town that the series was named for in favor of setting it in Japan decades earlier. That approach may be used again for future titles in the franchise, according to developer Motoi Okamoto.</p><p>"We believe we could perhaps take similar approaches with other cultures across the globe," Okamoto told <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/silent-hill-interview-okamoto-konami-americas" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Inverse</a> through a translator. "For example, in Central or South America, we could perhaps tap into the more local, shamanistic beliefs and see how that ties in. But we could also try to expand our horizons and look into other regions, like possibly Russia, Italy, or South Korea, because all those areas have their own unique types of belief systems. I believe that will be a gateway for us to expand our concepts further."</p><p>Okamoto appears to have put the most thought into the Central and South American locations, which he said have "been affected by a lot of military governments and coups," before adding, "There is a type of bravado and 'machismo' that comes from these political landscapes. There’s also the more folkloric angle coming from shamanism and local beliefs."</p><p>However, Okamoto noted that Konami potentially partnering with a development studio in Central and South America for a Silent Hill game may be difficult because the region doesn't have many to choose from. But he didn't rule it out. </p><p>Okamoto recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-f-producer-explains-how-fan-art-and-memes-have-kept-it-trending/1100-6536592/" data-ref-id="1100-6536592">credited memes and fan art</a> for keeping Silent Hill f trending months after its release. An update for that game also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-f-update-adds-new-casual-difficulty-skip-feature-for-new-game-plus/1100-6536180/" data-ref-id="1100-6536180">added a new casual difficulty</a> and a skip feature for new game plus. Meanwhile, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/silent-hill-2/" data-ref-id="5000-574201">Silent Hill 2</a> remake appears to have been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-quietly-confirmed-for-xbox-series-x-s/1100-6536398/" data-ref-id="1100-6536398">quietly confirmed for Xbox Series X|S</a>. Microsoft and Konami have yet to announce a release for that port. </p>

<p>Let's play hide-and-seek!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>If you're looking for a little bit of lightness this holiday season for you and the kids, then hopefully you've been saving up a bunch of those <strong>It's Me, Mario!</strong> shorts. Nintendo has been sharing these on its family-friendly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@playnintendo">Play Nintendo YouTube Channel</a> since August 2025.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkVH3EaHbL4">Episode 5</a> dropped overnight and features Mario with Yoshi and Toad, who are playing a simple game of hide-and-seek. Mario must find both of his friends, who have found devious places to keep themselves out of the plumber's eyesight.</p>
<p>And look, we're extremely partial to stop-motion animation, but Yoshi and Toad look particularly adorable; we love the little Super Mario World nod with the trees and the fruit, and Toad is... well, Toad! He can hide in some pretty easy places in the Mushroom Kingdom.</p>
<p>All five shorts have some lovely little callbacks to the Mario series as a whole, so while the kids might delight in the lovely colours and animations, parents (or grandparents, or uncles, aunts — whoever!) can get all nostalgic. You can see all five currently released episodes in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLngvvr1C2bLGRo0H8Lwl33utYqofaMDT3">this playlist</a>.</p>
<p>The It's Me, Mario! shorts are actually designed to promote the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/gallery-nintendo-updates-its-my-mario-product-line-with-multiple-new-yoshi-items-heres-a-look"><strong>My Mario</strong> range of toys for young children</a>, which were <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/gallery-nintendo-shows-off-its-new-my-mario-product-line">released in Japan back in August this year</a>. A selection of these are coming to the US in 2026.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-cold-snap-update-blueprint-drop-rate-2000654257</link>
            <guid>1386454</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Extraction shooter and recent Game Awards winner </span><i><span>Arc Raiders </span></i><span>just dropped a massive, winter-themed update. Cold Snap, as it’s called, adds a map condition that can cause frostbite, a timed event that lets players earn rewards (including Raider Tokens), a Candleberry Banquet project that also offers up some currency and cosmetics, and, apparently, way more generous </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-blueprint-locations-night-raid-map-2000650966"><span>blueprint drops</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>A </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1pom4pm/keep_the_blueprint_drop_rate/"><span>popular post on the official </span><i><span>Arc Raiders </span></i><span>subreddit</span></a><span> titled “Keep the blueprint drop rate” argues for developer Embark Studios to make the alleged changes to said drop rate permanent. “</span><span>Instead of sitting on gear and going with free loadouts, this incentivizes players to use loadouts with safe pockets and get some skin in the game,” the post reads. “What this game needs is to better incentivize bold play.”&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>In </span><i><span>Arc Raiders</span></i><span>, you have the option to venture up to the dangerous surface with either a free loadout of random, low-tier loot that you won’t mind losing if you get jumped by another player or zapped by a Hornet, or a custom loadout that often includes a safe pocket, in which you can store one precious item in case you die aboveground or fail to extract. The benefit of the custom loadout is that you’re guaranteed to leave with </span><i><span>something</span></i><span>, so long as you put it in your safe pocket, but the downside is that you run the risk of losing an upgraded gun or a higher-quality shield.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Many </span><i><span>Arc Raiders</span></i><span> players prefer to play conservatively, avoiding conflict with enemy squads at all costs. I can understand this, as I often run around the game with proximity chat on, yelling, “I’m doing a quest, please leave me alone!” But if there’s an elusive blueprint tucked away in my backpack, I can feel my trigger finger itching—this might mean that the next few weeks of </span><i><span>Arc Raiders</span></i><span> gameplay are more ruthless than ever before…</span></p>

 <p><span>I played a bit yesterday after the Cold Snap update and got three blueprints over the course of a few matches, which is definitely more than I’ve seen before. In one match, I was in a pure panic trying to get to an elevator with a shiny new gun, several stacks of Candleberries (which are found outside in the cold), and </span><i><span>two</span></i><span> blueprints, all while frostbite steadily depleted my health and a damn Wasp flitted overhead. I made it out, knuckles whiter than the layer of snow covering my backpack.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>When asked if the blueprint drop was adjusted, a spokesperson for </span><i><span>Arc Raiders</span></i><span> pointed me to two bullet points in the </span><a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/cold-snap-patch-notes"><span>most recent patch notes</span></a><span>:</span></p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><span>Increased some item and blueprint spawn rates in Stella Montis.</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Expanded blueprint spawn locations to improve availability in areas that were underrepresented.</span></li> </ul> <p><span>It’s not clear if this change is intended to be permanent, but of course Embark Studios may adjust the blueprint drop if it finds it’s become </span><i><span>too</span></i><span> easy to grab them. After all, avarice is a sin, and the greed on display by </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1po80ca/yeah_so_they_have_changed_the_blueprint_droprate/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>this player with 15 blueprints in their backpack </span></a><span>sickens me.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>For now, there are more blueprints out there. Go forth and be merry, Raiders. Please don’t shoot.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/everything-you-need-to-know-animal-crossing-kappn-update-switch-2-2000654252</link>
            <guid>1386451</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</span></i><span> hasn’t received a major update since 2021, and Nintendo previously showed no interest in continuing development on the five-year-old game. It was a huge surprise when Nintendo, in October, announced that </span><i><span>Animal Crossing: New Horizons </span></i><span>would get not only a Nintendo Switch 2 edition, but a 3.0 content update, too. On Oct. 30, Nintendo dropped </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch-2-edition-update-free-2000640118"><span>a 12-minute video breaking down the new details</span></a><span> and gave press an early, hands-off look earlier in December.</span></p> <p><span>Nintendo previewed the update in a 25-minute demo </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/animal-crossing-new-horizons-30-first-impressions-of-the-switch-2-version"><span>covered by </span><i><span>IGN</span></i></a><span>, which said the update is largely focused on design and decor and Nintendo Switch 2 quality-of-life improvements. Here’s what we know so far.</span></p> <h2><strong>When’s it coming out?</strong></h2> <p><i><span>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</span></i><span>‘ 3.0 update and Nintendo Switch 2 edition will be released on Jan. 15, 2026. The Nintendo Switch 2 Edition costs $64.99 on its own, or $4.99 for people who already own the game on Nintendo Switch. All players will get the 3.0 update content for no additional cost.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000654254" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000654254"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000654254">Image: Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <h2><strong>What’s new in the Switch 2 version?</strong></h2> <p><i><span>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</span></i><span> on the Nintendo Switch 2 will benefit from the console’s mouse controls, which will make placing decor a bit less fiddly. And that makes sense, paired with a content update that’s largely centered on decor. Using the Joy-Con 2s as a mouse makes clicking and dragging stuff around the map much simpler.</span></p>

 <p><span>IGN said the </span><i><span>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</span></i><span> Switch 2 edition also has an exclusive device—a megaphone. It’s used to call out to villagers and other visiting characters so they’re easier to find. To do so, you literally have to say a character’s name into the Switch 2 microphone, </span><a href="https://www.polygon.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-updates-preview/"><span>according to </span><i><span>Polygon</span></i></a><span>. However, the megaphone can only be used for characters that are outside of buildings—ones that would actually “hear” you—so it isn’t as useful for anyone inside a structure, </span><i><span>IGN</span></i><span> said.</span></p>

 <p><span>One initial draw is the upgraded multiplayer; up to 12 people can congregate on an island. But </span><i><span>IGN</span></i><span> reported that this feature requires everyone to be on a Switch 2. Plus, the edition makes use of the new camera system to display a player’s face near their character.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000654253" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000654253"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000654253">Image: Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <h2><strong>How about the 3.0 content update?</strong></h2> <p><span>The big addition in </span><i><span>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</span></i><span>‘ 3.0 update is the Kapp’n family’s hotel—your </span><i><span>Animal Crossing</span></i><span> island is now a destination not only for your friends, but visiting </span><i><span>Animal Crossing</span></i><span> characters. Leilani, Kapp’n’s wife, runs the hotel and gives you the opportunity to decorate up to 10 rooms, per </span><i><span>Polygon</span></i><span>. </span><i><span>IGN </span></i><span>said it’s something to be unlocked, but it’s tied to the pier—not optional or moveable. It’s similar to the </span><i><span>Happy Home Paradise</span></i><span> DLC, IGN said, in which you’ll decorate rooms, just by theme and not to a specific character’s interests.</span></p>

 <h3><span>Designing hotel rooms</span></h3> <p><i><span>IGN </span></i><span>said that you’ll be able to design around themes—like, say, seaside—but don’t have to. You’ll be able to choose from different items, but aren’t required to use anything in particular, unlike in </span><i><span>Happy Home Paradise</span></i><span>. You’ll have your full catalog of items to use, as well as items related to the specific theme.</span></p>

 <h3><span>Hotel shopping and new items</span></h3> <p><span>You earn hotel tickets by designing rooms, and then use the tickets to earn more things from a hotel-specific shop manned by Gran. </span><i><span>Polygon</span></i><span> said that a number of new items were left out of the preview, but that it’s a “very large amount of furniture.” There are new Nintendo-themed items, too, like the Ultra Hand and different NES games playable on classic consoles purchasable from the hotel lobby shop. (These need a Nintendo Switch Online subscription to play.)</span></p> <p><span>Other new items include </span><i><span>Splatoon</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Lego</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>The Legend of Zelda</span></i><span> stuff.</span></p> <h3><span>Crafting tweaks</span></h3> <p><span>One of the quality-of-life adjustments in the 3.0 content update is the ability to craft several items at once, using materials from storage instead of inside a player’s pockets, Nintendo announced during its October preview. Simply put, crafting could be a pain in the ass before; this should help, especially when you’ve got a lot to make.</span></p> <p><span>With so much new design and decor content, easing the pain of crafting a lot of stuff feels essential to the experience. Making things easier once again, there’s also a Resetti “reset” service to quickly clear a part of your island.</span></p> <h3><span>Slumber Island</span></h3> <p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/845242/animal-crossing-new-horizons-3-0-update-switch-2-edition-features"><i><span>The Verge</span></i></a><span> described the Slumber Island feature, seen in the December preview, as “extra sandboxes” to decorate and play in. You’ll be able to set the time of day and weather to create whatever vibe you’re into—without messing about on your permanent island. </span><i><span>The Verge</span></i><span> said it looked like a “quicker and smoother” way to dream up a design and build it all out: Items from your in-game catalog appear immediately, and terraforming has a little quality-of-life improvement, it seems, to help make the process less painful. Plus, Lloyd can build bridges and inclines immediately, according to </span><i><span>The Verge</span></i><span>. No waiting around.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Physical Video Game and Hardware Sales In November In the US Were The Worst They’ve Been Since November 1995]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/physical-video-game-sales-hardware-sales-november-2025-lowest-in-the-us-since-november-1995/</link>
            <guid>1386439</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>December might be home to Christmas, Boxing Day, and the rush to buy presents for loved ones for a significant portion of the world, but November is no slouch, particularly because of Black Friday. This year, however, November was not a booming and bustling month for game sales in the US, at least for physical game sales and hardware sales, according to the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3ma6t4juhvs2w">latest Circana report from executive director Mat Piscatella</a>.</p>



<p>In fact, physical game sales and hardware sales were the lowest they've been in the US since November 1995, as total spending across video games, hardware, and accessories came in at $5.9 billion, a 4% drop compared to November 2024.</p>



<p>Hardware spending specifically dropped to $695 million, a 27% drop compared to last year. November 2025 is now the second-lowest spending total for video game hardware in the US since November 2005, when the total spend on hardware was $455 million.</p>



<p>The number of hardware units was also down to 1.6 million for the month, with the only lower unit total coming from November 1995, when 1.4 million hardware units were sold. When it comes to specific consoles, sales for <strong>Xbox Series X/S consoles are down 70%</strong> compared to November 2024. <strong>PlayStation 5 console sales were down 40%</strong>, while Nintendo Switch console sales were down 10%, and that's even including the fact that the Switch 2 is now available.</p>



<p>Spending on accessories also fell to $327 million, a 13% drop compared to November 2024, with spending on controllers specifically dropping 19% compared to last year. Content, which encapsulates actual video game sales, DLC, etc., was the only area that actually went up compared to November 2024, with a 1% growth overall.</p>



<p>That said, physical game sales were down 14% compared to last year, another "<em>all-time low for a November month since tracking began in 1995</em>," Piscatella wrote.</p>







<p>So, what happened to make video game spending drop so much with regard to hardware, accessories, and physical video game sales? Well, according to Piscatella in a statement given to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/video-game-physical-software-and-hardware-sales-just-had-the-worst-november-in-the-us-since-1995">IGN</a>, it's the fact that the cost of everything, including video games, has skyrocketed in recent years, <a href="https://wccftech.com/okay-dont-panic-but-hdd-prices-are-rising-faster-than-they-have-in-years/">and with rising RAM prices</a>, things don't look good for the future.</p>



<p>"<em>Retail spending had been holding up relatively well until now, despite the pressure from higher prices we've been seeing in the market. More affluent consumers have kept on spending so far, which has made up for some of the declines in spending from the less affluent portions of the market. Perhaps this is a sign that those higher prices are beginning to impact purchases of pricier items, like consoles. Perhaps not.</em></p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>However, if the crunch on RAM pricing continues, if we see rising prices on consoles and gaming PCs over the coming months it could, theoretically, be potentially devastating to the dedicated gaming device market. Which would, of course, have potential carryover effects on the content side. I certainly see some of the relationships between hardware unit sales and pricing we're seeing in the November results as a red flag.</em>"</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tariffs-rising-costs-us-consumers-spending-less-video-games/">Piscatella gave a presentation at Summer Game Fest</a>, where he outlined how the rising cost of essentials in the US would likely impact video game market sales, because consumers would simply have less money to spend on video games when they're worried about paying rent and buying food.</p>



<p>Now, as Piscatella points out, it's not just the rising price of essentials that people need to live on that is driving down video game spending, but the cost of the games and the hardware themselves. In November 2019, the average cost of a console was $239. Now, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-ps5-pro-price-increases-us-tomorrow/">as console prices have risen</a>, not dropped, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-x-s-prices-will-reportedly-go-up-again-in-us-microsoft/">since the new generation launched</a>, even for<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-us-price-changes-nintendo-switch-2/"> what is now officially previous-gen consoles</a>, the average price for a console in the US is $439.  </p>



<p>It's still too early to tell if this is a one-off bad month or if this is the beginning of a growing trend. We won't know how the December 2025 numbers look until January 2026. That said, these numbers aren't exactly inspiring, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-is-now-rumored-to-reduce-the-production-of-rtx-50-gpus/">as memory shortages continue to turn the entire tech industry upside down</a>, it doesn't look like prices will stabilize anytime soon. Unless everyone starts getting paid more, the majority of consumers will continue to be priced out of buying the latest tech, in video games or elsewhere.</p>



<p>Lastly, an update on the best-selling games of 2025 in the US, a figure that we've been tracking most of the year. <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-pokemon-legends-z-a-tops-us-sales-charts-october-2025/">For October 2025, it was Battlefield 6 that stood at the top</a> of both the monthly charts and the year-to-date charts. </p>



<p>While Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 was the best-selling game in the US for November 2025, it doesn't even crack the top five for the year-to-date premium game sales charts, with Battlefield 6 still atop that list. Battlefield 6 was also the second-best-selling game for the month of November 2025, a clear sign that it has not slowed down its sales momentum in the US.</p>







<p>It's still early to call it, but perhaps Battlefield 6, not Call of Duty, will be the best-selling first-person shooter in the US at the end of 2025. We'll find out next year.</p>

The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

<p>The Direct will be a late one for UK and European folks, with the stream kicking off on <strong>23rd December 2025 at 1am GMT / 2am ET</strong> — that's <strong>22nd December at 5pm PT / 8pm ET</strong> for those in North America. It'll be available on both <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SEGA_West">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/sega">Twitch</a>.</p>
<p>As for what to expect, well, it's a deep dive — that's basically all we know! "This Direct will dive into new features, experiences, and gameplay from the upcoming two-in-one title" Sega says. So expect a little bit of everything.</p>
<p>We wonder whether we'll get any hints as to what this enhanced version of the 2009 PS3 title means for the future of the series RGG Studio director Yokoyama Masayoshi <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/yakuza-kiwami-3-is-more-than-just-a-remake-and-it-contains-major-hints-for-series-future">teased this himself a few weeks ago</a>.</p>
<p>So, tune in next week to find out what to expect from Kiryu's third (fourth?) chapter.</p>

Each character has the following 'Virtues' that have an assigned dice.&nbsp;</p><picture>

  </picture><p>The virtues are as follows:</p><ul><li>Charm (Rapport, Persuasion, Small Talk)</li><li>Warmth (Empathy, Connection, compassion)</li><li>Creativity (Wonder, innovation, artistry)</li><li>Awareness</li><li>Resilliance</li><li>Determination</li></ul><p>The mutations that each of the characters contribute to their specialization or mutation. Specializations are areas of expertise or heightened skill, while Mutations are 'functional apocalyptic mutations' that give a mechanical bonus such as additional damage, resistances, etc. A character is able to be more specialized by reducing the dice that they use for a particular skill.</p><p>Players can also be working on pet projects for the betterment of the community, that will also provide a mechanical benefit to the player.</p><picture>

  </picture><p><em>Dimension 20: Gladlands</em> is a mix of classic post-apocalyptic fiction like <em>Mad Max</em> and <em>Fallout,</em> where the party is made up of survivors of the wastelands. Some characters have quite human forms like the plague-doctor meets camp counsellor character of Michaelis, while others like Behpoornia's ant-headed human show that some level of radiation and mutation has also taken over the lands.</p><blockquote><p>In the before times, when water was plentiful and the high buildings towered over endless green adn growing gardens, they got so bored and angry that they blew up the world!</p></blockquote><p>The twist on the post-apocalypse comes from every character being incredibly nice and wholesome to one another. Instead of characters being out for themselves there's lots of talk of helping out one another and working together positively.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2><em>Dimension 20: Gladlands</em> Hidden Mechanic</h2><p>As with many Dimension 20 seasons it seems that there's more going on mechanically behind the good nature of the characters. Each player is set up with a gauge at their seat, similar to a pressure gauge we see the numbers 0-3 in green, 3-6 in yellow, 6-8 in orange, before a break in the color, and 8-10 in red. At different points in the trailer we see these gauges going up and down too.</p><p>Brennan Lee Mulligan sits with a larger gauge in front of him. When Vic's character is introduced in the trailer they start by saying "We started at a 10 [...] let's just take it down a second" and the shot quickly moves to Mulligan looking to have adjusted his meter down from 10 to a 7 or 8.</p><p>Dimension 20: Gladlands will take place over the course of six-episodes beginning on January 7th. The day after each episode releases there will also be an in-dome Adventuring Party where the players will all discuss the events of the episode.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

              <p><span>We here at </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span> have…complicated, multifaceted feelings on Mega Starmie. The Mega Evolved starfish started out being seen as one of the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-starmie-patrick-star-jokes-2000636057"><span>silliest new transformations</span></a><span> in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a><span>, then turned out to be </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-starmie-jokes-memes-videos-art-2000638556"><span>one of the MVPs of the RPG</span></a><span>. Despite all the endearment I feel toward Mega Starmie and its weird long legs and arms now, seeing the thing in the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>anime series has reawakened my innermost disgust reflex. I have many questions about this creature, but as far as the show goes, one comes to the forefront: Why does it look like Mega Starmie has been oiled up?</span></p> <p><span>The latest episode of </span><i><span>Pokémon Horizons</span></i><span>, titled “The Catcher in the Sky,” premiered in Japan last week, and in it, one the new series’ main characters, Friede, was revealed to have captured a Starmie that is capable of undergoing Mega Evolution. When the starfish is in this state, it stands as tall as its trainer and moves its arms and legs in a very uncomfortably human-like manner. Friede seems to be hamming up the human characteristics of Mega Starmie by calling it “Instructor Starmie,” though it’s unclear just what instructing it’s supposed to be doing.</span></p>

 <p><span>Anyway, the creature is shiny, as if Friede oiled it up before he reunited with the rest of the cast, and </span><i><span>Horizons</span></i><span> does a great job of exaggerating its animations to make it unnerving. Put it all together, and you’ve got a Pokémon that is just awful to look at. Way to go, team. You nailed it.</span></p>   <p><span>I haven’t been keeping current with </span><i><span>Horizons</span></i><span>, but I </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-horizons-anime-netflix-liko-roy-captain-pikachu-1851326504"><span>really enjoyed what I saw of the show when it made its English debut</span></a><span>. The series’ storylines have more of an arc compared to those in the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-anime-ash-ketchum-pikachu-final-episode-netflix-1850805389"><span>previous series</span></a><span> which was led by Ash Ketchum and kind of written for the series to have no real end goal and for episodes to stand alone. It seems like </span><i><span>Horizons </span></i><span>has been sticking with that storytelling approach as it enters its third season. The episodes that have been dubbed in English are streaming on Netflix.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Pendleton Ward, the creator of a little show you might’ve heard of called <em>Adventure Time</em>, worked on a new Adult Swim animated special called <a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-elephant-adult-swim-review-cartoon-network-2000698360?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>The Elephant</u></em></a>. He didn’t make it alone—Ward teamed up with longtime friends and Cartoon Network alumni Rebecca Sugar (<em>Steven Universe</em>), Patrick McHale (<em>Over the Garden Wall</em>), and Ian Jones-Quartey (<em>OK K.O.! Let’s Be Heroes</em>). The show, which saw the Avengers’ line-up of cartoon legends craft something without knowing what each other would contribute, gave Ward the jitters over whether their collective, experimental tale would coalesce into something worthwhile. What frightens Ward the most, though, is his thoughts about AI and how it may leave the animation industry as we know it as a hollow, not-so-exquisite corpse.&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tli7vrSE28Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="The Elephant | OFFICIAL TRAILER | adult swim"></iframe></figure><p>Over the course of his career, Ward has built a strong body of work as both a creator who shaped a formative part of an entire generation’s childhood and a champion of animation itself. Through <em>Adventure Time </em>alone, <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/HdUKAvl4jGE?si=g5VrH57PzmuAq0dK&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>creatives like Sugar</u></a> got a rocket strapped to their back, launching them into their own career, all while carrying the flame of crafting bold shows of their own that spoke to adults and kids. The gravitational pull of <em>Adventure Time</em>’s elevated arthouse approach to animation—often serving as a cultural bridge, exposing Western audiences to international talent like former Science Saru creative <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoT3h7c6tLY&amp;pp=ygUcbWFzYWFraSB5dWFzYSBhZHZlbnR1cmUgdGltZdIHCQk8CgGHKiGM7w%3D%3D&amp;ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">Masaaki Yuasa</a>—embraced creative freedom without hesitation. Ward can easily be credited as one of the bricklayers of this era of highly creative animation, which <em>The Elephant</em> harkens back to. It’s an era that feels on the precipice of dwindling, piece by piece, under the guise of AI as the supposed end-all, be-all of artistic innovation.&nbsp;</p><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/queer-cartoons-elon-musk-libsoftiktok-dogs-in-space-netflix/"><div><p>The Rise And Fall of Queer Cartoons</p><p>Long before LibsofTikTok and Elon Musk called on parents to cancel Netflix, cartoons were already on the tail end of their queer renaissance.</p><p><span>Gareth Watkins</span></p></div></a></figure><p>After reviewing <em>The Elephant</em>, I walked away with the stark feeling that the special emphatically reached out from beyond my screen, cupped my face, and said, “fuck AI.” When I asked him if that was at all the intent, Ward reminded me that the collaboration was a bit of a misnomer, since he and his peeps couldn’t communicate about what they were contributing to the special’s three acts, not knowing how the whole thing would come together, but trusting that it would be fun.&nbsp;</p><p>“What you’re describing is the magic of this piece of art. That there is a meaning [that] emerged from our blind connection of pieces. But in the beginning, all I knew was that I could only get close to feelings of things and not anything too specific,” Ward told me. “‘Cause if you get too specific, you’re creating a wall that may not be passable.”</p><p>When I raised the elephant in the room—AI’s looming role in the industry—Ward characterized the magic of <em>The Elephant</em>’s existence as a very cool “last squirt of human creativity.”</p><p>“It’s gonna be weird. I think people are gonna like AI, though,” Ward told me. “It’s gonna be heinous in many, many ways, and it’s gonna destroy the industry—but I think people are gonna like it, ultimately.”</p><figure><figcaption><span>Adult Swim</span></figcaption></figure><p>Whenever Ward thought about the state of the art in the rise of AI, iron bars came to mind, he said. Ward clarified that&nbsp; it was less about prison and more about the lost appreciation of artistry in our day-to-day lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“People used to craft everything. Now, when we look at drywall or something, it means nothing to us. Walls used to be crafted. I think about shaping iron bars. Now, when you walk by those things, they mean nothing because they’ve been industrially manufactured along the factory line,” Ward said. “I feel like that’s going to happen to art at some point, where art’s gonna be this thing that you barely have any appreciation for because it’s all just been generated by machines that have no feelings.”</p><p>While there will still be artists, Ward fears it’ll become a niche hobby, with artists reduced to people who whittle wood, making small things that take hours to make.&nbsp;</p><p>“It’ll have value in that way, the way that all original works still have value. But it’ll just become a smaller and smaller group of people doing it for a living ‘cause you won’t be able to make money,” he said.&nbsp;</p><p>With major animation companies like Disney playing both sides—<a href="https://gizmodo.com/google-has-taken-down-ai-generated-content-following-disneys-cease-and-desist-2000698254?ref=aftermath.site"><u>pearl clutching over protections against AI</u></a> while <a href="https://gizmodo.com/disney-openai-sora-deal-slop-2000698409?ref=aftermath.site"><u>partnering with OpenAI for profit</u></a>—Ward and his motley crew of animators are living through a time when the integrity of their craft is under constant threat. Sure, there’ll always be an animation industry, like there’ll always be journalism. But if you want to break through and be a part of it, you’re gonna have to be okay with being poor and deal with <a href="https://aftermath.site/ai-journalism-microsoft/"><u>AI debasing your craft</u></a> and calling it progress.&nbsp;</p><p>Ward sees an inkling of a silver lining in AI—at the very least—creating new jobs for humans willing to work there. But he can’t help noticing how broken a future is where artists push their creativity beyond its limits while still trying to sell commercial art, created in a way that is generic enough for people to relate to, only to have that blow up in their face.</p><p>“If we're just hired to push the boundaries of art so that AI can eat up all of our ideas and spit them out in different ways, those jobs will become like incredibly creative jobs, because we'll be needing to push the limits of all styles to feed the AI beast and give it more imagination,” he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Notice how the left lacks all the soul and whimsical charm that makes the right one so pleasing to look at </p><p>AI can copy movements but art comes from the human heart <a href="https://t.co/MlXmyFXKY7?ref=aftermath.site">https://t.co/MlXmyFXKY7</a></p></div>— ☝️💥 (@krystalmelodie) <a href="https://twitter.com/krystalmelodie/status/1999957712449437873?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">December 13, 2025</a></blockquote>
</figure><p>Despite <em>The Elephant</em> embodying the spirit of a work that’s preserving the soul of animation where human creativity served as the bedrock of its bold and frightening existence, Ward couldn’t help but stifle a laugh when I bluntly asked him if he thought we were cooked. His response, while dour, was brutally honest.&nbsp;</p><p>“Kudos to Adult Swim for making cool stuff and having cool choices like making <em>The Elephant</em>. But yeah, we’re cooked,” Ward said. “AI will be implemented at some point because it saves studios money. It just has to happen at some point, and it just keeps getting better. Time’s a changing.”</p>

            <title><![CDATA[‘Larian Said They Were Doing Something Absolutely Everyone Is Doing and Got an Insanely Crazy Sh*tstorm’ – KCD 2 Dev Talks ‘AI Hysteria’]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Larian's admission that they are using generative AI in specific tasks (concept art, placeholder text, and PowerPoint presentations) while making the <a href="https://wccftech.com/divinity-is-a-turn-based-rpg-will-be-way-better-than-baldurs-gate-3-says-larian/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new Divinity game</a> turned into <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-ceo-responds-backlash-over-genai-use-divinity-baldurs-gate-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a massive controversy</a>, between the backlash of many fans who swear they won't touch their games unless they backtrack and the studio's own rebuttal and clarification that no AI-made content will reach the final game and no human will lose their job because of it.</p>



<p>Now, the founder and creative director of a fellow RPG developer, Daniel Vávra of Warhorse (the makers of Kingdom Come: Deliverance), has <a href="https://x.com/DanielVavra/status/2001335767499669728" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared his own thoughts on the topic</a>. Vávra is not one to mince words (see <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-director-criticized-the-outer-worlds-2-obsidian-hasnt-innovated-since-fallout-new-vegas/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">his recent open criticism of Obsidian for The Outer Worlds 2</a>), and he went all-out in this case, stating that Larian has just voiced what literally every developer is doing and adding that AI is, at this point, a reality we can't really come back from, despite a hysteria that he likened to people 'smashing steam engines' back at the time of the industrial revolution.</p>



<p><em>This AI hysteria is the same as when people were smashing steam engines in the 19th century. Larian said they were doing something that absolutely everyone else is doing and got an insanely crazy sh*tstorm. I've even seen someone accuse us of using AI in KCD2. I don't know anything about it, except that I used Topaz Labs to upscale some of the AI elements from KCD1 and some of the old low-res textures.</em> <em>I'm no fan of AI generated art, but anyway, it's time to face reality. AI is here to stay with us. As frightening as it may be, that's the way it is.</em></p>



<p>Vávra then went on to say that he hates how long it takes, not to mention how many people and how much money are needed, to make videogames nowadays. </p>



<p><em>If AI can help me make an epic game in a year with a smaller team like in the old days, I'm all for it. That game will still have an art director, writers, programmers, graphic designers, but they won't have to do the tiresome and boring tasks, they'll have to focus on the essentials. I have ideas for lots of games, but I'm fifty years old and so far it's taken me seven years on average to make one game. If AI helps me realize those ideas faster, I'm all for it.</em></p>



<p>This is essentially what Larian and <a href="https://wccftech.com/ai-can-speed-up-game-development-human-intention-is-what-makes-our-stuff-special/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other developers</a> want to use it for. The gaming industry faces a significant challenge with rising budgets and increasingly long development timeframes, and the only viable solution is to smartly apply AI-powered tools where possible to reduce time spent on tedious, repetitive tasks. There is another potential course of action, of course: to greatly reduce either scope, quality, or both. For obvious reasons, none of the developers or publishers believe this would be a winning formula.</p>



<p>In his lengthy X post, the Game Director of Kingdom Come: Deliverance also mentioned other potential use cases of generative AI in gaming, such as RPGs allowing players to ask certain NPCs anything (like in <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-mod-adds-inworld-generative-ai-for-immersive-dialogues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that Skyrim mod powered by Inworld AI technology</a>) within the context of that game world. Moreover, he notes that soon AI will do the programming in games, with software architects overseeing that work, and 'resisting this is probably as meaningful as resisting the use of sewing machines in the textile industry.'</p>



<p>Vávra concludes noting that AI may well ultimately bring about the demise of humanity as foreseen in Terminator, but it could also mean that virtually 'anyone, at a fraction of the current cost, will be able to implement virtually any grand idea. Making a game will be as easy as writing a book.' Either way, he says, there's no stopping it.</p>



<p>Needless to say, this is the hottest topic not only in gaming but across most industries. Larian's reveal only served to bring it to the forefront of discussion, given their status as a revered developer after Baldur's Gate 3 (though a new attack on the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-writers-call-out-larian-studios-for-poor-hiring-practices-amidst-genai-backlash/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just came in from several writers who criticized their hiring practices</a>).

<p>It makes sense for Activision and Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 to capitalize on the Fallout Season 2 Amazon launch, and Black Ops 7 Season 1 Reloaded will see the two massive franchises collide.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-season-2-rotten-tomatoes-score-season-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout Season 2’s Rotten Tomatoes score is higher than Season 1</a>. The brand is hot stuff once again, and this comes hot off the heels of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-4-patch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new Fallout updates</a>. So, why not bring Call of Duty and Fallout together to deliver an epic crossover in Black Ops 7 Season 1 Reloaded?</p>



<p> That’s precisely what’s happening.</p>







<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-season-1-reloaded-welcomes-fallout-to-its-lands">Black Ops 7 Season 1 Reloaded Welcomes Fallout To Its Lands</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Return. Image via Prime Video</figcaption></figure>



<p>The official Call of Duty X channel announced the Fallout crossover and gave everyone a clear timeframe on when to expect it—Season 1 Reloaded.</p>







<p>Black Ops 7 carries on where previous CoD titles have left off by offering new seasonal updates every few weeks. Slapped in the middle of this is a ‘Reloaded’ update, offering new maps, modes, and guns, and sometimes special crossovers and events.</p>



<p>We know that Fallout has eyed up a primetime spot during this period, per the social media message:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Okie dokie – stay focused, stay alive. @FalloutonPrime is coming to Call of Duty in Season 01 Reloaded.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>There was a lot of talk before BLOPS 7 launched about the nature of unrealistic skins. It was revealed back in August that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-content-will-no-longer-carry-forward-into-black-ops-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6 content would not carry forward into Black Ops 7</a>. But Activision has never ruled out crossovers with brands.</p>



<p>Certain <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-skin-collabs-were-cancelled-after-player-feedback/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7 skin collabs were cancelled after player feedback</a>, but Treyarch senior director of production, Yale Miller, has previously stated that the game will have “Grounded” skins that “Make sense for Black Ops 7.</p>



<p>It’s not explicitly confirmed that the crossover includes Fallout skins, but it’s a logical assumption.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/game-writers-call-out-larian-studios-for-poor-hiring-practices-amidst-genai-backlash/</link>
            <guid>1386325</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>When Larian Studios <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-announces-divinity-the-game-awards-2025/">announced Divinity</a> at <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/">The Game Awards 2025</a>, players couldn't be more excited for the studio that brought them Baldur's Gate 3 to return to the other fantasy RPG series under its belt, which is actually bigger than Baldur's Gate. Days later, Larian is embroiled in controversy after its chief executive officer, Swen Vincke, admitted that the studio uses generative AI technology in its development pipeline.</p>



<p>Vincke has already <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-ceo-responds-backlash-over-genai-use-divinity-baldurs-gate-3/">responded to the first wave of backlash that has hit him and the studio with criticism</a> for using GenAI, though the blunt nature of his response has done anything but quell the backlash he and the studio have received. Amidst all of this, game writers and narrative designers have popped up online to speak out against Larian, not just for its GenAI use, but for what they find to be poor hiring practices.</p>



<p>It's common across several industries that when applying for a job, besides submitting a resume and being the subject of potentially multiple rounds of interviews, you'll be asked to perform a test to show your prospective employer your work on something they've assigned you. If you're a writer applying to a writing position at a game studio, you should probably expect a writing test at some point in the interview process.</p>



<p>But writing tests as a practice are themselves a point of controversy, because writers are sometimes asked to do these tests for free. Usually, if you're being asked to do a writing test for a studio, it's because you're one of the few finalists for a potential role, so it's common for studios to pay those few writers for their time to submit the test. Yes, these people are applying for a job, but no one likes to work for free. Larian, however, according to writers like Zoë Quinn, a game writer who most recently was the lead writer on <a href="https://wccftech.com/alien-rogue-incursion-part-one-evolved-edition-launch-trailer-xbox-series-x-s-release/">Alien: Rogue Incursion</a>, does not offer to pay writers for writing tests.</p>







<p>Quinn spoke out about their experience being recruited by Larian, an avenue they ultimately turned down due to Larian Studios' disallowing remote work and asking for an unpaid writing test that Quinn would also have to make playable.</p>







<p>Bruno Dias, a game writer who has worked on titles like<a href="https://wccftech.com/pathologic-2-out-may-23rd-pc/"> Pathologic 2</a>, Neo Cab, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-london-mod-gets-new-rabbit-and-pork-dlc/">Fallout: London</a> chimed in to add "<em>Larian's horrible hiring process is an open secret int he industry - insane amounts of unpaid work in 'writing tests,' excessive numbers of interviews, months and months of back and forth, etc. Everyone in games narrative circles has heard the stories at this point, probably from multiple people</em>."</p>







<p>Julie Muncy, a writer on Interstate 35, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/julie.radiantarray.io/post/3ma4wbovt3s2p">added</a>, <em>"If you see narrative people being meaner about larian than it sounds like they deserve, trust me, we've been waiting for this one</em>," <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/julie.radiantarray.io/post/3ma4xg5lazc2p">and</a> "<em>the thing about larian is that i think a lot of us were biting our tongues out of respect for the writers working there and the stuff they did make. but if larian doesn't respect those either, then, like, that incentive disappears</em>."</p>



<p>Cat Manning, a narrative designer at Firaxis, also through their voice to the fire, hinting at a "<em>throughline</em>" between Larian Studios use of generative AI and a misunderstanding of proper hiring practices when it comes to unpaid writing tests.</p>







<p>Other writers, like <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/babelfishwars.bsky.social/post/3ma4s6kx3z227">Olivia Wood</a>, spoke up to say that the reason game writers and narrative designers haven't spoken out about these poor practices before is to try not to burn bridges among the narrative and game writer community, since jobs for everyone are scarce.</p>



<p>Wherever you may land on Larian Studios using generative AI, it's clear that the studio's use of the technology and its response to the backlash have only emboldened the studio's critics to be louder. That's not to take anything away from their valid complaints, just a point to say that Larian is not necessarily the industry darling we might've once believed it to be.</p>



<p>That said, Daniel Vávra, founder and creative director of Warhorse Studios, the team behind Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, has, at least so far, <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-said-they-were-doing-something-absolutely-everyone-is-doing-ai-hysteria/">been the only major studio to come to Larian's defence regarding its use of GenAI</a>. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Fresh off its </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-tga-winners-losers-who-won-game-of-the-year-clair-obscur-2000652261"><span>Game of the Year</span></a><span> win, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-review-in-progress-1851777402"><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i></a><span> has a new, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-free-dlc-patch-notes-photo-mode-2000653032"><span>free update</span></a><span> that adds additional levels, upgrades, and boss fights to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/best-rpgs-2025-clair-obscur-avowed-assassins-creed-2000654194"><span>the RPG</span></a><span>. If it’s been a while since you checked in with Verso, Maelle, and the rest of the expedition, maybe, I dunno, go practice your parrying before you head into the new content, because even the sickos who were already dodging the game’s most elaborate onslaughts are having trouble with these challenging fights.</span></p> <p><span>The “Thank You Update,” as Sandfall Interactive is calling it, includes an Endless Tower, which features revamped boss battles from the base game for an extra challenge. </span><i><span>Clair Obscur</span></i><span>’s late-game boss fights and secret battles were already daunting tasks, and now the game has added a plethora of new fights that are exhausting just to watch. Look at how long this combo goes on in the new Duollistes fight:</span></p>

   <p><span>Some of the update’s challenges come from a seemingly never-ending barrage of attacks, but a lot of its fights are pretty standard </span><i><span>Clair Obscur </span></i><span>fare in that they </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscure-parry-sakapetate-chromatic-troubadour-1851781507"><span>trick you with multiple fakeout attacks</span></a><span>, baiting you into dodging and parrying before an enemy actually strikes, throwing off your rhythm and leaving you open to attack.</span></p>

   <p><span>Oh, and one boss will just straight up nuke your team. Good luck parrying that one.</span></p>   <p><i><span>Clair Obscur</span></i><span> fans are no strangers to challenging boss fights, but some feel that the Thank You Update’s boss run is too much. This account from </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/expedition33/comments/1pnn1se/im_officially_done_with_this_update/"><span>Reddit user Maggot_6661</span></a><span> sums it up:</span></p>

 <p><span>“I love this game, truly,” they wrote. “This update is great, but these bosses are too much. Unless I spend a full 9 to 5 learning the reaction times only a robot can reach, I will never beat them. I already have to spend the day searching for a job and going disappointment after disappointment, I’m not mentally strong enough to suffer through these bosses afterwards, all it’s doing is making me not like the game… which is something I don’t want to happen.”</span></p> <p><span>Sometimes walking away from the biggest challenges a game has to offer is the right call. To this day, I’ve never played through some of the secret bosses in </span><i><span>Final Fantasy X</span></i><span>, and I have art from that game tattooed on my arm. I think I’d rather just enjoy the game I played than bang my head against a wall on some of its more challenging fights, so I won’t judge anyone who walks away from </span><i><span>Clair Obscur</span></i><span>’s Endless Tower. To those of you who do beat them, thank you for your service. “For those who come after.”</span></p>

                <p>For three decades, the Tekken series has brought players together as they control of some of the best fighters in the world. Now, a 92-year-old Japanese woman named Hisako Sakai has carved out her own legend in the King of the Iron Ring battles by winning a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tekken-8/" data-ref-id="5000-572026">Tekken 8</a> tournament.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/92-year-old-grandma-wins-tekken-8-tournament-trophy-in-japanese-senior-citizen-esports-league/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>, the tournament of senior citizen Tekken 8 players was put on by the Japanese eSports association Care. The mission statement of that organization is to "create an environment in which the elderly can casually participate in eSports." Care has been running tournaments since 2019 while treating them like a major event with livestreaming and official commentators. A video from the event can be seen below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cj0XFWPkA8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5cj0XFWPkA8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Sakai made it all the way to the finals while playing as Claudio, when she went up against 74-year-old player Goro Sugiyama, who used Lili as his character. The match between Sakai and Sugiyama can be found two hours and 25 minutes into the video above. Despite the advantage of Sugiyama's relative youth, Sakai appears to have a superior button-mashing technique and enough mastery of the game to execute an effective path to victory.</p><p>Tekken development chief Katsuhiro Harada <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tekken-boss-katsuhiro-harada-is-leaving-bandai-namco-after-30-years-of-iron-fist-tournaments/1100-6536752/" data-ref-id="1100-6536752">recently announced his departure</a> from Bandai Namco after three decades with the company. Harada is not retiring from the video game industry, and his farewell message indicated that he has taken into consideration the "time I have left as a creator."</p><p>Earlier this year, Harada expressed his desire to bring <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tekken-director-is-trying-to-bring-the-game-to-waffle-house-but-to-no-avail/1100-6531496/" data-ref-id="1100-6531496">the Waffle House chain of restaurants into Tekken</a>. There have been several viral videos of fights in Waffle House restaurants that have given the chain a reputation that it probably wants to shy away from. That may be why Waffle House turned down Harada's request.</p>
