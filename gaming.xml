                <p>Borderlands 4 is out now on PC, and a number of issues have cropped up as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-blasts-off-on-steam-with-record-breaking-results/1100-6534670/" data-ref-id="1100-6534670">the game sets records on Steam</a>. On the <a href="https://support.borderlands.com/hc/en-us/articles/44493923901971-Borderlands-4-PC-Troubleshooting-and-Optimization-Guide" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Borderlands Support site</a>, Gearbox lays out some of the known issues so far and has provided workarounds for some issues.</p><h2>Compiling shaders</h2><p>To begin with, Gearbox reminded people that it's a good idea to ensure your drivers are updated, since doing that alone can fix some issues. For issues compiling shaders, Gearbox said they should take about 10 minutes to compile, and if it's taking longer, you can try rebooting the game and your system.</p><p>If that doesn't sort out the issue, you can clear the shader cache. Here's how:</p><ul><li>For Nvidia:  <ul><li>Open up the RunCommand (press WinKey+R),</li><li>Paste or type the following: %LOCALAPPDATA%\NVIDIA\DXCache and select "OK."  <ul><li>This will open a File Explorer window to that file path.</li></ul></li><li>Highlight all the files in the folder and select "Delete."</li><li>Some files cannot be deleted, so another window will appear to warn you.</li><li>Enable the "Do this for all current items" check box and then select "Skip." the files that cannot be deleted.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>For AMD:  <ul><li>Open AMD Adrenalin app</li><li>Select Gaming &gt; Graphics</li><li>Scroll down to bottom and select the Reset Shader Cache option</li><li>Note: This will wipe shaders for all programs</li></ul></li></ul><p>If you're running a 13th or 14th generation processor from Intel, that might be causing issues in your Borderlands 4 experience. Gearbox pointed out how Intel has acknowledged some instability issues, which can cause your PC to slow down, crash, overheat, or see large spikes of CPU usage. You can <a href="https://community.intel.com/t5/Mobile-and-Desktop-Processors/July-2024-Update-on-Instability-Reports-on-Intel-Core-13th-and/m-p/1617113" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">follow Intel's instructions</a> to try to sort the issues out if you're experiencing them.</p><h2><strong>Troubleshooting tips</strong></h2><p>Gearbox also provided a rundown of general troubleshooting tips to help you on your way. These can be seen below, as written by the developer:</p><h3><strong>Verify Game Files - Corrupted or missing files can stop the game from launching</strong></h3><p><strong>Steam</strong></p><ol><li>Right-click Borderlands 4 in your Library</li><li>Go to 'Properties' &gt; 'Installed Files'</li><li>Click 'Verify integrity of game files'</li></ol><p><strong>Epic</strong></p><ol><li>Find Borderlands 4 in your Library</li><li>Click the three dots next to the game title</li><li>Choose ‘Manage’ and select 'Verify'</li></ol><h3>Disable Overlays - Game overlays can cause performance issues or crashes.</h3><ul><li>Disable Steam Overlay: Steam &gt; Settings &gt; In-Game &gt; Uncheck "Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game"</li><li>Turn off other overlays (e.g., Discord, GeForce Experience, MSI Afterburner)</li></ul><h3>Run as Administrator</h3><ol><li>Right-click the game’s shortcut or .exe file</li><li>Click "Run as administrator"</li></ol><p>Also, try running the game in "compatibility mode" for Windows 10 if you're using Windows</p><h3>Check Antivirus/Firewall - Some security software can block game files.</h3><ul><li>Add the game folder as an exception to your antivirus.</li><li>Temporarily disable antivirus/firewall to test if it’s the issue (be careful doing this).</li></ul><p>A <a href="https://support.borderlands.com/hc/en-us/community/topics/43238641357075-Borderlands-4" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">complete rundown of Borderlands 4's known issues on PC can be seen on the support website</a>. If you've exhausted Gearbox's list of troubleshooting techniques, you can <a href="https://support.borderlands.com/hc/en-us/requests/new" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">submit a support ticket</a>.</p><h2><strong>Missing Super Deluxe Edition DLC</strong></h2><p>The console edition of Borderlands 4, which doesn't unlock until later today, September 11, is encountering some problems already as well. Gearbox said Xbox Series X|S users who bought a physical copy of the Super Deluxe Edition are not going to see their promised DLC at launch. The developer said it's aware of the issue and is "working on getting players their bonus content."</p><p>GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/borderlands-4-review-too-much-of-an-overcorrection/1900-6418405/" data-ref-id="1900-6418405">Borderlands 4 review</a> scored the game a 7/10.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Naughty Dog president and The Last of Us director Neil Druckmann has seemingly revealed that The Last of Us Part III is, at the very least, an idea that's been floated at the studio. In a new interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/neil-druckmann-last-of-us-exit-intergalactic-video-game-1236514453/"><em>Variety</em></a>, Druckmann says Naughty Dog debated going straight into Part III after completing <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/the-last-of-us-part-ii/the-last-of-us-part-ii-review-a-perfect-circle">Part II</a>, but that ultimately, the team decided to move forward on what we now know as <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>While a Part III to The Last of Us seems like a no-brainer, considering how well this franchise does for Naughty Dog and PlayStation, Druckmann has given mixed signals over the years. When <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered">The Last of Us Part II Remastered</a> dropped last year, it eventually included <a href="https://gameinformer.com/news/2024/01/25/grounded-ii-the-making-of-documentary-for-the-last-of-us-part-ii-will-be-released"><em>Grounded II</em>, a documentary about the making of the game</a>.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7HJZJTMP9gw"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7HJZJTMP9gw" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Near the end of it, Druckmann said, "For years now, I haven't been able to find that concept [for Part III], but recently, that's changed, and I don't have a story, but I do have a conept that to me is as exciting as 1, as exciting as 2, is its own thing, and yet has this throughline for all three. So it does feel like there's probably one more chapter to this story."&nbsp;</p><p>But then, in a March 2025 <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/the-last-of-us-season-2-abby-video-game-changes-backlash-1236327786/"><em>Variety</em></a><em> </em>interview, Druckmann, when asked about a potential Part III, said, "I guess the only thing I would say is don't be on there being more of The Last of Us. This could be it."&nbsp;</p><p>Now, in a new interview with <em>Variety</em>, Druckmann has seemingly revealed that Naughty Dog, at one point, had plans regarding a Part III game in its Last of Us franchise.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When asked about potential Intergalactic sequels, Druckmann said, "We don't tend to plan too much in the future, because we find – and this is something I inherited, it's just the Naughty Dog culture – that we do our best work when it's something we're really excited about, really passionate about.</p><p>"Just to give you an example, when we finished The Last of Us Part II, and that was highly successful for us, we were debating whether we should just go straight into The Last of Us 3, and we had a really long period where we looked at ideas for maybe what could be in that game."&nbsp;</p><p>The team looked at Uncharted, Jak and Daxter, and its "sci-fi thing," though, and Druckmann said what is now Intergalactic is where the team's passion led it.&nbsp;</p><p>So for now, it sounds like a third Last of Us game is on the theoretical or potential table as Naughty Dog continues work on Intergalactic.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Nature, a game about creating an ecosystem and evolving its inhabitants, is not exactly a new idea. Publisher <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/NorthStarGameStudio/AllGames/page/25D1D1E6-4BE8-460C-88A5-76F141CDAAE7" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>North Star Games</u></a> first released a similar title, <a href="https://zdcs.link/a5Xd5V?object_uuid=35714c69-489d-4f32-ba97-5a805a035441&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0725LRH1W" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Evolution</u></a>, in 2014. Evolution spawned multiple expansions and spinoffs over the subsequent years, to much acclaim. Designer <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamedesigner/3245/dominic-crapuchettes" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dominic Crapuchettes</a> just can’t let this idea go as 2025’s Nature is the latest iteration of this longstanding series. I’m glad he’s stuck with it, because this new standalone title is the most splendid variation yet.</p><div catalogid="63e640fa-0407-4587-ba23-f4273724f4dd" id="227874"><div id="227874" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Nature Board Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Just like in <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/155703/evolution" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evolution</a>, players steward a number of distinct species they must feed and protect. You gain a new budding lifeform in each of the four rounds, with species consisting of a size and population. The former represents its overall mass and scale, while the latter is the number of animals in the genus. So a small herd of elephant-like creatures would have a size of four but only a couple of population. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The most interesting aspect is that each species also consists of up to three trait cards. This is the nerve center of the design, as it consists of a nuanced card system that elicits difficult strategic decisions. The biggest concern is hand management, as well as guiding the evolutionary force in response to a shifting environment. Each animal is fighting for survival, and that includes gathering precious limited food from the central watering hole, or possibly going the carnivore route and hunting for sustenance. Your ability to work toward these goals and curb threats rests in the card play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Trait cards function primarily as evolving mechanisms for defense or food gathering. You can play a Fast card on one of your species to help them outrun predators. Or maybe armored plating to provide a hardy shell. Similarly, claws may help you gather plants more efficiently, or provide an offensive bonus when hunting other creatures.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What’s marvelous is that the system is ostensibly a tableau builder. This is a style of game, popularized by games like <a href="https://zdcs.link/zJrjln?object_uuid=35714c69-489d-4f32-ba97-5a805a035441&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B000YLAOEW" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Race for the Galaxy</u></a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/98P2xO?object_uuid=35714c69-489d-4f32-ba97-5a805a035441&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B08F65MX4L" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>7 Wonders</u></a>, where players place cards in their own personal area, creating an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-engine-building-board-games">engine</a> to generate points or resources. Nature twists this formula to create dynamic isolated tableaus that represent player-crafted species. So instead of managing a single tableau, players construct and manipulate several small sets of various properties. It’s a clever concept, using an existing mechanism to craft an ecosystem of evolving entities that must continually change in order to adapt to their environment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The environmental pressures that incentivize adaptation are mainly a result of the hunter system. When you are playing cards during your turn, you may always slap a hunter trait onto one of your species. This makes them carnivores, shirking the watering hole and instead seeking to outmaneuver prey and feed on their population. A reason to do this is that the watering hole plant food is limited, particularly late game when the number and population of species has escalated. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Predators also devour population, effectively harming opponent’s tableaus and weakening their species. Population and feeding lead to points in this game, as each token of food devoured gets banked for end game scoring. Feeding off another player’s pack not only scores you points, but it also lowers the ceiling on their food consumption. It’s a brutal aspect of the game, but one rooted in player interaction and evolutionary force.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many of these processes are identical to Nature’s predecessor, Evolution. The reason for this new edition of the game was to unify the design and its many branching expansions under a single family of products that all function together. This also allows for the Nature base game to be streamlined and simplified for a new generation of players. Crapuchettes' goal here is to craft a game that offers a welcoming enough foundation for a wide audience, while allowing for endless expansion to layer complexity and nuance atop that sturdy base. Nature is intended to appeal to virtually any level of gamer, hobbyist or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-beginner-board-games">newcomer</a>.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">By at measure, Nature is predominantly a success. There are several expansion modules that add things such as dinosaurs, flying creatures, random events, and environments such as the Amazon or Arctic Tundra. Most add a new deck of trait cards which are kept separate from the primary set of cards. The unified implementation makes for easier integration, with setup and teardown being quite simple. The framework also allows for multiple expansions to be used together in order to tweak the experiences. This is the strongest quality of Nature, as it plays quite differently depending on the chosen content.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Say for instance you want a more violent and exciting game. The Jurassic expansion adds more nifty tools for predators, so that’s an easy inclusion. But tossing in the Amazon setting will also introduce a bluffing element with hidden traits, which will ratchet up the tension and result in more daring attacks. Next time you play you can swap Jurassic for Flight, which will result in a far less confrontational session and instead focus on flocks of birds migrating as a new avenue for scoring.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The extensibility is a core asset of the design.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The extensibility is a core asset of the design. Nature as a streamlined and simplified experience on its own would be disappointing for those of who have played this game system previously. But I don’t think comparing the core set of Nature to Evolution: Climate is fair. The breadth and scope of each product needs to be evaluated, and Nature’s ability to evolve and plug in new content in a manner similar to its own player-driven trait selection is frankly, a magnificent adaptation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The main drawback to Nature is the somewhat obtuse feeding process. The process involves grabbing food from the watering hole equal to the size of your species, and is completely independent of the population. Additionally, bigger creatures don’t need to eat any more food, which is odd. This works mechanically and is an important aspect of the system, but it’s unintuitive and something players can struggle to internalize. The rest of the design is elegant, with the card play being clean and consistent and everything flowing extraordinarily well. I’m not sure the design itself could be carved away any further, but it’s a lingering question due to this mechanism not sitting perfectly flush.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, Nature meets its overall objective. It has a modest ruleset, and massive potential. Inserting a new expansion is seamless and the additional rules heft is only a couple of paragraphs. The core system is still sharp. It conveys its themes of evolutionary biology effortlessly. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/producer/north-star-video-games">North Star Games</a> continues to progress its flagship hobbyist title, unfurling new tricks and peculiarities.</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Sep 11, 2025 5:32 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Nature is both an entirely new game system and an iteration. It successfully blends a solid core framework with a long line of additional content players can add to tweak and adjust the experience. There is a tremendous amount of potential here, and much of it has already been realized.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/nature-board-game-review]]></content:encoded>

Mun, working with Joel actor Troy Baker again, casting <em>The Last of Us </em>Season 2 actor Tony Dalton (who played Joel's dad), and more.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VLGy63pt9vA"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VLGy63pt9vA" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Perhaps the most revealing statement from Druckmann came when <em>Variety </em>asked him about his description of Intergalactic as having "the deepest gameplay" in Naughty Dog history.&nbsp;</p><p>"You can look at our previous titles and see the evolution going from 'Uncharted,' where we're really cutting our teeth on a realistic character-action game, third-person shooter, combined with emotional storytelling," Druckmann said. "With 'The Last of Us,' we added some RPG elements, we started playing with wide linear layouts. Continue that trajectory forward, add sci-fi, and you start to get the sense of what we're doing, and then we've gotten even more ambitious than that."</p><p>My money's on a deep, third-person, character-driven RPG with multiple open hubs to explore, and I hope I'm right.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When asked about Gabrielle's casting, Druckmann explains Naughty Dog had an idea of who protagonist Jordan is as a character, but via documents and backstories – scripts and gameplay come much later as the team wants the space to "run experiments and prototypes and then see what works, what doesn't work," and so on.&nbsp;</p><p>"We were kind of at that stage when we started talking to [Gabrielle]," Druckmann told <em>Variety</em>. "That came about because we had just cast her in Season 2 [of <em>The Last of Us</em>], and just got the idea that she might be perfect for this role. Then she showed up, she came by Naughty Dog, I pitched her the story as it was at the time, and we kind of walked through it beginning, middle, end, and explained what her role would be.</p><p>"I asked her if she'd be willing to audition, and she was. We had her on stage, and I asked Troy to come in and read with her, so she read against Troy Baker. We were just very confident that is our Jordan A. Mun."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Druckmann says since then, he's been writing with Gabriella, something he did with Ellie actor Ashley Johnson and Baker when making The Last of Us. "[Gabrielle's] been just as influential in the writing and the thinking of this character, her arc, and I believe she's gonna be very iconic and complex and interesting in the Naughty Dog tradition.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking of Baker, Druckmann says, "Troy is in the game, and it's been five years since I've worked with Troy, and I've got to do it again, and it was a lot of fun to be on stage with him again."</p>

<p>The final piece of casting information from this interview is about Dalton. Druckmann says after working with him on Episode 206 of <em>The Last of Us </em>where he played Joel's dad, he DM'd him on Instagram to ask if he'd jump into a Zoom call to check out Intergalactic. "We jumped on a Zoom call, and I showed him parts of the game, and I talked to him about it," Druckmann said. "He's like, 'Yeah, I'm in. I'd love to do it.' So Tony Dalton is there, and maybe there's a few more [of actors from Season 1 or Season 2 of <em>The Last of Us</em>]."</p><p>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet is due out on PlayStation 5, though there's no word on when to expect the game.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, read <a href="https://gameinformer.com/exclusive/2025/03/26/naughty-dogs-neil-druckmann-on-the-creative-process-behind-season-2-of-the"><em>Game Informer's </em>interview with Druckmann about creating Season 2 of <em>The Last of Us</em></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>[Source: <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/neil-druckmann-last-of-us-exit-intergalactic-video-game-1236514453/"><em>Variety</em></a>]</p><hr><p><em>When do you think Intergalactic will launch?

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/signal-rolls-out-secure-backups-just-after-i-had-to-nuke-my-message-history.1295196/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For a month my phone was, from a technical perspective, “severely messed up.” I am a klutz on occasion, which is partially why I’ve gotten good at backing up my data, buying the most durable tools possible, and repairing the things that I own. But this time my phone was not only beyond the limits of my repair abilities, but also of everybody I brought the device to, and it contained the only thing I could not back up: my (iOS) Signal history. So, with a heavy heart, I had to let those chats go. So when Signal finally confirmed that they were rolling out “secure backups” in a limited capacity, I was ecstatic, and the timing made me want to throw a brick at a wall.&nbsp;</p><p>If you’ve never used Signal before, you should. It’s as secure a messaging app as you’re likely to get, works across most platforms, and is just generally well-encrypted and secure. It’s flexible and can work between your desktop and phone. But because it’s a piece of software that prioritizes security over retention, it has historically been complicated to back your conversations up.</p><p>This is by design: though your messages sync across devices, you cannot currently back them up to the cloud. iOS devices like the iPhone are especially annoying as you can only directly transfer it to another iOS device, usually over wifi. (Android phones can work similarly with the option <a href="https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007059752-Backup-and-Restore-Messages#android_restore_steps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for local backups</a>, and people have <a href="https://github.com/bepaald/signalbackup-tools" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">built complex, open source tools</a> for this purpose.) I have had to transfer my Signal history over multiple iPhones in the past, and thankfully the old devices were screwed up in a way that was either repairable or did not compromise the integrity of the phone itself.&nbsp;</p><p>This time, however, I was not so lucky. Following a freak accident, my phone got messed up in the most specific and annoying way possible: damage to the logic board, most likely the NAND flash. The phone would boot up momentarily, work very poorly for about 30 seconds (and a few times up to 30 minutes), and then promptly reboot. The phone was simply unable to stay on long enough to back up my conversations.</p><p>For about 99% of what’s on my phone, it’s not catastrophic. I’m fairly regular at backing up my photos and messages, so while the cost of a new or refurbished phone is bad, it’s mostly not world ending. But I did not want to lose my Signal chat, particularly years of discussions with my one other friend who is just as obsessed with technology as I am, in the way that I am. Both of us are very good at taking notes, but occasionally it would be useful to search the transcript for something one of us linked to in an offhanded way.&nbsp;</p><p>So, in my desperation, I spent multiple weeks seeing if a guy could fix the issue. I brought it to a guy who said he fixed it, but didn't, then that guy had to send it to <em>another guy </em>in Sunset Park, who held on to it for a week, said he fixed it, only for it to not be fixed. What’s more, I had already planned a vacation to the Bay Area with my girlfriend and I could not get a new device in time, so I had to navigate the entire trip via the 30 seconds of time my phone could handle, on my girlfriend’s phone, and over café WiFi on an iPad Mini. I cannot stress how embarrassing it is to walk around holding an iPad Mini like a man-sized toddler, although I guess if you have to pull something like that, San Francisco is the place to do it.&nbsp;</p><p>By choosing to use Signal on iOS, I had authored the inevitable demise of my texts. Eventually I just got a replacement phone and wiped the old one, those messages wiped away like a sand mandala being dumped into the ocean. I had to live my life. Perhaps this was for the best.</p><p><strong>Finally, Secure Backups</strong></p><figure></figure><p><a href="https://signal.org/blog/introducing-secure-backups/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In a blog post Monday</a>, Signal announced that they were finally rolling out a beta on Android (with iOS to follow) that allows for secure backups in the cloud. Based on the writeup as well as what’s covered in the support <a href="https://community.signalusers.org/t/public-signal-backups-testing/69984" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">forum</a>, there’s a lot to like and a lot to prod at. The feature is opt-in by default, and covers up all your texts and up to 45 days of media. If you want to store all of your media, Signal offers a monthly paid service (their first, they are a non-profit) of $1.99 to cover the cost of 100GBs of media storage. Media itself is encrypted twice and padded to obscure the file size.&nbsp;</p><p>The backup is end-to-end encrypted and locked with a 64-character recovery key. Though another person at the other end of a conversation can back up your conversation without you enabling the feature, disappearing and deleted messages are removed from any archive the way they were intended to. It also introduces a backup format that is readable independently of all clients, which opens up the possibility of theoretically restoring your messages between iOS, Android, and Desktop clients.</p><p>As with most security features, the devil is in the details. But security has always been Signal’s highest priority, which is why something as basic and heavily requested as secure backups took so long to figure out. And if there’s a potential exploit, Signal’s user base will probably be the first to figure it out. Though I’m bummed out, this was always something I’d known could happen, and I know this feature would not have rolled out to iOS fast enough to save my conversations. I’m done grieving my Signal history and am tranquil in the knowledge that I can finally shoot my phone with a shotgun without worrying that my secure texts and conversations from close friends will be lost forever.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/invert-controls-horizontal-x-axis"><h3>OK, But Who Is Inverting Their Horizontal Controls?</h3></a><p>The answer may go back to devotees of older, Japanese-made video games</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/unikat-32-33-indie-games-publisher-marketing"><h3>Running A Video Games Publisher AND Marketing Agency Sounds Absolutely Exhausting</h3></a><p>'Seeing all of your different efforts, ones that are synced by the work of many people, all being unveiled at once is a cool feeling'</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/signal-rolls-secure-after-i-detleted-my-signal-history]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/super-mario-bros-movie-sequel-could-be-super-mario-galaxy-nintendo-universal/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo%E2%80%99s-next-super-mario-bros-movie-could-be-called-%E2%80%9Csuper-mario-galaxy%E2%80%9D-%E2%80%93-rumor.1295181/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Besides the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-announces-legend-of-zelda-live-action-link-and-zelda-casting/">Legend of Zelda movie premiering in 2027</a>, we know that Nintendo is working on a <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-illumination-announce-a-new-super-mario-bros-film-due-in-april-2026/">follow-up</a> to its Super Mario Bros. film in 2023. Now, a day before what has been confirmed to be the <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-confirms-this-weeks-general-direct-is-its-longest-ever/">longest general Nintendo Direct ever</a>, a new leak might've just revealed the title of the next film to be Super Mario Galaxy.</p>



<p>As spotted on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1nef1vl/super_mairo_bros_second_movie_title_leaks_two/">Reddit</a>, NBC Universal has registered domains as of yesterday, September 10, 2025, which point to Super Mario Galaxy being the title. Both of the domains registered, when entered into your browser, <a href="http://supermariogalaxy-lefilm.com/">redirect to Universal's official website</a>. </p>



<p>That said, this does not necessarily mean the title is locked in, but the timing of the registrations do add some weight to Super Mario Galaxy potentially being the title for the coming Super Mario Bros. sequel. There's also the issue of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/unannounced-super-mario-bros-movie-sequel-title-super-mario-world-published-then-pulled-from-nbcuniversal-press-release">a press release from this past May from NBC Universal</a> that seemed to let the title slip, though in that case, the supposed title was "<em>Super Mario World</em>."</p>



<p>In a way, when looking at the post-credits scene from the first Super Mario Bros. movie, which teased the arrival of Yoshi, Super Mario World does seem to make more sense. Though it's not like Yoshi is absent from the Galaxy games, meaning the door is still open for it to be Super Mario Galaxy.</p>



<p>With the original Super Mario Bros. game about to celebrate its 40th anniversary this coming Saturday, September 13, 2025, and the next Super Mario Bros. film currently set to arrive on April 3, 2026, the timing does line up that we'd hear about the film's title <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-direct-announced-friday-september-12/">during tomorrow's Nintendo Direct</a>, and potentially even some news around what the film will entail, possibly even a teaser trailer.</p>



<p>Regardless, we will hopefully know which leak is correct by tomorrow. If it's Super Mario World, then these domains are potentially for something else entirely. If it's Super Mario Galaxy, then who knows what NBC Universal was referring to when the phrase was included and then removed from a press release in May. We'll see what answers tomorrow does, or doesn't, bring.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/the-11-best-changes-borderlands-4-junk-loot-menus-legendary-guns-2000624953</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/borderlands-4-makes-11-fantastic-changes-and-3-that-ain%E2%80%99t-great.1295172/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-includes-direct-jab-joke-gearbox-former-owner-embracer-bluff-2000624815"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a> launches on September 12 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Gearbox’s open-world looter-shooter sequel is a big game with a lot of quests to complete and plenty of endgame content to check out. As such, my review isn’t ready yet. But I’ve played nearly 40 hours so far, and I’ve enjoyed my time. A big reason why is that Gearbox has made some smart changes in <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-finishes-decade-old-quest-pre-sequel-dunks-watson-explained-2000624918"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a> that make it easier than ever to manage, sell, and collect loot and get around the world.</p> <p>As a big <em>Borderlands</em> fan who has played all of the games multiple times, I have cataloged a list of changes and improvements in <em>Borderlands 4</em> that I think both longtime fans and newcomers alike are going to be excited about.</p> <h2>Finally, A Weapon Wheel</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000624984" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624984"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624984">©Gearbox / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>For many, many years now, <em>Borderlands</em> fans, myself included, have longed for the franchise to add a real weapon wheel option. Past games have sometimes allowed you to use the d-pad on a controller to hot-swap between four guns, which is fine, I guess. But a true weapon wheel hasn’t been an option until now. <em>Borderlands 4</em> finally adds a real, honest-to-goodness weapon wheel, and it’s so nice. It makes quickly swapping to a gun easier and faster than ever!</p>

 <h2>Mark Loot As Junk When Picking Up</h2> <p>In <em>Borderlands 4</em>, like in past games, you’ll spend a lot of time collecting guns that are bad, or just not what you want. In the past, you’d have to manually sell each of these. And yes, you could mark them as loot in the inventory screen and then sell them all at once. But now, in <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-everything-pre-order-dlc-release-date-time-ps5-switch-2-crossplay-2000624090"><em>Borderlands 4</em>,</a> you can junk loot as you pick it up. This ties into another great change…</p> <h2>Instantly Sell Junk At Vending Machines</h2> <p>All that loot you mark as junk can now be sold at any vending machine just by walking up and hitting a single button. You don’t even have to go into the store screen. It’s so nice, and this change, as well as the last one, has helped keep my inventory mostly empty and ready for more loot.</p>

 <h2>The Lost Loot Menu Is So Much Better</h2> <p>Speaking of loot, in some past <em>Borderlands</em> games, players were able to return to a hub area and activate a “Lost Loot” machine that would spit out some of the guns that dropped out in the world that the player didn’t pick up. This wasn’t a very efficient way to handle the process and made using the Lost Loot option annoying. In <em>Borderlands 4,</em> this is now handled through a menu screen that lets you easily trash stuff you don’t want and take stuff you do want.&nbsp; And you can hit a button to take it all without having to grab each item off the floor.</p> <h2>A Warning When Selling Equipped Gear And Guns</h2> <p>Sometimes, when dealing with lots of loot and similar guns, it’s easy to mark an equipped piece of loot as junk and sell it. This has happened to me in past games. Sure, you could favorite stuff you didn’t want to sell, which is still an option in<em> Borderlands 4,</em> but it was always weird how the games just let you sell equipped gear so easily. Not so in <em>Borderlands 4</em>! Now you get a pop-up warning when trying to sell equipped items marked as junk. Nifty!</p>

 <h2>Legendary Weapons Are Much Rarer To Find, And That’s Good</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000624985" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624985"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624985">©Gearbox / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>One of the biggest problems I had with <em>Borderlands 3</em> was how easily and quickly you found legendary weapons and gear. On a recent playthrough, I was collecting and selling them within a few hours of starting a new character. By the end of the game, I had found well over 100. I lost count, really. This made them feel less special and made non-legendary purple gear less exciting to collect because better stuff was dropping all the time.</p> <p>Thankfully, this isn’t the case in <em>Borderlands 4.</em> After nearly 40 hours with the game, I’ve only collected 7 legendary weapons and items. And one of those I bought from a vending machine, something I’ve only seen once in my time with the game.&nbsp; Unlike in <em>Borderlands 3</em>, when legendaries drop in<em> Borderlands 4,</em> I get genuinely excited! It’s a rare event, and many of the items have been powerful and memorable.</p>

 <h2>Customize Your Character Anywhere And Anytime</h2> <p>In the past, if you wanted to put a new skin or hat on your <em>Borderlands</em> character, you’d have to find a specific machine in-game and use it. This was annoying. Now, you can just open up the customization menu whenever you want and freely change your character’s looks.</p> <h2>Upgrading Your Inventory And Ammo Capacity Isn’t A Boring Money Grind</h2> <p><em>Borderlands 4</em>‘s big open world has a lot of places to explore, things to do, items to collect, and activities to complete. And this time around, Gearbox has decided to tie the open world to upgrading your character. Instead of grinding for money and then going to an in-game store to buy SDU upgrades, which let you carry more stuff and ammo, you now earn SDU credits by exploring and completing activities. And this is all done via a menu that is available at all times. Need more loot space to collect more guns? Well, check to see if you have enough SDU credits to upgrade your inventory space, and if so, do it right then and there. So convenient!</p>

 <h2>An Optional Hologram Path That Helps You Go The Right Way</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000624986" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624986"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624986">©Gearbox / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I spent far too much time in past <em>Borderlands</em> games running around trying to figure out how to get to a specific place or a quest marker. The in-game maps have been helpful, but sometimes you just want someone to draw a line from where you are now to where you need to go. And good news: <em>Borderlands 4</em> does that now! At any point, you can hit a button to get an in-game holographic path showing how to reach your destination, which can be a quest or just a random point you marked on the map.</p> <h2>Repkits Offer Healing When You Need It Most</h2> <p>A new piece of loot introduced in<em> Borderlands 4</em> are repkits. These are small medical devices that players can activate every so often for some instant healing. No more hunting down health drops during tricky boss fights or big skirmishes. Those tiny bits of healing still drop and are still useful, but having a health gun at your side is great. And as with all loot in <em>Borderlands</em>, repkits come in various flavors with all sorts of weird, wacky, and useful bonuses and passive traits. Honestly, going back to any past <em>Borderlands</em> game is going to be hard after getting used to repkits.</p>

 <h2>Spawn Your Vehicle Whenever You Need It</h2> <p>A big theme when it comes to the changes and improvements made in <em>Borderlands 4</em> is convenience. And perhaps the best example of this is the removal of Catch-A-Ride stations, which previously were the only way to spawn in a vehicle. Now, every player has their own personal Digirunner (which are basically Sparrows from <em>Destiny</em>),&nbsp;and they are awesome. They move quickly, feel great to drive, and being able to call one in whenever you want is so handy. Plus, combining Digirunners with the new movement controls, like double jumping and gliding, lets you speed across the world in style.</p> <p><em><strong>And now, some changes that aren’t so good…</strong></em></p> <h2>Menus Feel Dark, Finicky, And Removed From The Game World</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000624987" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624987"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624987">©Gearbox / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Something I really loved about the menus in past <em>Borderlands</em> games was how vibrant they all were and how they existed in the world. When you opened your inventory or skills menu in <em>Borderlands 3</em>, you’d see your character standing in the world, and the menu would be hovering next to and behind them. That’s gone in <em>Borderlands 4</em>. Instead, all the menus and inventory screens exist in dark voids that feel disconnected from the world. And some of these menus are tricky to use or feel overly cluttered. The inventory, in particular, isn’t great to navigate when using a controller. This change doesn’t ruin <em>Borderlands 4</em>, but it does make me sad.</p>

 <h2>Loading Screens Are Dull</h2> <p>This is a silly complaint, I’ll admit, but the loading screens in <em>Borderlands 4 a</em>re so boring. In past games, which were filled with loading screens, you’d get these wonderful, colorful posters of the location you were loading into at that moment. In<em> Borderlands 4,</em> which has far fewer loading screens thanks to its (mostly) seamless open world, the screens just look like someone took concept art and tossed the location’s name on it. They seem stale, cold, and drab. Thankfully, stuff loads so quickly that you won’t have to look at them long.</p> <h2>Rewards For Challenges And Quests Are Hidden In Digital Boxes</h2> <p>When you complete a quest in <em>Borderlands 4</em> or when you finish an in-game challenge, you are rewarded with various goodies. But these goodies aren’t delivered directly to your inventory. Instead, you have to go into the character menu and open them up. Thankfully, you can open them all at once, but it’s so odd that this system is even in the game.</p> <p>Sure, it’s nice that guns or loot you earn from a quest aren’t dropped right in your limited inventory. But it’s annoying that cosmetic items are also locked in these chests. The game also does a terrible job of reminding you to check on your rewards. Sometimes I’d open my character screen and see, like, 10 of these chests waiting for me. I’d love an option to get notified every so often when I have more than two or three of these things waiting around to be opened.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s been almost a year since <em>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/intergalactic-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-ps5-actors-1851722128">was teased at The Game Awards 2024</a>. Naughty Dog’s upcoming sci-fi adventure doesn’t have a release window yet, much less a trailer showing what players will spend most of the blockbuster doing. But director Neil Druckmann did confirm it will&nbsp;<em>probably&nbsp;</em>be the studio’s most expensive game to date and reflect its growing ambition when it comes to delivering more expansive gameplay. Maybe that’s why had to ditch working on <em>The Last of Us</em> season 3 for HBO alongside his duties at PlayStation.</p> <p>“What can I say and not say?” the veteran developer said, tip-toeing around spoilers and PR guidelines <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/neil-druckmann-last-of-us-exit-intergalactic-video-game-1236514453/">in a new interview with <em>Variety</em></a>. “I can tell you we’re in the thick of it. We’re making it, we’re playing it. We’re firing on all cylinders.” Set in a far-flung, alternate future, <em>Heretic Prophet</em> follows bounty hunter Jordan A. Mun (Tati Gabrielle) who begins unraveling the secrets of a remote planet after becoming stranded there during a mission.</p> <p>“I’ve said this before, but I really mean it, I’m really feeling it right now: It’s the most ambitious game we’ve ever made. It’s the most expansive game we’ve ever made, maybe the most expensive, by the time we finish it. Troy [Baker] is in the game, and it’s been five years since I’ve worked with Troy, and I’ve got to do it again, and it was a lot of fun to be on the stage with him again.”</p>

 <p>While he hedged on the upcoming PS5 exclusive’s budget, it doesn’t seem like a shocker that it will end up costing more than the last new game Naughty Dog shipped, 2019’s <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>. In addition to the rising costs of development on current-gen platforms, a new IP like <em>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</em> will come with a hefty marketing price-tag as Sony tries to sell fans on the next big thing from the studio behind <em>Crash Bandicoot</em>, <em>Jak and Daxter</em>, and <em>Uncharted</em>.</p> <p>Druckmann did give a slight tease in the interview of what we can expect from <em>Intergalactic: The Heretic</em> <em>Prophet</em> in terms of scope. “With <em>The Last of Us</em>, we added some RPG elements, we started playing with wide linear layouts,” he said. “Continue that trajectory forward, add sci-fi and you start to get the sense of what we’re doing, and then we’ve gotten even more ambitious than that. So really looking forward to see how it all comes together. I think you’re all going to be pleasantly surprised by it.”</p>

 <p>While pressing up against the ceiling of vagueness, the comment seems to reaffirm that <em>Heretic</em> <em>Prophet</em> will showcase even more player freedom and agency within its world. Druckmann also confirmed actor Tony Dalton, who appears in the<em> Last of Us</em> TV show (he played Joel’s dad in a season two flashback), will appear in the game too, potentially alongside others from the HBO series (the show is up for three Emmys at this year’s awards ceremony on Sunday).</p> <p>As for what comes after <em>Heretic Prophet</em>, Druckmann is still being cryptic about Naughty Dog’s future and what other projects it has in the works. There was talk of doing <em>The Last of Us Part III</em> after the last game but the team wanted to try something sci-fi instead. “I’m sure if <em>Intergalactic</em> is successful, you will see it again,” he told<em> Variety</em>. “Whether that will be our next game right after that, I can’t say, and I leave that door open. Not to be coy for this particular question, we want to see how we feel once we’re done with it and look at the options in front of us, because we have some other ideas that we’d like to explore as well.”</p>

                <p>The TV adaptation of Naughty Dog's The Last of Us on HBO is a big hit, but could the developer's next game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-trailer-story-setting-and-everything-else-we-know/2900-6082/" data-ref-id="2900-6082">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>, leap to TV or the big screen?</p><p>It's too soon say, but Hollywood studios are already pitching Naughty Dog, Neil Druckmann said. Speaking to <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/neil-druckmann-last-of-us-exit-intergalactic-video-game-1236514453/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Variety</a>, Druckmann said, "We've already had studios approach us" about Intergalactic--based on excitement around the trailer alone. "Just having seen the trailer; they don't know much about the game," Druckmann said of these pitches from unspecified companies.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItkWqN3nMHE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ItkWqN3nMHE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Given the success of The Last of Us TV series at HBO, it makes sense that studios would come knocking and try to lock up an adaptation of Naughty Dog's next project. For his part, Druckmann said, "I want to make sure we don't put the cart in front of the horse." He said Naughty Dog needs to ensure Intergalactic turns into a "fantastic video game" before any transmedia opportunities are considered.</p><p>Also, it would have to be the "right partnership," he said. If those conditions can be set, Druckmann said it "would be great" to see Intergalactic find a new audience for TV or film.</p><p>"There's a lot of ideas of what we could do with Intergalactic, and in some ways it’s easier to expand that because it's just how that story is structured in that universe," he said. "So there's some interesting conversations happening about potential projects that could come down in the future, but our priority right now is to make Intergalactic the next big, fantastic Naughty Dog game."</p><p>As for the game Intergalactic, Druckmann said, "We're in the thick of it. We're making it, we're playing it. We're firing on all cylinders."</p><p>"It's the most ambitious game we've ever made. It's the most expansive game we've ever made, maybe the most expensive, by the time we finish it," Druckmann said.</p><p>HBO's The Last of Us series <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-3-release-date-trailer-cast-story/1100-6534454/" data-ref-id="1100-6534454">returns in 2027 for its third and potentially final season.</a> Season 2 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hbos-the-last-of-us-wins-another-emmy-this-time-for-its-most-traumatic-episode/1100-6534544/#:~:text=HBO's%20The%20Last%20Of%20Us,Its%20Most%20Traumatic%20Episode%20-%20GameSpot" data-ref-id="1100-6534544">just won a Creative Arts Emmy award</a>, and the show is nominated for many more in the upcoming main Emmy awards show on September 14.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>, one of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/771461/silksong-release-steam-nintendo-eshop-crash">hottest games of the year</a> with <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/silksong-passed-5m-players-in-three">a reported five million players</a> in its first week, <em>didn’t</em> launch on smartphones. But that won’t stop you from playing it on Android — because a new leap in Windows to Android emulation means you can easily install and run the Steam version on flagship phones like my Galaxy S25.</p><p>I’m talking <a href="https://gamehub.xiaoji.com/">about GameHub</a>, the app from Chinese mobile gamepad manufacturer GameSir, which just launched version 5.0 with two key features that help it rise above the Windows-on-phone emulation scene.</p><p>First, it automatically configures itself with the right graphics drivers, translation layer, and other components when you launch the game — something that I spent hours trying to do manually with rivals Winlator, GameNative, and an earlier version of GameHub with far worse results. Second and just as importantly: it can download your Steam savegames from your PC.</p><p>The result: you can download this app, log into your Steam account, tap to install the game, tap to play the game, tap a couple more times to enable Steam cloud saves… and then you’re playing a Steam game on a phone! Unfortunately, it doesn’t <em>yet</em> work the other way around: as of September 11th, GameSir was actively working on getting your savegames to upload and sync back to your Steam PCs, too, but it’s still not working in <em>Silksong. </em></p><p>Is it worth it? On my vanilla Samsung Galaxy S25, this PC game really does feel playable on a phone, at least once I attach a USB-C gamepad with an integrated cooler like the <a href="https://gamesir.com/products/gamesir-x3-pro">GameSir X3 Pro</a> I’m testing right now. I played over an hour yesterday and didn’t feel the need to pick up my Steam Deck instead.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->8</strong><span><cite>Image by Sean Hollister / The Verge</cite></span></p></section><p>With a normal PS5 controller, I saw framerates anywhere between 50 and 120 frames per second at my phone’s full, widescreen native resolution — did I mention GameHub supports widescreen and HDR? — and it runs a bit better at 720p.</p><p>But with the X3 Pro I was able to maintain framerates of over 100fps even in big fights, so long as I plugged the gamepad’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoelectric_heat_pump">Peltier cooling plate</a> and noisy fan into USB-C power. I guess I shouldn’t <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/28/24143845/phone-cooler-fans-ice-graphics">make fun of phone coolers</a> anymore!</p><p>It’s not as smooth as my Steam Deck or other handhelds without that added cooling: when my phone is thermally throttling, moments where it hits 50 or 60fps don’t feel like 50fps or 60fps, they feel like the game is borderline unplayable. But I was pleased to see the cooling solution do its job! I imagine a larger Galaxy phone, or a phone designed for gaming, or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/711116/onexsugar-sugar-1-hands-on-preview-transforming-dual-screen">a dedicated Android handheld</a>, would have an easier time.</p><p>You probably won’t want to use a phone <em>much</em> weaker than the S25 for this quick-reflex game. When I tried GameHub and <em>Silksong</em> on an older Pixel 9 with a Tensor G4, it balanced on the knife’s edge of playability, and definitely fell off without a cooler attached. The Pixel 9 also doesn’t currently let me watch the game’s cutscenes, a bit of a dealbreaker if you’re buying the game to play on phone, though the Galaxy S25 plays cutscenes fine as of this latest GameHub release.</p><p>Some in the Android emulation community have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EmulationOnAndroid/comments/1n8yikp/silksong_runs_better_on_switch_emulation_than/">turned to the Nintendo Switch emulator Eden</a> for better sustained performance in <em>Silksong</em>, and I’ve heard that one runs at a stable 120fps without extra cooling. But that would require somehow obtaining a downloadable copy of the Switch version of the game, and it might be difficult to transfer saves with a real Switch.</p><p>With GameHub, I’m downloading my legitimately purchased games and saves from Steam itself. That’s amazing.</p><p>Windows emulation on Android is looking like a game-changer. And <em>Silksong</em> is just one of the games it might be about to change. Today, that’s because this game requires an incredibly low amount of performance and power to play, but future phones might carve out more and more of the PC game library.</p><p>Just don’t rely on GameHub too much yet. Even though many are enthusiastic about the big improvements in GameHub 5.0, others are complaining that it broke games that were previously working. It could be worth waiting for the dust to settle.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/hands-on/776180/hollow-knight-silksong-android-phone-windows-emulation-gamehub#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/hands-on/776180/hollow-knight-silksong-android-phone-windows-emulation-gamehub]]></content:encoded>

<p>For seven years, the discussion around <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> focused on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/08/explaining-the-internets-obsession-with-silksong-which-finally-comes-out-sept-4/">the cult-like levels of devotion among fans patiently waiting for the sequel</a>. Now that <em>Silksong</em> has been available for about a week, though, that discussion has turned decisively toward <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/criticism-isnt-hate-hollow-knight-silksong-sparks-debate-about-difficulty-runbacks-and-the-dreaded-git-gud-comments">seemingly endless takes</a> on <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/hollow-knight-silksong-more-difficult-player-complaints/">the game's</a> relative <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-is-hollow-knight-silksong-too-difficult">difficulty</a> (or lack thereof). The discussion has gotten so loud that the developers at Team Cherry have vowed to implement a "slight difficulty reduction in early game bosses Moorwing and Sister Splinter" <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1030300/discussions/0/595159519774039622/">in a coming patch</a>.</p>
<p>So is <em>Silksong</em> too difficult for its own good? Or do players just have to "get good" and stop whining?</p>
<p>To help answer those questions, we felt it was a good time to bust out the Ars Difficulty Matrix (ADM™), which we <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/03/is-elden-ring-really-that-hard-well-it-depends-what-you-mean-by-hard/">first used to analyze <em>Elden Ring</em>'s difficulty in 2022</a>. By breaking down the various ways a game can be "difficult," the ADM™ can more precisely critique the ways <em>Silksong</em> is and is not designed to challenge players, both for good and for ill.</p>
<p>Each section of the ADM™ starts with a broad definition of the specific questions we're attempting to answer, followed by an analysis of how <em>Silksong</em> fits into that paradigm of the long history of video game difficulty.</p>
<p><em>Note: The remainder of this piece has very minor spoilers for some of the earlier portions of Silksong.</em></p>
<h2>Mechanical difficulty</h2>
<p><em>Does the game require players to hit a specific sequence of buttons in a certain tight timing window to succeed? Also sometimes referred to as a "reflex test."</em></p>
<p><em>Hollow Knight Silksong</em> requires pretty good gaming reflexes. There's no way around it.</p>
<p>This is especially true when facing the game's many bosses, who often only briefly telegraph their intentions before unleashing attacks that can fill a huge portion of the screen. Players need to keep a careful eye on the sometimes small animation cues that presage an attack, move quickly and precisely to avoid that specific attack, and then dart back in during a quick counterattack window to do some damage before starting the cycle over again.</p>
<p>Unlike many <em>Souls</em>-like games, <em>Silksong</em> doesn't have a spammable dodge button that offers the player brief invulnerability to almost every attack, regardless of location. That means players must actually carefully plan and execute quick movements to a safe region of the screen, which can be exceedingly difficult in tight timing windows.</p>

<p>Bosses aside, <em>Silksong</em>'s platforming often requires players to bounce off of aerial enemies or objects using a series of mid-air downward attacks. These precisely timed bounces are especially difficult early in the game, when the downward attack launches diagonally forward in an arc that can be challenging to aim precisely.</p>
<p>Later upgrades that allow you to float and/or dash in mid-air help reduce the challenge of these multi-bounce strings, as do optional upgrades that straighten out your downward slash. Even so, <em>Silksong</em>'s platforming challenges will likely trip up a lot of players without extensive run-and-jump gaming experience.</p>

<h2>Punishing difficulty</h2>
<p><em>How much of a penalty does the game extract for mistakes? How many mistakes can you make before "dying"? And when you do die, how much progress do you lose?</em></p>
<p>On the plus side, <em>Silksong</em> never extracts the ultimate punishment by sending you all the way back to the start of the game. You have effectively infinite lives, and death never pushes back farther than your last save point.</p>
<p>On the downside, those save points are often spaced quite far apart, meaning death can require a good deal of backtracking through treacherous areas to get back to where you were (and to recover the crucial rosaries you collected in your previous life). This can be especially punishing when you reach a new region of the game and are forced to search for a convenient save point without the aid of a map, which makes retracing your steps all the more fraught and confounding.</p>

<p>The individual enemies in <em>Silksong</em> aren't very forgiving, either—just a few false moves can allow even random scrubs to get in enough damage to lead to a premature death. Bosses can do even more damage with a single attack and can also absorb a lot more damage than your poor avatar. Getting in five or 10 hits against a boss might be relatively simple, but getting in 50 or so before dying yourself often requires near-perfect levels of focus and execution across multiple challenging attack phases.</p>

<p>Like its predecessor, <em>Silksong</em> allows players to refill some of their health after gathering enough silk by hitting enemies. But even this nod to forgiveness is relatively punishing, since the health refill freezes your character in a defenseless pose for a few seconds. There's nothing quite so deflating as seeing an attempted health recharge get thwarted by an enemy lunging in for an inopportune attack.</p>
<h2>Arcane difficulty</h2>
<p><em>How well does the game explain its inner workings? Are there detailed tutorials explaining the basic controls and deeper strategies? Or do you have to figure it all out on your own? Are there signposts showing you what to do next?</em></p>
<p>The most difficult part of <em>Silksong</em>, for me, is often figuring out where I should be going. Before I find a map in a new region, I often find myself flummoxed trying to remember which paths I've already explored and which I still need to work through. And even with an in-game map in hand, it's difficult for me to remember which previously inaccessible corners might now be opened thanks to a new ability.</p>

<p>I'm willing to allow that this might be a personal problem with my sense of direction. Still, I'd imagine I'm not the only one who finds navigating <em>Silksong</em>'s labyrinthine halls to be unexpectedly difficult.</p>
<p>The in-game map also purposefully obscures some of the game's secret nooks and crannies, which can only be found with careful observation (or a handy walkthrough). Many players could miss some of the game's most useful abilities if they're not observant. And while the game gives some basic tutorials for new abilities, a few mechanics seem intentionally obscured. I didn't know until <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn5pOXujszQ">hearing about the move in a YouTube video</a> that you could dash downward to quickly reach the ground, for instance.</p>

<h2>Grindable difficulty</h2>
<p><em>Does the game give a patient player enough additional power, upgrades, tools, or knowledge to defeat difficult challenges? Or are you pretty much stuck with the techniques and abilities given to you at the outset?</em></p>
<p>For players willing to do a little optional exploring, <em>Silksong</em> can actually be pretty generous with the power upgrades. Hidden paths and missions can often lead directly to improvements for your health, weaponry, and move set that can pay huge dividends for later challenges in the game. And the required upgrades that you receive after certain bosses (see "Gated Difficulty," below) can often make earlier challenges in the game that much simpler if and when you backtrack a bit.</p>

          
                  </div>

<p>That said, there are limits to how much this additional power can help <em>Silksong</em> players. This isn't like some old-school RPGs where dozens of hours of grinding can lead to a Level 99 character that can take out the final boss in a single attack. Even with all the extra upgrades you can muster, you still have to struggle through the same basic dodge-and-counterattack repetition to get through some extremely difficult and unavoidable bosses.</p>
<h2>Gated difficulty</h2>
<p><em>Are large portions of the game hidden behind in-game challenges that need to be bested before you can move on? Or does the game offer alternative options for getting around what might be impassable progression walls?</em></p>
<p>Like any <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/metroidvania/">Metroidvania</a> worth the genre name, large portions of <em>Silksong</em> require finding and unlocking new movement or attack capabilities. And in <em>Silksong</em>, those required abilities are usually gated behind major bosses that you'll need to take down before accessing massive chunks of the expansive in-game map.</p>
<p>If and when you do get stuck on one of these bosses, you're not necessarily trapped. You'll usually be able to backtrack a bit to explore a few optional side paths and missions, which can offer power boosts that can make the boss a bit easier (see "Grindable Difficulty" above). Speedrunners have also found some arcane sequence skips to get around certain bosses or methods for putting off some boss fights until later than the developers intended.</p>

<p>These will be of little use to many casual players, though, who may well give up on <em>Silksong</em> after banging their head against a progress-blocking boss for an hour or two.</p>

<h2>Tunable difficulty</h2>
<p><em>Does the game offer explicit options for players to change the difficulty level or make the game generally more accessible? If not, does the game tune its difficulty automatically based on a player's performance?</em></p>
<p>The lack of any difficulty-tuning options seems like a major omission for a modern title like <em>Silksong</em>. The game's options menu includes toggles for screen shake and HUD size, but nothing in the way of difficulty adjustments.</p>

<p>Here, the developers at Team Cherry would have done well to take a few lessons from <em>Celeste</em>. While the default <em>Celeste</em> experience requires extremely precise jumps and split-second reflexes, designer Maddy Thorsen also felt it was important to offer an extremely forgiving "Assist Mode" for players who want or need a little boost.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>“From my perspective as the game’s designer, Assist Mode breaks the game,” <em>Celeste</em>'s Thorsen said <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/celeste-difficulty-assist-mode/">in an interview with Vice</a>. "I spent many hours fine-tuning the difficulty of <em>Celeste</em>, so it’s easy for me to feel precious about my designs. But ultimately, we want to empower the player and give them a good experience, and sometimes that means letting go.”</p>
<p>A similar Assist Mode in <em>Silksong</em> would be easy for "serious" players to ignore while still allowing all players to at least have some access to the full breadth of <em>Silksong</em>'s intriguing world. Even a <a href="https://www.mariowiki.com/Invincibility_Leaf">Nintendo-style "invincibility" mode</a> that appears after a couple-dozen failed boss encounters could give frustrated players an option to unstick themselves from the game's toughest sticking points.</p>
<h2>ADM™ roundup</h2>
<p>From a holistic point of view, <em>Silksong</em> is definitely on the tougher side of most dimensions on the Ars Difficulty Matrix™. The game requires good reflexes—especially for bosses and platform challenges—that can punish even small mistakes with relatively large penalties and hides large chunks of the game behind difficulty gates with no tuning options that might offer some relief. Plenty of players are going to be forced to give up long before they fight their way through some of the game's most difficult bits, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/09/every-game-should-copy-death-strandings-very-easy-mode/">and that's a shame</a>.</p>
<p>But I think the passage of time has obscured just how much most of these critiques also applied to the original (and beloved) <em>Hollow Knight</em>. While <em>Silksong</em>'s bosses might be a little tougher, and its jumping challenges a little more precise, its predecessor was also often unforgiving and gated in almost the exact same ways (though some of this difficulty was <a href="https://hollowknight.fandom.com/wiki/Voidheart_Edition">eventually rebalanced</a>). Only 22 percent of <em>Hollow Knight</em>'s Steam players have <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/stats/367520/achievements">obtained the "Hollow Knight" achievement</a> for reaching the first of the game's multiple endings, and I'm willing to bet most of the remainder gave up out of frustration rather than boredom [the original version of this story cited the incorrect Achievement. Ars regrets the error].</p>
<p>There's definitely room in the world of popular gaming for titles like <em>Silksong </em>that push even experienced players to their limits. But it's still a shame that this extreme level of challenge is going to prevent a large portion of the player base from ever directly experiencing everything <em>Silksong</em> has to offer.</p>

              <p>You want to buy something in a video game. Maybe it’s a battle pass. <a href="https://twitter.com/Wensoing/status/1965755228424425619?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">Maybe it’s a Sonic skin</a>. Maybe it’s the current <em>Halo</em> Master Chief skin. That one costs 1,500 V-Bucks, but V-Bucks only come in packs of 400 or 1,000. You now have 300 leftover V-Bucks and Epic Games has your extra money. It’s scammy and it sucks. Thankfully, it’s also going away.</p> <p>“Starting October 14, we’re adding an Exact Amount&nbsp;offer to the <em>Fortnite</em> V-Bucks purchasing page that lets you ‘top up’ your V-Bucks balance to the exact amount needed for the item you’re trying to buy,” the company announced on Thursday. “Let’s say you want an item that costs 500 V-Bucks but you only have 400 V-Bucks in your account. You’ll be able to buy just the 100 V-Bucks needed.”</p> <p>The improved payment option is coming to <em>Rocket League</em> and <em>Fall Guys</em> as well, and will be available across Xbox, Switch, PC, mobile, and…not PlayStation 4 and PS5? “We will work to make this available everywhere,” the blog post reads. Sony did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p> <p>Forcing players to buy extra currency by mismatching it with microtransaction prices is a tale as old as digital downloads on console. Platforms like Xbox were once infamous for making players buy games with points instead of real currency, a practice <a href="https://tech.yahoo.com/gaming/article/2013-08-26-xbox-live-updated-to-real-people-money.html">that didn’t end until 2013</a>. It was such a big deal when it changed that Microsoft made the announcement at that year’s E3.</p> <p><em>Fortnite</em>‘s “top-up” option comes a couple of years after Epic reached <a href="https://kotaku.com/fornite-refund-check-file-claim-ftc-settlement-deadline-1851717873">a $245 million settlement</a> with the FTC over “dark patterns” that tricked players into unwanted purchases.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">When I was 13, my dad let me drive his car for the first time. It wasn’t on city streets – just in a big, empty parking lot – but I will never forget that’s the day I learned that a car creeps forward even when the driver’s not pressing the gas. Sure, I was only going a few miles an hour, but as a terrified, inexperienced driver, my heart was pounding and I felt totally out of control. I hit the brakes like a kick drum, starting, stopping, starting, and stopping, until I finally got a handle on the machine. It was a steep learning curve; before then, the closest experiences I had to real-life driving were go karts and Mario Kart, and I naively thought my hundreds of laps of motion control steering on Coconut Mall would give me some idea of what to expect. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Strangely, I thought about this memory a lot just a few days ago during my first hands-on demo with Kirby Air Riders. There are certainly a number of similarities: your character moves forward automatically without pressing any buttons, I was going completely off the rails and heavily relying on the brakes until I got the hang of things, and – most notably – my Mario Kart skills didn’t transfer whatsoever. But surprisingly, it was my Smash Bros. muscles that I found flexing instead, with Air Riders feeling like a strange pseudo-sequel to Super Smash Bros. Ultimate in the same way that Donkey Kong Bananza gave the Super Mario Odyssey treatment to another franchise. Let me explain.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Masahiro Sakurai Gameography</h3><p>Here's every game that Smash Bros. creator and YouTuber Masahiro Sakurai has directed or designed in his 30-plus year career.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Ever since Mario Kart World and Kirby Air Riders were formally revealed for Switch 2 back in April, lots of us have wondered the same thing: “Why is Nintendo releasing two kart racers in the same year?” It’s a fair question, one that even Air Riders director – and the creator of Kirby himself – <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sakurai-says-kirby-air-riders-is-basically-mario-kart-in-extremely-smash-bros-style-direct"><u>Masahiro Sakurai posed in his presentation last month</u></a>, joking that it “basically is like Mario Kart,” and one that he even brought up when Nintendo asked him to make Air Riders years ago. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the surface, it’s an obvious comparison. Mario Kart World and Kirby Air Riders both feature a large roster of characters racing through colorful courses on various karts/machines, as they weaponize a wide lineup of power-ups to try to take first place. It’s easy to see why onlookers (and even Sakurai himself) would question the choice to place both of these games in Switch 2’s first six months on the market. But once I got Air Riders in my hands, I realized that Mario Kart World and Air Riders really don’t play like each other at all, even in their respective racing modes.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I got to try out the same pair of race courses as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kirby-air-riders-the-first-preview"><u>our previewer Leanne Butkovic</u></a> did late last month, first speeding through the starter track, Floria Fields, before taking on the more intense Waveflow Waters. I was immediately struck by how <em>fast </em>Air Riders is compared to the GameCube original, where the racing always felt a bit sluggish. It echoes the jump from Smash 64 to Smash Melee: Melee is faster, more competitive, and stacks a ton of new mechanics on top of the original, just as Air Riders does when compared to Air Ride. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The difference is that Melee came out two years after the first one, and Air Riders is arriving more than two <em>decades</em> after its original, and it’s honestly really cool to see Sakurai pick up right where he left off, creating an iterative sequel that builds upon and fixes issues of what came before as if no time has passed at all. When Air Riders was first teased, I didn’t know what to expect from a legacy Sakurai sequel as he returned to a series from so long ago, and the answer being that it’s basically a GameCube game, but better, is a pretty cool direction to take. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Kirby Air Riders echoes the jump from Smash 64 to Smash Melee.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Air Riders felt like a roller coaster ride at first, as I swung around tight turns and glided through exciting setpieces like a stretch of road with rumbling waterfalls on either side of it. The strategy for these races is nothing like Mario Kart World, where it’s all about knowing your route on the track, crossing your fingers for the right item at the right time, and executing shortcuts when you get the power-up you’re looking for. Air Riders is more about attacking and reacting to your opponents – Nintendo even opened its behind-closed-doors presentation to the media by calling it a “Vehicle Action Game” rather than a kart racer. To play Air Riders successfully, I needed to focus on combat and my opponent’s positioning while racing around the course, both by attacking enemies to charge up my devastating special and following the leader’s exact path to take advantage of the new Star Slide ability that increases your speed when you collect the trail of stars machines leave behind. Once I wrapped my head around these core mechanics, I started to understand that from a gameplay perspective, Mario Kart World isn’t the immediate comparison point for Kirby Air Riders: it’s Sakurai’s other darling, Super Smash Bros.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Kirby Air Riders: Official Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Smash is technically classified as a fighting game, but it has really carved out its own niche with its focus on advanced platforming and knocking opponents out of the arena rather than depleting a health bar, and the same concept can be applied to Kirby Air Riders. Both Smash and Air Riders exist on the outskirts of their traditional genres, resulting in games that can be intimidating at first glance due to how they defy expectations, but ones that provide shocking mechanical depth to those who heavily invest in their systems. As I said, I was incredibly overwhelmed during my first Air Riders play session, but determined to understand its intricacies, I returned to the demo three additional times during PAX West, gradually getting better and more confident each time. I was reminded of the first time I played an eight-player match of Super Smash Bros. for Wii U. It was overstimulating, chaotic, and hard to follow, and I thought there was no way it was a mode I’d ever get attached to. But Sakurai games have a way of drawing you in, and it wasn’t long before eight-player matches became a staple on game nights with friends.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I could see the same thing happening with Air Riders’ City Trial mode, which I’ve now had the chance to play eight times. This returning fan-favorite from the GameCube original drops you into an open city alongside up to 15 other players, giving you five minutes to find a better machine to ride and upgrade, with stats and powerups that spawn throughout the map. At the end of five minutes, you compete in one of a lineup of competitions with the machine you developed which range from seeing who can glide the furthest to the straight-up speed test of a drag race.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Air Riders presents itself as a cute, simple racer, but in reality, it’s a complex action game.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite Sakurai warning against it in his presentation, I spent my first few City Trial runs gobbling up every power-up I could find, and it resulted in a machine that was way too fast for the minigames that followed. I was completely off the rails, and I initially felt punished for being too greedy during the exploration segment of City Trial. But for subsequent runs, I started being more selective about which power-ups I grabbed and which I left behind, trying to make a machine well-suited for any of the possible minigames that could show up. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sakurai’s fingerprints are truly all over Air Riders. From the slick menu and UI design – which is traditionally designed by his wife, Michiko Sakurai – to the dramatic, slow-motion, red and black finish zoom that punctuates destroying an opponent’s machine just like the final knockout in a match of Ultimate. Even the main menu’s basic black title set on a white background is the same style as Ultimate, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/games/switch2/aaaba/index.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Air Riders’ Japanese website</a> could easily be confused with Sakurai’s other series at a quick glance, complete with character renders and alternate costume designs that scream Smash Bros. Each character’s unique special move instantly reminded me of a Final Smash, and the sheer level of polish and attention to detail across every facet of my demo was unmistakably Sakurai.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/11/airriders-1757609508456.PNG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Rider page on Air Riders' Japanese website is very Smash Bros.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m so interested to see how the public perceives Air Riders when it comes out in a couple of months. It’s more nuanced than it appears, and for that reason, I don’t think Air Riders demos very well to people playing it for the first time. I spent about two hours watching various groups demo it at PAX West, and the vibe of players felt very familiar to my very first hands-on session: overstimulated, overwhelmed, and generally confused. Air Riders presents itself as a cute, simple, approachable racer that only uses the control stick and a couple of buttons, but in reality, it’s a deep, complex action game that demands your full attention. That tough, contradictory first impression, combined with the surface-level comparisons to Mario Kart, and Air Riders’ hefty $70 price tag, makes me worried that people won’t give it the time of day when it launches in November. I hope not, because after meeting Air Riders on its own terms and working across several demo sessions to understand it, I walked away very excited for a fascinating sequel from one of my favorite creators.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Logan Plant is the host of Nintendo Voice Chat and IGN's Database Manager &amp; Playlist Editor.

One conspicuous absentee here is PlayStation — and while Epic does not state why Sony's consoles will not initially support the feature, it has said it's working to make the offer available "everywhere".</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/11/fortnite-exact-amount-purchasing-offer-1757607311797.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Fortnite's Exact Amount purchase screen. Image credit: Epic Games</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">An example image of how it will work, above, as published today on Fortnite's website, shows a player with 600 V-Bucks being offered the ability to buy the remaining 400 V-Bucks required to purchase a 1,000 V-Bucks item.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Where previously the player would have had to buy a whole other 1,000 V-Bucks pack (and be left with an unused 600 V-Bucks balance after their purchase), the Exact Amount method offers a way to only pay for the V-Bucks that are required.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, there are still advantages to buying V-Bucks in bulk, and the conversion rate offered for the 400 V-Buck top-up looks to be a straight 100 V-Buck to $1 price. That compares to buying a 1,000 V-Buck pack for $9, or spending even more on larger V-Buck packs and getting even more V-Bucks included.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Epic Games hasn't said why it is adding this feature now, or why it is launching the offer in general. But it's certainly an interesting step for Fortnite and the publisher's other titles to take — and one that others around the industry will likely be watching. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, the advantage to developers of making players pay for more currency than they might need is that players then end up spending more. After that, players are also left with a remaining balance, that they may then decide to put towards something else — and so the cycle continues. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> boss <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-bundle-containing-fortnite-skin-is-an-ebay-investment-randy-pitchford-suggests-even-though-account-trading-risks-a-ban">Randy Pitchford suggested</a> that the game's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/is-it-actually-worth-preordering-borderlands-4-or-should-you-wait">pre-order bundle</a>, which contains a free Fortnite skin, could become a worthwhile investment for players.

                <p>Hellraiser: Revival developer Saber Interactive is aiming to deliver a faithful adaptation of the cult-classic horror series, and the studio says it wants to earn its M rating when the single-player survival-horror game is eventually released. The source material--starting with Clive Barker's novel that the popular horror film series is based on--was already pretty extreme for its time, as it revolved around people unwittingly summoning the sadomasochistic Cenobites: explorers from another dimension who subject their victims to gruesome experiments.</p><p>"We are going to go as far as we possibly can, as far as the people that make rules will let us go," Saber development chief Tim Willits said to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hellraiser-revival-dev-plans-to-go-as-extreme-as-the-people-that-make-rules-will-let-us-go" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>. "And I hope that we can make one version, but we are willing to go as far as we possibly can go."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Clive Barker’s Hellraiser: Revival - Announcement Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Barker is also involved in the project, as Saber says that he was consulted on the story written for the game. "We're trying to portray all the gore and horror that is present in the films, violence, sexuality, everything," associate game director Aleksandra Pelivanović <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clive-barkers-hellraiser-revival-game-is-as-nsfw-as-its-creators-original-vision/1100-6534252/">explained to GameSpot recently</a>. "It was really important for us to catch every key element of the franchise and put it in the game in the right context. And when we sent Clive the final draft for the storyline, he was like, 'Yes, that's Hellraiser!'"</p><p>According to the Entertainment Software Ratings Board, an M rating is usually reserved for games that feature "realistic depictions of violence, blood and gore, sexual content," as well as the "frequent use" of profane and vulgar language. In terms of pure gore, the recent Mortal Kombat games have received this rating, and <a href="https://youtu.be/RyFMmcrRkc8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mortal Kombat 1 pushed the envelope for digital violence</a> with several stomach-churning fatalities.</p><p>The fighting game featured characters being brutally dismembered in a variety of ways that were rendered in vivid detail, so you can only imagine just how far Saber can go--along with the erotic themes present in the Hellraiser material--before it risks earning an Adults-Only rating.</p><p>Following a series of cryptic teasers, Hellraiser: Revival was officially revealed in July and it'll launch for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. Pinhead actor Doug Bradley will reprise his iconic role and provide the voice of the Cenobite--though sadly, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DNq0n22JySe" rel="nofollow ">not in a scouse accent</a>.</p>
