			<p>The latest Title Update for Star Wars Outlaws is <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-gets-new-creative-director-biggest-update-to-come-21-november/">the biggest one yet</a>, and the team has been working towards making some huge changes both in graphics and in gameplay. For the most part, this Title Update has had a significant focus on combat and stealth to allow the player to have more control of their decisions, as well as allowing players to keep hold of pick-up weapons for longer. For those who may be getting stuck into Star Wars Outlaws, this is how big the update is on each platform:</p>
<ul>
<li>PlayStation 5: 7.44 GB</li>
<li>Xbox Series X|S: 10.18 GB</li>
<li>PC: 8.83 GB</li>
</ul>
<p>A few notable changes have been made with the latest Title Update in Star Wars Outlaws. Especially when it comes to the stealth and combat options in the game, by updating stealth and combat, players now have more choices to make and can adapt their playstyle accordingly. This includes using stealth or reaching for your blaster, even in syndicate territories in cities.</p>
<p>In conjunction with stealth and combat, enemy AI and detection have been improved. Players are now notified when they're being detected, giving them a choice between breaking stealth and engaging in combat or finding a way to change tactics to remain in stealth. Another layer has been added to the combat system, which involves enemy weak points being added to Star Wars Outlaws. This is so that players who engage in strategic gameplay are rewarded for their efforts, leading to the enemies to die in comedic new ways.</p>
<p>Continuing on with the efforts to fix combat, Kay's blaster and pickup weapons have been re-tuned so that the combat experience is smoother and more enjoyable. This includes the option to carry two-handed weapons more frequently throughout the game.</p>
<p>For many people, the animations and character design is what threw them off, as the characters do have a touch of uncanny valley. The developers for Star Wars Outlaws continue to work on this, with facial expressions and animations now being improved in dialogue scenes. This also comes with a new option to toggle the cinematic lens during gameplay, as well as distant lights being more visible when traversing through the game.</p>
<p>These are only the highlights of what was added in this Title Update for Star Wars Outlaws, and the patch notes carry on for quite a while. You can read them in their <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2842040" target="_blank" rel="noopener">uploaded blog post</a>, which goes into detail about everything that has been changed in the game.</p>

There will be a lot to unpack about the state of Ubisoft’s open-world stealth adventure in the days and weeks ahead but the most important thing to know right now is that the game is ditching its most annoying feature. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196345" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Pokémon With Guns And More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="126" data-playlist="196345,195358,196358" data-current="196345"><div><p>The Week In Games: Pokémon With Guns And More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196345/196345_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196345/196345_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196345/196345_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196345/196345_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21893.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>At launch there were many missions in <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, especially early on, where getting spotted by guards instantly resulted in failure. The word “caught” would flash in giant letters onscreen and you’d be started at the last checkpoint, which was sometimes surprisingly far back. No more. The latest developer diary explaining the game’s post-launch journey details why the developers nixed this feature and replaced it with the option to shoot your way out whenever the need arises. </p><p>“Our first step in expanding player choice is removing forced stealth from almost all quest objectives,” recently appointed creative director Drew Rechner <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/4U9vshW5I0KpPRJFhQspn2/star-wars-outlaws-dev-update-3-the-scoundrels-journey&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/4U9vshW5I0KpPRJFhQspn2/star-wars-outlaws-dev-update-3-the-scoundrels-journey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote over on the game’s website</a></span>. “This doesn’t mean that sneaking is no longer a viable or even preferable option in some cases. Rather, if you’re caught while sneaking, the objective won’t fail and reset you to the last checkpoint. Instead, you’ll seamlessly transition into combat.” </p><p>There are three other important changes that build on this more <em>Deus Ex</em>-style immersive sim gameplay. First, players can now shoot their way through unfriendly syndicate districts instead of being required to sneak through them. Second, weapons picked up and used in the field will remain accessible for a longer period of time. Third, headshots now do additional damage, and players will be able to target specific body parts for bonus damage on other weak points. </p><p>Combined, it should all help to grease the wheels for <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> to feel a bit more natural and free-flowing than it did with its more punishing, stealth-centric framework from a few months ago. The changes are also coming alongside the new Wild Card story DLC that sees protagonist Kay Vess team up with Lando Calrissian to bluff her way through a sabacc tournament on the casino cruiser Morenia. </p><p>The <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/1sXCR6GmB3Kn7OrKiy8DPO/star-wars-outlaws-title-update-140&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/1sXCR6GmB3Kn7OrKiy8DPO/star-wars-outlaws-title-update-140" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new 1.4 title update, out November 21</a></span>, also improves enemy AI behavior, facial expressions, animations, and more. It’s all part of Ubisoft’s attempt to salvage the game’s poor initial sales and turn it into a long-tail success. The game is currently 25 percent off on consoles through Black Friday as well.

<p>It was recently revealed by Riot Games that the League of Legends Worlds final, which took place on November 2 in London, secured a whopping 50 million peak viewers worldwide. This number was driven mostly by esports fans in China.</p>



<p>That figure includes an all-time high for esports viewers outside of China, the company revealed. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-into-perspective">Into Perspective</h2>



<p>To put that figure into perspective, this year’s NBA Finals pulled in a peak viewer count of around 12.3 million users across the United States. The Super Bowl, which was held in February 2024, racked up a total unique viewer count of 120.2 million people, averaging a peak of 38.5 million.</p>



<p>The data was <a href="https://x.com/lolesports/status/1859295721956024521" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">provided by Riot Games on social media</a> via Stream Hatchet.</p>



<p>This year’s League of Legends World Championship final is widely considered one of the best events in <strong>many years</strong>. It was a spectacle to behold, with live performances taking centre stage at the O2 Arena in London before T1 and Bilibili descended upon their stations to compete in front of a sold-out stadium.</p>



<p>The closing moments of the match were nothing short of legendary, and it marked a <strong>fifth </strong>Worlds win for both T1 and Faker.</p>



<p>In terms of numbers and buzz on social and streaming platforms, the grand final fixture was one of the most popular (if not <strong>the most</strong>) esports matches in the industry’s history. Nothing before has topped the grandiose profile of the full series, and it’s unlikely anything will again – for a long time, at least.</p>



<p>The League of Legends World Championship continues to grow. It’s the number-one esports event of the year, and it’s a perfect example of the ever-developing power of the esports market.</p>

<p>Another games studio is letting go of staff. Heart Machine, the developers behind Hyper Light Breaker and its predecessor Hyper Light Drifter, have confirmed that its holding layoffs.</p>



<p>First reported and confirmed by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/hyper-light-breaker-developer-heart-machine-confirms-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Developer</a>, the Los Angeles-based studio didn’t give a specific reason for the layoffs, nor did they confirm how many people are being let go. However, it will be providing severance and healthcare to those being let go. </p>



<p>It was also affirmed that the upcoming launch of Hyper Light Breaker won’t be impacted by the layoffs.</p>



<p>“Hyper Light Breaker’s&nbsp;upcoming launch will not be impeded by this sad news–in fact, a strong and timely launch will rekindle opportunities for those affected as we look to evolve and grow the game throughout Early Access. Our other projects, including&nbsp;Possessor(s), will also remain unaffected,” studio community and PR manager Yiyi Zhang told Game Developer.</p>







<p>Zhang continued: “We really appreciate our communities who have rallied in support of our studio and others in similar positions, and are hopeful for what’s on the horizon for our upcoming games, our colleagues, and the industry as a whole.”</p>



<p>Though an exact date hasn’t been announced, Heart Machine is planning to launch Hyper Light Breaker in early access sometime in 2025. The game was originally scheduled to release in late 2024 before being delayed in August.</p>



<p>The games industry has seen more that 14,100 known jobs lost due to layoffs in 2024. The real number, according to some sources, could be as high as 16,000 to even 17,000.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">From Software has become synonymous with challenging and beautifully crafted action-RPGs, and for Black Friday, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09743F8P6?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">you can get the studio's very best game for just $20</a>. Elden Ring typically sells for $60, and while we have seen it discounted several times in the past, this is the best price yet for an incredible adventure that'll test your skills within its elegantly tragic fantasy world.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-gamespot-10-10-review-score/2900-153/" data-ref-id="2900-153">Only 29 games have earned a 10/10 score</a> across GameSpot's long history, and Elden Ring is one of them. Back in 2022, Elden Ring was praised for creating a massive open-world environment with substance and giving players an action-packed experience that has become the gold standard for all Souls-likes.</p><ul><li><a href="https://amzn.to/40YzOMn" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo Switch</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/3CCklYp" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PlayStation</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/3CEO4zK" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/4135foZ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Accessories</a> | <a href="https://amzn.to/4eG3Tn1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Hardware</a></li></ul><p dir="ltr">"In a genre that has become wrought with bloated and over-designed games, Elden Ring is defiantly contrarian in almost every way. Its commitment to design by subtraction and to placing the responsibility of charting a path through its world entirely on the player makes it stand head and shoulders above other open-world titles," Tamoor Hussain wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elden-ring-review-death-of-the-wild/1900-6417832/" data-ref-id="1900-6417832">Elden Ring review</a>. "Elden Ring takes the shards of what came before and forges them into something that will go down in history as one of the all-time greats: a triumph in design and creativity, and an open-world game that distinguishes itself for what it doesn't do as much as what it does."</p><p dir="ltr">If you're looking for the complete experience, you can also pick up Elden Ring with its one and only expansion, Shadow of the Erdtree. The expansion was released earlier this year and adds an absurd amount of extra content, like new weapons, equipment, skills, and magic not found in the base game, alongside new enemies, encounters, and plotlines.

                <p>Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth is the latest in the beloved RPG series, and the second to star new series protagonist Ichiban Kasuga. If you haven't caught up with the latest misadventures of everyone's favorite big-hearted dumbass, now is a great time, as Amazon has it for $25 (marked down from $70) for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/black-friday/">Black Friday</a>.</p><p>The Like A Dragon series is the new title for the former Yakuza series, which shifted with the release of Ichiban's debut in Yakuza: Like A Dragon. That game also shifted the series to feature turn-based RPG combat, as opposed to the Yakuza series' action-oriented approach. Infinite Wealth brings back the turn-based combat, but with a new twist that adds free movement as well.</p><p>Infinite Wealth tells the story of Ichiban trying to help former Yakuza members reform and get their lives together after the dissolution of several Yakuza clans. Like previous games, it takes place mostly in Japan, but this time, it also has Ichi building up a community in Honolulu City, Hawaii.</p><p>For even more great deals on games, movies, collectibles, and more, be sure to check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/black-friday/">all of our Black Friday coverage</a>.</p><p><a href="https://amzn.to/3AT6I6s" rel="nofollow ">Black Friday Gaming Deals at Amazon</a>:</p><ul><li><a href="https://amzn.to/40YzOMn" rel="nofollow ">Nintendo Switch</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/3CCklYp" rel="nofollow ">PlayStation</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/3CEO4zK" rel="nofollow ">Xbox</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/4135foZ" rel="nofollow ">PC Accessories</a> | <a href="https://amzn.to/4eG3Tn1" rel="nofollow ">PC Hardware</a></li></ul>

The tool's so flexible it can be picked up by newcomers to learn the basics of game development, and also be a viable engine for commercial titles like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://gamemaker.io/en/showcase/fields-of-mistria">Fields of Mistria</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://50games.fun/">UFO 50</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and of course </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://gamemaker.io/en/showcase/undertale">Undertale</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. YoYo Games </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3219220/GameMaker_25th_Anniversary/">even made its own studio simulation game</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to commemorate the anniversary.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That YoYo Games (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/opera-opens-new-video-game-division-and-confirms-yoyo-games-purchase">which is now owned by Opera</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">) has survived 25 years is an accomplishment on its own: that is has done so by supporting the video game industry's smallest studios is nearly a miracle. It reached that milestone after a year of major turbulence within the game engine sector—one that began with Unity announcing a "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/unity-apologizes-to-devs-reveals-updated-runtime-fee-policy">Runtime Fee</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">" that would charge developers on a per-install basis, and ended with it sheepishly rolling back the plan as more developers decamped for engines like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/godot-founders-had-desperately-hoped-unity-wouldn-t-blow-up-">Godot</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/unity-spent-205-million-eliminating-25-percent-of-its-workforce">Unity</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and Unreal Engine maker </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/epic-games-lays-off-nearly-900-staff">Epic Games</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> also both laid off hundreds of workers in that time period, running headlong into the reality that the service provider business is not the infinite money pool some had thought it would be.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With turbulence like that, what can these studios and other tool providers learn from GameMaker's long-running success?</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="GameMaker's lasted so long by supporting devs with big dreams">GameMaker's lasted so long by supporting devs with big dreams</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">During our chat, Kay admitted that GameMaker isn't the most sophisticated development tool on the market. That's partly because its users largely aren't programming wiz kids. He called it the "bedrooms to billions" mindset—with an emphasis more on "bedrooms" than "billions." "You have kids being able to take their ideas to a larger audience...it's the creative side, it's not necessarily the business end," he said. "It's not about trying to make the next Call of Duty, it's about thinking about the box and asking 'what's going to work?'"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The GameMaker developer community, he said, is largely filled by those "creative" developers trying to wrangle big ideas, bolstered by a supportive "technical" community that digs around in the tool and explores solutions to bring those ideas to life. The business case for working with this kind of audience is that as they learn to grow and trust GameMaker. They bring the tool with them out of their academic or hobbyist days and into their professional careers. "We would like people to not just think of GameMaker as something they picked up at school, tried, and moved on to proper game development," Kay said, going on to say he wants developers to be thinking that "GameMaker is a series tool used by serious products, and it's well worth looking at."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Image via YoYo Games.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the greatest forms of support any small developer needs is the ability to ship their game—big or small—across platforms beyond PC. Kay said when he joined YoYo Games in 2009 as chief technical officer, the tool only supported PC products, and bringing any game to Mac, Linux, console, or burgeoning mobile platforms required extra work. Kay recalled that there was a shift in thinking at the company after Derek Yu released </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Spelunky</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a game he prototyped in GameMaker but couldn't finish due to the platform limitations.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of Kay's first major goals was to bring support for those platforms to GameMaker as fast as possible. The timing was perfect, especially with the mobile market about to positively explode with the kinds of 2D games GameMaker is good at producing. In the years since the company has been aggressive in keeping the engine current with new and emerging platforms, ranging from the PS Vita to the growing use of WebGPU.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"That's how we've been sustainable," he said. And all the while, the engine's remained "fairly stable," and today works roughly the same way as it did a decade-and-a-half ago.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"You can still open a tutorial from 15 years ago and it will </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>mostly</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> work," he said, glancing aside to try and recall exactly what had been made obsolete. "There'll be things that are wrong in it, but it will mostly work."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="How should toolmakers be supporting game developers?">How should toolmakers be supporting game developers?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Since GameMaker debuted, the tool provider market for game developers has exploded in growth. Many software companies have sought stability by selling metaphorical shovels to metaphorical prospectors heading out to the metaphorical gold rush instead of setting out for them thar hills themselves. Many of those toolmakers are now pitching services that run on generative AI, promising developers that they can save time and money with generated assets and code—but many of them miss the mark, sometimes delivering </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/art/how-devs-can-spot-ai-generated-3d-models">vastly inferior products</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A creative, not-very-technically-inclined audience would be the prime candidate for such tools, right? Not necessarily, said Kay. Working with this userbase has taught him that these developers aren't always looking for the best or most efficient technical solutions. Plenty of toolmakers can mistake what they think developers need versus what they actually need, and create software that slows down the game development process.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It's being aware that you're optimizing for the right thing," he said. For instance, an AI tool that could generate 10,000 assets sounds useful, but it's not useful if you don't know what 10,000 assets you need.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's also helpful to remember chasing technological advancements isn't always the right move. Kay described how games made in GameMaker don't bear any stigma that sometimes comes with unrefined Unity or Unreal Engine games, because players can't immediately spot a "GameMaker game" at a distance. "It's actually quite difficult to look and say this game is made in GameMaker these days, because... you'd be surprised at the sorts of games which are actually coming through."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Because Unity and Unreal have baked-in lighting and traversal solutions, developers are sometimes locked into a certain "look" or "feel" of a game that players can unconsciously detect. When developers have resources to break away from that kind of "game feeling," or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>want</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> their game to look and feel like the kind of game those solutions are optimized for, it's great. But Kay said it's sometimes more difficult to "break out of the creative box" in a 3D game engine versus a 2D one like GameMaker.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Don't expect any AI features in GameMaker any time soon, by the way. Kay said YoYo Games is "experimenting" with the technology, but hasn't found any immediate solutions ready for the game production pipeline just yet.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="How did Unity's Runtime fee fiasco affect GameMaker?">How did Unity's Runtime fee fiasco affect GameMaker?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After Unity sparked a mass uproar among its users with the proposed Runtime Fee, GameMaker announced </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/gamemaker-expands-with-more-free-options-replaces-two-subscriptions-with-one-time-fee">a price change</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> of its own: one that made the engine free for more users and ditched subscription plans targeted at smaller developers in favor of a one-time transaction. The changes were met with open arms.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Did YoYo Games make these changes because Unity had sent many developers rushing to find new tools? Kay said the answer was "no," that the changes were in the works months before Unity turned the indie game development world on its head.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But, he sheepishly admitted, YoYo Games did "hold off" on announcing its new plans as they waited for the fallout from Unity's move to settle. He said the company has seen a "big spike" of new users in the year since. "There's a greater appreciation of other game engines, and that there is more choice out there than just Unity. [We're seeing] a distrust of large companies and people wanting to have something that's simpler and easier to get their head around."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Interestingly, Kay said YoYo didn't experience the same phenomenon Godot did, where developers cracked open the tool and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/godot-founders-had-desperately-hoped-unity-wouldn-t-blow-up-">expected it to work just like Unity</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Because GameMaker bore fewer similarities, there was less pressure on it to meet its competitor's standards.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Image via YoYo Games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He said he keeps in touch with the teams that oversee Godot, and that the two engines aren't exactly jockeying to fill a vacuum. Godot's open-source framework, he said, is informing how YoYo Games thinks about GameMaker's future. The company has already made some portion of its engine open source, and will likely do the same for more features in the future.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It is a model that I think that engines need to adopt, because studios need to be able to have that ability to make bespoke versions for a particular game," Kay said.

            <p>Following the success of its Festival of Seasons concert, which you could say hit all the right notes, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> is touring another musical rendition for the beloved video game.</p>
<p>Symphony of Seasons, as it is known, will be an all-new concert, which will boast a bigger orchestra than its predecessor. In fact, it's got a 35-piece orchestra, which will perform new arrangements of the soundtrack as gameplay footage is shared.</p>
<p>Described as a "musical journey from your first day in the valley to your arrival to the summit", Symphony of Seasons has been curated by Stardew Valley's creator,  Eric 'ConcernedApe' Barone.</p>

<p>The concert tour will be coming to the UK in 2026. It will be in Glasgow on 10th February of that year, before heading to Manchester on 12th February and London on 14th February.</p>

<p>As for the video game world, earlier this year, ConcernedApe admitted he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-developer-has-not-touched-haunted-chocolatier-in-a-long-time-due-to-ongoing-update-work">hadn't actually touched his next game - Haunted Chocolatier - "in a long time"</a>, because his focus had been on Stardew Valley.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-creator-reveals-haunted-chocolatier">Haunted Chocolatier was first announced back in 2021</a>, with a cute trailer showing off its spooky chocolate-making, monster-stabbing, small town-living role-playing gameplay. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-creator-wont-rush-haunted-chocolatier-better-to-have-a-good-delayed-game-than-a-bad-game-on-time">Barone previously said he's "not too concerned with the pressure" of releasing Haunted Chocolatier</a>, saying, "it's better to have a delayed game that's actually good than a bad game that's on time".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Among Ashes is going to be available from December 9th on PC via Steam and PS5, Rat Cliff Games has confirmed today. It was just a few weeks ago that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/24/among-ashes-has-been-confirmed-for-ps5/">Among Ashes was confirmed for PS5</a>. To celebrate this milestone, the studio has released a brand new trailer of the game where the horrors of videogames and reality clashes.</p>
<p><iframe title="Among Ashes - Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RFBzqIK4Q9g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Among Ashes is a bit of a layered game in which players have to play a haunted videogame, called Night Call, and keep playing it until the very end. This means that in the game, your character will boot up the haunted game to play that and get through its challenges. In Night Call you will come across various monsters to fend off, but in the “real world” of Among Ashes the horrors are much more subtle and darker, delving more into psychological threats. There is a&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2430900/Among_Ashes/">demo available now on Steam for Among Ashes</a>, if you are in the mood to play a haunted video game.</p>
<p>Rat Cliff Games are self publishing the PC version of Among Ashes, while new publisher Dojo System will be publishing the PS5 version of the game.</p>

But ways to know which of the less fancy, more easily gained cards are missing from your collection would be nice. It turns out, there <em>is</em> a system for that, and while it could be a lot more useful, it really helps when it comes to choosing Wonder Picks.</p><h2 id="h1213"><a id=""></a>How to wishlist cards in <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em></h2><figure id="" data-id="c7cee7dd8b28fa4a543f8b5f63779212" data-recommend-id="image://c7cee7dd8b28fa4a543f8b5f63779212" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The My Cards screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The My Cards screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c7cee7dd8b28fa4a543f8b5f63779212" data-recommend-id="image://c7cee7dd8b28fa4a543f8b5f63779212" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The My Cards screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>OK, this is a bit convoluted, but you’ll be glad you did it. To find <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>’s bizarrely buried wishlisting option, you’ll want to head to your collection, the My Cards page, which is the second option of the five tabs at the bottom of the main screen.</p><p>However, this page defaults to hiding which cards you don’t yet have, so you now want to tap the entirely unlabeled, anonymous toggle near the top, to the left of the search button. That done, your collection now shows all the empty spaces for cards you’ve yet to gather. In the spaces where a card is missing, you’ll instead see its card number on a gray background.</p><p>Tap on one of those gray tiles and where it would usually show you the larger version of your card, instead you’ll see the back of a card with the words “Not obtained” across the middle.  But now, top right, you’ll also see a gray outline of a heart, with the <em>teeny </em>word “Wishlist” below.</p><figure id="" data-id="e2c42e249ccf90c1831e29aae44ff364" data-recommend-id="image://e2c42e249ccf90c1831e29aae44ff364" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A not obtained Pokemon card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A not obtained Pokemon card." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e2c42e249ccf90c1831e29aae44ff364" data-recommend-id="image://e2c42e249ccf90c1831e29aae44ff364" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A not obtained Pokemon card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Tap the heart and it’ll turn pink, and you’ll be told (disappearing before you can read it), “You wishlisted this card.

Now, if you head to the Wonder Pick page (the first tab, then the option bottom-left), any card that appears in any of the available packs that you don’t yet have will be marked with a pink heart, top right. This makes life <em>so</em> much easier when selecting a pick, saving you from having to go back and forth between tabs, or trying to hold it all in your memory.</p><h2 id="h1214"><a id=""></a>What wishlisting doesn’t do</h2><figure id="" data-id="0ebc203997b061ad3ea60a477921e5af" data-recommend-id="image://0ebc203997b061ad3ea60a477921e5af" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="No gaps in a collection of alt-art cards." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="No gaps in a collection of alt-art cards." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0ebc203997b061ad3ea60a477921e5af" data-recommend-id="image://0ebc203997b061ad3ea60a477921e5af" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="No gaps in a collection of alt-art cards." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This feature could be a whole lot better.

Why it doesn’t is frankly mysterious, given it’s exactly where it’s needed most. Switching back and forth between this and your collection is even more frustrating, because it’s so many silly taps apart, and the Pack Point Exchange doesn’t even have the quick-scroll button that every other screen features!</p><p>Another peculiarity is that when you flip that toggle to show missing cards, it only works for the main set, up to 226/226, Lt. Surge. Once you enter the territory of alt-arts, cards 227 to 286, it doesn’t show the gaps at all. This is maddening! It means there’s no way to wishlist any of these cards!</p><p>Hopefully, as the game gets patched, such oddities will begin to be ironed out, and perhaps the game will even tell people that wishlisting exists at all!</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s a stormy night in the early 2000s and your friend has sent you a link to “Night Call,” a horror game that he found online. As you play, strange things start happening in your apartment. Something is terribly wrong with the game.</p><p><em>Among Ashes</em> features an innovative, meta-framing device in which players will experience a full retro-inspired first-person survival horror game within another first-person horror game, in addition to a host of unique presentational touches, surprises, mechanics and puzzles that transport players back to the turn of the millennium—providing a terrifying dose of nostalgia in the process.</p><p>In the retro-styled survival-horror “Night Call,” players will explore Stoker manor; solving puzzles and fighting off the nightmarish creatures that have infested its labyrinthian halls. In the real world, however, they’ll be haunted by the dark entities that have latched on to this strange game, as they frantically try to unravel the mystery behind the game and its enigmatic creator.</p><p>Whatever you do… KEEP PLAYING.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

                <p dir="ltr">As we enter end-of-the-year award season, superstar Post Malone has revealed his current favorite game--Hunt: Showdown. The musician geeked out about the FPS with the game's creative director, calling it "the best game."</p><p dir="ltr">Spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/its-the-best-game-post-malone-reveals-he-has-nearly-400-hours-in-hunt-showdown-proving-the-songwriter-has-impeccable-fps-taste/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>, Malone appeared in a video (seen below) with Hunt: Showdown creative director Scott Lussier on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CywILj8E8rM" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the game's YouTube channel</a>. The musician explained that his buddy turned him onto Hunt: Showdown, and he's loved it ever since. "Whenever I'm on the road and can't play, I'm always missing it," Malone said. "And I've got about 400 hours on it."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CywILj8E8rM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CywILj8E8rM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Malone noted that he liked how "you can body somebody in one shot" in Hunt: Showdown, as well as offering guns and skins that are "so sick." The Grammy Award-nominated musician--behind hits like "White Iverson," "Sunflower," and "Rockstar"--basically implied it blew his mind when he first tried out "Necro" in the game.</p><p dir="ltr">This isn't the first time Malone has expressed his video game love or been associated with a big-name game. For instance, last year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-x-post-malone-event-features-new-ltm-themed-cosmetics/1100-6518852/" data-ref-id="1100-6518852">Apex Legends partnered with Malone for a special in-game event</a>, including skins based on the musician. Then, earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/backbones-new-translucent-controller-is-a-very-unexpected-crossover/1100-6524272/" data-ref-id="1100-6524272">Backbone released a limited-edition Post Malone controller</a>. Last but not least, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/post-malone-now-holds-the-one-ring-of-power-magic-the-gathering-card/1100-6516474/" data-ref-id="1100-6516474">Malone is clearly a Lord of the Rings nerd</a>, as well.</p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hunt-showdown-is-having-its-best-day-ever-on-steam-following-ambitious-1896-update/1100-6525834/" data-ref-id="1100-6525834">Hunt: Showdown had its best day ever on Steam</a> in August after the launch of the 1896 update. Developer Crytek overhauled the shooter's visuals and ended support for Xbox One and PS4, though players got free upgrades to the Xbox Series X|S and PS5 versions. Last month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hunt-showdown-gets-its-first-crossover-character-with-this-legendary-horror-villain/1100-6527323/" data-ref-id="1100-6527323">the game got its first crossover character with Scream's Ghost Face</a>. Hunt: Showdown first launched on Steam Early Access in 2018.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/shenmue-iii-publishing-rights-transferred-to-inin-games/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/shenmue-iii-publishing-rights-transferred-to-inin-games.1041762/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/shenmue-iii-publishing-rights-transferred-to-inin-games/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Previously, Shenmue III's publishing rights were Deep Silver's, a company that has previously published titles such as Dead Island: Riptide, Metro Redux, and most recently, Metro Awakening.&nbsp; Shenmue III was first released for PlayStation 4 and PC via Epic Games Store in 2019, with a Steam and GOG release following a year later. Now, the publishing rights have transferred from Deep Silver over to <a href="https://www.iningames.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ININ Games</a>, a publisher known for bridging the gap between Japanese media and the West. They have published titles such as Air Twister, Parasol Stars, and Rainbow Cotton.</p>
<p>"Following the previous collaboration on Air Twister, this will deepen the relationship with the legendary creator Yu Suzuki and his team. Known for our commitment to celebrating beloved titles and bringing them to new platforms, ININ Games is excited to shepherd Shenmue III into its next phase," says the announcement from ININ Games. The transfer of publishing rights coincides with two milestones within the Shenmue franchise. The transfer took place during the 25th anniversary of the Shenmue franchise and the fifth anniversary of Shenmue III.</p>
<p>"We at ININ Games are honored to carry the Shenmue torch forward during such a significant moment in the series' history. As we reflect on two decades of innovation and passion, we remain dedicated to preserving and sharing the journey of Ryo Hazuki with both long-time fans and newcomers."</p>
<p>At the moment, there haven't been any announcements as to what the plans are with Shenmue III or the overall franchise as a whole, but the transfer is still relatively fresh, meaning they need time to plan out their announcements and plans for the game going forward. However, they have promised that there will be upcoming announcements, as they signed off on their announcement.</p>
<p>"With this transfer, the story of Shenmue is far from over. We have exciting plans to celebrate these anniversaries, ensuring that this beloved series continues to thrive and inspire. Keep an eye out for upcoming announcements as we unveil our vision for the next phase of Shenmue's legacy."</p>
<p>Currently, the title is only available on PC and PlayStation 4. However, with the transfer of the rights, it's possible that this game and <a href="https://wccftech.com/shenmue-iv-still-in-planning-phase-needs-a-partner-to-be-made-ue5-remakes-of-first-two-games-might-be-fun/">any future titles</a> within the franchise will be seen on other platforms, such as Xbox Series X|S and maybe the Nintendo Switch.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Immersion of Playing Retro Games in Nature: The Scenic Gamer Interview]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/interviews/scenic-gamer-interview-playing-retro-games-in-nature</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-immersion-of-playing-retro-games-in-nature-the-scenic-gamer-interview.1041759/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/interviews/scenic-gamer-interview-playing-retro-games-in-nature<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Over the past four decades, video games have owed so much of their success to their ability to immerse players. As industry enthusiasts, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/firewatch-outdoors-grief-loss" rel="nofollow">we talk about immersion a lot</a>, and we're always seeking new ways to improve on that: better graphics, dynamic mechanics, more intelligent NPCs, and realistic enemy AI.</p>

<p>All of these updates look to the future, but how do we get immersed in the past? That's what Noah Enright of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@thescenicgamerofficial" rel="nofollow">The Scenic Gamer</a> aims to do.&nbsp;We had the chance to sit down with Enright&nbsp;and talk a bit about The Scenic Gamer TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram channels, as well as his success streaming on Twitch.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The concept is simple enough: bring a CRT television out into the world and play games where they're set, such as <em>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</em> on a sandy beach or <em>Super Mario Baseball</em> above the MLB playoffs.&nbsp;</p>
<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed//E8bVvw6yvLg"></iframe></p>

<p>When I discovered Enright's content on TikTok, it resonated with me immediately. I love getting immersed in the stories I'm experiencing, whether that's downloading&nbsp;<em>Firewatch</em>&nbsp;onto my Switch to play while on a camping trip or enjoying&nbsp;<em>Sea of Thieves</em>&nbsp;by a local beach. Modern gaming has made these moments easier to obtain, but there's still a rather large roadblock to bringing these moments to retro games: the hardware and lack of portability.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Emulation is one answer to this problem, but Enright goes the extra mile to bring out a retro TV and console to different locations so that he can enjoy these games on original hardware while appreciating the sights and sounds of nature.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I've been a life-long gamer, and I've always wanted to do something with that besides just gaming," Enright&nbsp;said. "I play retro games in the most scenic and amazing places, and places the games are based on. I came up with the idea when I was at a garage sale one day and decided to buy an old retro TV for a dollar."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Though Enright&nbsp;launched The Scenic Gamer accounts just a couple months ago, he has already amassed over <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thescenicgamerofficial" rel="nofollow">36,000 followers on Instagram</a> and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@thescenicgamer" rel="nofollow">16,000 followers on TikTok</a>.</p>

<p>In tandem with his brother, who works as his manager and editor, he has been able to grow the channel at an incredible rate.&nbsp;When asked about preparing his setup, I found his answer relatable to many millennial gamers like myself.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I've been a collector for quite some time," he said. "So I already had all the retro game stuff."&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-scenic-gamer-marioi-kart.jpg?itok=SWJJvyoP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-scenic-gamer-marioi-kart.jpg?itok=7JUnuylK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Image courtesy of Noah Enright</figcaption></figure><h2>What Games Has The Scenic Gamer Brought Into the World So Far?&nbsp;</h2>

<p>So where exactly did Enright's<strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong>travels bring him?&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"I've been to some pretty amazing places so far playing some pretty cool games." —Noah Enright, The Scenic Gamer&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An avid baseball fan, Enright knew he had to celebrate the Dodgers making it to the playoffs and the World Series in true gaming fashion, making some new friends along the way.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I was playing <em>Mario Baseball</em> above Dodgers stadium. This family came up to me and asked if they could play with me. So I was playing with these kids above a playoff game and enjoying <em>Mario Baseball</em>! You kind of have to get out of your shell to play these games in public." &nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/noah-and-his-scenic-gamer-setup.jpg?itok=LGEwsBJk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/noah-and-his-scenic-gamer-setup.jpg?itok=qzLvI6LM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Image courtesy of Noah Enright</figcaption></figure><p>Local to Los Angeles, Noah has plenty of great scenery nearby to work with, but these projects have motivated him to travel to other exotic locations.&nbsp;From a local Wendy's to far-away national parks, this adventure has motivated Enright to step out of his comfort zone and explore incredible places around the country.</p>

<p>"The farthest I've been has been spots in Utah, that's three states away, and we went to Zion National Park," Noah said.&nbsp;"We got a campsite and set up the TV and GameCube by a valley and some mountains and made the perfect backdrop for some of those games. We played <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time" rel="nofollow"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</em></a> – that opening was absolutely beautiful. And we streamed <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/lego-star-wars-skywalker-saga" rel="nofollow"><em>LEGO Star Wars</em></a> under the stars."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Noah told me how growing up, he and his brother would play <em>LEGO Star Wars </em>games together, so having the opportunity to do that in the scenery of Zion National Park was amazing. This particular trip took place on Enright's&nbsp;birthday weekend, making for an extra-special memory to celebrate another trip around the sun.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-scenic-gamer-setup-outdoors.jpg?itok=1BW1rFPh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-scenic-gamer-setup-outdoors.jpg?itok=HNqvMNxK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Celebrating a birthday playing retro games at Zion National Park.&nbsp;Image courtesy of Noah Enright</figcaption></figure><h2>Power &amp; Portability: Behind the Scenes with The Scenic Gamer</h2>

<p>One of the most common questions for The Scenic Gamer is how does he power his setup? A portable battery covers his power needs, but getting to the different locations is still a challenge. He loads everything he needs into a big wagon—TV, console, controllers, recording equipment, snacks—and hauls them to where he needs to get to.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Pulling the wagon through the sand is tough," he said. "I've been to some mountains where I've had to pull it through weeds and all sorts of hills."&nbsp;</p>

<p>As one might expect, the natural world isn't always forgiving when it comes to the retro tech he's carrying around.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I was at the beach streaming <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/super-mario-3d-all-stars" rel="nofollow"><em>Super Mario Sunshine</em></a> and it got really windy and sand blew everywhere. It got into my GameCube; these are the unspoken things you don't see that are behind the camera that we need to deal with."</p>

<p>The GameCube Enright&nbsp;uses is the one he's had since childhood. Unfortunately, the sand blowing into it did create some technical problems, but he's in the process of taking the GameCube apart to see if he can fix it.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The Scenic Gamer Looks to the Future&nbsp;</h2>

<p>When asked of future plans, he&nbsp;very excitedly told me about some of the places he hopes to get to someday.</p>

<p>"I would love to travel across the United States and do a tour of different games in different spots," he said. "And out of the country – Japan is top of my list of places to go. A lot of the games I'm playing originated there. I would love to just get out there to some of the big Japanese cities and in the countryside to play games there."&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you'd like to follow Enright's journey and cheer him on along the way, you can check out any of his social media channels. Most recently, he traveled around Los Angeles playing&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto V&nbsp;</em>in the real-life locations from the game.&nbsp;</p>

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Much has been made about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/avowed/" data-ref-id="5000-516154">Avowed</a>'s approach to its setting, the Living Lands, and the fact that it is not an open-world game. Instead, Avowed's world is made up of "open zones"--large geographical areas that are interconnected with other large areas, much like a previous game from developer Obsidian, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-outer-worlds/" data-ref-id="5000-490219">The Outer Worlds</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">At least in the first of Avowed's areas, that means that Obsidian has put a focus on making sure that the entire space provides interesting adventures. Whether you're chasing side quests handed out by random characters populating the Living Lands' biggest city, Paradis, or just rambling through the area to see what's there, there are plenty of rewards for exploration. There are bandit camps, ruins, half-destroyed hovels, and groups of dead soldiers surrounding the corpses of huge bears. The Living Lands is a place dense with stories and thick with secrets to uncover, and even wandering aimlessly through the wilderness feels like an adventure unto itself.</p><p dir="ltr">"We have these open zones, and they're expansive, they have a lot of breadth of them, but they're manageable enough for our team size to be able to handcraft every part of them and to fill them to the adequate amount of density that we want in that environment," said region director Berto Ritger in an interview with GameSpot. "So we don't want big, big, long expanses, of just grass, that has nothing going on. There are moments of serenity and calm in the environment, but there's always a little bit of something. And we try to have enough variety as well with those things where you're not finding the same corpse of the potion in his hand over and over."</p><p dir="ltr">We recently played the first two hours of Avowed during a preview event at Obsidian, which provided a sense of the way your path through the game's world begins to unfold. Notably, it's not long before you wind up with more or less complete freedom about what to do and how to do it, and even in the early going, Avowed provides you with a ton of freedom about how you want to approach the game, its story, and its combat systems.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4403052-ss_f8b3cc0098a149d3a59cfdbe57fbe979d5b94cb2.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4403052" data-ratio="0.5627931214174" data-width="1919" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4403052-ss_f8b3cc0098a149d3a59cfdbe57fbe979d5b94cb2.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4403052"></a><figcaption>Avowed has a bunch of open zones instead of one giant open world.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4403052-ss_f8b3cc0098a149d3a59cfdbe57fbe979d5b94cb2.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">After delving into Avowed's expansive character creator, you're thrown into the world. Obsidian has previously detailed the setup for the story: You play a character named the Envoy, traveling to the Living Lands by the orders of the leader of a major nation of humans and elves, the Aedyr Empire. The empire has interest in the Living Lands, a somewhat isolated island known for its harsh wilderness and harsher denizens. The place has a sort of Wild West frontier vibe--people head there when they are searching for a better life, or when they want to disappear. It's not a completely uncivilized place, but plenty of the people who've made the Living Lands their home are the kind of rough-and-tumble folks you wouldn't want to tangle with.</p><p dir="ltr">Into this individualistic, slightly lawless society comes the Aedyr Empire, establishing a foothold in the Living Lands that the locals view suspiciously as the first steps of colonization and the establishment of order. As the emperor's Envoy, most people immediately view you with anything ranging from mild distrust to outright hostility.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4403053-ss_c012446d8a0b30d9d7763a5089614799d0423284.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4403053" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4403053-ss_c012446d8a0b30d9d7763a5089614799d0423284.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4403053"></a><figcaption>You don't pick a class that determines your fighting style--you're free to fight as you please.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4403053-ss_c012446d8a0b30d9d7763a5089614799d0423284.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">But the Living Lands also have a major problem: the Dream Scourge, a "soul plague" that's infecting people, wildlife, and the island itself. Essentially, those afflicted succumb to madness and fungal growths, and with no indication as to what it even is, much less how to stop it, the emperor has dispatched you to conduct an investigation and find a way to deal with the problem. The Dream Scourge is a major threat to life in the Living Lands, and you get a first-hand look at the effects of the madness it inflicts when the Aedyran outpost--filled with your allies--fires its cannons on your approaching Aedyran ship. You survive the wreck and find another crewmate on the beach, and together head to the outpost to find a way to continue your journey to the Living Lands.</p><p dir="ltr">This early tutorial section is mostly about fights with Xaurip lizard people who've taken up residence in the outpost after all the soldiers seem to have lost their minds and murdered each other. Right from the start, Avowed emphasizes its open class approach to combat. Part of character creation is picking your backstory as the Envoy, with options like setting yourself as a war hero or arcane scholar, and what you pick determines your starting weapon. You're not locked into that choice, however, and as soon as you start finding other options, like spears, pistols, swords, shields, and spell-slinging grimoires, you can wield them with no prerequisites or requirements.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4403054-ss_3a8669c117eb89ec45e1f0ab7bbe05ce24c80696.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4403054" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4403054-ss_3a8669c117eb89ec45e1f0ab7bbe05ce24c80696.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4403054"></a><figcaption>The demo I played saw me deal with a quite a few of Avowed's lizard-like Xaurip.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4403054-ss_3a8669c117eb89ec45e1f0ab7bbe05ce24c80696.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">I previously got to try Avowed's combat during an hour-long preview at a Los Angeles Gamescom event, but that demo provided a shorter and more focused look at fighting within the game, with character builds that were set ahead of time by developers. Starting from scratch, things felt a lot more open. I quickly tossed aside my starting dagger for a sword and grimoire, so I was able to slice through enemies or blast them with a flamethrower from my hand, watching their health tick away as they smoldered and charred.</p><p dir="ltr">Fighting enemies is snappy, fluid, and cinematic. As Obsidian worked out how to do first-person combat that felt good, while also utilizing elements from its top-down Pillars of Eternity games (Avowed and the Pillars series are set in the same world), developers found that getting the right feel for combat meant tuning the timings of attacks so they became quicker, making the whole system feel more responsive.</p><p dir="ltr">"Because we started with [a] first-person [perspective], first-person almost necessitates a little bit of brevity in what you do, because if it's third-person, you can see everything that's happening," said senior combat designer Max Matzenbacher in an interview with GameSpot. "With a limited perspective, there's your hands, and there's only so much that you can do there. If you lose control of your character because they're recovering for a long time, that's a major forcing function of just making it feel responsive."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4403055-ss_1ce7a3cf720bdb29e2c6bf46e3610257c419b2ec.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4403055" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4403055-ss_1ce7a3cf720bdb29e2c6bf46e3610257c419b2ec.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4403055"></a><figcaption>Each of the game's many zones are quite distinct.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4403055-ss_1ce7a3cf720bdb29e2c6bf46e3610257c419b2ec.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">There are a lot of options for any given fight, too. You can store two weapon loadouts at a time and swap between them instantly, even mid-attack combo, which means it's easy to alternate between two completely different setups. Hitting enemies damages their health while also pushing up a meter that tracks their stamina; when it maxes out, your opponent will be stunned, leaving them open for a weapon-specific special move that triggers automatically for a ton of damage. Stealth is also always an option--enemies often won't detect you right away and you can sneak up and clobber them from behind by moving through tall grass or avoiding their sightlines. And there are environmental elements you can utilize to help you out as well, like fiery berries you can shoot with a bow to start a blaze.</p><p dir="ltr">In both previews I've played, I've vibed pretty well with Avowed's combat--although even in the tutorial area, it can be tough. The moment-to-moment thrust is in managing a stamina meter that dictates your attacks and, more critically, your quick, agile dodges that can get you out of harm's way. Some enemies come at you with unblockable attacks, leaving you no option but to get clear, and staying alive means a lot of sidestepping to slip past a blow and land one of your own. Most attacks land quickly so you can strike back and then get clear or block an incoming attack, although you can also gamble with stronger charged-up blows using most weapons. Everything is quick and fluid, though, and the ability to constantly dual-wield weapons, whether two of the same blade or a main weapon like a spear and an off-hand weapon like a pistol or grimoire, means it always feels like you have something up your sleeve.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4403056-ss_b881e3b01586fdccabfae170af7d12b9e09d58e1.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4403056" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4403056-ss_b881e3b01586fdccabfae170af7d12b9e09d58e1.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4403056"></a><figcaption>Creepy crawlies of all shapes and sizes populate Avowed's world.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4403056-ss_b881e3b01586fdccabfae170af7d12b9e09d58e1.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">While you're given a lot of freedom in how you want to engage with enemies, the leveling system is more structured. You can spend skill points in any of several skill trees, each named for a different character class, like Fighter or Ranger. That makes it a little easier to get a sense of how you're building your character along traditional lines, without Avowed locking you into a particular class. You also unlock special abilities that run on cooldown timers, and these give you easy ways to mix together the capabilities of different disciplines without really worrying about the skill tree at all. For instance, you can get the Fighter's dash-tackle ability, which you can use to wallop enemies for a big stun, or the Ranger's entangling magic vines that temporarily root enemies to a specific spot.</p><p dir="ltr">Uncovering the mystery of what happened in the outpost quickly brings you to your first major RPG choice in Avowed. You discover a local resident of the Living Lands locked inside with a dead soldier. As a representative of the Aedyr Empire, she's immediately distrustful of you and gives you a sense of how the residents of the island see outsiders. Your crewmate doesn't think it's a great idea to let the smuggler out, but you need a boat to reach the Living Lands proper. Whether you choose to trust the smuggler or leave her to rot, however, is up to you.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4403057-ss_024c5d99b7a9e0af7e0b125594a9309a16fc3b99.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4403057" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4403057-ss_024c5d99b7a9e0af7e0b125594a9309a16fc3b99.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4403057"></a><figcaption>The fungal-like disease spreading through the world is an ongoing problem for your character.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4403057-ss_024c5d99b7a9e0af7e0b125594a9309a16fc3b99.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">With the smuggler in tow and some more sneaking around and assassinating Xaurips, we eventually made it to Paradis. After parting with your crewmate pal and reluctant smuggler buddy, your journey in Avowed gets its real start, and almost immediately, you're let off the leash to do as you will. Landing at the Paradis docks, you're met by a local militia representative, a put-upon guard captain who makes it sarcastically clear she's not thrilled to see you, and Kai, a guy who's looking for the "clavager"--essentially Paradis's mayor, such as there is one. It turns out that the Aedyran ambassador, who you need to speak to, has headed out to investigate some possible Dream Scourge-related weirdness with the clavager, so Kai decides to join you in going to track them down.</p><p dir="ltr">Paradis is a big place, but for the main point of civilization in the Living Lands, it immediately gives a strange impression. It's both a bustling city full of people and a place that looks like it's half-collapsing, combining new structures and crumbling ruins.</p><p dir="ltr">"One of the things that I was trying to say, the story I was trying to tell, was that this is a really, truly untamed, untamable place," said lead environment artist Dennis Presnell. "There have been numerous civilizations that have tried to stake their claim, and they have come and gone, and you see evidence of that at the start of the game. When you get to the docks, you see it's new built on old. But even the new looks like it's old, and it's trying to weather the storm, but it's barely holding on. And when you get to Paradis, you see the same thing. It's new built on old, and it's a collection of different cultures that are all trying to make their way in what is probably the safest and most secure place in all of the Living Lands, and yet, it's not."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4403059-ss_429bef4d49d33166174e2e9c66619b15c1b1f89d.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4403059" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4403059-ss_429bef4d49d33166174e2e9c66619b15c1b1f89d.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4403059"></a><figcaption>The people of the Living Lands don't like the protagonist very much.

As you set out, you start to get a sense of what the Living Lands are really like. Presnell described the location as more of a living organism than a location, and part of Avowed's personality is how it treats the Living Lands as something of a strange place that's not easily understood.</p><p dir="ltr">"Treating the environment itself as a character is so helpful, and that's true for any component of the game, because you're trying to empathize with a piece of land or a particular tree or whatever, but kind of putting yourself in the position of, 'Okay, if I was this tree and I was mad that I had new neighbors and I had the agency to do something about it, how would I go about that?'" art director Matt Hansen said. "And so there's a lot of that that's going into it, as far as how to push that sense of a weird and wondrous frontier."</p><p dir="ltr">Side quests are available immediately--I ran into a woman not far from the docks who needed a hand with Xaurips invading her house on some nearby sea cliffs. After clearing them out, I found a strange mural they'd painted in her living room. When I confronted the woman about it, she told the story of how she has dreams about the Xaurip and is worried that, more or less, the Xaurip is her literal soulmate. I offered her some useless words of encouragement, took my reward, and wandered off, wondering what the hell that could have been all about. (I asked developers about that quest, and apparently there's more to the tale of the Xaurip soulmate.)</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="917001617" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

"Companions will react to those things in real time. Those choices will also heavily impact individual characters, groups of characters, and entire settlements, factions of people, and the states of the regions that you go through. They will also impact the choices that are even available to you. Later in the game, you'll be locked or locked out of or presented with new choices based on the choices you made much earlier in the game."</p><p dir="ltr">Even on the short walk to the next location for the main story, though, there was plenty to see. The area around Paradis is objectively not <em>huge</em>, as I discovered wandering around it, but it's not especially small, either. Importantly, though, it feels bigger than it is, thanks to how much interesting stuff Obsidian has packed into it. Cutting to one side of the area, I stumbled on a tall ruined building or tower of some kind. It wasn't marked by an icon or any other clues, but just looked interesting. Climbing in, I found tripwires that triggered huge swinging blades, a set of barely working traps designed to keep people out that were now exposed to sunlight and easy to dodge. Further on, I was attacked by phantoms, which look like spectral, smokey ghosts, and killing them allowed me to reach a chest filled with a high-quality piece of armor. The entire affair took around 10 minutes and was totally optional, but exploring that little tower was a rewarding diversion that gave a little more of a sense of the Living Lands.</p><div

this content!</p></div><p dir="ltr">Avowed appears to be littered with situations like this. I found a decrepit, abandoned house not far away on the river, where journals told me about the struggles of the farmer who used to live there. A little way down the stream was another set of ruins where bandits had set up camp. They promptly killed me as Kai yelled in the background to warn me my weak starting armor couldn't handle their much better weapons. And that was all just stuff I happened across on my way back to town.</p><p dir="ltr">The two-hour demo we played also included some early bits of Avowed's story--you track down the ambassador, have a weird encounter with a voiceless entity that seems to be the spirit of the Living Lands, and kill a huge bear afflicted with the Dream Scourge that's angry and covered in beautiful, horrific mushrooms.</p><p dir="ltr">Those points are compelling, but maybe even more so are the little things that Obsidian has seeded throughout the Living Lands that you might miss, like that ailing farmhouse or those weird ruins. That also goes for the time you can spend with your companions; it's possible to set up camp at certain places where you can tend to things like improving your gear, and during those moments, you can also talk to your pals about whatever's going on in the plot, their backstories, and more. Even 10 steps off the dock, I was surprised at how deep and expansive my camp conversations with Kai could be. There's a ton of story material in these moments, but it's all optional, allowing you to dig as deeply into the narrative and characters as you want.</p><p dir="ltr">"Ultimately, what we want is for the player to make the experience that they want to have, and that means being able to dig really deep into conversations if they want to, or to minimally engage with them," said narrative designer Kate Dollarhyde. "And that does, you know, create some design challenges. But ultimately, I think having content that's missable or skippable or that can be done out of order is ultimately better than the best, most polished linear presentation, because at the end of the day, it just feels more personal. And to me as an RPG player, that is almost always more important to me than a really linear experience."</p><p dir="ltr">Though we still have only seen a small portion of Avowed, it's the freedom to explore and the density of things to find, whether in combat, out in the world, or in conversations, that has me most intrigued. Avowed feels packed with things to discover for yourself, whether you're following the story or making your own way through the world. What we've seen of the Living Lands is full of life, and Obsidian's willingness to give you so much to discover that you'll miss some makes Avowed seem like the kind of game it'll be great to get lost in.</p>

            <p>Uncork'd Entertainment has acquired distribution rights to 'George A. Romero's Resident Evil' - an investigative documentary which looks into the filmmaker's unrealised film adaptation of the video game series - in the US and Canada.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3840097/george-a-romeros-resident-evil-documentary-releasing-in-january-2025-exclusive/">Bloody Disgusting</a>, the documentary has been directed and co-written by Brandon Salisbury. It takes us back to 1998, when Constantin Film set out to bring Resident Evil to the big screen with the help of Romero. On its release, the documentary will include archival footage, as well as interviews with those who were involved in the unreleased film, going into the reasons why it was never made.</p>
<p>"George Romero gave birth to modern horror, the modern zombie, and ultimately Resident Evil," said Salisbury. "I am honoured to bring fans the untold story of his most important unmade project, to celebrate the legacy of the man that inspired me to pursue filmmaking as a career. I hope fans enjoy this ultimate experience in survival horror."</p>
