			<p>Today, MercurySteam has revealed the previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/mercurysteams-new-dark-fantasy-arpg-blades-of-fire-to-be-unveiled-this-thursday/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> Blades of Fire game. From its looks, it will be a single player action/adventure in the vein of Sony Santa Monica's God of War titles. The protagonist is one Aran de Lira, the firstborn of the King's Ward. In this fantasy world, the newly crowned Queen Nerea has cast a spell that turns steel to stone. Only her army of abominations wields the divine metal against which other blades shatter.</p>
<p>As Aran, players must find forging scrolls, develop the main character's blacksmithing skills, and craft weapons to suit their favorite fighting style. The chosen weapon family and the materials used while forging it will affect characteristics such as weight, length, durability, penetration, and edge quality.</p>
<p>There are seven different weapon families in Blades of Fire, as well as over thirty unique Forge Scrolls, allowing for a great number of combinations. Picking the right weapon for the job, depending on the enemy's armor, will be critical. The developers promise a unique and challenging combat system that allows players to target specific parts of the enemy's body.</p>
<p>On his journey to liberate the land, Aran won't be alone. His companion, Adso, will be crucial to your adventure as he speaks the ancient language of the Forgers. He'll also provide helpful tips on how to defeat enemies by analyzing them and making notes in his chronicles. It sounds like players will need the info since Blades of Fire features over fifty enemy types, including the Queen's guards, creatures, undead, and more. Each enemy has its own unique attack style, weapon and armor. Throughout the story, Aran and Adso will explore epic environments, including huge castles and labyrinthine palaces.</p>
<p>505 Games president Neil Ralley said:</p>
<p><em>MercurySteam’s pedigree for creating unique and beloved games is just one of the many reasons we’re thrilled to partner with them on Blades of Fire. Their gaming system that transforms weapons customization into an outstanding combat experience is astounding, as is their commitment to telling the best story possible. We can’t wait to share it with the world.</em></p>
<p>The good news is that the game isn't far off at all. It's set to launch on May 22 for PC (via the Epic Games Store), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. The game's pricing is technically $59.99, though there is a 10% pre-order discount. Additionally, pre-order customers will get two in-game armors for Aran as well as additional forging materials.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam Next Fest is live</a> from now until March 3rd, celebrating upcoming games with dozens of playable demos. For many games with big aspirations, getting a demo into the hands of future players is crucial during Next Fest, and some are having greater success than others. </p>



<p>Here are the demos that are attracting the most players during Steam Next Fest for February 2025.</p>



<h2 id="h-most-played-demos-at-steam-next-fest-february-2025">Most Played Demos at Steam Next Fest (February 2025)</h2>



<p>Player numbers are all current as of February 27th.</p>



<h3 id="h-mecha-break">Mecha BREAK</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>With 317,522 players at its peak, the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2870990/Mecha_BREAK_Demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mecha BREAK demo</a> is greatly outpacing the other demos available during this Next Fest. The third-person multiplayer mecha shooter has become very popular with the international audience, though critical reactions have been mixed. Many players enjoy the mix of games modes and the numerous customization options, but the demo still fields a Mostly Negative review on Steam, which is attributed primarily to the game’s monetization and server issues. Insider Gaming was invited to the NA offices of developer Amazing Seasun Games, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-interview-mecha-break-creator/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got to talk to Mecha BREAK’s creator about the game’s development</a>.</p>



<h3 id="h-fellowship">Fellowship</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2352620/Fellowship/">Fellowship</a>, which has peaked at 16,721 players, is billed as a game for players that want to jump right into end-game dungeon content like you’d see in World of Warcraft. The game features “endlessly scaling dungeon runs,” and end-game WoW fans will feel right at home with the game’s user interface and group finder mechanic. Groups will need to kill packs of enemies to unlock the boss fight, which will feature unique mechanics and challenges that a team will need to overcome.</p>



<h3 id="h-among-us-3d">Among Us 3D</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3168600/Among_Us_3D/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Among Us 3D</a>, which has peaked at 6,729 players, is exactly what you think it is if you’ve ever seen Among Us before. 3D uses the same first-person perspective as Among Us VR, but without the need of a VR headset. Among Us 3D features built-in proximity chat, meaning you won’t need to use other programs to manually activate it. There will also be some new and returning mini-game tasks. The game will launch with the Skeld II and Polus Point maps from Among Us VR.</p>



<h3 id="h-roadcraft">RoadCraft</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3456580/RoadCraft_Demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RoadCraft</a>, which peaked at 12,559 players, is developed by the same Saber Interactive who made Snowunner and Mudrunner. But rather than operating a vehicle offroad, RoadCraft tasks you with rebuilding and reconstructing areas that have been ravaged by natural disasters. In RoadCraft, players will be able to unlock over 40 vehicles to help them replace roads, bridges, and other critical pieces of infrastructure.</p>



<p>While these demos may be the most popular, there are still dozens, it not hundreds of playable demos you should try during this Next Fest. And don’t fret, because <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/full-2025-steam-sales-schedule-revealed-by-valve/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another Next Fest is coming in October</a>.</p>

            <p>
Some 35 years after experiencing an overwhelming sense of mild disappointment thanks to Ocean Software's Terminator 2: Judgment Day on the ZX Spectrum 128K, I get to tell you a new video game adaptation of James Cameron's movie hit is coming this September. But despite the furious march of technology, this one's also going to be 2D.
</p>
<p>
Terminator 2D: No Fate is the work of developer Bitmap Bureau - the studio behind the likes of Xeno Crisis and 88 Heroes - and it's looking to deliver some good old-fashioned arcade-style side-scrolling action inspired by "iconic scenes from Terminator 2" and "original scenarios".
</p>
<p>
Its obvious selling point is its rather strikingly animated pixel art, but - as per Terminator 2D's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkMFYMG3QLw">announcement trailer</a> - it's also got a bit where you get to wander around a bar as the T-800, smashing up baddies while unabashedly in the nude. As it happens though, the T-800 (nude or otherwise) is just one of several characters you can play as in Terminator 2D.
</p>

<p>
Bitmap Bureau say the T-800 has been designed to emphasise his weight and power, with moves including a devastating shoulder barge. And while he's slower than Terminator 2D's other playable characters - Sarah Conner and John Connor - he also has high durability. As for Sarah, she's agile and reactive, excelling at melee combat with a sliding attack. However, she can also deploy her laser sight, locking her in place but significantly boosting damage.
</p>

<p>
John Connor, meanwhile, will be playable as an adult during the game's Future War missions. He's not as agile as Sarah, but can evade attacks with a tactical roll, and also emphasises mid-to-long-range combat, with a plasma rifle, pipe bombs, and three ammo types. And, of course, the iconic T-1000 is back as the game's main adversary - liquid metal abilities included.
</p>
<p>
Terminator 2D: No Fate - which also includes multiple endings, leaving players to decide humanity's future - launches for PlayStation 5, Playstation 4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Switch, and PC (via Steam and Epic) on 5th September.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/steam-users-worry-good-next-fest-games-are-being-crowded-out-by-ai-slop-but-the-real-problem-is-more-complicated.1121196/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/steam-next-fest-demos-ai-disclosure-algorithm<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam Next Fest</a> is in full swing, and the hopefully-washed masses are once again partaking of more demos than any one person can reasonably get through. This time around, though, there’s been a recurring theme to people’s hours spent sifting diamonds from the rough: AI art.&nbsp;</p><p>Across sites like Twitter and Bluesky, numerous Steam users have turned up their noses at unpleasant surprises populating their Next Fest feeds.</p><p>"Looking at the Steam Next Fest page, it's so tiresome how many games with AI art there are," The CRPG Book editor Felipe Pepe <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/felipepepe.bsky.social/post/3lixnwg5v4k2w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> on Bluesky. "And it's always the same crap: generic anime girl, grimdark fantasy guy with those 'Balenciaga AI' faces, or obviously fake pixel art."</p><p>"This Steam Next Fest has probably been the most AI infested ever, and it’s all been voice acting and art more than anything," a modder who goes by the handle Manny Calavera <a href="https://x.com/MannyCalavera12/status/1894395629377655087" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> on Twitter. "It's rough."</p><p>This week, Valve also added a mandatory AI disclosure feature to game’s Steam pages, which made headlines when it forced Activision to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/call-of-duty/call-of-duty-admits-its-using-generative-ai-to-help-develop-some-in-game-assets-and-suddenly-all-those-poorly-made-calling-cards-make-sense/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">finally admit</a> something that players have <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-is-already-taking-jobs-in-the-video-game-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">long suspected</a>: AI cosmetics are becoming an increasingly prolific part of the world’s most popular first-person shooter. A quick perusal of Steam Next Fest’s “Simulation” section, especially, yields many similar disclosures from games with titles like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3533100/Wrap_House_Simulator/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Wrap House Simulator</em></a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3544050/Gun_Factory_Simulator_Demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Gun Factory Simulator</em></a>, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3371650/Car_Mechanic_Workshop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Car Mechanic Workshop</em></a>. Other games sport art that looks <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3458190/Pocket_Garden_Demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suspiciously similar</a> to something generative AI would spit out, but they lack disclosures.&nbsp;</p><p>While it’s difficult to say for certain whether or not the latest Next Fest is more awash with slop than its predecessors, it wouldn’t be surprising considering the <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/developers-still-aren-t-warming-up-to-generative-ai" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">growing use of AI</a> in game development circles – even if nobody is actually asking for this. But there’s also an under-discussed factor at play: Valve changed how Steam Next Fest functions late last year.</p><p>"If people think they are seeing smaller or weirder games in this Next Fest – and the one at the end of last year – Steam did switch to this different approach where they cut out the livestreaming elements of Next Fest [and] are showing you a more random selection of games for the first two-to-three days of the Fest,” Simon Carless, founder of <a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GameDiscoverCo</a>, an agency that analyzes how players find video games, told Aftermath. “They will then show you personalized picks, based on what everyone else has been playing, later in the Fest."</p><p>It is unlikely, however, that Valve’s goal was to surface slapdash trash.</p><p>"This does lead to some odder, tinier games getting randomly surfaced,” said Carless. “But that's Steam deliberately trying to diversify and get more 'egalitarian,' as opposed to just showing the biggest trending games, which is something that was increasingly being gamed by studios launching a demo early and pushing it to influencers to get on top of the Next Fest charts for the first day."</p><p>In my experience, Carless' assessment appears correct. Several days into Next Fest, I'm now seeing far fewer suspicious recommendations, even in oft-criticized categories like "Simulation." Intriguing prospects like <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3482840/Wanderstop_Demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wanderstop</a> </em>and <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2585830/Promise_Mascot_Agency/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Promise Mascot Agency</a></em>, as well as meme-y but undeniably amusing concepts like <em>Silent Hill</em> soccer game <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3495990/FEAR_FA_98/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FEAR FA 98</a></em>, have risen to the top. Only once I scroll down do I begin to see dicier fare.</p><p>These days, Valve applies this general philosophy to most corners of Steam, explained Chris Zukowski, a video game marketer who <a href="https://howtomarketagame.com/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">regularly writes about Steam and discoverability</a>.</p><p>"Overall, this 'Give every game 15 minutes of fame and see who survives' [approach] is a fundamental aspect to the Steam algorithm in several different areas,” Zukowski told Aftermath, pointing to a survey of Steam’s Discovery Queue he ran across 75 games of different sizes.</p><figure><figcaption>Chris Zukowski</figcaption></figure><p>"Notice how Diamond, Gold, and Silver earners all start out with around 25,000 impressions on day one and two? That is the Steam algorithm testing the games. If a lot of people buy the game on day one and two, on the subsequent days, it is given even more visibility. If it doesn't do well, its visibility is cut,” he said.&nbsp;</p><p>Zukowski then pointed to the brown line on the graph.&nbsp;</p><p>“Those are games that had so few wishlists going into launch that Valve figures that the dev was too unsophisticated or just a shovelware scammer,” he said. “So they don't even give them the default 25,000 views on day one and two. This Discovery Queue algorithm is why I am not worried about an AI shovelware flood. If a scammer could churn out an AI-generated game per day, they would not have had enough time or spent enough effort gathering the minimum number of wishlists to qualify for the ‘15 minutes of fame’ at launch.”&nbsp;</p><p>For years, Steam users and developers raged against <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/asset-flip-simulator-highlights-a-huge-problem-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a glut of "asset flips" and fake games</a> overrunning the platform. This was Valve's solution: to algorithmically create what are functionally two Steams – the one regular people see and the landfill. While games occasionally slip through the cracks in both directions, it's a relatively effective system overall, according to developers I've spoken to over the past couple years. But it does not solve the problem of <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mhwilliams.bsky.social/post/3lj4eyb6txs2v" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nearly 20,000 games releasing on Steam per year</a>; it only mitigates some of them.</p><p>Those who analyze Steam and similar platforms for a living aren’t sounding the alarm bells about an AI slop flood just yet. The bigger issue Steam developers face is the sheer number of high-effort, <em>good </em>games that come out on a daily basis. This is true of Next Fest as well. There are over 1,000 games in Steam's latest demo-palooza, and many of them look solid. Can an algorithm, no matter how much time Valve spends optimizing it to ultimately lure money out of your wallet, solve that problem? Should it?</p><p>For better or worse, the algorithm remains key, and Carless and Zukowski recommend keeping a close eye on it.</p><p>"The net result of [Valve changing its approach to the previous Steam Next Fest] was I think every game got less visibility. Even top-performing AA games got fewer wishlists during SNF. So it was less winner-take-all,” said Zukowski. “There is weird stuff on Steam, but most of it is filtered out by the algorithms.”&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/chinese-cleaver-chefs-knife-caidao-cck-sbz"><h3>Everyone Should Have A Chinese Chef’s Knife</h3></a><p>My Chan Chi Kee KF1812 caidao is one of my most prized possessions and I use it for basically everything.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/washington-post-bezos"><h3>Jeff Bezos Presents: The News</h3></a><p>Bezos' new vision for The Washington Post's opinion section will destroy the paper</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

What isn’t awesome and is in fact shitty, dumb, and greedy is that Xbox is going to charge PS5 players $100 to play the game a few days early, despite <em>Horizon 5 </em>being a game that released back in 2021. </p><p>On February 27, Xbox announced that<em> Forza Horizon 5 </em>would launch on PS5 on April 29.<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010647&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010647" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> But if you spend $100</a></span> to buy the fanciest, expensive-st version— the Premium Edition—you can start playing the game on April 25. Xbox claims this is “early access,” but uh, I’ve been playing <em>Forza Horizon 5 </em>on my Xbox Series X for years now. </p><p>This is all really silly for a few reasons. First, it lays bare the fact that the early access scams publishers have embraced recently are completely arbitrary and nonsensical. A game that you can play right now on PC and Xbox is going to be released “early” for some players on PS5. Give me a break. Second, when Xbox launched <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> back in 2021 <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://support.forzamotorsport.net/hc/en-us/articles/4402249796243-Forza-Horizon-5-Announce-FAQ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://support.forzamotorsport.net/hc/en-us/articles/4402249796243-Forza-Horizon-5-Announce-FAQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it did charge $100 for early access</a></span>, which was still annoying but at least it wasn’t already out on multiple other platforms. Now, in 2025, it seems very strange to suggest that early access is just as valuable or useful. </p><p>Yes, I know that a lot of people who only own a PS5 might be really excited to play<em> Forza Horizon 5</em> and they might be willing to shell out extra money to get their hands on the game sooner. But you don’t even need an Xbox or PC to play <em>Forza Horizon 5.</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.xbox.com/en-US/play/games/forza-horizon-5-standard-edition/9NKX70BBCDRN&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/play/games/forza-horizon-5-standard-edition/9NKX70BBCDRN" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">You can stream <em>Horizon 5</em> via Game Pass Ultimate on your phone or tablet instantly</a></span> and that will cost you a lot less than $100. </p><p>Ultimately, I’m probably wasting my time.<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/paid-early-access-pre-order-starfield-diablo-iv-madden-1850831357?_gl=1*1i6zn7a*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MDY4MTkwMy4xNi4xLjE3NDA2ODI4NjkuMjcuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/paid-early-access-pre-order-starfield-diablo-iv-madden-1850831357?_gl=1*1i6zn7a*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MDY4MTkwMy4xNi4xLjE3NDA2ODI4NjkuMjcuMC4w"> I’ve already written about how greedy and shitty early-access pre-order bonuses are </a></span>and how publishers are just delaying games for most people to squeeze out extra pennies from a few diehard fans who have no patience or self control. </p><p>And yet, despite me and many others pointing this out, a lot of people keep spending extra money to play games a few days early. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/paid-early-access-pre-order-madden-star-wars-outlaws-1851596675?_gl=1*1i6zn7a*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MDY4MTkwMy4xNi4xLjE3NDA2ODI4NjkuMjcuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/paid-early-access-pre-order-madden-star-wars-outlaws-1851596675?_gl=1*1i6zn7a*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MDY4MTkwMy4xNi4xLjE3NDA2ODI4NjkuMjcuMC4w">As a result, publishers keep pushing their luck</a></span>—adding more days, charging more money, or even offering multiple release dates depending on how much extra you pay. Now, we’ve reached the next level of fuckery and Xbox is charging early access for a years-old port of a game that is currently playable on any phone via streaming. The future sucks.</p><p>  <strong><em>Correction: 2/27/2025, 4:05 p.m. ET</em></strong><em>: A prior version of this article incorrectly claimed Forza Horizon 5 didn’t offer an early access launch option on Xbox in 2021.</em></p><p> . <br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"If we continue focusing on our mission, Pokemon can probably continue to its 50th or 100th anniversary," he said. "But if we become complacent and go with the flow, that's when Pokemon will go downhill."</p><p>The Pokemon Company is privately held, but it regularly works with its minority investor Nintendo on all manner of projects in the gaming space, including the upcoming Switch game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6521882/" data-ref-id="1100-6521882">Pokemon Legends Z-A</a>.

			<p>Playground Games has revealed the PlayStation 5 launch date for its award-winning game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/forza-horizon-5-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forza Horizon 5</a>. The latest installment in the open world racing game franchise <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-5-comes-to-playstation-5-in-spring-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will debut on Sony's console</a> on April 29, although owners of the Premium Edition will be able to start roaming the Mexican country roads from April 25. Playground Games also revealed the technical details of this version, including the planned improvements for the PlayStation 5 Pro console:</p>
<p><em>Forza Horizon 5 on PS5 features two rendering modes to choose from: Performance (60fps) and Quality (30fps). On PS5 Pro, the Performance mode receives increased visual fidelity, while Quality mode adds ray traced car reflections to Races and Free Roam.</em></p>
<p>The launch on PlayStation 5 coincides with a major update called Horizon Realms, which will be available on all platforms. This new feature aims to let players immerse themselves in the history of the game's Evolving World updates. In Horizon Realms, players will get to explore twelve Evolving World locations: eleven of the best previously limited-time locations and the first-ever Stadium Track.</p>
<ul>
<li>Stunt Park</li>
<li>Ice Rink</li>
<li>Oval Track</li>
<li>Summer Party</li>
<li>Neon Airstrip</li>
<li>Día de Muertos</li>
<li>Winter Wonderland</li>
<li>Lunar Drift Arena</li>
<li>Retrowave Highway</li>
<li>Cars and Coffee</li>
<li>Stadium Maze</li>
</ul>
<p>Collecting new Horizon Realms exclusive awards will unlock four new Horizon Reward Cars:</p>
<ul>
<li>2024 Lamborghini Revuelto</li>
<li>2023 Lamborghini Huracán Sterrato</li>
<li>2018 Lotus Exige Cup 430</li>
<li>2022 Hennessey Mammoth 6x6</li>
</ul>
<p>Playground has discussed two ways to experience Horizon Realms. In Skill Mode, the Forza Horizon 5 user picks one of the Realms to enter and try to get as many Skill Scores as possible. Each Evolving World will have its own Skill Score Leaderboard, and there will also be an overall Skill Score Leaderboard that adds up all the points you have banked on each Realm. Earning enough Skill Score will also unlock new player badges unique to Horizon Realms.</p>
<p>In Free Mode, leaderboards are cast aside to focus on the fun factor. &nbsp;having fun on their favourite realms. Players can drive solo or with friends, earn badges tied to previous content updates, and unlock accolades to earn #Forzathon points.</p>

<p>As a side note, it's possible April will be a month to remember for PlayStation 5 users when it comes to Microsoft game releases. <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/tom-warren-indiana-jones-for-ps5-is-targeting-an-april-release.1120953/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to The Verge's Tom Warren</a>, MachineGames is aiming to launch the PS5 version of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle in April, though that might still change.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/clue-peanuts-brings-childhood-charm-to-classic-mystery-board-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new version of the iconic Clue board game is coming based on the world of Peanuts. The aptly named <em>Clue: Peanuts</em> reimagines the classic whodunnit mystery board game with the characters and iconography of the comic strip created by Charles Schulz.</p>

<h2>The <em>Clue: Peanuts</em> Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official press release, the <em>Clue: Peanuts</em> board game is being developed by The Op under license of toy company giant <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/hasbro-unveils-new-playing-to-win-strategy-expanding-their-reach-to-more-players" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Hasbro</a>. The mystery at the heart of the game isn't a murder, but the disappearance of Linus' blanket. Players will step into the shoes of Snoopy, Charlie Brown, Lucy, and more to solve the classic Clue questions of Who, Where, and with What.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/clue-peanuts-game-board.jpg?itok=ezG2B3Hw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/clue-peanuts-game-board.jpg?itok=qvw8MFI_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The use of the <em>Peanuts'</em> license extends to the locations as well. Players will explore Lucy's psychiatric booth, the pumpkin patch, and Snoopy's doghouse to find clues, interrogate various supporting characters, and piece together the greater puzzle. The game is designed for 2-6 players ages 8 and up.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“At The Op Games we believe happiness is…playing board games with friends and family,” said Dane Chapin, CEO of The Op Games. “We’re excited to add CLUE: PEANUTS Edition to our growing line of PEANUTS titles in this special anniversary year, and fans can look forward to more of Charlie Brown, Lucy, and Snoopy just around the corner.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Peanuts is a syndicated Sunday comic strip written and illustrated by Charles Schulz. It debuted in 1950 and continued until Schulz died in 2000. By that time the comic had circulated in thousands of magazines across 75 countries. It is considered one of the most influential comic strips in history for it cementing the four-panel gag comic format, alongside philosophically and psychologically complex humor.</p>

<p>The last major project featuring the Peanuts gang was an animated movie in 2015 developed by Blue Sky Studios. It received positive reviews and was the 7th highest grossing animated film of that year.</p>

<p><em>Clue: Peanuts</em> is available now at physical and online retailers. It is being sold at an MSRP of $44.99.</p>

The Switch game seems like a significant departure from the untamed open zones of <em>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</em>, which is exciting because we don’t know what to expect. The stream gave us a trailer as well as a general breakdown, and we skimmed through both to see what details we could find. Here’s everything we noticed.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="36ee184a9960e112180eb234ced9b0c8" data-recommend-id="image://36ee184a9960e112180eb234ced9b0c8" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A trainer aims at a Fletchling." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A trainer aims at a Fletchling." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="36ee184a9960e112180eb234ced9b0c8" data-recommend-id="image://36ee184a9960e112180eb234ced9b0c8" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A trainer aims at a Fletchling." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>One of the best innovations <em>Pokémon Legends: Arceus </em>implemented was real-time capture mechanics. This included over-the-shoulder aiming which let you toss a Poké Ball at a wild critter and capture them without entering a battle. <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet </em>didn’t quite match this. You could throw a ball at a Pokémon as a way of initiating battles, but you would still have to fight the monster before you could capture them. In <em>Legends: Z-A</em>, it looks kind of like a mix of the two. You can still capture Pokémon without battling them, but it looks like it has a lock-on system similar to that in <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em> rather than the option to freehand it. Kind of a bummer, but hopefully it feels better when you’re playing it.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4fad372785fbf29c7c91ae0ccd716623" data-recommend-id="image://4fad372785fbf29c7c91ae0ccd716623" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A trainer throws a Pokeball at a Flaaffy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A trainer throws a Pokeball at a Flaaffy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4fad372785fbf29c7c91ae0ccd716623" data-recommend-id="image://4fad372785fbf29c7c91ae0ccd716623" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A trainer throws a Pokeball at a Flaaffy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>One of the great challenges of a <em>Pokémon </em>game is trying to capture a new addition without knocking them out. This is why abilities like False Swipe exist, which will leave a Pokémon with 1 HP rather than knocking it out. In the first <em>Legends: Z-A </em>trailer, we see a Flaaffy seemingly beaten in battle, but the player still captures it in a Poké Ball. If this is the case, it takes some of the risk out of battles, but will make it a lot easier to capture a rare Shiny or Legendary Pokémon.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="cca0cf0789231f6e8c46ca43899dd76b" data-recommend-id="image://cca0cf0789231f6e8c46ca43899dd76b" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Chikorita attacks Flaaffy with Razor Leaf with Disarming Voice on its ability wheel." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Chikorita attacks Flaaffy with Razor Leaf with Disarming Voice on its ability wheel." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cca0cf0789231f6e8c46ca43899dd76b" data-recommend-id="image://cca0cf0789231f6e8c46ca43899dd76b" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Chikorita attacks Flaaffy with Razor Leaf with Disarming Voice on its ability wheel." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Chikorita, Tepig, and Totodile are the starters in <em>Legends: Z-A</em>, which has fans convinced their final forms will each get Mega Evolutions. For Chikorita, its final stage is Meganium, and fans are theorizing its Mega Evolution might be a grass/fairy-type because of one small detail in the trailer. The Chikorita shown fighting the aforementioned Flaaffy knows the attack Disarming Voice, a fairy-type move Chikorita has historically never been able to learn. Could this be a hint that Chikorita’s move pool has been tweaked to prepare it for a fairy typing in the late game?</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7b0ffc8fc07d2713bc9ff2bcc0a21f09" data-recommend-id="image://7b0ffc8fc07d2713bc9ff2bcc0a21f09" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Totodile moves out of the way from a Rollout attack." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Totodile moves out of the way from a Rollout attack." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7b0ffc8fc07d2713bc9ff2bcc0a21f09" data-recommend-id="image://7b0ffc8fc07d2713bc9ff2bcc0a21f09" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Totodile moves out of the way from a Rollout attack." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</em>’ battles were more cinematic than those in previous games, and part of what added to the chaotic nature of its fights were that you could move your character around as your Pokémon took part in the scrap. In <em>Legends: Z-A</em>, Game Freak is taking this a step further by integrating it into the battle mechanics. Positioning and timing are integrated into combat in ways they weren’t before, and as you run around your active Pokémon follows, setting up and avoiding attacks as they play out. So now you don’t just run around aimlessly during fights; you’re a more active participant in battles.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3ec112048b7696a2133f05c74d47f911" data-recommend-id="image://3ec112048b7696a2133f05c74d47f911" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Chikorita's ability wheel shows Leafage recharging." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Chikorita's ability wheel shows Leafage recharging." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3ec112048b7696a2133f05c74d47f911" data-recommend-id="image://3ec112048b7696a2133f05c74d47f911" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Chikorita's ability wheel shows Leafage recharging." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Part of that new active system is that Pokémon attacks seem to have cooldowns. We can see when Chikorita is fighting Flaaffy that its moves have a timer before it can use them again. This makes sense given that timing seems to be a core part of battles this time around. Now you’ll have to make sure you’re well-positioned and can use the attack you need at the right time.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1c470e8a9b7a842984062f71749d7f9c" data-recommend-id="image://1c470e8a9b7a842984062f71749d7f9c" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A trainer floats off a rooftop using their Rotom phone." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A trainer floats off a rooftop using their Rotom phone." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1c470e8a9b7a842984062f71749d7f9c" data-recommend-id="image://1c470e8a9b7a842984062f71749d7f9c" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A trainer floats off a rooftop using their Rotom phone." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Since <em>Legends: Z-A</em> takes place entirely in one city, it’s not too surprising that it’s doing away with some of the open-world traversal of <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em> and <em>Legends: Arceus</em>. In those games, you would ride on Pokémon to get to high places, glide through the air, or swim across bodies of water. Based on what we can see in <em>Legends: Z-A</em>, the only Pokémon you’ll be using to traverse will be your Rotom—which is in your phone—to float between rooftops. That’s a little disappointing considering riding the Hisui Pokémon in <em>Legends: Arceus </em>was one of the best parts about it, but it makes sense given the environment you’ll be inhabiting in <em>Legends: Z-A</em>.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="98a3a7c17fbe8b5f0a10ee64d2aee145" data-recommend-id="image://98a3a7c17fbe8b5f0a10ee64d2aee145" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Urbain and Taunie in Legends: Z-A." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Urbain and Taunie in Legends: Z-A." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="98a3a7c17fbe8b5f0a10ee64d2aee145" data-recommend-id="image://98a3a7c17fbe8b5f0a10ee64d2aee145" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Urbain and Taunie in Legends: Z-A." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s become pretty common in <em>Pokémon </em>games to determine members of the supporting cast by which version of the protagonist you pick at the beginning of the game. In <em>Legends: Arceus</em>, if you pick the female character Akari, you’d meet the male protagonist Rei in the main story, and vice versa. In <em>Legends: Z-A</em>, it looks like you’ll meet one of two supporting characters called Urbain and Taunie depending on your character’s gender. We see what looks like a male protagonist meeting up with Taunie and Urbain chatting with a girl hero. The question is: will both characters essentially be model swaps of the same role, or will they have their own goals and quirks for us to learn?</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f7d6c3816848ba1d46959e431d5c4809" data-recommend-id="image://f7d6c3816848ba1d46959e431d5c4809" data-format="jpg" data-width="1362" data-height="766" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="AZ and Floette vibing in a hotel lobby." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="AZ and Floette vibing in a hotel lobby." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f7d6c3816848ba1d46959e431d5c4809" data-recommend-id="image://f7d6c3816848ba1d46959e431d5c4809" data-format="jpg" data-width="1362" data-height="766" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="AZ and Floette vibing in a hotel lobby." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While this isn’t a hidden detail, it’s crazy to me that we’re just gonna gloss over AZ.

<p>A Minecraft Movie hits theaters on April 4, and the final pre-release trailer has been released by Warner Bros. Pictures. The trailer gives a deeper look into the movie’s world, creatures, mobs, and the Nether. </p>



<p>“Welcome to the world of Minecraft, where creativity doesn’t just help you craft, it’s essential to one’s survival!” the movie’s description reads. “Four misfits—Garrett “The Garbage Man” Garrison (Jason Momoa), Henry (Sebastian Hansen), Natalie (Emma Myers) and Dawn (Danielle Brooks)—find themselves struggling with ordinary problems when they are suddenly pulled through a mysterious portal into the Overworld: a bizarre, cubic wonderland that thrives on imagination. </p>



<p>“To get back home, they’ll have to master this world (and protect it from evil things like Piglins and Zombies, too) while embarking on a magical quest with an unexpected, expert crafter, Steve (Jack Black). Together, their adventure will challenge all five to be bold and to reconnect with the qualities that make each of them uniquely creative…the very skills they need to thrive back in the real world.”</p>

                <p>A Good Snowman is Hard to Build is a delightful Sokoban-like puzzle game that challenges you to build a snowman in increasingly complex environments. Originally released in 2015, for the game's 10th anniversary, developer Draknek &amp; Friends decided to implement a unique weather-based pricing system in lieu of its normal price of $15.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWJIkfiKmQk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uWJIkfiKmQk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/indie-studio-introduces-a-unique-temperature-based-pricing-system-for-its-snowman-game/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>, over on the game's <a href="https://draknek.itch.io/a-good-snowman" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Itch.io</a> page, the developer has dubbed the new model "pay what the temperature is." The price on Itch.io is set according to the current temperature in London in degrees Celsius every hour--for example, at the time of writing, the temperature is currently 8.3 degrees, meaning that the game is $8.30. This of course means that the game will be cheaper at night and during the colder winter months, and significantly more expensive during the summer months, which you might call thematically appropriate. In the case that London falls to 0 degrees Celsius or lower, the game will be free.</p><p dir="ltr">Because platforms like Steam don't allow this sort of price tomfoolery, this scheme is exclusive to the Itch.io storefront. The developers joke that those who are upset by its use of Celsius can opt to pay for Fahrenheit or Kelvin instead by using Itch.io's "pay what you want" feature. (For comparison, the current price would be $46.94 in Fahrenheit and $281.45 in Kelvin). Draknek &amp; Friends are currently working on its new game, The Electrifying Incident, which stars the same monster as A Good Snowman is Hard to Build.</p>

It was clearly meant to be played co-op, where your friends ruin your plans and then you all fight, but I mostly played it as a solo experience. It was a lot of fun that way–stealthing through its sprawling mansions, banks, discos, and art galleries until I ruined my plans all on my own, at which point I’d run around in a panic and then hide in a vent. Developer Pocketwatch announced a sequel in 2022; there’s currently a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1063030/Monaco_2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">demo</a> available as part of Steam Next Fest, which makes single-player a more viable way to play.</p><p>The core of <em>Monaco 2</em> is essentially the same as <em>Monaco 1</em>–a group of characters is drawn together to break into glamorous buildings, locate some coveted object, and try to get out alive–but how all that works has gotten an overhaul. Most noticeable is that the sequel has nixed the pixel art, and has shifted to an isometric perspective. I wasn’t quite sold on the game’s new look when it was first announced, having such fond memories of the first’s bright, blocky colors and relative simplicity. But the new style grew on me quickly while playing the demo; the more detailed art brings life to the levels, and the new perspective makes heists feel more akin to playing a <em>Hitman</em> level than the somewhat cerebral remove of the original’s overhead design. Levels feel busier, which makes them more engaging to move through, if not sometimes a bit more chaotic, especially when things go south.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Monaco 2 OFFICIAL Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aKF0feOQcPU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Developer Andy Schatz told Aftermath in an interview that some of the visual changes were due to ways Pocketwatch saw players struggle to understand the original. This is especially true of the way <em>Monaco 2</em> iterates on the first game’s most unique visual feature, which is that parts of a level outside your immediate vicinity were greyed out. Schatz said, “Some people's brains literally cannot parse [the original look]... and I wanted to be able to make the sequel something that more people could parse.” The original game had a blueprint vibe, which is preserved in the sequel through your ability to pore over the map before you start or during gameplay. But the moment-to-moment is different now; while in the first game, areas outside your line of sight were essentially invisible, here, you can see a lot more of their contents. This reduces some of the first game’s tendency to feel like a disco when things went haywire, but still maintains enough mystery to keep you on your toes. Schatz said, “There’s basically like a shadowing [in <em>Monaco 2</em>], but it's a more subtle shadowing that doesn't completely change the visual style of the region that is unseen versus the region that is seen.”</p><figure><figcaption>The original Monaco's line of sight</figcaption></figure><p>Drawing on the lessons learned from players over a decade of the first game influenced other changes for the sequel as well. One is the new way that characters work, especially when playing single-player. In the first game, you could only change characters when you died; here, you can swap them out at various checkpoints. While Schatz admitted <em>Monaco</em> will never have quite as much “riotous fun” in single-player as in co-op, he thinks the single-player experience in <em>Monaco 2</em> is better than in the first game. As a solo player, being able to change characters more often lessened the feeling that I was the wrong person for the job as I moved deeper into a level and faced new challenges.</p><p>The game’s eight characters fall into basic archetypes, each with their own distinct look and powers, like the ability to heal or a drone that can hack alarms. The variety within the team is a reflection of the heist movies <em>Monaco</em> is inspired by, in which Schatz said “the people within the crew are all unique from one another because they have a unique role within their team.” My favorite demo character was The Socialite, who has a little dog she can deploy to distract single guards. (Schatz told me that, alas, other players can’t pet the dog.) Playing alone, I’d use her in the early parts of a level, where her dog could handle the scattered enemies. When later areas got too populated, I’d swap to The Prowler and use her dash ability to sneak by multiple patrolling guards.</p><p>“The primary approach is really that we're designing for different player personalities and player styles more so than player skill,” Schatz said of the differences between the characters. “<em>Monaco</em> is designed around the idea that everyone always has the opportunity to be the hero under different circumstances.”&nbsp;</p><p>Characters also have “<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1063030/view/542222803385975570" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trinkets</a>” they can unlock through diamonds earned by completing challenges; trinkets give characters new abilities at the cost of some of their health. Schatz said there’s more like 40 different characters, given how much a trinket can change your playstyle. He said that trinkets largely follow a certain progression: “For the most part, they all stay within the theme of the character. I did always try to make sure that there was one trinket that was like a speedrunning trinket, and another trinket that was a team-based trinket. Then the other two were typically just like, well, this would be a cool variation on the character. I generally tried to order their unlock order so the first one is, how do I make this character a little bit easier to play?”</p><figure></figure><p>Another change that makes single-player a little more approachable is the change to how weapons work. Schatz said he didn’t like the way you picked your weapon at the beginning of a <em>Monaco 1</em> stage, and then unlocked ammo for it while collecting coins scattered around a level. In <em>Monaco 2</em>, you spend coins to unlock different weapons you find, which, like the ability to change characters, gives you more gameplay options. In the first game, similar to how I sometimes felt I was stuck with the wrong character, I’d also feel like I had the wrong tool. In the demo, I could deploy a smoke bomb to hide from guards, flee to a stairwell, then swap to a disguise to calmly stroll through the next floor. It’s not the same team-based vibe as a heist movie or co-op play, but it made me feel clever, and gave me more options when I didn’t have teammates to get me out of a jam.</p><p>But no amount of character or weapon swaps can prevent a <em>Monaco</em> level from devolving into chaos, no matter how much I want to play it like the <a href="https://aftermath.site/stealth-game-no-detection" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">perfect stealth game</a>. It’s not that the enemies are challenging–Schatz said the game’s guards are “particularly dumb”--but that running afoul of one has a cascading effect. You can’t really fight them head-on– Schatz said that “everyone always asked for combat back in the day [of <em>Monaco 1</em>], they wanted to be able to fight the guards... [But] that's just not how <em>Monaco 1</em> was: plan A is stealth and then plan B, we called it the ‘oh shit’ button.” Fleeing from one guard inevitably runs you into another, and they all start to chase you as you race around corners and deal with the game’s particular take on line-of-sight. Schatz said the game treats enemies like “a flock as a whole, and a giant system where you’re making waves.” This brings a slapstick vibe to things going wrong that feels core to the experience of <em>Monaco</em>, and I was glad to see it hold true for the sequel.</p><p>“The only piece of code that is literally shared between <em>Monaco 1</em> and <em>Monaco 2</em> is the aggro algorithm, the algorithm for how guards see you, how they perceive you, and when they chase you,” Schatz said. “That's the one that was like, there's special sauce in there that we don't want to mess with.”</p><figure></figure><p>This idea of enemies as a whole, rather than individuals, also feels like it fits with the nature of the heist movies <em>Monaco </em>is inspired by, which Schatz described as being about “a band of misfits that gather together to outsmart the squares.” The original <em>Monaco</em> was inspired by the heist movies of its time–Schatz cited Guy Ritchie movies and <em>The Usual Suspects</em>–but heists, and the nature of heist movies, has changed since then. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgdy5e3neko" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Modern heists</a>, Schatz said, “almost all involve some form of digital trickery… They often are multi-stage at this point… And that was something that kind of went into the original thoughts of some of [<em>Monaco 2</em>’s] story.” We only get a glimpse of that story in the demo, and what I played feels physical in the way of “classic” heists, letting you jetset around locations and put yourself in harm’s way, while also feeling more high-tech, such as through the presence of robot guards. “It’s not so much a sci-fi story, but it’s sort of mildly so,” Schatz said.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Monaco 2</em> is being published by Humble Games, which faced what owner Ziff Davis called a “<a href="https://aftermath.site/humble-games-layoffs-closure-ziff-davis-ign" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">restructuring</a>” over the summer, but which to many looked more like a closure. Humble initially brought in third party The Powell Group to continue its <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/indie-devs-working-with-humble-games-were-also-blindsided-by-the-publisher-reportedly-laying-off-all-employees-this-will-have-drastic-consequences/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">games</a>, and, later, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/humble-games-calls-in-good-games-group-for-support-following-restructure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">external help</a> in the form of a company founded by ex-Humble employees.&nbsp;When asked how this had affected the game, Schatz acknowledged that there was “healthy and valid skepticism of the initial statements that it's a restructuring.” He said Humble has been “surprisingly really supportive… I say ‘surprisingly;’ I mean just, even I had that kind of skepticism when it all went down. I was panicked, but… they've been supporting [<em>Monaco 2</em>] beyond even sort of initial promises. No corners have been cut; in fact, corners have been added… I have been given every sign that they are extremely excited about <em>Monaco</em>.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><em>Monaco 2</em> is set to release this year. I’m enjoying my time with the demo and the way it feels more suited to my solo circumstances, even if solo play isn’t the ideal. (<em>You</em> try making plans to game with friends as a middle-aged adult.) Schatz told me, “I actually think that one of the reasons that Pocketwatch has been successful over the years is… [trying] to discover new niches of people that were underserved by the games that they know and love. And in this case, we're making a sequel… so there are some ways in which we said, if there is something that works better for this game, we can't be afraid to let it go.</p><p>“We've tried to preserve everything we could about the spirit of the original, and the emotions that you have and the types of things you think about while you're playing… [We didn’t want to] change that feeling of <em>sneak, sneak, sneak, CHAOS</em>. That is <em>Monaco</em>.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/chinese-cleaver-chefs-knife-caidao-cck-sbz"><h3>Everyone Should Have A Chinese Chef’s Knife</h3></a><p>My Chan Chi Kee KF1812 caidao is one of my most prized possessions and I use it for basically everything.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/washington-post-bezos"><h3>Jeff Bezos Presents: The News</h3></a><p>Bezos' new vision for The Washington Post's opinion section will destroy the paper</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>In 2017, Brendan "PlayerUnknown" Greene carved out a space for himself in the battle royale genre with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/playerunknowns-battlegrounds-review/1900-6416830/" data-ref-id="1900-6416830">PUBG: Battlegrounds</a>. Later this year, Greene's new title, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/brendan-playerunknown-greenes-next-game-prologue-i/1100-6472284/" data-ref-id="1100-6472284">Prologue: Go Wayback</a>, is sending players up against an enemy they can't simply shoot or kill. As shown in the new trailer below, Prologue is a survival game in which there's nothing more dangerous to the player than the brutally cold weather and the harsh environment of the woods.</p><p>Prologue's 64-square-km maps are procedurally generated, with millions of possible combinations. The goal of each game is to live long enough to reach a weather station that's randomly located in each map. To do so, players will have to scrounge for supplies and gear, battle hunger and thirst, and take shelter from the elements to prevent their untimely demise. The cold itself is your primary adversary, and there's more than one way it can kill you. For example, slipping on some icy terrain can sometimes lead to a fatal end. And if you happen to be outside during a blizzard, it may go very badly for you.</p>

      </div>
<p>While the weather can be overwhelming, Prologue will give players the tools to help them recognize when the temperatures are going to rapidly drop or when they need to immediately find shelter. Players can also fix items they find and temporarily take refuge in cabins. But staying in one place isn't a long-term strategy, and extraction is only possible at the weather station.</p><p>PlayerUnknown Productions has previously stated that Prologue is part of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-creators-three-game-plan-starts-with-a-survival-game-with-millions-of-maps/1100-6528255/" data-ref-id="1100-6528255">a plan for three games</a>, which includes an upcoming title called Project Artemis. PUBG publisher Krafton and Nvidia have recently shared plans to create <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-and-nvidia-reveal-new-ai-powered-characters-designed-to-act-like-real-people/1100-6528667/" data-ref-id="1100-6528667">AI-powered teammates in PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds</a> that can act more like real people. Krafton is also working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-spin-off-gets-a-new-name-and-more-details/1100-6529319/" data-ref-id="1100-6529319">PUBG: Blindspot</a>, which will be the first PUBG spin-off aside from PUBG Mobile.</p><p>Early access for Prologue: Go Wayback will begin this summer on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2943740/Prologue_Go_Wayback/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>.</p>

		<p>Terminator 2D: No Fate has been announced by Reef Entertainment and developer Bitmap Bureau, a brand new side-scrolling action game that’ll probably make you think you’re playing a remaster of an early 90s movie tie in. It’s coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, Xbox One, Switch and PC on 5th September.</p>
<p><iframe title="Terminator™ 2D: NO FATE - Announcement Trailer (PS5®, PS4®, Nintendo Switch™, Xbox &amp; PC)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IkMFYMG3QLw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>As you can see from the trailer, this is a real love letter to the film and 16-bit video games, but with all the potential that funnelling that through modern hardware can produce. There’s really slick animation, the sprite work is really high detail, and then there’s just so many moments that are being recreated from the film – in addition to some original stages.</p>
<p>Play as Sarah Connor, the T-800, and John Connor in the far future missions, with a blend of beat ’em ups, shooting and stealth.</p>
<p>This could be the Terminator 2 tie-in game that we never had. Except… we did have them. Lots of them. There was a computer game by a studio called Dementia – really quite a bad name for a games company – an arcade shooter by Midway, a Game Boy game by Bits Studios, and a 1992 NES game by Software Creations. Bits Studios returned in 1992, making a 16-bit version for SNES and Mega Drive. I have no idea if any of these games were good.</p>

<p>So, perhaps Bitmap Bureau design director Mike Tucker can put it a different way:&nbsp;“It’s a love letter to 80s/90s arcade games and we feel like it’s the T2 game we should have had back in our youth.”</p>
<p>To go alongside the game reveal and announcement is a Making Of video, where Tucker utters these words:</p>
<p><iframe title="Making Terminator™ 2D: NO FATE (PS5®, PS4®, Nintendo Switch™, Xbox &amp; PC)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QPMqA-qqfWo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p>Intriguingly, the way that the game has been developed is intended to allow them to port the game back to classic machines. The current console releases are set for 5th September, with other, older platforms yet to be announced.</p>

		<p>Xbox’s excellent arcade racer <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/forza-horizon-5">Forza Horizon 5</a> is coming to PS5 on 29th April, it’s been confirmed, narrowing down the spring release window that was previously revealed.</p>
<p>This will also come alongside an update for the game on Xbox and PC that introduces the Horizon Realms</p>
<p><iframe title="Forza Horizon 5 - Horizon Realms Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wWd6ox2dgec?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The PS5 release of Forza Horizon 5 will come in multiple editions, and with early access for pre-orders starting on 25th April. As with Xbox Series X, the PS5 will have a 60fps Performance and 30fps Quality mode. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> will also have the same frame rate targets, but Performance mode will have increased visual fidelity, while PS5 Pro Quality mode will add ray-traced car reflections to races and free roam – these are otherwise limited to photo modes.</p>
<p>Horizon Realms will adapt the previously time-limited events from the Evolving World update, bringing back 11 locations and adding one more. These include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Stunt Park</li>
<li>Ice Rink</li>
<li>Oval Track</li>
<li>Summer Party</li>
<li>Neon Airstrip</li>
<li>Día de Muertos</li>
<li>Winter Wonderland</li>
<li>Lunar Drift Arena</li>
<li>Retrowave Highway</li>
<li>Cars and Coffee</li>
<li>Stadium Maze</li>
<li>Horizon Stadium Circuit (new)</li>
</ul>
<p>These can all be played in either Skill Score, which has you try to bank enough points to climb a leaderboard, or Free mode, which is all just about messing around and earning Badges.</p>
<p>It’s still a bit weird seeing Xbox first party exclusives popping up on PlayStation, but here we are. They even have their trailers appear on the PlayStation YouTube channel these days!</p>
<p>The port is being developed by Panic Button in collaboration with Turn 10 Studios and Playground Games, and will be like-for-like in terms of content with all the previously released car pack, and the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/07/27/forza-horizon-5-hot-wheels-review/">Hot Wheels</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/24/forza-horizon-5-rally-adventure-expansion-revealed/">Rally Adventure</a> expansions also available.</p>
<p>This follows on from comments by Xbox boss Phil Spencer, who said in the last few weeks that “To keep games off other platforms… it’s not a path for us.” This certainly tied in with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/10/rumours-suggest-more-xbox-games-will-be-coming-to-ps5-and-switch/">the latest rumours</a> that had other core Xbox franchises like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/halo-the-master-chief-collection">Halo</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gears-of-war-e-day">Gears of War</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag-microsoft-flight-simulator">Microsoft Flight Simulator</a> potentially coming to PlayStation, and with Bethesda’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/23/doom-the-dark-ages-release-date-confirmed-for-may/">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/05/rumours-grow-of-starfield-indiana-jones-more-xbox-games-coming-to-ps5/">Indiana Jones</a>, and Obsidian’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/13/the-outer-worlds-2-is-coming-to-ps5-as-well-as-pc-and-xbox-in-2025/">The Outer Worlds 2</a> already confirmed.</p>
<p><iframe title="Forza Horizon 5 Review (Xbox Series X in 4K 60fps)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KEl0KBy5I-U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Forza Horizon 5 is the latest in Playground Games’ spectacular open world arcade racing spin-off to the main Forza Motorsport series. Where previous games took us to Australia and the UK, Forza Horizon 5 takes players to a gorgeous approximation of Mexico, really showcasing the variety of environments that you can find in the country.</p>
<p>Originally released in late 2021 across Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One and PC, t<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/01/26/halo-infinite-20-million-players-forza-horizon-5-18-million-but-how-many-bought-the-games/">he game set records for Xbox Game Pass at the time</a>. It’s over three years old now, and has had countless updates, car packs and a pair of great expansions as well. PlayStation 5 owners are in for a treat when it arrives.</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/11/04/forza-horizon-5-review-xbox-series-x/">Forza Horizon 5 review</a>, we scored the sequel a sublime 9 out of 10 with Dom saying, “Forza Horizon 5 continues the series’ legacy, usurping Forza Horizon 4 as the new pinnacle of open-world racing and as a graphical showcase for the new generation of Xbox console.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-reaction-time-and-does-it-make-you-better-at-cs2-or-valorant/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The <a href="https://humanbenchmark.com/tests/reactiontime" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reaction Time test</a> on the Human Benchmark website is a common destination for Counter-Strike 2 or VALORANT players who want to quantify their brain’s reflexes. But what does reaction time actually mean, and how much of an advantage does a faster mental response time give players?</p>



<p>Let’s dive into what reaction time is, what the Reaction Time test actually is grading, and what it means as a CS2 or VALORANT player.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-reaction-time">What is Reaction Time?</h2>



<p>Reaction time is defined as the amount of time it takes for an individual to recognize and respond to a visual and/or auditory stimulus. For gamers, and for players of tactical shooters like CS2 or VALORANT, reaction time is how long it takes for a player to respond to a specific visual or audio cue. This could be an enemy or grenade appearing on screen, or the sound of the bomb being planted or an ability being popped.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="donk INHUMAN Reaction Flick (with pov)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PKG99h5gF3U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>When CS2 or VALORANT players talk about “reaction time,” they’re typically referring to the time it takes a player to react (i.e. shoot) an enemy that appears on screen.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-reaction-time-test">What is the Reaction Time test?</h2>



<p>The Reaction Time test on the Human Benchmark website is described there as a “simple tool to measure your reaction time.” It measures the milliseconds it takes for you to recognize when the red box turns green and then click. When you perform the test, you are given an average reaction time after four applications of the test.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>According to the site, the median reaction time is 273 milliseconds, while the average is 284 ms, though input/monitor lag can play a factor. These numbers are produced from over 81 million reaction time clicks. Top esports pros score much higher though. During a recent stream, VALORANT star Tyson “TenZ’ Ngo <a href="https://x.com/JakeSucky/status/1894802864910016862" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">casually performed the test</a> and scored 138 ms, more than twice as as fast as the test’s average.</p>



<p>The Human Benchmark website also recently added a simplified “aim trainer” game that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-cs2-practice-modes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you’d find in programs like AimLabs</a>. This test is actually a better method of grading a gamer’s reaction time, since it includes moving the mouse to hit your targets. The median reaction time in the aim trainer game is 400 ms.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-important-is-reaction-time-in-games-like-cs2-or-valorant">How Important is Reaction Time in Games Like CS2 or VALORANT?</h2>



<p>High reaction time is important in games like CS2 or VALORANT, but high reaction time doesn’t guarantee success. Of course, higher reaction times will help players win aiming duels or turn away from flashbangs. But fast reactions are only a small part of the skillset players need to go from casual to competitive to professional.</p>



<p>Skills like communication, coordination, emotional maturity, and the ability to read or predict enemy actions are all crucial. Without them, you’d just have players going by instinct, trying to make hero plays. A player that can react and make a play in a bad situation is great, but so is a player that can predict or avoid getting into dangerous situations altogether. If your reaction time is slow, that can be improved by training or improving diet or posture. But because it eventually falls off with age, pro players that stay around CS2 or VALORANT for a long time need to rely on more than just reaction time.</p>



<p>Do you have below or above average reaction times? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
