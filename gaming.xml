            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/streamer-secures-full-combo-for-the-most-infamous-guitar-hero-song-at-200-speed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Clone Hero streamer and content creator CarnyJared has completed a full combo (FC) for DragonForce’s infamous <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/guitar-hero-iii-legends-of-rock"><u>Guitar Hero 3</u></a> song Through the Fire and Flames — at 200% speed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The streamer's description of the event says it all: “IT. IS. OVER.” Posted yesterday, February 27, is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhV9b0CiAtU&amp;t=5s" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recorded evidence</a> of the unbelievable feat and world record CarnyJared managed to pull off while streaming. As he launches into his final, successful attempt at hitting all 3,722 notes without missing a beat, on-screen text reminds viewers that this grand finale is the result of nine months of practicing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I am rightfully thankful for everybody that has supported me throughout this ridiculous grind. I have the best supporters on the entire platform of Twitch and YouTube,” CarnyJared explains in the video’s description.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We all spent an unfathomable amount of time staring at the same 3,722 notes, figuring out any possible way to hit them more efficiently. Somehow it worked out, and somehow I am able to sit in front of this computer which you have all cumulatively provided to me, and make a living playing Clone Hero.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— CarnyJared (@CarnyJared) <a href="https://twitter.com/CarnyJared/status/1895007995852951808?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 27, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Through the Fire and Flames running at regular speed can be a lot to process for the untrained eye, so watching CarnyJared blaze through the song at 200% speed feels completely incomprehensible. There’s not much else to say; FCing a seven-and-a-half-minute song in just over three minutes is extremely impressive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Achieving an FC on the open-source Guitar Hero-like known as Clone Hero requires playing a song in its entirety without missing a single note. On-screen stats in the streamer’s video reveal that he’s reached nearly 2,000 FC runs past the song's first bridge, only 662 past its second bridge, and 227 to its solo section. The Through the Fire and Flames 200% FC you see today marks only the fourth time CarnyJared has managed to pass the solo.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This is a moment that will live with me forever.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“I am blessed every single day to wake up and have food in the kitchen, and a place to sleep because of you amazing group of people,” CarnyJared adds. “And I also thank my family, who has not only supported me my whole life, but they all specifically watched and supported this entire grind at my lowest and highest points. This is a moment that will live with me forever.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He called the Through the Fire and Flames 200% FC the “hardest thing” he’s ever done in his life, so the celebration that follows his successful run tracks with the effort he’s put into completing it throughout the last nine months. For those interested in seeing how such an inhuman achievement can be accomplished in the world of Guitar Hero and Clone Hero, CarnyJared teased that fans can expect a “1 hour+” documentary in the next few months.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CarnyJared?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#CarnyJared</a> CarnyJared full combos Through The Fire and Flames on 200% speed <a href="https://t.co/bscIumlvhy" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/bscIumlvhy</a></p>— Livestream Fails (@LSF_Forwarder) <a href="https://twitter.com/LSF_Forwarder/status/1895045223983591471?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 27, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">For more on how the Guitar Hero community is keeping the game alive, you can watch <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/crkd-reveals-its-new-guitar-controller-and-how-it-builds-on-guitar-heros-legacy-ign-fan-fest-2025"><u>music game streamer Acai test out CRKD’s new guitar controller</u></a> in Fortnite Festival as part of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/events/fanfest">IGN Fan Fest 2025</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-charges-for-character-edit-vouchers-again-and-players-are-frustrated<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> is out and millions of players are making their hunters. It might be worth spending some extra time in the character creator though, as frequent extensive edits can run up a tab.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Character Edit Vouchers make a return in Monster Hunter Wilds (as pointed out by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/monster-hunter-wilds-locks-character-editing-behind-microtransactions/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VGC</a>), adding a microtransaction for returning to the creator screen. While smaller edits to your character — say, hair color or voice pitch — won't consume a voucher, more extensive edits <em>will </em>require a voucher.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"You can edit hair, eyebrow color, facial hair, makeup and clothing from the Appearance Menu in tent without using a voucher," the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3289620/Monster_Hunter_Wilds__Character_Edit_Voucher_ThreeVoucher_Pack/?curator_clanid=44795648" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">description on the Steam page states</a>. More extensive edits, anywhere from changing the actual voice to swapping from a male to female hunter, will however eat up one voucher.</p><div id="monster-hunter-wilds-weapons-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Monster Hunter Wilds Weapons Tier List</h3><h3>Monster Hunter Wilds Weapons Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom is handing out one free voucher for players, but anything beyond that will require purchasing a new one. The same rules apply to your Palico, which will also need a voucher for any extensive edits. The vouchers are sold in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/dlc/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">various denominations</a>, including three-packs for character edits at $6.99 and a bundled Character &amp; Palico Edit Voucher three-pack for $9.99.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's worth noting that this is not the first time Monster Hunter has had this particular microtransaction. Both <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/861870/Monster_Hunter_World__Character_Edit_Voucher_Single_Voucher/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Monster Hunter World</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1798007/MONSTER_HUNTER_RISE__One_Character_Edit_Voucher/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Monster Hunter Rise</a> had their own Character Edit Vouchers. That's not to say they're a particularly beloved facet of the series, though.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/s42q17/character_edit_vouchers_are_a_total_scam_and/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Monster Hunter subreddit thread from three years ago</a> lamented the Vouchers in Monster Hunter Rise, for example. "Worst part of gen 5 for sure," one user replied at the time. "I hate the introduction of completely unnecessary [microtransactions]."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even in the days leading up to Monster Hunter Wilds' launch, players voiced disdain for this system. As <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1it8xfg/probably_no_one_cares_but_capcom_for_the_love_of/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some in a recent thread noted</a>, other games like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a> offer character edits for free, and an unlimited amount. With Capcom's current system, there's a hard cap to how many times a player can return to the creator and edit their hunter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"On top of having to pay in MH, there's a hard limit where you can never customise that character again once you've used all the available vouchers. What purpose does this serve?" <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1it8xfg/probably_no_one_cares_but_capcom_for_the_love_of/mdmvmju/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one player asked</a>. "When I return to a game I haven't played for a while I like to change my character's looks to keep it fresh, but I just don't bother in Monster Hunter and whack a helmet on lmao."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The system itself is fairly reminiscent of some MMOs where making a "new character" might require an additional sub or added cost. Yet the Voucher system has been a routine point of frustration, to the point that some PC players have found ways to get around it with mods.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">All Low Rank Armor in Monster Hunter Wilds</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Users also left negative feedback in the Steam reviews for Character Edit Vouchers for both Monster Hunter World and Rise. Even the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3289630/Monster_Hunter_Wilds__Character_Edit_Voucher_Single_Voucher_Free_Trial_Version/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Character Edit Voucher - Free Trial Version</a> for Monster Hunter Wilds has garnered nearly 200 reviews as of the time of writing, sitting at a "Mixed" overall rating. On the negative side, the complaints seem clear: "It's not ideal, but I can live with cosmetics 'DLC', but limiting character edits is a bit much, should be free and unlimited."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the rebuttal, the positive reviews stress how little the Vouchers impact the game itself: "The amount of people that will never actually read, or actually use the in-game feature that allows this shocks me. But then again, it's the internet here we're talking about."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The whole kerfuffle feels reminiscent of Dragon's Dogma 2, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragons-dogma-2-breaks-capcom-steam-records-amid-microtransactions-furore">where a legion of microtransactions rolled out at launch and immediately garnered frustration</a>. Those particular exchanges offered in-game goods; ones still acquireable through gameplay means, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragons-dogma-2-mods-undercut-capcoms-controversial-microtransactions-dish-out-infinite-save-slots">players still found ways to work around them anyways</a>. In the case of Monster Hunter Wilds, there's one free Edit Voucher, and everything after has to be bought out-of-game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It remains to be seen how the community will react to this, long-term. Monster Hunter Wilds is only just now getting into <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-nears-1-million-peak-concurrent-players-on-steam-and-its-only-going-to-get-bigger-from-here">many, many people's hands</a>, and I do think that other concerns like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-review">difficulty</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amid-mixed-steam-user-review-rating-capcom-issues-monster-hunter-wilds-pc-troubleshooting-guide">PC performance</a> will take precedence over microtransactions, especially since these aren't a <em>new</em> problem. Whether they remain a problem, or players learn to live with — or work around — the Voucher limit, we'll see in the coming weeks and months.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To help get your Monster Hunter Wilds adventure started, take a look at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Things_Monster_Hunter_Wilds_Doesn%27t_Tell_You_-_Tips">what Monster Hunter Wilds doesn’t tell you</a>, and a guide to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Weapons">all 14 weapon types</a> in the game.

                <p dir="ltr">I like robots--especially comically large ones armed with various weapons. When I received an invitation to visit Amazing Seasun Games' Irvine, California office to try out their latest title, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mecha-break/">Mecha Break</a>, all I really knew going into it was that I'd be playing a game featuring really big robots armed with various weapons. I'm not quite sure what I was expecting (other than access to the aforementioned giant robots), but I <em>certainly</em> wasn't expecting to fall in love.</p><p dir="ltr">Most of Amazing Seasun Games' previous titles were unknown to me, and all I'd seen of Mecha Break were some impressive trailers. When I finally sat down to take the free-to-play mech-based third-person hero shooter for a test-fly, I was admittedly a bit apprehensive. The live-service hero shooter market is oversaturated enough as it is, and it's a tough genre to stand out in. Is Mecha Break up to the task? So far, the answer appears to be "yes."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4452072-mb1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4452072" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4452072-mb1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4452072"></a><figcaption>Mecha Break is mech-nerd heaven.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4452072-mb1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The game features a cast of 13 different mechs--referred to in-game as Strikers--each with their own set of unique weapons and abilities. When selecting a Striker, players can look at a graph showing that particular mech's strengths and weaknesses. Some Strikers are great for lone-wolf playstyles, some are better at supporting or defending one's team, and some are a combination of both. Each Striker feels surprisingly well-balanced--while I quickly fell in love with a specific Striker that fit my preferred playstyle (more on that in a bit), I never felt that one Striker was too overpowered or underpowered.</p><p dir="ltr">But before I get into the nitty gritty of Mecha Break's gameplay, I have to take a second to praise the game's absolutely phenomenal character creator. Before you set foot in a mech, you must first create the character who will be piloting it. You can pick from a series of masculine and feminine preset characters, but those options can then be customized. At most, I was expecting a simple customization screen that might let me choose from a handful of hairstyles and colors. What I was not expecting was a character creator so detailed it rivals that of RPGs like Cyberpunk 2077. While there aren't many body shapes to choose from, the sky's the limit when it comes to everything else.</p><p dir="ltr">Players can customize their pilot's hair color (including roots and tips), every part of their eyes (from sclera to pupil) and other facial features, their makeup (including eyeshadow, eyeliner, blush, lipstick, and lip gloss), scars and tattoos, and more. Outfit colors can also be customized on an extremely detailed level, and players are given the ability to choose from a wide variety of colors. I had to physically tear myself away from the character creator--one could easily spend an hour or more perfecting their pilot's look. In the end, I had a female pilot with heart-shaped pupils, impeccable makeup, and beautifully animated waist-length hair with a black-to-purple ombré dye job. While playing, I encountered pilots with equally varied looks, including one who was wearing a sailor uniform and had a PC monitor for a head. (I later learned this pilot belonged to none other than Amazing Seasun Games CEO and Mecha Break Game Director, Kris Kwok, who joined us for a few matches.)</p><p dir="ltr">Additional customization options like clothing colors, hairstyles, tattoos, and eyeliner designs can be purchased using an in-game currency that you earn for free while playing the game, which is a plus. After just a few hours, I had more than enough currency to customize every inch of my pilot ten times over. While items like pilot outfits will likely be sold via an in-game store when the game is released, the build I played allowed for plenty of customization without the need for players to spend real-life currency. Oh, and players can also customize their Striker as well as its pilot, using the same in-game currency.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4452073-mb2pilot.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4452073" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4452073-mb2pilot.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4452073"></a><figcaption>Character customization is extremely detailed, and doesn't cost a dime of real-life currency.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4452073-mb2pilot.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">After reluctantly dragging myself away from the incredibly detailed character creator, I climbed into a Striker and tried out three game modes. The first was your standard 3v3 team deathmatch-style mode. The second was a 6v6 mode that really leaned into hero shooter mechanics, with different maps having different objectives--one map had my squad protecting a moving payload from an enemy team as it traveled across the map, while another saw us fighting to control a series of three map points in a king-of-the-hill-style match. The third mode, called Mashmak, is Mecha Break's "signature mode," according to its developers.</p><p dir="ltr">Mashmak is a PvPvE mode that sees 10 three-player teams dropped into an absolutely <em>enormous</em> map, where they must defeat both AI-controlled enemies and player-controlled squads, collect loot, and--if they want to keep that loot--reach an extraction point. The extraction point appears 10 minutes in, but you don't have to hit it immediately, as another extraction point will spawn every five minutes for the remainder of the match. But you don't want to wait too long--after 15 minutes, a Pulse Storm will begin devouring the map. You can delay this to some degree by destroying some of the drones controlling the storm, but ultimately, the appearance of the Pulse Storm is your sign that it's time to extract as soon as possible.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to being visually appealing, Mecha Break's Mashmak maps are absolutely enormous. Each of the game's Strikers has the ability to fly long distances (though some have bigger fuel reserves than others), and during the preview event, we were told that even if the Strikers had infinite fuel reserves, it would still take roughly <em>10 minutes</em> to fly from one end of the map to the other. Mecha Break's maps aren't just wide, however--they also have a huge amount of verticality. Players can fly up and over the side of large mountains which, in most games, are usually put there to keep players penned in. This is not the case with Mecha Break--if you can see it, you can fly over it. Of course, there's a limit--fly too high and an alert will appear on screen alongside an out-of-bounds timer, signaling players to lower their altitude--but I didn't often find myself flying too close to the sun.</p><p dir="ltr">One might imagine that with a map this big, keeping a squad together might be difficult, but in my experience, that wasn't the case. Mecha Break's Strikers fly fast and far, fuel reserves replenish quickly, and as long as you're communicating with your team, you're unlikely to find yourself in a situation where your squad is too far away to help.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4452121-mb6airborne.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4452121" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4452121-mb6airborne.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4452121"></a><figcaption>Mecha Break's maps are absolutely enormous, and quite beautiful.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4452121-mb6airborne.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Speaking of going airborne, flying in Mecha Break feels <em>amazing</em>. The game's developers lean into airborne combat, rather than shy away from it, so each Striker has decent fuel reserves and can stay airborne for quite a while. I played the game with both mouse-and-keyboard controls and an Xbox controller, and both input methods felt equally seamless when I took to the sky.</p><p dir="ltr">Combat, too, felt seamless and satisfying. I played around with a few different mechs, but quickly found my favorite Striker in Alysnes, an agile, sword-wielding mech with an arsenal that also included a machine gun, a shield, and a special ability that shoots deadly lasers in multiple directions.. Mecha Break has an interesting lock-on mechanic--keep an enemy in your line of sight for a brief moment and a large red triangle will appear around them, indicating that your target is locked, and you're free to fire away. The lock-on mechanic works the same way for every Striker, and if you lose sight of an enemy, you'll have to get them back in your field of vision and lock on again if you want to continue attacking them. Thankfully, locking on doesn't take long.</p><p dir="ltr">Alysnes' gun does decent damage, but I had far more fun using her sword. With her sword equipped and her target locked, Alysnes will zoom toward the enemy and begin slashing away. If that target happens to be in the air, she will automatically go airborne as well, leading to tons of intense, mid-air fights to the death. Speaking of death, what happens when your Striker's health hits zero depends on the game mode. In non-Mashmak matches, your pilot will automatically eject from their mech, and you'll be removed from the battle for a brief time period before redeploying from the sky to rejoin your teammates. In Mashmak mode, your fellow squadmates will have to respawn you themselves.</p><p dir="ltr">In its current state, Mecha Break feels like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/titanfall-2/">Titanfall 2</a> if you gave it a can of Red Bull and let it spend the day playing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/armored-core-vi-fires-of-rubicon/">Armored Core</a>. It's an incredibly good time, and does a great job of making you feel like you really are piloting a gigantic robot--bridges crumble when you forcefully land on them, parts of buildings break apart when you send an enemy crashing into them, and while the Strikers feel appropriately hefty, they never feel clunky.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4452122-mb5lockon.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4452122" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4452122-mb5lockon.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4452122"></a><figcaption>Locking onto enemies is easy--just keep them in your line of sight.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4452122-mb5lockon.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Aside from the lack of variation in pilot body shapes and a few instances of rather silly looking jiggle physics on feminine pilots, it's truly difficult to find much to complain about when it comes to Mecha Break's current build. Unlike a lot of newer hero shooters currently on the market, Mecha Break appears to have a well-defined identity--it knows what it is, and it knows who it's for. Though there are plenty of similarities to Titanfall, it never feels like a rip-off, and while the Alysnes Striker <em>does</em> feel a lot like Titanfall 2's Ronin Titan, Mecha Break's Strikers operate differently--and frankly, more gracefully--than Titans. You can't manually eject your pilot and run around ripping batteries out of other mechs, nor does each Striker have a unique voice and distinct personality for you to grow attached to, but that doesn't feel detrimental to the quality of the game.</p><p dir="ltr">Mecha Break doesn't have a single-player campaign, but there is a tutorial mission, and the game has an ongoing plot revolving around the mining of a strange, crystal-like element known as Corite. Amazing Seasun Games says that the story will be supported with additional media, including manga and animated shorts. But even if you completely removed the plot from the equation, Mecha Break could still stand firm (and fly high) on the foundation of its gameplay, which thus far is engaging, smooth, satisfying, and frankly, fun as all hell.</p><p dir="ltr">Curious to learn more about Mecha Break's development, I sat down with Amazing Seasun Games CEO and Mecha Break game director Kris Kwok to find out how exactly this high-flying hero shooter got off the ground.</p><p dir="ltr">"I came to Hong Kong when I was very young, so I got to know [of] mecha when I was very young, maybe when I was in the second or third year of primary school," Kwok told me. "So, for Mecha Break, my biggest inspiration would be these works: First of all, Gundam. Secondly, Macross."</p><p dir="ltr">Given the complexities of the game--13 mechs with various abilities, multiple modes, enormous maps--I was curious to hear what sort of challenges the development team faced while working to bring Mecha Break to life.</p><p dir="ltr">"In the Chinese market, as long as you're doing something sci-fi related, [or] mecha-related, there's almost no beginning," Kwok said. "If you want to do something, you'll be the first one [to do it]. So, in terms of hiring the right people and getting the right technology in place, we had barely anything to begin with. In the beginning, we invested in a British team. We learned a lot from the British team. Their original [idea] was to do it on PS2, a space-fighter shooter project. In the end, we've experienced several failures. The second time, we worked with the UK team, our team, and [a team of] Japanese designers. We failed. Then, we did it ourselves--we asked the Japanese designers to be our consultants. We failed. In 2021, I think we learned a lot. In this process [of failure], we learned a few key techniques that allowed us to break through. In terms of design, [that breakthrough was] the design language of mechas, [which] deviate from the traditional, low-quality toy-looking kind of appearances, and [look] way more cool."</p><p dir="ltr">Another challenge was making Mecha Break's mechs look appropriately robotic.</p><p dir="ltr">"You cannot just map the skin onto a human body, because mechas don't move like humans," Kwok explained. "We had to re-design the animation of the mecha's skeletal structure, and then we had to follow up with animations in that sense. The second [challenge] in terms of technology was hard surface modeling. We had to make it [look] really hard, very industrial looking. Through numerous iterations, we mastered that as well."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4452123-mb3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4452123" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4452123-mb3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4452123"></a><figcaption>Kwok says getting Mecha Break's Strikers to look realistically robotic was a challenge.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4452123-mb3.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">While we were on the topic of animation and modeling, I had to know: Why add such a detailed, RPG-esque character creator?</p><p dir="ltr">"Amazing Seasun Games already has a reputable history for the past three decades of making Chinese-themed traditional wuxia games," Kwok explained. "So, we kind of transferred those core competencies over to the character-creation stage. We don't want you just to identify with the hard metal mecha surface--there's an actual person behind it: The human, the pilot, that you can eventually identify with. If you get to create a character that physically looks like you, the player, you will have a stronger sense of immersion in the world. <em>You</em> are playing that mecha, <em>you</em> are the pilot."</p><p dir="ltr">Amazing Seasun Games has held a number of community playtests, so the next thing I wanted to know was how player feedback has shaped Mecha Break's development. Kwok told me that he and his team have received a ton of player feedback regarding the game's user interface and gameplay balance.</p><p dir="ltr">"In terms of the feedback that we've gotten, mostly it's in terms of the product itself, the UI, the experience, etc.," Kwok said. "So we're working on that too. And the balance takes time, you know? Nobody can get it right the first time. I'm not surprised that we've gotten a lot of feedback in terms of balance as well, and the players had expectations of PvE in addition to PvP."</p><p dir="ltr">It was at this point, Kwok said, he and the team were faced with a monumental decision: Should there be a single-player campaign?</p><p dir="ltr">"A [single-player] campaign is a one-time-through kind of deal," Kwok said. "So we kind of decided against it."</p><p dir="ltr">Another aspect I was curious about was balance. My experience with Mecha Break was smooth and seamless, and there was never a time where I felt one of the game's 13 mechs had a massive advantage over the others, or a blatant weakness in need of addressing. I asked Kwok how on Earth the team went about balancing the game's lineup of mech-heroes, and which mech was his favorite. The answer truly surprised me.</p><p dir="ltr">"So, first of all, as the producer and designer of all that--I'm not talking about the aesthetics or the outward appearances [of the mechs], but the weaponization was all done by me, myself--for me, each of them is like my own child," Kwok told me, explaining that he had personally spent hundreds of hours playing and perfecting each mech. "So, it's hard for me to tell you which one I like the most, because I had to play each one of them many times, try a lot of things, and constantly modify them.</p><p dir="ltr">"Of course, balance is a very, very difficult process. So in this process, the question is, 'Which one is the most difficult to balance?' I can't say which one is the most difficult to balance. In terms of balance in this game, I'd rather stay away from the traditional buffing [or] nerfing some units, giving them more stats, HP, armor, all that."</p><p dir="ltr">Instead, Kwok added that he's more focused on "the actual player's control in-game, rather than giving you a number to tell you which one is the hardest to balance. It's always an ongoing process, there's no endpoint [to] a game's balance anyway."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4452124-mb4gameplay.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4452124" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4452124-mb4gameplay.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4452124"></a><figcaption>Balancing the abilities of all 13 Strikers was no small task, Kwok says.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4452124-mb4gameplay.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">It's clear that even while tweaking small details, Kwok always has his eye on the big picture first and foremost. When I asked what aspect of the game he was most excited for players to experience, he simply told me, "Actually, I think [I'm most looking forward to the reception of] the game as a whole. At its core, what we want to create in the game is the feeling of driving a machine gun. Whether it's 6v6, Mashmak, or 3v3, we want all players to feel like, 'Okay, I'm really driving this machine, I'm controlling this machine, it's like part of my body.'"</p><p dir="ltr">"I'm counting on the player to experience that kind of integration, unity, the pilot being one with the mech," Kwok said.</p><p>Mecha Break does not yet have an official launch date, but is slated for release on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S sometime in 2025. It is currently available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2452280/Mecha_BREAK/" rel="nofollow">wishlist on Steam</a>.</p>

			<p>Today, during the latest Digital Extremes stream, the Canadian developer shared more details about the upcoming Warframe update Techrot Encore. Due to launch on March 19, this big update will add the 60th Warframe to the game, Temple.</p>
<p>Playing as this character, users will fire off heatwave projectiles, summon Techrot Subwoofer minions to buff nearby fans and debuff the haters, sing a Solo of the century to set off flame jets, and even call upon the sapient Infested guitar named Lizzie as an Exalted Weapon capable of firing projectiles at the pluck of a string and transforming into a flamethrower for a limited time.</p>
<p>There are also four new Protoframes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flare (Temple), who aims to be the ultimate work of art, transcending the boundaries of both gender and biology.</li>
<li>Minerva (Saryn) and Velimir II (Frost), two hardened military veterans, once in love, and the adoptive parents of <a href="https://wccftech.com/warframe-1999-is-available-everywhere-today/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warframe: 1999</a> antagonist Major Rusalka.</li>
<li>Kaya (Nova), voiced by Juzel Bagabuyo, is the self-taught engineering genius of the new crew with a special interest in cracking time travel.</li>
</ul>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/TECHROT-RECAP2-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<p>When it comes to new content, the developers are introducing two new mission types to the game. One is Stage Defense, which reimagines the traditional defense mission type. In this one, you must defend Flare as they put on a memorial concert for the band members lost to the Scaldra's oppressive takeover of the city. Temporal Archimedea, on the other hand, is the most challenging Warframe mission type. In this new version, players group with Minerva and Velimir II to take on three back-to-back randomly selected missions, using Kaya's new Peely Pix system to select upgradeable modifiers that change the flow of each attempt. Lastly, as part of the studio's Make-A-Wish commitment to James Conlin, Techrot Encore adds the latest atomic racing mini-game as part of the Höllvania Mall Hub arcade collection, Ollie's Crash Course.</p>
<p>Today also marks the release of the Open Beta for the new Warframe mobile companion app, featuring Steam login support, improved navigation, and a redesign of the settings page. You can get it for iOS <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/KPfve5cm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> and for Android <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.digitalextremes.warframenexus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

<p>Megan Everett, Director of Community at Digital Extremes, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>Warframe will officially turn 12 years old on March 7, a milestone none of us ever thought we would hit when we first started. We want to make sure our players know how thankful we are for them through our content plans this year. Techrot Encore marks not only the first major update of our 12th year but also the biggest ‘echoes’ update we’ve ever made to expand out something like Warframe: 1999. We’re stoked to finally bring our surreal space virus boy band to life and everything that comes with them, so get ready for the party of your lifetimes on March 19!</em></p>

<p>Today, Digital Extremes also aired a new live stream dedicated to <a href="https://wccftech.com/digital-extremes-soulframe-devstream-showcases-companions-new-social-hub-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Soulframe</a>, the upcoming fantasy-themed game. The team offered more details on the latest update for Preludes (Pre-Alpha Test) players, including two new social hubs tied to the faction system, a faction-based side-quest system, and gameplay of the new caster weapon type. In addition to the previously announced Silent Rose faction, players can now pledge allegiance to two other factions if their goals align: Alca's Children and Kith of Kings.</p>
<p>There are two new social Enclave hubs reserved for each faction, where players can take on a new type of side quest to further each group's goals. Lastly, the aforementioned new caster weapon type shown in the stream is capable of firing bolts of energy from both hands and even tricking enemies into thinking you're unarmed.</p>

<p>Out summer 2025, New Shores adheres to the first game's formula of carefully plonking down buildings to milk various adjacency bonuses and achieve a certain level score. Over the course of each stage, you unlock more and fancier buildings, each alighting in your inventory with that gentle kiss-pop effect that has become the cosy gaming genre's acoustic signature - a sort of Wilhelm Scream for creators of games about soft sunsets and rake-wielding bunnies making friends.</p>
<p>New Shores contains some new shores, obviously - we can expect "50 dynamic island generators offering endless variety". It also harbours new features. Foremost among them are boons - "one-time power ups unlocked on each stage as you collect points, offering a helping hand that will become vital as you take on the game's tricker levels". These might let you duplicate buildings in your inventory or replace those you've already built, among other "intriguing new twists". Sounds like that might come in handy with the new "advanced scoring systems that reward clever tactics".</p>
<p>There's also a new Sandbox mode (with separate save files), "44 unique building types", seven "stunning island properties", and a juicy photo mode with a spread of filters and a turntable camera setting. Streamers, meanwhile, get Twitch integration which lets viewers vote on building choices.</p>
<p>It all seems like Good Stuff, though I do consider it a little malapropos that one of the islands at the end of the trailer appears to be an active volcano. Did Islanders have volcanoes? I never unlocked any.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/halo-infinite-is-embracing-tac-shooters-with-search-destroy-mode-coming-this-year/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Halo team <a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/seek-and-deploy-extraction" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> today that S&amp;D Extraction, a round-based competitive mode based on tactical shooters and Call of Duty’s Search &amp; Destroy mode, is coming to Halo Infinite in 2025. S&amp;D Extraction will be a part of Halo Infinite’s esports scene, and a $20,000 contest for maps for the new mode will be held as well.</p>







<p>S&amp;D Extraction is Halo Infinite’s take on popular tactical shooters like CS2, VALORANT, or Call of Duty’s Search &amp; Destroy. The Halo Infinite mode’s full name, Seek and Deploy, is a clear reference to popular bomb plant/defusal mode from Call of Duty.</p>



<p>In S&amp;D Extraction, teams of four take turns on offense and defense. The offense tries to “initiate an Extraction” (plant the bomb) on one of two sites, while the defending aims to stop them by defeating all opponents or “converting” (defusing). An S&amp;D Extraction consists of 11 rounds, meaning the first team to win six wins.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Like CS2 or VALORANT, players have to manage an economy in between and during rounds of S&amp;D Extraction. Players earn credits for planting or defusing the bomb and getting kills, but can also secure extra credits at “neutral devices on the map.” Between rounds, players can buy weapons, grenades, equipment, and power equipment like Active Camo, Drop Wall, or Threat Sensor.</p>



<p>A unique mechanic coming to S&amp;D Extraction in Halo Infinite is a buy back mechanic, something that’s not common in other tac shooters. Players that have died in a round and have enough credits can “buy back” into the round, respawning at the spawn point with a base loadout. While exact numbers aren’t clear, the team at Halo Studios says buying back will be expensive, and will require several rounds of saving credits to afford.</p>



<p>As mentioned at the top of the article, a $20,000 S&amp;D Extraction map contest is being held by Halo Studios and ForgeHub. Halo Studios has also hired Forge community mapmakers Artifice and Mikrips to build the mode and its custom map. The first look at the new mode is scheduled for the FaZe Kaysan Invitational on March 29, and will be broadcast on the official Halo Twitch channel.</p>



<p>Halo Infinite has seen dwindling player numbers for some time now. Is this enough to give the player base a much needed spike? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/call-of-duty-2025-in-development-for-last-gen-consoles.1711/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official Insider Gaming Forums.</a></p>

                <p>It's been almost five years since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/axiom-verge-2-surprise-releases-on-switch-today-alongside-six-other-games/1100-6495049/" data-ref-id="1100-6495049">Islanders</a> gave cozy-game lovers a casually engaging city-building experience. Now, Coatsink has announced that a sequel, Islanders: New Shores, is coming to consoles and PC this summer. In the first-look video below, New Shores retains the appealing aspects of the first Islanders while teasing some of the new features that will be integrated into the gameplay.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lAgsVJxyJ4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8lAgsVJxyJ4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As in the first game, New Shores allows players to develop cities and structures on a series of breathtakingly gorgeous islands and transform them as they see fit. Each level begins with a number of buildings at players' disposal, but they also have consider where the structures should be placed in order to get the maximum amount of points during the stage. Earning those points allows additional buildings to be unlocked, which opens the door to even more options.</p><p>One of the new features introduced in New Shores is called boons. It's a one-time power-up that's unlocked on each stage as players collect points. Boons can allow players to perform some of the more difficult tasks in a single action, including the creation of duplicate buildings and the destruction of others to make way for something new. However, boons should be used sparingly, since some of the trickier levels may need them more than the earlier levels do.</p><p>New Shores is introducing an additional sandbox mode that has a save system that is separate from the high score mode. A photo mode has also been added to preserve players' favorite creations or even just pictures of the beautiful islands themselves. To share the experience, Coatsink is adding Twitch integration to New Shores, as well as the option for viewers to vote on which buildings to pick.</p><p>Islanders: New Shores will be available on Nintendo Switch, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC. Beyond the Summer 2025 window, Coatsink hasn't set a specific release date yet.</p>

            <p>
More than 110 former Metro series developers have come together as a new studio, known as Reburn, and its first project - La Quimera - is sci-fi shooter set in Latin America that's being co-written by Drive director Nicolas Winding Refn.
</p>
<p>
The specifics of the announcement have lead to some confusion as talk of rebranding has gone around, but Reburn essentially appears to Metro developer sub-studio 4A Games Ukraine breaking away from 4A Games' Malta-based headquarters to do its own thing. As for the 4A Games that remains, it continues to work on a new IP and the next Metro project.
</p>
<p>
Reburn, though, consists of over 110 former Metro developers, including gameplay designers, artists, sound engineers, and programmers - all led by former 4A Games Ukraine CEO Dmytro Lymar. And its debut project is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2282350/La_Quimera/">sci-fi FPS La Quimera</a>, promising "familiar tense gunplay and intimate storytelling" in a futuristic Latin American megalopolis and lush jungle setting.

<p>
La Quimera sees players - either going it solo or co-operatively with up to two friends - stepping into the customisable exosuit of a down-on-their-luck PMC soldier battling against rival factions. There's talk of "unique and highly detailed environments, characters and weapons", as players experience a world and narrative written and created by Nicolas Winding Refn (Drive, Only God Forgives, The Neon Demon) and E.J.A. Warren.
</p>
<p>
You can get a taste of that in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u_qFKhoB8c&amp;t=57s">La Quimera's announcement trailer</a> above. But Reburn - which also has a presence in Cyprus alongside its Ukraine and remote teams - says it'll share more on the PC game, alongside additional "supporting visuals", in the coming months.

I’ve landed on four standout game demos that are worth your time now and whenever their full games release.</p><div><p id="the-talos-principle-reawakened"><h2>The Talos Principle Reawakened</h2></p></div><p>The best way to describe <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2806640%2FThe_Talos_Principle_Reawakened%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>The Talos Principle: Reawakened</em></a> is if <em>Portal </em>was harder, less funny, and written by C.S. Lewis if he knew what a robot was. <em>Reawakened</em> is a remaster of 2014’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2014/12/17/7411513/the-talos-principle-review"><em>The Talos Principle</em></a>. But according to the developers at Croteam, <em>Reawakened</em> doesn’t just take the original and slap on a next-gen coat of paint; it also adds new story content and a new puzzle editor so players can create their own challenges. </p><p><em>Reawakened</em> strikes the perfect difficulty balance – not too simple, not too frustrating – that makes its puzzles delightful to figure out. In the demo, you play as a robot tasked with solving puzzles using lasers, signal jammers, and your own burgeoning sentience. The game gives you no tutorial on how exactly to use the tools you’re given. And while that can be annoying if their function is too esoteric to parse, learning what I’m being asked to do and how to use the tools to do it was part of the fun. With the lasers, it was thrilling figuring out that I can split a beam in multiple directions, something I only learned by going, “Hey, wonder if I can do this?” and finding out that I could.</p><p>As for the story, there is an overarching narrative involving the architects of the open-world place you’ve been dropped in, but the game’s graphics on the Steam Deck made those narrative sequences – which involve you using a computer terminal – impossible to read and therefore parse. I didn’t mind it because I’m just here for the little thrills you get completing a challenge which were manifold in the 40-minute demo. </p><div><p id="bundle-of-joy"><h2>Bundle of Joy</h2></p></div><p><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F3138370%2FBundle_of_Joy%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Bundle of Joy</em></a> was the most touching and heartfelt of the games I played. It’s a narrative minigame-a-palooza ala the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22632465/warioware-get-it-together-nintendo-switch-preview"><em>WarioWare</em></a> games in which you’re a new dad tasked with caring for your new baby and maintaining your sanity in the middle of the pandemic lockdown. Every day is split into tasks like making bottles, putting on baby’s socks, and making trips to the grocery store. The minigames are simple like hitting buttons in the right sequence and timing to rock your baby to sleep, but because being a new parent is inordinately stressful, each task adds to an ever growing stress meter. Fill it up, and you have a breakdown. Your partner taps in to take the baby while you take a breather. </p><p>What I loved about this demo was the sweetness and empathy with which it treats its subject matter. I don’t have kids (yet), but there was something about being asked to input my skin tone, my partner’s skin tone, and my baby’s skin tone that just <em>got </em>me. I’m a Black woman in an interracial relationship and it was really cool to see the game account for a family dynamic like mine would be. Also when you have a breakdown, it’s not treated as a failure, only as a fact of parenthood. The game encourages you with messages like “You’re doing great. It’s okay!” that I think would make any new or aspiring parent feel reassured when it comes to the ultimate game: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/24278723/comic-baby-monitor-surveillance-history-tech">raising a kid</a>.</p><div><p id="creepy-redneck-dinosaur-mansion-3"><h2>Creepy Redneck Dinosaur Mansion 3</h2></p></div><p>Listen, I don’t know how you could see a game named <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2116510%2FCreepy_Redneck_Dinosaur_Mansion_3%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Creepy Redneck Dinosaur Mansion 3</em></a> and not play it. Same with anything the developers at Strange Scaffold put out. According to the description, <em>CRDM3</em> (which, hilariously, is actually the first game in the series) is a comedic match-3 and metroidvania, which the developers helpfully call a “matchroidvania.” But it is so much more.</p><p>In it, you play as JJ Hardwell, an agent of the Alcohol, Tobacco, and Super Science Bureau who is tasked with investigating a mansion for suspected dinosaur activity. You use match-3 action to take down the evil saurians while choosing which way to go through the mysterious maze of a mansion. Along the way, the choices you make contribute to JJ’s abilities that help him overcome the mansion’s many obstacles. An observation made in one area will, later on, open up a path that would have otherwise remained blocked off.</p><p>The match-3 elements are surprisingly deep, allowing you to use items and abilities powered by the gems you match to defeat enemies. <em>CRDM3</em> is funny as hell, with all kinds of meta jokes about game development that I suspect will delight the players who know their way around Unity or Godot.</p><div><p id="promise-mascot-agency"><h2>Promise Mascot Agency</h2></p></div><p>In <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2585830%2FPromise_Mascot_Agency%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Promise Mascot Agency</em></a>, you play as a disgraced yakuza sent to a derelict town to raise $80 million by managing a mascot business. But instead of sending out real people in adorable cat or poop costumes to birthday parties or to promote a new business opening, you’ve got a larger-than-life sentient severed pinky or a partially eaten and crying block of tofu. As for the actual game mechanics, they don’t seem to matter all that much in relation to the story, but in a good way. You get job requests, send out mascots who fit the requirements, and if they get into trouble, there’s a turn-based, card battler minigame you play to overcome the issue. There are also open-world elements where you drive around in one of those <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kei_truck">kei trucks</a> that have recently <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/autos/kei-trucks-are-gaining-popularity-us-small-size-low-prices-rcna156653">become all the rage</a>, picking up collectibles, finding spare cash, and recruiting new mascots to help your business.</p><p>Once you get beyond the wacky premise, the <em>Promise Mascot Agency</em> actually has real heart. Yes, your coworker is a walking, talking, foul-mouthed severed pinky who is so unsettling and cute at the same time that I can’t stop <em>staring</em> at her. But your job is to work with her to revive a town that’s seen economic and social devastation by fostering real connections with the people who live there. </p><p>The singular best thing about discovering games via Next Fest is seeing developers’ creativity on full display. In games, the default way to drum up interest is by making something that’s easily explainable – <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/22/24047087/palworld-early-access-steam-xbox-gamepass"><em>Pokémon</em> but with guns</a>, for example. But for Next Fest, I loved finding games that defy succinct explanations like “surrealist Japanese mascot management simulator.”</p><p>Yes, that may make it hard to sell to the average consumer, but games don’t and shouldn’t have to be broadly appealing to be successful. The developers of these games know exactly what they are and that they are not for everybody. And in making these weird little freak games, they’ve managed to punch through all the “x but make it y” noise to truly stand out. Play them — or use Next Fest as an opportunity to venture outside your comfort zone to find something truly special.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>NetEase Games has announced today that the cross-platform test for Once Human has begun, where it will be testing the cross-platform feature for mobile devices and PC in particular. This will benefit players greatly, as it will widen the pool of players available to interact with, as well as giving them more of a chance to build, engage in combat, and explore the post-apocalyptic world that has been taken over by Lovecraftian creatures.</p>
<p>At the moment, Once Human is only available on PC, but the game will be available on Android and iOS devices come April 2025, and the versions will be cross-compatible.</p>
<p>For those who are interested in joining Once Human's current cross-platform test, it is currently live and will be available to participate in until March 30. Players across Europe, Japan, and North America can sign up to participate. To sign up, you can either <a href="https://research.easebar.com/htmls/863iir/paper.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complete a survey</a> within Once Human or join through the official social media for Once Human. There are limited slots for this test, so make sure you sign up quickly.</p>
<p>For those who want to test the game on mobile, iOS users will have to participate through TestFlight, while Android users will have to install the game's APK from the official website. Of course, for those on PC, the process is significantly easier, and you can jump into the test via the game's official client once you've been added to the test.</p>
<p>It's also been confirmed that the cross-platform test will be using the current global server environment from the PC version of Once Human. This means that those joining on mobile or PC will get access to all Scenarios, as well as the Visional Wheel and Lunar Oracle.</p>
<p>In addition to the cross-platform test, pre-registration is now live for the mobile version of Once Human. The full launch of the mobile version is scheduled for an unmentioned date in April 2025. You can<a href="https://usw2.nyl.as/t1/129/f42m6hk9tex0ofpxkzu7weoo7/3/c52da950fe9ce2ab511d86047fac03b84befe1d1625a354bd30a7d621e7f76c9" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> pre-register</a> your interest in playing the mobile version of Once Human, where you can then win in-game rewards, which include some great weapons and items that can prove beneficial to your journey. You can also try your luck by pre-registering, as you'll be entered into a draw to win an iPhone 16 Pro Max.</p>
<p>Since its release, Once Human has performed very well and has received a multitude of updates, including specific PvP Scenarios and<a href="https://wccftech.com/once-human-august-update-out-includes-animal-ranching/"> Animal Ranching</a>, for those who prefer to have a little bit of a farm life in the game.</p>

The modern <em>Pokémon </em>games have been universally plagued by technical issues, but the debate about the series’ graphics and art style is a bit more complicated and subjective than simple acknowledgments of technical shortcomings. <em>Legends: Z-A </em>is being held to a lot of scrutiny after games like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-review-nintendo-switch-1849843125&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-review-nintendo-switch-1849843125"><em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em></a></span><em> </em>traded the intimate, crafted environments of their predecessors for open-world scope, and the fandom seems divided on whether the upcoming Switch RPG is an improvement or another step in the wrong direction.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

But it is a step up from the 2022 RPGs in that it’s more colorful, uses smaller environments to get more details and textures on screen, and at least in the trailer, it looks like it’s running better than <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em> do, too. I’m open to conversations about whether <em>Legends: Z-A </em>looks bad, but I feel like anyone who thinks it looks <em>worse</em> than the ugly open world of Paldea probably hasn’t booted up <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet </em>in a minute or is wearing rose-colored glasses. The side-by-side comparisons are pretty damning.</p><p>For all the discussion happening in the <em>Pokémon </em>fandom, <em>Legends: Z-A </em>feels like a calculated pivot away from the pitfalls of the series’ recent open-world entries. It’s focusing on a smaller world by taking place entirely in Lumiose City, which means we’ll hopefully not be subject to the same framerate culling and texture pop-in that plagued <em>Legends: Arceus </em>and <em>Scarlet</em> / <em>Violet</em>. But even if it’s a technical step up earned through careful planning, does <em>Legends: Z-A</em> beat the ugly artstyle accusations? That’s the question fans can’t seem to agree on.</p><p>I’m still interested in some of the mechanical changes <em>Legends: Z-A </em>is implementing like real-time battles, but the longer I’ve thought about it, the more I’m disappointed that visually, the <em>Legends</em> subseries isn’t following in the superior footsteps of <em>Legends: Arceus</em>. Yes, <em>Arceus</em> had some of the same technical troubles that impacted <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em>, but it was generally pretty to look at because it adopted a colorful cel-shaded look. Seeing <em>Legends: Z-A </em>fall in step with <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet </em>is a bummer because moving away from the open-zone structure could have, in theory, given Game Freak the chance to focus on smaller environments with some visual flair and personality. <em>Sword </em>and <em>Shield</em> was the last game that featured (primarily) smaller environments, and it had some real standout towns that popped on screen and had a real sense of place. I look back at the city of Ballonlea, which is adorned with colorful, bioluminescent mushrooms, as a reminder that Game Freak can create gorgeous environments when it scales back. Lumiose City looks better than anything in <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em>, but if it were more stylized, it could look even better.</p><p>Hopefully, we’ll see something more visually striking between now and when <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </em>launches on Switch later this year. Until then, at least I haven’t seen anyone <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/c0l58j/why_is_this_ok/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/c0l58j/why_is_this_ok/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">getting mad about the trees.</a></span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The storage box holds up to 250 sleeved cards and three punch-out dividers, making it an affordable way to keep your new cards safe as you start your collection.</p>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DDL8HJ2M,B0DDL6BJDS&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DDL8HJ2M,B0DDL6BJDS&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DDL8HJ2M,B0DDL6BJDS&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Disney Lorcana - Archazia’s Island Starter Deck</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DDL8HJ2M,B0DDL6BJDS&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DDL8HJ2M,B0DDL6BJDS&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DDL8HJ2M,B0DDL6BJDS&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$17</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>Don’t want the hassle of building your own deck?

In the post, they answered over a dozen fan questions about how the upcoming open-world stealth game will perform on consoles, specs needed on PC, upscaling and raytracing options, and more. And in this new post, Ubisoft confirmed that <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> on Steam won’t, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-connect-steam-assassin-s-creed-valhalla-1849809946&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-connect-steam-assassin-s-creed-valhalla-1849809946">like past many Ubisoft PC games</a></span>, require players to download and install Ubisoft Connect.</p><p>So yes, here’s the good news: According to Ubisoft, you won’t need to muck about with a separate launcher when playing <em>Shadows </em>via Steam. The company says that <em>Shadows </em>includes a “lite embedded version” of Ubisoft Connect in it. </p><p>However, you’ll still need to link your Steam account to a Ubisoft Connect account to play <em>Shadows</em>. Ubisoft promises this is a “one-time” thing and once you link the accounts you will be good to go, but it is still a weird barrier between Steam users and the game. And for those worried that this means you have to be online to play <em>Shadows</em>, that’s not the case. Ubisoft confirmed you only need an internet connection to install the game. Then you can play offline. </p><p>Now for some bad news: Steam Deck users won’t be playing <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> at launch. In today’s tech Q&amp;A, Ubisoft very bluntly responded to a question about <em>Shadows </em>on Steam Deck with: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>At launch, the game will not be compatible with Steam Deck, due to the fact it is below our minimum specs for PC.</p></blockquote><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/steam-deck-2024-big-games-unplayable-space-marine-2-pc-1851669933?_gl=1*1lj6v08*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MDc2NTY5Ni4xNy4xLjE3NDA3NjY1NjAuNjAuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/steam-deck-2024-big-games-unplayable-space-marine-2-pc-1851669933?_gl=1*1lj6v08*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MDc2NTY5Ni4xNy4xLjE3NDA3NjY1NjAuNjAuMC4w">This isn’t surprising, as more and more games are struggling to run on the aging Steam Deck</a></span>. However, the fact that Ubisoft specified it won’t be playable <em>at launch</em> is interesting. Perhaps in a future update the company will add some Steam Deck options to make it playable on Valve’s portable PC. But if you don’t have a computer that can play <em>Shadows</em> and rely on a Steam Deck to play PC games, I’d hold off on buying the new <em>Assassin’s Creed.</em></p><p><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> is nearly here. The game launches on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC on March 20. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But one trio of monsters that fans were really hoping to see did NOT appear: the elemental monkeys Panpour, Pansage, and Pansear.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Why are fans so hung up on the monkey trio? It's a bit complicated. The three monkeys and their evolutions have been a part of an increasingly shrinking list of Pokémon that are currently unavailable in any Nintendo Switch game. If you want to truly catch 'em all, you still can, by transferring them from other Pokémon games pre-Switch to Pokémon Home. But at the moment, the following Pokémon are unavailable for capture natively in any Nintendo Switch Pokémon game:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Panpour</li><li>Pansage</li><li>Pansear</li><li>Simipour</li><li>Simisage</li><li>Simisear</li><li>Patrat</li><li>Watchog</li><li>Furfrou</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">This list used to be much longer, but Game Freak added a ton of new Pokémon in the DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet that culled the list down to these nine. What's more, the trailer we saw yesterday showed both Patrat and Furfrou, confirming these two at least will be available in Legends: Arceus. And since Watchog evolves from Patrat, it's a safe bet it will be in the game too. So that just leaves the three monkeys.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The elemental monkey trio was first introduced in Pokémon Black and White, and are somewhat beloved by fans due to the unique way the player obtains them. In Black and White, the first Gym the player encounters will use a typing that the player's starter Pokémon is weak against. However, if the player visits a certain person in the Dreamyard, they'll receive the monkey that has an advantage against that Gym, making it easier to tackle. Their designs are also memorable for being based on the "Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil" wise monkeys of Japanese folklore.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/28/pokmon-legends-z-a-releases-in-late-2025-3-1740761188956.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Furfrou lets out a lakeside howl in Pokemon Legends Z-A.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Realistically, the odds of the monkey trio showing up in Legends: Z-A are actually pretty good. It would be very surprising for Game Freak to leave them out of what could possibly be the last major Pokémon game on Nintendo Switch, and given that they appeared in the Kalos region PokéDex back in the day, it only makes sense for them to still be there in Z-A.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even if the monkeys are included, there's still one other problem Game Freak needs to solve: Spinda. Spinda is catchable on Nintendo Switch in Brilliant Diamond/Shining Pearl, but due to an error in how the game reads its spot patterns, it cannot be transferred to Pokémon Home. You can still get a Spinda from pre-Switch games transferred to Home, but the weird stuck nature of Spindas on Switch means that the dizzy little bear could probably use a functional Z-A appearance too, if Game Freak feels amenable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-first-trailer-reveals-rooftop-running-gameplay-and-late-2025-release-window">first real look at Pokémon Legends Z-A</a> gave us a lot to take in, and we're still dissecting the footage to find all the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-fans-are-frantically-trying-to-work-out-how-pokemon-legends-z-a-connects-to-other-pokemon-games">connections between this and other, past Pokémon games</a>.

But it also outlined several awaited features it’ll bring:</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 Update 7.0:</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>One Chapter Pack</li><li>One Champion Pack</li><li>Private PvP lobbies</li><li>A new weapon (only in PvE for now)</li><li>New Operation</li><li>Weapon perks rebalance</li><li>Class weapon loadouts rework</li><li>PvE Prestige Rank</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">The PvE Prestige Rank is perhaps of most interest to veteran players of Space Marine 2 looking for a new challenge or goal to work towards. Here’s how it works: once you reach level 25 on a class, you can buy a Prestige Level that will unlock a unique Prestige Perk.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Choose them wisely,” Focus and Saber said, “because you won’t be able to change your selected Prestige Perks before unlocking the four Prestige Levels.” On top of that power boost, each class will have a unique cosmetic reward that emphasizes the class’ iconic armour part.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Space Marine 2 will get Public Test Servers (PTS) on Steam only in March before Patch 7 comes out. This will give fans early access to the upcoming features and the chance to share feedback so the developers can refine the content ahead of launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Focus and Saber teased the upcoming launch of Horde mode, a feature Space Marine 2 players have been looking forward to ever since the game came out last year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You’re very eager to get more info on the Horde Mode, it’s one of our top priorities right now,” Focus and Saber said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“One thing we can say is that it will be very different from the Space Marine 1 Horde Mode, and that there are surprises we can’t wait for you to find out about.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Once we get really interesting things to show you about it, we will do it!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Bear with us.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the same post, Focus and Saber also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-dev-stamps-out-live-service-game-talk-amid-backlash-to-fomo-community-events">stamped out live service game talk amid a backlash to 'FOMO' Community Events</a>.
