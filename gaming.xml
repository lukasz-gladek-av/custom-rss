<p>After a few lengthy delays, the tactical RPG <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/demonschool">Demonschool</a> has finally secured a final release date for the Switch, and you've not got long to wait. As announced during the Indie World Japan showcase, the Necrosoft Games-developed title will launch on <strong>3rd September 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>The game is influenced by the likes of <strong>Persona</strong> and <strong>Shin Megami Tensei</strong>, along with – and this is brilliant – italian horror cinema..? <em>Excuse</em> me?! So cool. Plenty of footage has already been made available through trailers and gameplay showcases, so if you haven't checked out Demonschool yet, then definitely take a peek when you can. It looks awesome.</p>
<p>Needless to say, it's nice to finally get a proper release date, and it sounds like Necrosoft's Brandon Sheffield is equally relieved, stating "“At long last, Demonschool is finally coming out. It's been a long road but we're through certification and ready to go. We really put a lot of ourselves into this thing and now the future of Demonschool is in your hands. We truly hope you will enjoy it."</p>
<p>We hope so too!</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fifteen-years-in-the-making-caves-of-qud-is-finally-coming-to-nintendo-switch-later-this-year.1264536/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Kitfox Games and Freehold Games have announced that <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/caves_of_qud">Caves of Qud</a></strong> is finally on its way to Switch via a Q4 2025 release. That's not even very far away!</p>
<p>For those who haven't heard of the game before, Caves of Qud is a game that spent a whopping 15 years in development and early access on PC, before releasing on that platform in December of last year to some outrageously gushing reviews.</p>
<p>We're looking at a retro-styled roguelike that's apparently got all of the goods here. Enough to make it a standout in one of the most oversaturated genres of all time, even. Wow. It certainly looks unique, with some fairly busy visuals that meld retro gaming chic with what looks like root directories from your dad's old PC. The good stuff, in short. You can also tell by the barmy text on-screen, and tons of lore at every turn, that there's a depth to the world you'll blast through.</p>
<p>You can check out the trailer above, and we'll leave you with some further details about the game itself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Caves of Qud is a science fantasy roguelike epic steeped in retrofuturism, deep simulation, and swathes of sentient plants. Come inhabit a living, breathing world and chisel through layers of thousand-year-old civilizations. Decide: is it a dying earth, or is it on the verge of rebirth? Do anything and everything. Caves of Qud is a deeply simulated, biologically diverse, richly cultured world.</p>
<p><strong>DEEP PHYSICAL SIMULATION</strong> — Don’t like the wall blocking your way? Dig through it with a pickaxe, or eat through it with your corrosive gas mutation, or melt it to lava. Yes, every wall has a melting point.</p>
<p><strong>FULLY SIMULATED CREATURES</strong> — Every monster and NPC is as fully simulated as the player. That means they have levels, skills, equipment, faction allegiances, and body parts. So if you have a mutation that lets you, say, psionically dominate a spider, you can traipse through the world as a spider, laying webs and eating things.</p>
<p><strong>DYNAMIC FACTION SYSTEM</strong> — Pursue allegiances with over 70 factions: apes, crabs, trees, robots, and highly entropic beings, just to name a few.</p>
<p><strong>RICHLY DETAILED SCIENCE FANTASY SETTING</strong> — Over fifteen years of worldbuilding have led to a rich, weird, labyrinthine, one-of-a-kind storyworld, layered on top of the simulation, all for you to explore. Live and drink, friend.</p>
<p><strong>TACTICAL GAMEPLAY</strong> — Turn-based, sandbox exploration and combat offers as many solutions as you and your mutations, implants, artifacts, and skills are creative enough to invent.</p>
<p><strong>RPG ELEMENTS</strong> — Quests, NPCs, villages, historic sites; some dynamic and some handwritten, interwoven to produce a transportative RPG experience.</p>
<p><strong>Play one of four modes:</strong></p>
<p><strong>CLASSIC</strong> — Like other traditional roguelikes, this mode has permadeath, meaning you lose your character when you die. Extremely challenging even for experts.<br>
<strong>ROLEPLAY</strong> — Play it like an RPG. Save your progress at checkpoints located in settlements.<br>
<strong>WANDER</strong> — Focus on exploration. Most creatures will not attack you, you don’t gain experience by killing, but you DO gain experience by discovering new locations and treating with legendary creatures.<br>
<strong>DAILY</strong> — One chance with a fixed character and world seed. How long will you survive?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Get to your ships!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/arcade_archives_d-day">D-Day</a>, Jaleco's 1984 arcade shooter, will arrive today on Nintendo Switch as part of Arcade Archives. The game, which this writer remembers quite enjoying back in ye olden days, sees players control a warship as it sails right up the screen, shooting down planes and blowing everything to ribbons as it goes.</p>
<p>Players have a selection of two weapons, and the little reticles on the screen, that you can see in the trailer above, pertain to each of these. Now, there was another D-Day game, in fact there have been a few, but this is the vertical shooter one, not the 1985 strategy game (which was impossibly difficult).</p>
<p>Watching the above trailer, we're also brought back to the wonderful world of mid-80s era arcade tunes and sound effects. A cacophony of ill-fitting music and incredibly loud beeps, boops and blasts await any soldiers brave enough to take on the challenge. The longest day, indeed.</p>
<p>Here's some more details and pics from the official press material:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"D-DAY" is a shooter released by JALECO in 1984.<br>
Your mission is to pilot your battleship, fending off enemy battleships and bombers, and destroy the enemy fortress.<br>
Today is the day the operation is to take place. The longest day begins...</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/demonschool-announced-for-pc-and-consoles/">Demonschool</a>, the tactical role-playing game developed by Necrosoft Games and published by Ysbryd Games, will launch next month on PC and consoles after being delayed indefinitely last year.</p>



<p>As announced during today's Nintendo Indie World Japan, the game will launch on September 3 on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Serie S, and Nintendo Switch. To celebrate the announcement, a new short trailer was also shared, showcasing some of the fifteen playable characters, all with unique fighting styles, the game's retro graphics, the battle system, and more. You can find the trailer below.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Demonschool release date trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fazy1L9KXFQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Demonschool has been in development for quite some time, and at one point, it looked like work on the game had stopped.&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/demonschool-preview/">Last year</a>, however, the game was relaunched with a playable demo that did an amazing job showcasing its unique premise and, most of all, its excellent battle system. You can learn more about it in my preview.</p>



<p><em>A few rather unique quirks make the Demonschool combat system intriguing. For starters, units can only move in straight lines and must use a special maneuver called Sidestep, which doesn't cost AP to adjust their movement range. Attacking enemies requires positioning characters in the correct range, and each attack also pushes the attacked unit, allowing the player to plan things out so that it will become possible to attack an enemy out of range at the start of the Planning Phase. Additionally, just defeating enemies is not enough to win, as not only players must defeat a required number of demons, but they also have to reach the opposite side of the combat arena with any character to seal a portal. Add in different roles for playable characters, frequent demon respawns, and special attacks with different properties, and you get a uniquely challenging battle system that could take some time to understand, but it offers a lot of strategic depth, making battles extremely fun.</em></p>



<p>Demonschool launches on September 3 on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Over the past decade and a half, <em>Eurogamer’s</em> <em>Digital Foundry </em>has become the most knowledgeable and trustworthy place to find out <em>just</em> how powerful a new video game console might be, where the hottest new games run the best, and why they sometimes <em>don’t</em>! <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-sony-ps5-pro-tech-interview-with-mark-cerny-and-mike-fitzgerald">Even Sony</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2017-project-scorpio-tech-revealed">and Microsoft</a> often favor <em>DF</em> for exclusive access to technical details.</p><p>But as of today, <em>Digital Foundry </em>is no longer a <em>Eurogamer</em> sub-brand, and it’s no longer <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/21/24161718/ign-gamer-network-acquisition">controlled by <em>IGN</em></a>. <em>DF</em>’s founder has purchased the publication and its complete archives, and a team of five is taking it completely independent.</p><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/664747/giant-bomb-independent-gaming-site-employee-owned">Like <em>Giant Bomb</em></a>, or the former <em>Kotaku</em> writers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/7/23949269/aftermath-video-games-kotaku-defector">who created <em>Aftermath</em></a>, it’s the latest example of video game journalists finding a path that’s different from corporate ownership. “We answer to nobody but you, the audience,” <em>DF</em> now says, as part of <a href="https://youtu.be/tl7bIJ2yu4I">a new podcast episode explaining the change</a>.</p></div><p>Buying <em>Digital Foundry </em>wasn’t much of an uphill battle, to hear editor and founder Richard Leadbetter tell it, partly because he only had to buy 25 percent. Leadbetter had been holding onto 50 percent of its shares since 2015, when he originally sold his other half to <em>Eurogamer</em> to help fund <em>DF</em>’s popular YouTube channel. <em>Eurogamer</em>’s parent company Gamer Network obtained that half, which then got acquired by ReedPop, before making its way to <em>IGN</em> when parent company Ziff Davis purchased Gamer Network in turn, each time postponing Leadbetter’s own attempts to buy the rest of his company again.</p><p>Then, this year, <em>IGN</em> suddenly offered to sell its half back: 25 percent to Leadbetter and 25 percent to investor Rupert Loman, who originally founded <em>Eurogamer</em> in 1999 with his brother Nick. But even 25 percent of the company wasn’t cheap: “I think this is pretty much easily the biggest thing I’ve ever bought, more than my house,” Leadbetter says.</p><p>Thankfully, <em>Digital Foundry</em> doesn’t need to worry about building an audience from scratch to pay its journalists. It’s already profitable all on its own, Leadbetter tells <em>The Verge</em> — with an <a href="https://www.patreon.com/digitalfoundry">established audience of paying subscribers on Patreon</a>, whose website estimates it pulls in roughly $200,000 a year, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry">a YouTube channel</a> with nearly 1.5 million subscribers.</p><p>But <em>DF</em> wants to <em>build</em> on that profitability, Leadbetter says, and he thinks the team can do that better without corporate ownership. He explains that the previous relationship where he owned half, and <em>IGN</em> or Gamer Network owned half, meant that all new investments had to be agreed upon by two parties with different priorities. “When you’re part of a large corporate entity, that spirit of innovation kind of gives way to the hard numbers,” he says.</p><div><p>(Leadbetter won’t tell me if he ran into any particular difficulties with <em>IGN</em>, but we know that Ziff Davis recently <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/715220/ziff-davis-creators-guild-cnet-layoffs">cut workers</a> in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/718692/ign-entertainment-layoffs-creators-guild-ziff-davis">back-to-back layoffs</a>, and <em>IGN</em> was one of the affected Ziff Davis brands. The decision doesn’t seem to have anything to do with the time a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V10wHzV5zp0">full-length Nintendo ad was placed on <em>DF</em>’s YouTube channel without initially being labeled as an ad</a>; “The guy who presses the button on YouTube is not <em>IGN</em>, it’s me,” Leadbetter says, calling it an error that won’t happen again.)</p></div><p>So, what does <em>DF </em>plan to build? One thing the team doesn’t have anymore is a proper place for its <em>written</em> words to go. While <em>DF</em> does own <a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/">digitalfoundry.net</a>, Leadbetter says it’s currently just a portal to direct people to its videos. He says <em>DF</em> wants to “figure out the business case” to justify creating a larger site.</p><p>The dream is to take nearly two decades of archived <em>Digital Foundry</em> content and turn it into something new, something that’ll additionally make <em>DF</em>’s findings more accessible to a wider audience like many news sites (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/626952/sony-fsr-4-upscaler-coming-to-ps5-pro-reimplementation">shameless plug</a>) try to do. The team would also like to launch a retro games podcast, something <em>DF</em>’s John Linneman says would have been difficult under corporate owners; do more game developer interviews; and try to hire an additional editor to beef up PC coverage if funds allow.</p><p>Leadbetter, Linneman, and colleague Alex Battaglia don’t sound like they’re planning to change the formula much, though. <em>DF</em> plans to stick to PC gaming, retro gaming, and console performance analysis as its “three pillars” and doesn’t plan to chase SEO. Much of this is just about controlling <em>DF</em>’s own destiny, taking control of everything from hiring to sponsorships, ad sales, and merch.</p><p>Nor should you expect to see <em>Digital Foundry</em> move to a subscription-only model. Leadbetter plans to keep the vast majority of content free, the same as it is now, and you shouldn’t even notice a difference on its YouTube channel, where <em>DF</em> plans to deliver the same number of videos without interruption.</p><p>“If we do a website, it’ll be a public-facing website without any sort of pay-gating,” Leadbetter says. “There’s always been smaller subscriber bonuses, but ultimately the pitch we’re making is to support us. If you love what we do, please support the team, it really does make a huge amount of difference.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/743535/digital-foundry-game-console-analysis-going-independent]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/mafia-old-country-reviews-metacritic-roundup-ps5-2000616275</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mafia-the-old-country-reviews-say-it%E2%80%99s-mostly-good-enough.1264509/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/mafia-4-old-country-august-launch-ps5-xbox-50-trailer-1851779729"><em>Mafia: The Old Country</em></a> brings back the period-piece gangster franchise after almost a full decade with a more streamlined, linear adventure set in early 1900s Italy. Has the experiment paid off? So far it sounds like the results are mixed. Early reviews of the new <em>Mafia</em> are praising the look of its world and the quiet details in-between missions, while some are criticizing what they see as tropey storytelling and dated gameplay.</p> <p><em>Mafia: The Old Country</em> is out on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on August 8, which technically means it goes live for players in the earliest time zones later today and at midnight for everyone on Steam. Today’s reviews, arriving less than a day out from launch for some some fans based on where they live, are also only for the PC version of the new <em>Mafia</em>. The developers at Hangar 13 have promised a PS5 Pro update for the game will follow, and it’s “targeting” 60fps in performance mode on base PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. But no one will be able to actually test how well that works in practice on console until the full release.</p> <p>The game follows the story of indentured laborer Enzo Favara as he climbs out of the Sicily’s sulfur mines into the family of one of the country’s more notorious crime families. The turn-of-the-century setting makes <em>The Old Country</em> the earliest game in the<em> Mafia</em> series. It’s also been touted as an overhaul of the franchise’s open-world design which got increasingly bloated with <em>Mafia III</em>. The new game is only $50 and takes just 12-14 hours to beat. Does it pay off?</p>

 <p><em>Mafia: The Old Country</em> currently sits at 75 on Metacritic, one of the higher scores in a series that usually hovers somewhere around “good but not great.” <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mafia-the-old-country-review-look-but-dont-touch/1900-6418393/"><em>GameSpot’s</em>&nbsp;Jake Dekker praised</a> the characters and look of 1900s Sicily but criticized the simplistic gunplay and lack of depth. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mafia-the-old-country-review"><em>IGN</em> was more upbeat</a>. “It doesn’t reinvent stealth, and there’s nothing especially remarkable about its typical third-person cover shooting – but with great writing, excellent vocal performances, and a wonderful eye and ear for detail, <em>The Old Country</em> is a potent and immersive time machine to a rarely explored era,” wrote reviewer Luke Riley.</p> <p><em>Kotaku</em> will have its own review in the coming days once we’ve had time to test <em>Mafia: The Old Country</em> on console. In the meantime, here’s what other early reviews are saying about the gangster drama’s semi-open-world return:</p> <h2><em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/mafia-the-old-country-review/">Polygon</a></em></h2> <blockquote><p>It’s not just about the mafia, nor is it about Italy in the early 1900s.&nbsp;<em>Mafia: The Old Country</em>&nbsp;is a sobering reminder that tough times still create a breeding ground for exploitation today, just as they did in Sicily. When the money is tight and our backs are against the walls, our options narrow as survival becomes a necessity. There are plenty of ways that we end up carrying out someone else’s dirty work that don’t involve pulling a trigger at a don’s behest.<em>&nbsp;The Old Country&nbsp;</em>doesn’t expect you to agree with Enzo’s choices, but it does ask you to understand the societal forces that drove him to them. — Giovanni Colantonio</p></blockquote> <h2><em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/07/arts/mafia-old-country-review.html">The New York Times</a></em></h2> <blockquote><p>Resisting the expectation for single-player games to be chockablock with content, <em>The Old Country</em> is sparing and restrained. Its pacing, especially in the first few chapters, is slow and deliberate. Walking as Enzo often feels more natural and rewarding than breaking out into a sprint. It’s the best way to take in the postcard beauty of [developer] Hangar 13’s depiction of Sicily, and to listen in on the conversations between other characters. This world is believable and well-realized. The sprawling Torrisi vineyard, your home base for much of the game, is alive with activity: Cars and horse-drawn carriages come and go constantly, workers pick grapes out in the field, cooks and maids chatter in the kitchen. — Yussef Cole</p></blockquote> <h2><em><a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/mafia-the-old-country/an-offer-you-can-probably-refuse">Game Informer</a></em></h2> <blockquote><p><em>The Old Country</em> isn’t bad; it’s also not great. Perhaps most depressing, it’s simply fine, inoffensively so. There’s nothing in here you haven’t seen elsewhere, cast included. And worse yet, probably done better. For all the great prequels out there, <em>The Old Country</em> is proof that going backwards isn’t always an interesting way forward.&nbsp; — Wesley LeBlanc</p></blockquote> <h2><em><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/mafia-the-old-country/">VGC</a></em></h2> <blockquote><p><em>Mafia: The Old Country</em> returns to the series’ roots with a more linear adventure, delivering a solid story (if a cliché-heavy one) and satisfying combat. The character models and environments are stunning to look at, but the latter raises our main issue: as much as we appreciate the focus on a linear story, this wonderfully sculpted Sicily map is begging to be explored more and is sorely underused as a result. — Chris Scullion</p></blockquote> <h2><em><a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/mafia-the-old-country/review">PCGamesN</a></em></h2> <blockquote><p>All of this stems from a confidence in vision that makes <em>The Old Country</em> far richer than its adherence to mob genre storytelling might suggest. There’s a purity to its concentration on small-scale character work, mood setting, and straightforward action that stands apart from the tendency toward convolution and inflation found in so many other big budget videogames. <em>Mafia: The Old Country</em> is a game that knows what it wants to do and rarely deviates from offering just that. In the end, as with any take on a familiar type of story, that makes all the difference. — Reid McCarter</p></blockquote> <h2><em><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mafia-the-old-country-review-look-but-dont-touch/1900-6418393/">GameSpot</a></em></h2> <blockquote><p><em>Mafia: The Old Country</em> relies on a handful of dated instant-fail stealth segments with poor checkpointing to break up the pace of driving, shooting, and cutscenes in a typical mission. These range from inconvenient to frustrating. One in particular sees Enzo sneaking into a government facility to crack a safe. It’s a fun premise, but one slip-up puts you back outside to start over, regardless of how deep you make it into the building. At first, I gave these instant-fail stealth missions the benefit of the doubt, since there are obvious story reasons why Enzo wouldn’t want to be spotted. However, most of the time, a gunfight erupts anyway, making all that trial and error feel trivial. — Jake Dekker</p></blockquote> <h2><em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mafia-the-old-country-review">IGN</a></em></h2> <blockquote><p>Part mob drama and part Western, <em>The Old Country</em> may be a safe and conventional third-person action adventure on the surface, but it’s a moody and engaging one that makes great use of its uncommon setting and is brimming with old school atmosphere so heady you can practically smell the sun-dried tomatoes. — Luke Riley</p></blockquote>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-4-is-getting-a-paid-mods-system-its-claimed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fallout-4-is-getting-a-paid-mods-system-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1264503/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Bethesda is reportedly working on bringing Creations to Fallout 4 to introduce paid mods for the game. </p>



<p>Fallout 4 is yet to receive a proper update since the next-gen upgrade for the title. The developers have released a bug-fixing patch since then, but no major updates have been revealed. As Fallout 5 doesn’t seem to be releasing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-5-fully-greenlit-bethesda-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anytime soon</a>, players are expecting more content out of Fallout 4, especially after the Amazon Prime series. It seems developers might be fulfilling this wish with a paid mod system that exists for several other Bethesda games. </p>



<h2 id="h-fallout-4-paid-mods-could-arrive-before-season-2">Fallout 4 Paid Mods Could Arrive Before Season 2</h2>



<p>The claim about Fallout 4 paid mods comes from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-AwL2IrXLw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">JuiceHead</a> on YouTube, who has confirmed these details from multiple sources. JuiceHead has also accurately claimed in the past that Skyrim would receive a new paid mods system, and Creations was released soon after. Moreover, the recent changelog updates on SteamDB suggest that Bethesda is working on something for Fallout 4. The YouTuber also shared that Fallout 4’s press build has undergone some changes as well. </p>



<p>The fact that Fallout 4’s press build is receiving changes hints that Bethesda is testing out new features by giving select users access through the Steam beta. The core aspect of the upcoming update is bringing Creations to Fallout 4, the same system available in Skyrim and Starfield for paid mods. It is speculated that this new system will enable players to view both paid and free mods, and also allow authors to create new paid content for the game. </p>



<p>The Fallout Amazon Prime series has been influential in bringing audiences back to the Fallout games, with Fallout 4 experiencing the most significant growth. As Bethesda has now observed that their games could benefit from other media, they might plan to release the Creations update after or alongside Season 2 of the series, which is scheduled to arrive in December 2025. However, as all of this information doesn’t come from an official source, players should take it with a grain of salt. </p>

                <p dir="ltr">After a disastrous debut for the live-service shooter earlier this year, Bungie and PlayStation made the decision to move Marathon out of its planned September 23 release date and into next year. During a Q&amp;A session after the company's Q2 earnings call, Sony CFO Lin Tao fielded some questions about not only the game, but Bungie itself, and it seems the longtime development house will soon be fully integrated into the PlayStation Studios family.</p><p dir="ltr">As reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sony-cfo-says-marathon-is-expected-to-release-before-march-and-bungies-independence-is-getting-lighter/" rel="nofollow ">VGC</a>, when asked about Marathon's current status and whether or not it will launch in the fiscal year--which ends March 31, 2026--Tao said through an interpreter that the company "factored it in the forecast" and that it "expects the launch to happen within the fiscal year." However, she did also stress that her words were not a confirmation of that target, as "no official announcement has been given yet."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Marathon | Official Gameplay Overview Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Tao added that Sony has stepped in to make "modifications in development," and that either Bungie or PlayStation will be able to announce Marathon's new launch date "in the autumn timeframe." Tao said the company, at this moment, does not expect the game to be canceled.</p><p dir="ltr">As for Bungie itself, Tao said that the company will be integrated into the PlayStation Studios ecosystem after "offering a very independent environment" initially. She says that the process is "ongoing," but that the goal is for Bungie "to become part of PlayStation Studios."</p><p dir="ltr">"We have gone through structural reform, as we announced last year, so this independence is getting lighter," Tao said. "Bungie is shifting into a role which is becoming more part of PlayStation Studios, and integration is proceeding."</p><p dir="ltr">This is the first update provided on the status of Marathon by either Bungie or PlayStation since the game was delayed in late June after reports surfaced of<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-responds-to-marathon-art-theft-claims/1100-6531591/"> stolen art being used</a> in the game. Graphic artist Antireal had accused the company of stealing their art in the Marathon alpha test in May, saying that the alpha build used in the test was "covered with assets lifted from poster designs [they] made in 2017."</p>

Battlefield Studios has <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1953431583223943500" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">clarified</a> how bots work, with the developer making it clear that AI soldiers only show up in the "Training Grounds" playlists for the open beta.</p><p>This week, the Training Grounds playlist is Breakthrough Initiation. The Training Grounds playlists aim to help players learn the ropes and should be a "smoother experience" compared to a full match populated with real humans. The Training Grounds playlist is only available for ranks 1-15.</p>

Developer Necrosoft Games and publisher Ysbryd Games announced today that Demonschool will arrive on September 3, 2025 for PlayStation 4 and 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, Steam Deck, and PC through both Steam and Epic.</p><p>Shown during today's Nintendo Indie World Japan showcase, Demonschool follows college freshman Faye, born into a line of demon hunters, through quite an eventful semester. As creepy, spooky, and scary events transpire around her school life, she'll have to team up with newfound friends to combat the looming demonic threat.</p><p>She's got no shortage of friends though, as Necrosoft Games says there are 15 playable characters, alongside side quests to pursue, social links to cultivate, and combos to develop. Some easy comparisons could be drawn to both Shin Megami Tensei and its sister series Persona, and true sickos might even detect the faint aroma of the dual-screen duology Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fazy1L9KXFQ"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fazy1L9KXFQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Demonschool was originally planned to launch a while ago, but <a href="https://necrosoftgames.com/demonschool-in-2025/">several delays</a> have pushed it to where it is now, as the team worked to realize their vision for this demonic tactics RPG. Still, it's <a href="https://gameinformer.com/sgf-2025/2025/06/07/the-coolest-games-weve-played-at-summer-game-fest-2025">managed to impress</a> through the various demos Necrosoft Games has shown over the years.</p><p>“At long last, Demonschool<em> </em>is finally coming out.

<p>50 games in one</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>In a blink-and-you'll-miss-it moment, Mossmouth's critically-acclaimed retro compilation, <strong>UFO 50</strong>, is out on Switch... <strong>today</strong>!</p>
<p>Announced during today's Indie World showcase, the game was developers by the creators of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/spelunky">Spelunky</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/downwell">Downwell</a>, and <strong>Catacomb Kids</strong>. We've been itching to try this one out for a while, and now we don't have to wait any longer. <a href="https://www.fangamer.com/collections/ufo-50">Fangamer will also be handling a physical version</a> of the game, and pre-orders are live now for $35.99 for the standard version, or $49.99 for the Deluxe (thanks <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3lvsu2wkil627">Wario64</a>!)</p>
<p>This isn't a <strong>WarioWare</strong>-type situation with tons of minigames — this is a full-on collection of 50 different games, all ready to play from the beginning. Essentially, the entire game is about a fictional video game company from the 80s called UFO Soft, and you can chart the development history of that company in-game.</p>
<p>There are sequels, stand-alone titles, multiple different genres, and a handful of multiplayer and co-op games too.</p>

<p>We got to try the game very briefly <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/round-up-every-nintendo-switch-game-we-played-at-summer-game-fest-2024">at Summer Game Fest in 2024</a> and, while we only spent around 10 minutes and got to try a handful of in-game titles, we were absolutely charmed.</p>
<p>We know what we're playing tonight!</p>

<p>Underwater future slaughter</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Playism and Studio Snowblind have announced <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/glaciered">Glaciered</a></strong> for Switch 2, with a release date of winter 2025.</p>
<p>The game, which is apparently inspired by the rich ecosystems of Hokkaido, Japan, and looks a little like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/subnautica">Subnautica</a>, but with underwater hand-to-hand combat (good thing), sees players assume control of Twi, a dinosaur descendant who's fighting for survival in a futuristic deep sea.</p>
<p>Twi can equip lots of different gear, and upgrade through various levels to grow stronger as they fend off all manner of very bizarre-looking ocean threats. We expect there are gonna be some fairly freaky big beasties to fight down the line in this one.</p>
<p>You can check out the reveal trailer for the game above, and we'll leave you with a few screens. We'll also be sure to update you with more info on this one as it arrives.</p>

<p><em>Fancy some futuristic deep ocean fighting? Fancy being a dinosaur fighting for survival in an alien world? Let us know!</em></p>
