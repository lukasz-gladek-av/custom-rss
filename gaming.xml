            <p>
This summer, Epic Games finally gets its wish when, thanks to new EU regulations, it's launching its own digital store on iOS and Android. And ahead of its arrival, the company has announced it's removing Fortnite and other Epic games from what it calls "rent collector" competing stores, "even if those stores offer us a special deal for our own games."
</p>
<p>
In its <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/epic-s-new-game-strategy-for-mobile-stores">announcement post</a>, Epic first confirms developers selling games on its on its new mobile store will be subject to the same 12 percent fee seen on its PC digital storefront (zero percent if a developer uses a third-party payment system). It then reveals plans to pull its own games from some competing stores. More specifically, it says it'll be "ending distribution partnerships with mobile stores that serve as rent collectors without competing robustly and serving all developers fairly, even if those stores offer us a special deal for our own games."
</p>
<p>
It's also pulling Fortnite and its other titles from the Samsung Galaxy Store, in what it calls "protest of Samsung's anticompetitive decision to block side-loading by default" on its devices. Conversely, Epic says it's planning to brings its own mobile games to stores that "give all developers a great deal". One of these will be the <a href="https://altstore.io/">indie-focused AltStore</a>.

<p>
The reason for all this, it insists, is that "we want to do everything we can to support other stores that strive to bring all developers their own great deals." Of course, it probably also helps that by manoeuvring its games from major to minor competing stores, it's pretty much guaranteeing most Fortnite traffic on mobile will come through its own store, where it won't need to pay a cut on its revenue at all.
</p>
<p>
Epic has been battling to return to iOS ever since Fortnite was booted out of Apple's ecosystem in 2020, when Epic <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-boss-pledges-more-legal-action-as-supreme-court-dismisses-apple-lawsuit-appeals">deliberately circumvented</a> contractually mandated App Store payment mechanisms within its Fortnite iOS app. Attempts to reverse Apple's decision through legal means have largely been unsuccessful in the US, with courts <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-boss-pledges-more-legal-action-as-supreme-court-dismisses-apple-lawsuit-appeals">predominantly ruling in Apple's favour</a> as time has gone on. However, the EU's Digital Markets Act has now provided the Fortnite maker with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-secures-ios-developer-account-europe-mobile-store-and-fortnite-launch-this-year">means of getting its foot back in the door</a> - in the EU at least.
</p>
<p>
The Epic Games Store is set to launch on iOS in the EU and Android worldwide later this year. Epic has also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-says-its-bringing-fortnite-and-the-epic-games-store-to-ios-in-the-uk-next-year">said</a> it'll be bringing Fortnite and its store to iOS in the UK in the "second half of 2025". That announcement might be a little premature, however, given there's still much to be determined around the UK's new Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/guilty-gear-strive-producer-talks-lucy-from-cyberpunk-edgerunners-evo-2024<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Guilty Gear Strive is now entering its fourth year of content updates, and despite now earning the reptutation as being the "old man" on the block, especially when put side-to-side with more recent releases like Street Fighter 6, Tekken 8, and Mortal Kombat 1, Strive is still continuing on just as strong as ever.</p><p>Which brings us to Evo 2024, where Arc System Works made perhaps their biggest announcement involving Guilty Gear Strive to date: In addition to two returning characters, Dizzy and Venom, and one brand new character, Unika, they would also be adding their first guest character to the roster: Lucy from Cyberpunk Edgerunners. I got a chance to catch up with Guilty Gear Strive Producer Ken Miyauchi to find out how this surprising collaboration came to be, along with getting some insight regarding Strive's future. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><strong>IGN: We learned that Lucy from Cyberpunk Edgerunners is going to be in Strive. Can you talk a little bit about how long this has been in the works and how this collaboration came around?</strong></p><p><strong>Ken Miyauchi, Guilty Gear Strive Producer: </strong>So yeah, we've tried to find who will be a good guest character for Guilty Gear Strive. And we've been doing this work since 2023, actually. And we've been talking to CD PROJEKT RED because our lead artist, Hidehiko Sakamura, is actually a big fan of The Witchers series. And we've been in talks with CD PROJEKT RED, and then there was several conversation going on and that kind of led to the decision to get Lucy from Cyberpunk Edgerunners.</p><p><strong>Now, I'm not opposed to the idea of Lucy, but Lucy's not the main character of Cyberpunk Edgerunners, David is. What made you want to go with Lucy instead of David?</strong></p><p><strong>Miyauchi: </strong>So I cannot talk much about why because that might spoil what we are trying to do. But there is a reason we decided Lucy. Of course, I personally wanted to see David with Sandevistan, but yeah, so I can't talk about it right now, but I hope people will figure [it] out in the future.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><strong>Is there any kind of collaboration happening between you and Studio Trigger who made the Cyberpunk Edgerunners anime? Are you working together with them to make Lucy happen in Strive?</strong></p><p><strong>Miyauchi: </strong>Honestly, we've been in talks with CD PROJEKT RED directly, not through Trigger, but if there could be any kind of collaboration that we [would] be able to do with Trigger, I'd like to do [it]. But that's still not in [the] plan.</p><p><strong>Another thing that you guys announced, which is something that you've talked about in the past, is the 3-on-3 mode. Can you talk a little bit about what makes this mode different than something like Dragon Ball FighterZ or a Marvel vs Capcom?</strong></p><p><strong>Miyauchi: </strong>So you'll eventually see the game mechanics explanation from our website or social post. So what makes the Team of 3 unique compared to the other games is that people will play at the same time, not just you controlling the character and doing the 1v1 in one screen. So I'm just going to explain the first layer of this game mechanic. The team will be formed with one main role and two assist roles, and the two assist roles will be able to select their skills to interact in the battle.</p><p><strong>Oh, interesting.</strong></p><p><strong>Miyauchi: </strong>And of course, during the battle, the assist players can switch with main players or assist player can interact into the battle with their own character in certain condition. Well the game mechanics-wise in the open beta test, I think people will be able to find out in tutorial, there's a Team of 3 tutorial mode in open beta test. So I hope people will figure out how they can utilize the new game mechanics that's exclusive for team of 3.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><strong>And then another character that I'm sure people are very excited for is Dizzy. Can you talk a little bit about how Dizzy is going to perform in this iteration of Guilty Gear? And specifically, I saw that she was Queen Dizzy, can you talk a little bit about what the significance of that is?</strong></p><p><strong>Miyauchi: </strong>I want to explain the details, but I'll keep it secret for now why she's called Queen Dizzy. I had the same question when I first received [the] Queen Dizzy name from Daisuke Ishiwatari. There's a interesting story going on and you if actually see the trailer, you might find some hint of why she's called Queen. But for more details I'd like to say please look forward to actual her arcade story mode.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There's a interesting story going on and you if actually see the trailer, you might find some hint of why she's called Queen. </p></div><p><strong>And then other characters that were announced were Venom and Unika, from the anime. I know they're probably early on development, but is there anything you can tell us about how those characters are going to play in Strive?</strong></p><p><strong>Miyauchi: </strong>So yeah, Venom, and also Unika, I can't explain the details of how their battle styles are for now. I think Venom is going to be quite similar to how he played in the past series, but sort of like how we've been doing, [it won't be] exactly same as the past series. Because if you want to play his past series style, you can play for example Xrd or XX. At the same time there is certain type of [uniqueness] in what makes Venom, Venom. And we would like to keep that as his gameplay. Regarding Unika, anything that I talk about her is going to spoil the anime series. So I'm going to expect people to watch the anime and then also try to maybe bring up their own theory of how she's going to play in the game play and check her actual game style later.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><strong>Did you ever expect Strive to be going this strong for this long? It had a lot of entries at Evo this year.</strong></p><p><strong>Miyauchi: </strong>Yeah. I'm actually very, very surprised to see that we've been getting [consistently] over 2000 [entrants], throughout all the years of Evo for now. And I'm really, really happy that communities are supporting our game. And it's achieved all because I think the Guilty Gear community is very enthusiastic and they keeps wanting to support the game, and really appreciate it, and I really want to pay back their support with Gear Guilty updates.</p><p><strong>Is there anything you can tell us, any kind of hints you can give us about what to expect mechanically from the updates that you're bringing to Season 4?</strong></p><p><strong>Miyauchi: </strong>In a Developer's Backyard just a month ago that I released, I kind of talked about what's coming in the next few months, which are the Battle Balance updates, the minor version, it's coming out at the end of this month. And also the major one is coming sometime... I don't remember when I said this, but I think it's around October, end of October timing. </p><p>But the minor updates is more of mainly targeted to those characters who have less chance of getting access to their potential. So more of, buffs to those characters. And also adjusting on some of the universal mechanics such as the burst meter gain and also the positive bonus kind of thing. And also we have some changes to Roman Canceling mechanics on some of the invincible moves. So those are coming in the next character balance update. And I think this update will sort of shake up some meta in the current competitive fighting scene and I hope people will look forward to it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><strong>Beyond new mechanics, is there any kind of intention of improving some of Strive's more, let's say, base level features? Are we ever going to get frame data in training mode? Are we ever going to get matchmaking that doesn't go through the lobby system? Anything like that in the works?</strong></p><p><strong>Miyauchi: </strong>So those are updates that I've been always thinking that I want to accomplish, I mean, implement in some point. This is just from the producer perspective, I've been always talking about it with director. And we are always talking about when we'll be able to do this update. And currently we announced the new updates that's coming in next, which is the Team of 3, and the development on Team of 3 is going so hard right now. And once we release that, I think we'll be able to take our hands on those updates. So I'd like players to look forward to them, too.</p><p><strong>I apologize for this in advance because I feel like I ask you this every single time that I've talked to you, but insta-kills, fans love them. It's one of the things that I think fans love the most about the Guilty Gear series. What are the chances of them still making their way into Strive? And if it's something that you've thought about, are there any unique challenges involved with implementing insta-kills into Strive?</strong></p><p><strong>Miyauchi: </strong>So implementing instant kills is something that we would also like to do, and I do agree that it's some, how do I say, very, very unique mechanic that presents Guilty Gear. So we would like to make that happen sometime in the future. I can't tell when will that be possible because developing instant kill actually takes a lot of time. And also the character animations, emotions, which makes instant kills very, very unique and cool, will take a lot of time developing.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Implementing Instant Kills is something that we would also like to do. </p></div><p>We try to make it unique because we animates them by frame, by frame. And if the instant kill motions are long and cool, that means we have to have more time to make sure every pattern looks cool, right? And if we decide to implement instant kill to all characters, that means we have to develop that to all characters, which is almost nearly equal to developing maybe two characters. So we'll try to find a chance. Our team has been expanding still even now, we have our motion designers and animators recruited in our team and our team is getting bigger. So I'm looking, please look forward to future updates if we'll be able to do it.</p><p><strong>Final question, I'm asking this of pretty much everyone that I'm talking to here at Evo, but we've just crossed a milestone of Rollback netcode, everyone kind of has rollback netcode now. It's now become standard among fighting games. I think fighting games are a lot better for it. What do you think is the next step for fighting game evolution across the genre?</strong></p><p><strong>Miyauchi: </strong>That's something that we've been also discussing among the development team. Of course, as you know, Arc System Works has been making fighting games and we'll continue making fighting games. And if we make new fighting games, we'll always discuss about what will be something that we can bring, revolutionize the fighting game, how do I say, industry. And I don't have the answers yet or I can't share any answers for it, but I will be always thinking about it. And I honestly think the community right now, fighting game community right now, is in the best form of the current era. In the past, there was always... I mean, I wish if I would be a player in this fighting game era right now, people are expecting more and more fun things to the fighting game and we'll try to find out what we'll be able to provide to the community.</p><p><em>Mitchell Saltzman is a Senior Producer at IGN.

When it was first unveiled earlier this year, the gut response—from fans and skeptics alike—was that it looked a whole lot like an Overwatch facsimile with licensed Marvel heroes and villains filling in the roles abdicated by Genji, Winston, and Roadhog. After jumping into the closed beta for a few hours, I can confirm all of those suspicions. This is a hero shooter that has studied the established formula hard, but so far, that has resulted in an experience that's flashy, polished, and ready to get under your skin.</p><p>Like most multiplayer games, Marvel Rivals glosses over the specifics for why this alliance of superheroes has decided to beat each other to death over a variety of team-based objectives. (It has something to do with a partnership between two different versions of Doctor Doom. Beyond that, who knows?) But everything else here should be very familiar to anyone who's spent time in a big, bouncy arena shooter. You'll be split into two teams of six players, with rosters categorized into basic tank, support, and DPS roles, all of whom are blessed with a variety of unique abilities and an Ultimate that charges up over the course of the game. Victory will be achieved if you can move a payload to the end of its route, or if you're able to camp on a control point, and all of the action takes place in blooming battlefields plucked from the greater Marvel canon. Remind you of anything?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Yes, Rivals takes its cues from Overwatch much more than it does from Valorant or Team Fortress 2. The tactics here aren't built around twitchy gunplay. In fact, a sizable chunk of its cast aren't wielding firearms at all, and across the board, they tend to absorb a ton of bullets before keeling over. Naturally, that makes Rivals more approachable to those who are turned off from traditional shooters. Do you want to toss up protective magical barriers and weave portals to teleport around the map? Dr. Strange might become your main. Would you rather bring a wide arsenal of munitions to the fight and try to win with your well-hewn Call of Duty skills? Then The Punisher might be more your speed.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>A sizable chunk of its cast aren't wielding firearms at all, and across the board, they tend to absorb a ton of bullets before keeling over.</p></div><p>The asymmetry in each of these heroes is genuinely staggering. Developer NetEase has clearly dedicated a lot of time and resources into making sure the vividness of the Marvel fantasy is able to come to life within the narrow confines of a hero shooter. Consider Iron Man, who operates like a mobile artillery unit, throwing out huge splashes of damage to anyone below him. Star-Lord, meanwhile, has two blasters in his holster that automatically reload whenever he dashes forward. String those together correctly, and you can absolutely melt the lifebar of whoever was unlucky enough to be caught out of position.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Rivals also does a good job of emphasizing one of the great traditions in comic books: team-up abilities, where two heroes combine their strengths and start wrecking shop. These are character-specific, and they often play off of the relationship between the heroes within the Marvel universe as a whole. For instance, Rocket Raccoon can leap onto the shoulders of his old pal Groot, hooking him up with damage reduction and added mobility. It's a cool wrinkle, and one that sounds difficult to balance. Ideally, at high levels, Marvel Rivals won't boil down to matches that feature a prescribed set of established synergies, and still allow players to express their own creativity with their compositions.</p><p>Because even now, in its unfinished state, Marvel Rivals is beautifully rendered. The characters are all gorgeously exaggerated and rippling with muscles, far more reminiscent of a comic shop in 1997 than anything from the MCU. The maps themselves are equally resplendent and surprisingly modular. (Take aim at a wall, and you might be able to blast it to smithereens.) And perhaps most importantly, Rivals seems equally attuned to the whims of a select few esports-adjacent diehards, and those who simply want to burn off a weeknight crushing the opposition with The Hulk. The package that NetEase has put together here is rock solid. Let's hope it stays thrilling when it jumps to live servers.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

In addition to <em>Fortnite</em>, Epic also plans to bring <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/24/22345184/rocket-league-sideswipe-android-ios-announced"><em>Rocket League Sideswipe</em></a><em> </em>to AltStore PAL, spokesperson Natalie Munoz tells <em>The Verge</em>. </p><p>When reached for comment, AltStore’s Riley Testut pointed to Epic’s post and said that “we’re very excited to be bringing <em>Fortnite</em> and more to AltStore PAL.”</p><p>The company is also working on bringing <em>Fortnite</em> to iOS in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/1/24189982/fortnite-is-getting-closer-to-a-return-on-ios-in-the-eu">the EU</a>, which it says will happen “soon,” and launching its own app store <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/20/24106711/heres-what-epics-mobile-app-store-might-look-like">on iOS and Android</a>. </p><p>Epic also announced that “we will be ending distribution partnerships with mobile stores that serve as rent collectors without competing robustly and serving all developers fairly, even if those stores offer us a special deal for our own games.” Epic is presumably talking about Apple and Google here, given the company’s disputes with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/28/24158911/apple-v-epic-evidentiary-hearing-app-store-payments">both</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/2024/6/25/24185450/epic-google-catalog-access-library-porting-estimated-cost">companies</a> over their app store practices.

            <p>
Crystal Dynamics' beloved dark fantasy action-adventure series Legacy of Kain could be poised to receive the remaster treatment, if newly sighted branding at Comic-Con is to be believed.
</p>
<p>
As spotted by a user on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-i-ii-remastered-branding-seen-at-sdcc.937002/">Resetera</a>, logos for an unannounced "Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1 &amp; 2 Remastered" were included on display plaques accompanying statues of game characters Kain and Raziel at this week's Comic-Con San Diego show.
</p>
<p>
A Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver graphic novel prequel, The Dead Shall Rise, was recently announced by Dark Horse Comics, and GameSpot has now <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/soul-reaver-remasters-seemingly-confirmed-by-a-statue-at-comic-con/1100-6525310/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f">received confirmation</a> from the publisher's VP of product development and sales that this is due to release in August.

<p>
Given the Dark Horse logo also appears on the (now removed) Comic-Con plaques, it's hard not to speculate the graphic novel and remaster might arrive in tandem - particularly as the first Soul Reaver game is 25 years old on 16th August this year.
</p>
<p>
Hints that Crystal Dynamics might be considering a Legacy of Kain revival first surfaced in 2022, when the developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/crystal-dynamics-wants-your-thoughts-on-legacy-of-kain">sent out a survey</a> asking if recipients would be interested in seeing the series - which spanned five titles between 1996 and 2003 - make a comeback.
</p>
<p>
Over 100,000 people responded positively, to which Crystal Dynamics CEO Phil Rogers <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/crystal-dynamics-hears-legacy-of-kain-fans-loudly-and-clearly-following-huge-survey-response">replied</a>, "Rest assured, we hear you loudly and clearly, and we'll continue to update you on the 'what if' possibilities ahead for Legacy of Kain in the future." Since then, parent company Embracer has embarked on an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-has-now-laid-off-8-of-staff">devastating programme of layoffs and project cancellations</a>, making a Legacy of Kain revival seem unlikely - but here we are now.
</p>
<p>
Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1 &amp; 2 were written and directed by Amy Hennig - perhaps best known as the creative director on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s Uncharted series - and the series celebrated its 20th anniversary back in 2019. If you're curious to learn more, Eurogamer's former editor-in-chief Wesley Yin-Poole <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-turns-20-lets-remember-why-it-was-brilliant">recalled why the series was so brilliant</a> at the time.

<p>Nintendo and Lego are at it again—they've announced another collaboration today as a follow-up to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/03/lego-teams-up-with-nintendo-for-super-mario-brick-based-game/">the interactive Mario sets</a>, the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/07/this-200-lego-nes-set-features-a-scrolling-8-bit-mario/">replica Nintendo Entertainment System</a>, the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/09/2064-piece-lego-set-recreates-super-mario-64-in-miniature-for-170/">unfolding question mark block</a> with the&nbsp;<em>Mario 64&nbsp;</em>worlds inside, and other sets besides.</p>
<p>The latest addition is <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/super-mario-world-mario-yoshi-71438?cmp=REF-202407-Mario_Yoshi_Laun">an homage to 1990's&nbsp;<em>Super Mario World</em></a>, Mario's debut outing on the then-new 16-bit Super Nintendo Entertainment System. At first, the 1,215-piece set just looks like a caped Mario sitting on top of Yoshi. But a look at the back reveals more complex mechanics, including a hand crank that makes Yoshi's feet and arms move and a dial that opens his mouth and extends his tongue.</p>

<p>Most of the Mario sets have included some kind of interactive moving part, even if it's as simple as the movable mouth on the <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/aboutus/news/2023/september/lego-super-mario-piranha-plant">Lego Piranha Plant</a>. Yoshi's mechanical crank most strongly resembles the NES set, though, which included a CRT-style TV set with a crank that made the contents of the screen scroll so that Mario could "walk."</p>
<p>The Mario &amp; Yoshi set is available to preorder from Lego's online store for $129.99. It begins shipping on October 1.</p>
<p>Lego has also branched out into other video game-themed sets. In 2022, the company began selling <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/07/recapture-the-fun-of-the-1980s-game-crash-with-legos-240-atari-2600-replica/">a replica Atari 2600,</a> complete with faux-wood paneling. More recently, Lego has collaborated with Epic Games on <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/themes/fortnite">several <em>Fortnite</em>-themed sets</a>, including<a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/battle-bus-77073"> the Battle Bus</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/sag-aftra-video-game-voice-actor-strike<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Following prolonged negotiations with many of the biggest companies in video games, the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) has called for a video game performer and voice actor strike, beginning on July 26. Try as they might, the two sides have been unable to see eye to eye on the issue of AI.&nbsp;</p><p>“The video game industry generates billions of dollars in profit annually," said SAG-AFTRA national executive director and chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland in a statement to Aftermath. "The driving force behind that success is the creative people who design and create those games. That includes the SAG-AFTRA members&nbsp;who&nbsp;bring memorable and beloved game characters to life, and they deserve and demand the same fundamental protections as performers in film, television, streaming, and music: fair compensation and the right of informed consent for the AI use of their faces, voices, and bodies. Frankly, it’s stunning that these video game studios haven’t learned anything from the lessons of last year - that our members can and will stand up and demand fair and equitable treatment with respect to AI, and the public supports us in that."</p><p>Workers can now strike at ten companies: Activision, Blindlight, Disney Character Voices, EA, Epic, Formosa Interactive, Insomniac Games, Take-Two, VoiceWorks, and WB Games.</p><p>The aforementioned companies released their own joint statement:</p><p>“We are disappointed the union has chosen to walk away when we are so close to a deal, and we&nbsp;remain&nbsp;prepared to resume negotiations," the companies said via a spokesperson. "We have already found common ground on 24 out of 25 proposals, including historic wage increases and&nbsp;additional&nbsp;safety provisions.&nbsp;Our offer is directly responsive to SAG-AFTRA’s concerns and extends meaningful AI protections that include&nbsp;requiring&nbsp;consent and fair compensation to all performers&nbsp;working under the [Interactive Media Agreement]. These terms are among the strongest in the entertainment industry.”</p><p>SAG-AFTRA membership first voted in favor of authorizing a strike <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23885558/sag-aftra-strike-authorization-negotiation-video-game-voice-actors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in 2023</a>, which the union’s national board <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-national-board-meets-videoconference-national-board-unanimously-gives-chief-negotiator" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">followed last week</a> by granting Crabtree-Ireland authority to call a strike if need be. This is the second video game voice actor strike, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016%E2%80%932017_video_game_voice_actor_strike" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the first</a> lasting nearly a year between 2016 and 2017. As a result, actors received a pay raise, though residuals and matters pertaining to vocal stress – other central issues at the time – did not make it into the contract, prompting criticism from some actors.</p><p>At the beginning of this year, SAG-AFTRA again faced controversy when it <a href="https://aftermath.site/sag-aftras-ai-voice-acting-deal-was-a-powder-keg-waiting-to-go-off" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">struck a deal with a company called Replica</a>, with the goal of making it easy for “professional voice over artists to safely explore new employment opportunities for their digital voice replicas with industry-leading protections tailored to AI technology” and “allowing AAA video game studios and other companies working with Replica to access top SAG-AFTRA talent.” This turned out to be a one-off deal with a single company rather than the broader Interactive Media Agreement over which SAG-AFTRA members had authorized a strike, but performers still felt blindsided by the decision.</p><p>Now workers are going to battle to secure their rights across the board.&nbsp;</p><p>“Eighteen months of negotiations have shown us that our employers are not interested in fair, reasonable AI protections, but rather flagrant exploitation, said video game performer and SAG-AFTRA&nbsp;Interactive Media Agreement negotiating committee chair Sarah Elmaleh. "We refuse this paradigm – we will not leave any of our members behind, nor will we wait for sufficient protection any longer. We look forward to collaborating with teams on our interim and independent contracts, which provide AI transparency, consent and compensation to all performers, and to continuing to negotiate in good faith with this bargaining group when they are ready to join us in the world we all deserve."&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Video game performers within United States actors union SAG-AFTRA have voted to go on strike starting Friday, 26th July, after "more than than a year and a half of negotiations" with major game companies over the use of AI have failed to reach a deal.
</p>
<p>
SAG-AFTRA members initially <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sag-aftra-members-overwhelmingly-vote-in-favour-of-authorising-video-game-strike">voted in favour</a> of (but did not immediately take) strike action last September, after the union failed to reach a consensus with video game producers - including Activision, Warner Bros, EA, Take-Two, and Disney - while attempting to negotiate a successor to the Interactive Media Agreement, which covers members' work on games.
</p>
<p>
At the time, SAG-AFTRA said companies had refused to offer acceptable terms on critical issues, including wages in-line with inflation, protections around exploitative uses of AI, and job safety.

<p>
Then, this March, SAG-AFTRA national executive director and chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland confirmed the strike was still likely to go ahead after the union had failed to reach a deal with companies regarding AI protections. "We want to make sure the implementation [of AI] is human-centred and focused on augmentation [of production], not replacement of people," he explained, adding that "consent and compensation" for members whose work is used by AI engines is also one of the union's aims.
</p>
<p>
And now, with a deal still not agreed upon, union members have officially called a strike, effective Friday, 26th July, at 12:01am. "Although agreements have been reached on many issues important to SAG-AFTRA members," the union wrote in a <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-members-who-work-video-games-go-strike">statement announcing the strike</a>, "the employers refuse to plainly affirm, in clear and enforceable language, that they will protect performers covered by this contract in their AI language."
</p>
<p>
"We're not going to consent to a contract that allows companies to abuse AI to the detriment of our members," SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher added in the statement. "Enough is enough. When these companies get serious about offering an agreement our members can live - and work - with, we will be here, ready to negotiate."
</p>
<p>
Many video game performers, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/solid-snake-and-commander-shepard-stars-discuss-threat-of-ai-on-voice-acting">Solid Snake actor David Hayter and Commander Shepard actor Jennifer Hale</a>, have voiced their concerns about AI and its impact on their work in recent times. In March this year, Eurogamer spoke to several BAFTA-nominated <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> actors, who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-actors-reveal-the-darker-side-of-success-fuelled-by-ai-voice-cloning">revealed the darker side of success</a>, fuelled by AI voice cloning.

                <p dir="ltr">As more information about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/2xko/" data-ref-id="5000-503365">2XKO</a> comes to light, most of the attention is focused on how established characters from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/league-of-legends/" data-ref-id="5000-40335">League Of Legends</a> are being adapted into a fighting game. And that makes sense--seeing characters from a well-known franchise enter a new realm is always interesting. That "fish out of water" feeling brings a huge appeal to crossover characters like Negan in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tekken-7/" data-ref-id="5000-293825">Tekken 7</a> and Banjo-Kazooie in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/super-smash-bros-ultimate/" data-ref-id="5000-480957">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a>, to name a few.</p><p dir="ltr">However, after playing a few rounds of 2XKO at Evo 2024, I realized that solely focusing on how the game reimagines classic LoL characters is a disservice to the rest of the game, which makes major shifts to the 2v2 fighting format, from modified mechanics to a philosophical shift in how we're expected to play a fighting game. 2XKO has already gained a reputation for reinventing one wheel, but in truth, it might be revamping the whole dang vehicle right under our noses.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> 2XKO - Braum, The Heart Of The Freljord | Champion Gameplay Introduction</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">As mentioned before, 2XKO is a two-on-two tag-based fighting game--think X-Men Vs. Street Fighter and its ilk--with a cast of characters populated by champions from Riot's ultra-popular MOBA, League Of Legends. Our demo featured six playable champions: Ahri, Braum, Darius, Ekko, Illaoi, and Yasuo.</p><p dir="ltr">Right from the character select screen, a huge change is thrown at us: When Riot says "2v2" in regards to 2XKO, they don't just mean "two characters vs. two characters." Each match supports up to four players at a time, with each player controlling a single champion. This means any given match can feature any of the following scenarios:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Team A and Team B have a single human player controlling both champions in a team.</li><li dir="ltr">Team A and Team B have two human players, each one assigning themselves a specific champion.</li><li dir="ltr">Team A has a single human player controlling both champions while Team B has two human players each assigned to one champion, or vice versa.</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4340584-2xko_vevo24_braumpresskit_09.png" data-ref-id="1300-4340584" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4340584-2xko_vevo24_braumpresskit_09.png" data-ref-id="1300-4340584"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4340584-2xko_vevo24_braumpresskit_09.png"></figure><p>From a competitive standpoint, this creates an interesting new level of strategy. One brain controlling two different characters presents its own set of challenges, but being pitted against a team of two human players, each with likely their own specific style and strategies, is a different beast altogether. It already asks intriguing questions about the future, like whether 2XKO events will allow players to sign up either as a single rep or as a two-person team in the same tournament, and how that will play out in real-time.</p><p dir="ltr">The character select screen also offers Fuses, which are perks that can be selected to add an extra benefit to your team. Pulse--2XKO's version of Modern controls--was recommended to us during the demo, but we also saw Double Down, which allows us to combine each character's Ultimate attack into one massive move, and 2X Assist, which gives an assisting character more options when called. We focused on the Pulse option for most of our matches, but the ones where we tried 2X Assist added a few extra and helpful tools to our toolbox.</p><p dir="ltr">Once your teams are decided, the core gameplay of 2XKO will feel very familiar to the fighting game faithful. One character for each team is on-screen at a time--you can call out your partner character for a brief assist move at any point in the match, and both characters on one side must lose their entire health bar for the round to be decided. Each match feels slower and more methodical compared to what we've come to expect from games like Marvel Vs. Capcom 3, but for the purposes of this preview at least, we'd consider that a positive--we're trying to learn the ins and outs of the game, and a breakneck pace would only get in the way.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4340585-2xko_vevo24_braumpresskit_08.png" data-ref-id="1300-4340585" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4340585-2xko_vevo24_braumpresskit_08.png" data-ref-id="1300-4340585"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4340585-2xko_vevo24_braumpresskit_08.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">There is one notable and interesting change to the core format worth mentioning, however. In previous tag-based fighters, when a character lost all of their health, they were disabled for the rest of the round/match--and that included assists. 2XKO takes that limitation away, by allowing players to continue to call for assists from fallen characters after they've gone down.</p><p dir="ltr">This changes the fundamental strategy in later portions of a match. In MvC2 and MvC3, for instance, losing those assists left players at a distinct disadvantage, as the timing of certain assists is paramount to their ability to win the match, and the player who's ahead could capitalize. With 2XKO assists always active, that safety net no longer applies, which encourages the player on the back foot to stay aggressive.</p><p dir="ltr">Each character offers a full kit of attacks and abilities, with some easier to pick up and play than others. We found the most success with the two biggest brutes, Braum and Darius, mostly because their play style is so straightforward: smash the opponent's face in by any means necessary. Yasuo was also an early favorite, but his style relies less on the brute strength of powerful attacks and more on mixing speed with attack power for max potency.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4340586-2xko_vevo24_braumpresskit_06.png" data-ref-id="1300-4340586" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4340586-2xko_vevo24_braumpresskit_06.png" data-ref-id="1300-4340586"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4340586-2xko_vevo24_braumpresskit_06.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Ekko, on the other hand, has major potential, as his best combos come from his ability to manipulate his position on-stage thanks to his time powers, but we didn't have enough time to figure him out. Illaoi and Ahri fall into a similar space of being good at spatial control, especially Illaoi with her ability to summon tentacles. There's a lot to learn with each of these characters already, and we haven't even seen the full roster yet.</p><p dir="ltr">It's clear that 2XKO is vying to be a revolutionary fighting game. While it's paving new ground for the franchise it represents, the changes being made to the core concept, if done correctly, could have more far-reaching effects on fighting games as a whole. We still don't know when 2XKO will launch, but it will be one to watch for fighting game fans, LoL fans, and everyone in between.</p>

Exotic class items currently drop from chests opened in the Pale Heart of the Traveler location, including those that players earn at the end of the Onslaught activity. The adjustment will change things so that each Onslaught chest you open up will increase the chances of an Exotic class item dropping until you earn one, with higher-difficulty activities further increasing the chance.</p><p dir="ltr">Right now, any chest in the Pale Heart has a chance of dropping an Exotic class item, but those chances seem relatively small. Bungie means to downgrade those other, random loot chests as sources for class items and instead focus on Onslaught, both to encourage more players to take part in the activity, and to make farming those chests a clearer path to earning the item.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie is also adding the ability to earn an additional class item on each character each week in the Dual Destiny mission, which adds another guaranteed roll if you're willing to keep replaying it--and have a partner to do so with.</p><p dir="ltr">That's good news for anybody chasing god rolls on those armor pieces, which can be a huge boon to their builds. Exotic class items, released with the Final Shape expansion, come with two special Exotic traits that are drawn from other Exotic pieces of armor, which can create some awesome combinations. But each class item's traits are random, which is why players are trying to earn as many of them as possible. Bungie said it's also looking into offering Exotic class items from activities outside of the Pale Heart, as some members of the community have requested, but didn't say it has any clear plans to do so yet.</p><p dir="ltr">Also getting a boost to its drop rates are Brave Arsenal weapons, a series of previously deprecated guns Bungie brought back as part of its free Into the Light content that it released in the lead up to The Final Shape. Bungie is bringing back attunement, allowing you to put a thumb on the scales of Destiny 2's RNG to get more of a particular weapon to drop from Onslaught, the activity that dispenses Brave weapons.</p><p dir="ltr">During Into the Light, players could choose to "attune" certain Brave weapons, which pumped up their chances of dropping as rewards from Onslaught by 50%. The new attunement system, which you can access by visiting Zavala in the Tower, increases that boost to 60%. You can also change or deactivate attunement anytime with no penalty or cooldown, which should make it a lot easier to farm Brave weapons and nab god rolls.</p>

Recently, Dark Horse Comics announced the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-is-making-a-comeback-but-its-not-what-you-think-it-is/1100-6524621/" data-ref-id="1100-6524621">"Legacy of Kain Soul Reaver - The Dead Shall Rise" comic</a>, so this statue suggests that an announcement of remasters could be imminent.</p><p>On the San Diego Comic-Con show floor, Dark Horse Comics vice president of product development and sales, Randy Lahrman, told GameSpot that the statue will come out in August, and that more info will be released later. However, the company would not comment on the remasters, and the sign referencing them had been removed by the time we arrived at the booth.</p><p>Last year, developer Crystal Dynamics confirmed that it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/legacy-of-kain-fans-are-convinced-the-next-game-in-the-series-is-being-secretly-tested-soon/1100-6513443/" data-ref-id="1100-6513443">conducting a closed playtest</a>, but didn't say for which game. Around that time, those who completed a Legacy of Kain survey received an email from the developer about playtests "for an unspecified new game."</p><p>Crystal Dynamics and Eidos CEO Phil Rogers previously acknowledged fan interest in "revisit[ing] the land of Nosgoth and our iconic IP, Legacy of Kain."</p><p>This convinced fans that Crystal Dynamics was making a new Legacy of Kain game, and it's possible that the new game is simply a remaster of the two Soul Reaver entries. The first Soul Reaver game came out in 1999 with the sequel following in 2001. It's been over 20 years since the last game in the series, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/legacy-of-kain-defiance-review/1900-6083425/" data-ref-id="1900-6083425">Legacy of Kain: Defiance</a>, came out in 2003.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sag-aftra-members-who-work-on-video-games-to-begin-strike-at-midnight-ai-negotiations-to-blame.937059/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sag-aftra-members-who-work-on-video-games-to-begin-strike-at-midnight<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today a statement was released by SAG-AFTRA for members that work on Video Games to begin a strike after more than a year and a half of negotiations surrounding the Interactive Media Agreement (IMA) has reached no deal. The strike will begin effective July 26th at 12:01am.</p>
<p>The statement explains that negotiations began with a number of companies including Activision Productions Inc., Disney Character Voices Inc., Electronic Arts Productions Inc., and Insomniac Games Inc. among many others. It is explained that while agreements have been reached on a number of topics that "the employers refuse to plainly affirm, in clear and enforceable language, that they will protect all performers covered by this contract in their A.I. language.</p>
<p>SAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher released the following quote alongside the statement</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We're not going to consent to a contract that allows companies to abuse A.I. to the detriment of our members. Enough is enough. When these companies ger serious about offering an agreement our members can live - and work - with, we will be here, ready to negotiate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>SAG-AFTRA members approved a video game strike authorization with a 98.32% yes vote. You can read the <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-members-who-work-video-games-go-strike">full Press Release on the SAG-AFTRA Website</a>.</p>
<hr><p><strong>Update:</strong> After initially posting this story Audrey Cooling, a spokesperson for the video game producers party, reached out with a statement in response to SAG-AFTRA's impending strike. Their statement has been added below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are disappointed the union has chosen to walk away when we are so close to a deal, and we remain prepared to resume negotiations. We have already found common ground on 24 out of 25 proposals, including historic wage increases and additional safety provisions. Our offer is directly responsive to SAG-AFTRA’s concerns and extends meaningful AI protections that include requiring consent and fair compensation to all performers working under the IMA. These terms are among the strongest in the entertainment industry.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr><h2>What Does A SAG-AFTRA Strike Mean For Video Games?</h2>
<p>As the Video Game Strike begins all members of SAG-AFTRA will not be able to work for any 'Struck' Video Game productions. Working could include active production such as acting (whether it be voice acting, performance, or stunts), background or stand-in work, or performing camera tests. This also includes participating in auditions, authorizing your voice or likeness, or promoting any struck games you've been working on as a SAG-AFTRA performer.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/contracts-industry-resources/contracts/video-game-strike/ima-strike-notice-members">full list of rules for the SAG-AFTRA video game strike can be found here</a>. It's also important to note that not all Video Game productions are within the scope of the Strike Order, SAG-AFTRA has created a resource for looking up a game via it's Full Code Name or Production ID so it can be verified whether it's within the Strike Order. Looking up a game will either return to you a "Game Over!" message, or a "Let's Play!" if it is not struck.</p>
<p>Fans of TV and Movies will be familiar with the idea of a SAG-AFTRA strike after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_SAG-AFTRA_strike">almost four months of striking</a> that occurred last year.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What Can I As A Fan Of Video Games Do To Support SAG-AFTRA?</h2>
<p>As with the 2023 SAG-AFTRA and WGA strikes last year the first thing for everyone to understand is that depending on the length of time there may be delays to known or unknown Video Games on the horizon. It's important to remember that it's not the fault of those on strike, but of the companies that can't come to an agreement to protect the livelihood of those working in video games.</p>

<p>As part of their Strike FAQ page SAG-AFTRA has put together a list of ways that Creators/Streamers, Developers, Fans, and Podcasters can support the strike. This doesn't ask people to not play games that are within the Strike, but instead asks that you share the message of the strike and promote the importance of the strike.</p>
<p>SAG-AFTRA also asks that if you're sharing the message that you use the hashtags&nbsp;#LevelUpTheContract, #VideoGameStrike and #SagAftraStrong when sharing on socials. For more information on how you can engage you can explore their<a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/contracts-industry-resources/interactive/video-game-strike/take-action"> "Take Action" page</a>, and for more information overall for members, non-members, or just as a fan you can <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/videogamestrike-faq">check out their FAQ page</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>SAG-AFTRA At San Diego Comic-Con</h2>
<p>For those looking to attend San Diego Comic-Con next week SAG-AFTRA has explained that they understand that due to the proximity it could cause complications so is granting an exception to the strike rules related to promotion and publicity services specifically for SDCC 2024.</p>

The strike goes into effect July 26th at 12:01AM and impacts all SAG-AFTRA actors, voice actors, and motion capture actors and involves companies like Activision Blizzard, EA, Insomniac Games, WB Games, and more. According to SAG-AFTRA’s press release, the union and video game companies could not come to an agreement regarding AI protections.</p><p>“We’re not going to consent to a contract that allows companies to abuse AI to the detriment of our members,” said SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher in the press release. “When these companies get serious about offering an agreement our members can live — and work — with, we will be here, ready to negotiate.”</p><p>In a statement to <em>The Verge</em>, Audrey Cooling, spokesperson for the video game producers&nbsp;involved in the negotiations, wrote:<em> </em></p><div><blockquote><p>We are disappointed the union has chosen to walk away when we are so close to a deal, and we&nbsp;remain&nbsp;prepared to resume negotiations.

Advertising for struck work is also prohibited, which would potentially impact games being promoted at San Diego Comic-Con, but SAG-AFTRA included a clause explaining games at SDCC would be exempt from strike action.</p><p>In September of last year, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/26/23890663/sag-aftra-strike-approval-video-game-performers">SAG-AFTRA voted to authorize a strike</a> around the same time the Hollywood actors and writers strikes were winding down. As with those strikes, the use of AI was one of the major sticking points with concerns the technology could be used to replace workers. SAG-AFTRA has already made some deals regarding the use of AI in video game production, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/10/24033258/sag-aftra-ai-video-game-voice-acting-licensing-replica-studios">signing an agreement with AI voice company Replica Studios</a>. The agreement permits SAG-AFTRA members to work exclusively with Replica to create digital replications of their voice that can then be licensed out with agreements in place for length of use and compensation.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[EA and Paradox Aren’t Showing Dragon Age: The Veilguard and Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2 at Gamescom]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/ea-and-paradox-arent-showing-dragon-age-the-veilguard-and-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-at-gamescom/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-and-paradox-aren%E2%80%99t-showing-dragon-age-the-veilguard-and-vampire-the-masquerade-%E2%80%93-bloodlines-2-at-gamescom.937053/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ea-and-paradox-arent-showing-dragon-age-the-veilguard-and-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-at-gamescom/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Despite both being slated to launch this Fall, neither Dragon Age: The Veilguard nor Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 will be shown at Gamescom 2024 by EA and Paradox Interactive, the respective publishers.</p>
<p>With less than a month left before the beginning of the big European convention, the exhibitors list has been <a href="https://exhibitors.gamescom.global/en/gamescom-exhibitors/list-of-exhibitors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">finalized</a>. Since Wccftech is attending with media accreditations, we are looking into which games will be shown there, and we can confirm that neither of two of the most anticipated games scheduled in the latter half of 2024 will appear.</p>
<p>EA does actually have a presence at Gamescom 2024. However, we confirmed with the publisher's PR department that the only game shown there will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/heres-everything-you-need-to-know-about-ea-sports-fc-25-fc-iq-tactics-career-mode-improvements-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EA Sports FC 25</a>, which means Dragon Age: The Veilguard is sorely missing. It feels like a weird repeat of what <a href="https://wccftech.com/konami-is-at-gamescom-but-only-for-the-yu-gi-oh-tcg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KONAMI</a> is doing with the Silent Hill 2 remake, which is also skipping Gamescom 2024 for some reason despite only being a few weeks away from its October debut.</p>
<p>It's enough to make one wonder if a delay is coming, although Electronic Arts has actually shared a lot of Dragon Age: The Veilguard <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/dragon-age-the-veilguard-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-first-dragon-age-in-a-decade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">info</a> lately, which pointed to the Fall release window being respected. Moreover, earlier today, the developers <a href="https://x.com/dragonage/status/1816511768044163410?cn=ZmxleGlibGVfcmVjcw%3D%3D&amp;refsrc=email" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> that the game is 'making good progress' toward its Fall launch while also confirming that it is already Steam Deck verified and the Steam version will be native, which means it won't require the EA app to play the game, unlike other EA titles.</p>
<p>Another game in a similar situation is Paradox Interactive's Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2. The troubled sequel is still formally <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-comes-fall-2024-developed-by-the-chinese-room/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pinned</a> for a Q4 2024 launch, but Paradox is skipping Gamescom altogether, Wccftech was able to confirm via the publisher's PR, meaning Bloodlines 2 will be nowhere to be seen at the Koelnmesse. A delay in this case would be less than surprising, as what's been shown so far isn't quite as polished as we would have liked to see. It is far from unlikely that the developers will require more time before launch.</p>
<p>Even if both games missed their Fall 2024 launch windows, Western RPG fans would still have two high-profile games pretty much assured to debut this year: Warhorse's <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-is-out-this-year-and-its-looking-great-not-to-mention-twice-as-large/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</a>&nbsp;and Obsidian's <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-to-feature-third-person-camera-and-respec-option-game-director-says-its-looking-fantastic-and-ready-for-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Avowed</a>, both of which will be shown at Gamescom.</p>
