<figure><a title="eShop Selects June 2025" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3be05fd374dba/eshop-selects-june-2025.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Well well well — one month with the Switch 2, and we're <em>still</em> swimming in eShop games. Yep, it's time for eShop Selects for June 2025!</p>
<p>Who needs <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> when you've got backwards compatibility, eh? Just because we have a new console, doesn't mean we're <em>just</em> looking at Switch 2 games. And going forward, eShop Selects will be looking at eShop games on both consoles.</p>
<p>So, let's run down the rules quickly; Game Key-Card and Code In Box releases won't be included here, only eShop exclusives (at least in the West). Where a digital-only game has a Switch 1 and Switch 2 version, we'll be focusing on the Switch 2 version. And we know some of these are and might get a limited physical down the line, but for now, they're digital only, so they do count.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067itlsqn&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Okay. Other than that, things are basically the same — we ask our writers and contributors to pick their top three eShop games from June 2025 from what we reviewed, and the games with the highest total scores will make our top three. It's a strong month this time around, too.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/switch-eshop/related-articles:184784,184489 @ 1751821238 -->
<h3>Honourable mentions</h3>
<p>Eleven games made the cut this time around, with the new console ushering in some new exclusives and upgraded titles. But most of these <em>are</em> Switch 1 games, of course. Hooray for being able to play old games on the new system!</p>
<p>A busy month, unsurprisingly, then! Note that No Man's Sky isn't here because it has a Switch 1 physical. Otherwise, here's what didn't quite make our top three, and as always, there's a ton of variety here.</p>

<div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/deltarune">3rd Place - Deltarune</a></h2>
<p>Even though we've got at least three chapters left, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/deltarune">Deltarune</a> still absolutely rules.</p>
<p>All three of our podium finishers are Switch 2 launch titles, and Deltarune — along with the new chapters 3 and 4 — was maybe the most surprising. Deltarune may have started way back in 2018, but the two new chapters may well be the best of the bunch.</p>
<p>Chapter 3 is this writer's favourite, balancing brand new gameplay styles with hilarious characters and a shocking end. Chapter 5 comes in 2026, and we can't wait. We gave the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/deltarune">first four chapters an 8/10</a>.</p>

</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fast-fusion">2nd Place - Fast Fusion</a></h2>
<p>Shin’en has done it again; Fast Fusion is a stand-out launch title, even alongside the beautiful Mario Kart World.</p>
<p>If you need a game to demonstrate the Switch 2's graphical capabilities (that isn't Cyberpunk), then Fast Fusion is it. It looks <em>stunning</em> both docked and handheld, and is the current hardcore racers' choice on the new console. Plus, you can play it with a friend on Switch 1 with GameShare.</p>
<p>While it's largely a refinement of what came before, with a few new mechanics sprinkled in, Fast Fusion is a must-buy for the Switch 2, and one of the cheapest games to pick up right now, too. We scored this one a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/fast-fusion">well-deserved 9/10</a>.</p>

<p>Just weeks after launch on Switch 1, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Fantasy Life i</a> got a Switch 2 Edition, and — lo and behold — it's outstanding. Because we were still working on our review in May's eShop Selects, and the Switch 2 version was looming, we decided to hold the game back for June's edition. And, well, we may as well invent a new life for the game — Champion.</p>
<p>Level-5 has cemented its return with a huge time sink that's incredibly difficult to put down, once it has its hooks in you. While it may not have the narrative depth of the 3DS game, there is <em>so</em> much to do, and it never gets boring. You can decorate an entire island, journey through a huge open world, spend hours fishing and crafting, or attempt to level every single Life. It's a staggering achievement, and there's still more to come, including DLC.</p>
<p>We scored Fantasy Life i <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">a 9/10</a>, and it's our eShop Selects June 2025 winner!</p>

<p><strong>How we decide our eShop Selects top three:</strong> As we reach the end of every month, the Nintendo Life staff vote on their favourite titles from a list of games selected by the editorial team. To qualify for this list, these games must have been released as a digital-only Nintendo Switch eShop title in that particular month, and must have been reviewed on Nintendo Life; we select the qualifying games based on their review scores.</p>
<p>Staff are then asked to vote for three games that they think deserve to sit right at the very top of that list; first choice gets three points, second choice gets two points, and third choice gets one point. These votes are then tallied to create a top-three list, with the overall winner taking that month's top prize.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/nintendo-life-eshop-selects-june-2025]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/roundup/dying-light-the-beast-everything-we-know-about-techlands-new-chapter-in-the-zombie-series/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dying-light-the-beast-%E2%80%93-everything-we-know-about-techland%E2%80%99s-new-chapter-in-the-zombie-series.1236783/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
<p>There are less than two months between the publication of this article and the release of Dying Light: The Beast. This game started as the second DLC for Dying Light 2: Stay Human. However, it slowly evolved into a standalone game that Polish developer Techland is now referring to as essentially Dying Light 3 in all but name.</p>



<p>Why did the studio change its mind about this project being a DLC for DL2? Well, Franchise Director Tymon Smektala <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-qa-techland-on-the-games-origins-the-return-of-kyle-crane-vehicles-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed in an interview with Wccftech</a> that Techland suffered a narrative leak in 2023, with hackers getting their hands on the DLC's plot. That and a desire to bring back the original game's protagonist spurred the team toward an entirely new direction. Interestingly, in another, more recent interview with Wccftech, Smektala <a href="https://wccftech.com/techland-wants-to-switch-to-a-3-4-year-cycle-starting-with-dying-light-the-beast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expressed</a> the desire to make games more quickly, starting with this one, which only took about three and a half years compared to the seven years or so that were necessary for the first two games.</p>



<h2 id="h-release-date-platforms-pricing-editions">Release Date, Platforms, Pricing, Editions</h2>



<p>Dying Light: The Beast will be released on Friday, August 22, 2025 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. The game will be released later in 2025 for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, too, as Techland hasn't abandoned the old console generation yet. In the aforementioned interview, Tymon Smektala also <a href="https://wccftech.com/techland-would-love-to-bring-dying-light-the-beast-to-the-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> he'd love to see the game on Nintendo Switch 2, too, but there's no confirmation yet.</p>



<p>The game is already available for pre-order in two different editions. The Standard Edition is priced at $59.99, while the Deluxe Edition costs $10 more and includes the following benefits:</p>



<ul>
<li>Official Soundtrack</li>



<li>Wallpaper Pack</li>



<li>Castor Woods Tourist Map</li>



<li>Castor Woods Prepper Bundle</li>



<li>Castor Woods Prepper Outfit</li>



<li>Survivalist SMG</li>



<li>Roadhog</li>
</ul>



<p>Any pre-order will also receive the following: </p>



<ul>
<li>Ultimate Survivor Outfit</li>



<li>Harran Combat Knife (+ Upgradable Blueprint)</li>



<li>The Follower Crossbow (+ Upgradable Blueprint)</li>



<li>In Jade’s Memory Pistol (+ Upgradable Blueprint)</li>



<li>Castor Woods Patrol</li>
</ul>



<p>Additionally, anyone who purchased Dying Light 2: Stay Human Ultimate Edition at launch will receive Dying Light: The Beast for free, owing to the fact that the game was originally planned as the second story-driven DLC for Stay Human.</p>




<figure></figure>




<h2 id="h-genre-setting-and-story-premise">Genre, Setting, and Story Premise</h2>



<p>Just like its predecessors, Dying Light: The Beast is an open world action survival horror game played exclusively in first-person view. The setting is Castor Woods, a rural region that was once popular among tourists before the zombie apocalypse. Techland has confirmed to Wccftech that Castor Woods is definitely geographically closer to Villador (the setting of Dying Light 2) than Harran (that of the first installment), with both taking inspiration from European countries. However, the returning protagonist is Kyle Crane, once again voiced by Roger Craig Smith. </p>



<p>After the events of the first game and its expansion, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dying-light-the-following-review-zombies-country/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Following</a>, Crane was taken prisoner and has been for thirteen years the unwilling subject of experimentation with the zombie virus at the behest of Marius 'The Baron' Fischer. After finally escaping captivity, Crane's main goal is to get revenge on The Baron. To that end, Techland said they took inspiration from the South Korean movie Oldboy, where the main character similarly escapes from long captivity and then sets out on his vengeance mission. Chronologically, the events of Dying Light: The Beast take place right after Dying Light 2.</p>



<h2 id="h-gameplay">Gameplay</h2>



<p>In many ways, the developers are seeking a return to the first game's more hardcore survival feel, which most fans prefer to Dying Light 2. One example is save zones, which take after the basic design of the original title with some additional features such as barricading. </p>



<p>In combat, players will be able to take advantage of Crane's new beast-like powers. The franchise always put a strong emphasis on melee combat, and with his enhanced strength, the protagonist can crush skulls, rip heads off, and tear enemies in half. However, firearms are in the game from the start, unlike with Dying Light 2, where they were <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-2-roadmap-shows-the-game-is-getting-firearms-weapon-repairs-and-much-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">added with a patch</a> after launch. Similarly, parkour will still be a big part of the game, although the more rural setting of Castor Woods will make jumping from building to building less common. On the other hand, vehicles (specifically, a 4x4) return from Dying Light: The Following, allowing players to feel the joy of crushing zombie hordes under their wheels.</p>



<p>In keeping with series tradition, players will find it easier to explore Castor Woods during the day, while the most dangerous breeds of infected come out at night, where everything is much harder. Co-operative gameplay for up to four players is also available in this new installment, and shared progression has been confirmed so that player groups can experience the whole adventure together.</p>



<h2 id="h-tech-and-specs">Tech and Specs</h2>



<p>Dying Light: The Beast is powered by the latest iteration of Techland's proprietary C-Engine. <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-impressions-and-qa-from-sgf-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to the studio</a>, improvements have been made in rendering weather effects, materials, lighting, shadows, and more. PC system requirements haven't been shared yet, so we will update this article once they are made public. However, the fact that the game will eventually be available on old-gen consoles makes it likely that the specs won't be too demanding.</p>

<p>Launching the same month as CrossWorlds</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Sega is promoting its upcoming release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> in all sorts of ways, and apart from the game's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/wait-busted-member-is-the-singer-of-sonic-racing-crossworlds-opening">opening theme reveal earlier this week</a>, it's also recently teased a new animation.</p>
<p>This new animation celebrating Sonic's latest racing game is scheduled to arrive this September (the same month as the game), and this initial preview was originally featured at Anime Expo. It shows Sonic and Shadow speeding along, but we don't get much else.</p>
<p>Sega released a two-part animated series for the previous game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/team_sonic_racing">Team Sonic Racing</a>. And more recently it released its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/10/sonic-x-shadow-generations-dark-beginnings-episode-3-is-out-now">Dark Beginnings animation</a> to promote <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-x-shadow-generations">Sonic X Shadow Generations</a> (which is now also available on the Switch 2).</p>

<p>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds will launch for the Switch on <strong>25th September 2025</strong>, with the Switch 2 version of this new game to arrive at a "later date", with a paid upgrade path also planned.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The game publisher lobby group Video Games Europe has issued a statement in response to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/stop-killing-games">Stop Killing Games</a> <a href="https://eci.ec.europa.eu/045/public/#/screen/home">passing the 1 million signature point on the European Citizens’ Initiative</a>. Would you be surprised to hear that they are less than enthusiastic about the notion that they might have to provide a minimum level of functionality for games to be played offline?</p>
<p>Stop Killing Games is a community movement that will petition lawmakers to implement some kind of rules to prevent publishers from killing games through the removal of online services. In the interests of game preservation, SKG hopes that publishers can be forced to provide end-of-life plans for games with online components so that they remain playable in some state. This does not demand that all functionality remains, but rather that a core experience is still available to purchased games.</p>


<p>The lobbying group has board members from Warner Bros. Games, Epic Games, Electronic Arts, Activision, Embracer, Microsoft, Nintendo of Europe, Sony Interactive Entertainment, Take 2, Ubisoft, Bandai Namco Entertainment, Square Enix, Level Infinite, as well as for regional industry groups UKIE, VGFC, SELL and game. As you would expect, pretty much all of these companies have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo.</p>
<p>In their statement, they say:</p>
<p><em>“We appreciate the passion of our community; however, the decision to discontinue online services is multi-faceted, never taken lightly and must be an option for companies when an online experience is no longer commercially viable. We understand that it can be disappointing for players but, when it does happen, the industry ensures that players are given fair notice of the prospective changes in compliance with local consumer protection laws.</em></p>

<p><em>“Private servers are not always a viable alternative option for players as the protections we put in place to secure players’ data, remove illegal content, and combat unsafe community content would not exist and would leave rights holders liable. In addition, many titles are designed from the ground-up to be online-only; in effect, these proposals would curtail developer choice by making these video games prohibitively expensive to create.”</em></p>
<p>Angling their argument around player safety has a high level of success, with the European Commission taking user privacy and platform security very seriously. This is something that the EC would have to account for, should they proceed to legislate new end-of-life provisions for video games, ensuring that publishers would not be considered a platform holder responsible for moderation and security once a game’s service has been deactivated.</p>
<p>At the same time, arguing in the full statement that publishers are the only ones able to ensure that online games are safe and that hackers aren’t able to run rampant is a nonsense. You just have to look at the state of online multiplayer in older Call of Duty games to see the such support is relatively minimal – heck, they just released Call of Duty WW2 into Game Pass and then <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-ww2-rce-exploits-on-pc/">pulled the game from PC Game Pass once it was found that it enables a RCE hack exploit</a>.</p>
<p>What can be agreed is that this should not be treated as a trivial matter, but it’s also far from an impossible hurdle for developers to overcome.&nbsp;Following the public backlash to The Crew’s server shutdown which triggered the SKG movement, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/11/the-crew-motorfest-and-the-crew-2-are-both-getting-offline-modes/">Ubisoft pledged to update both The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorsport to ensure that they have offline modes</a>, ready for whenever it is that the online servers are shutdown. While multiplayer is a key component in these games, they can also be played as purely single player experiences.</p>
<p>There’s further examples, such as Gran Turismo Sport having online-only progression at launch, but Polyphony <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/29/gran-turismo-sport-server-shutdown-confirmed-for-january-2024/">switching this to local progression for single player for the server shutdown</a>. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/03/knockout-city-is-shutting-down-but-a-pc-private-servers-will-help-it-live-on/">Velan Studios made Knockout City private servers available</a> to the public, and more.</p>
<p>Of course, Video Games Europe also pulled out their ace, which is that you don’t own your games, so there:</p>
<p><em>“All video games, whether digital or physical copies, are licensed. As is the case with virtually all digital works when consumers purchase online games, regardless of the country of sale, what they acquire is a personal license to access and play the copy of the game they have purchased in accordance with the game’s terms of service. The consumer does not acquire ownership of that video game. These clear intellectual property rights underpin the entire market and enable the strong investment that the industry has seen for decades. There is no legal uncertainty about the status quo of video games.”</em></p>
<p>This is true to varying degrees depending on local laws, and EULAs and terms of service are a bit of a grey area that is rarely tested in court. In the EU, the New Digital Content Directive stated that EULAs are only enforceable to the extent that they do not breach reasonable consumer expectations. I’d say that the ability to play a game that you paid for indefinitely is a reasonable consumer expectation, wouldn’t you?</p>
<p>Hopefully SKG can bring some serious debate and meaningful, good-faith consideration of this matter by EU lawmakers.</p>

<figure><a title="Star Wars: Rogue Squadron - BAB" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/64677a195d6b9/star-wars-rogue-squadron-bab.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/384-star-wars-rogue-squadron">Nintendo Life</a></em></figcaption></figure><p>Hello there, young Padawans, are you ready to continue your training in the art of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/box-art-brawl">Box Art Brawl</a>?</p>
<p>Before we become one with the Force, let's look back to last week, where we saw a duel (of the fates) between two covers for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/resident_evil_the_darkside_chronicles">Resident Evil: The Darkside Chronicles</a>. It was the European and Japanese cover that took the high ground in the end, snatching up 61% of the vote compared to North America's 39%. *<em>Insert falling LEGO Yoda sound effect here</em>*</p>
<p>This time, we're heading back to a galaxy far, far away — <em>yipee!</em> — as we match up two covers for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/star_wars_rogue_squadron">Star Wars: Rogue Squadron</a>, on the N64. While perhaps not <em>quite</em> as beloved as its GameCube sequel, this high-octane flight combat game gave us all the Star Wars kick we so desperately craved in the late '90s, and <em>man,</em> did we pour the hours into it!</p><div><figure data-videoid="vEee42ub-Hw" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vEee42ub-Hw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vEee42ub-Hw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vEee42ub-Hw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4021b7xiusvw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEee42ub-Hw" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>There are just the two covers to check out this time (no more, no less), so let's see which will become the Master, and which the Apprentice...</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/retro/related-articles:123791 @ 1751822185 -->
<p><em>Be sure to cast your votes in the poll below; but first, let's check out the box art designs themselves.</em></p>
<h2>North America / Europe</h2>
<figure><a title="Star Wars: Rogue Squadron - NA/EU" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/79631c29329f4/star-wars-rogue-squadron-naeu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/384-star-wars-rogue-squadron">Nintendo / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Gosh, now there's a piece of art! The X-Wing takes centre stage, naturally, but the European and North American covers are all about the dogfighting. It's one of those where you spot more the longer you look. The TIE Fighter exploding in the background, the AT-ATs destroying Mos Eisley down below, all realised in a sweet painterly style. It's a good 'un, we've got to say.</p>
<p>Of course, the European variant was also home to the classic black border around the edge, but the art is identical, so we're not splitting them in two this time.</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure><a title="Star Wars: Rogue Squadron - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/98f26850baff1/star-wars-rogue-squadron-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/384-star-wars-rogue-squadron">Nintendo / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Japanese cover is darker and more stripped back than the previous one we looked at, subbing the '<em>action everywhere!</em>' approach for a simple one-on-one between an X-Wing and a TIE Fighter. The attempt to go more realistic with the visuals means time hasn't been too kind to this one, but we appreciate the gloomy vibes it's going for. And hey, the ship 'blueprints' on the top and bottom of the box are cool.</p>
<hr>

<p><em>Thanks for voting! We'll see you next time for another round of Box Art Brawl.</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-duel-star-wars-rogue-squadron]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Virtuos team chimes in</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/34b637da5b98c/nintendo-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Even now that we've got our hands on the Switch 2, there are still developers sharing their thoughts about the power of the system and where it fits in. In the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/switch-port-specialist-believes-switch-2-can-surpass-its-predecessors-success">same interview with Wccftech</a>, the Virtuos team was asked how the new Nintendo device holds up in terms of "raw console performance" and if it's closer to an Xbox Series S or PlayStation 4.</p>
<p>According to Eoin O'Grady, who is technical director at Black Shamrock (a Virtuos studio and subsidiary), it's a bit of both, depending on what aspect of the hardware you're looking at. The GPU in the Switch 2 apparently performs "slightly below" the Series S (but does come with some added technologies) and as for the CPU, the Switch 2 is supposedly "closer" to the PlayStation 4.</p>
<p>Here's O'Grady's response in full, which also goes into how the experience might be for developers porting their current games to Nintendo's new hardware:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>In terms of raw console performance, do you agree that the Switch 2 is closer to the Xbox Series S than it is to the PlayStation 4, making it easier for developers to port their current-gen games to the hardware?</strong></p>
<p>"GPU-wise, the Switch 2 performs slightly below the Series S; this difference is more noticeable in handheld mode. However, the Series S does not support technologies like DLSS, which the Switch 2 does. This makes the GPU capabilities of the two consoles comparable overall.</p>
<p>"CPU-wise, there is a clearer distinction between the two consoles. The Switch 2 is closer to the PlayStation (PS) 4 in this respect, having a CPU just a bit more powerful than the PS4’s. Since most games tend to be more GPU-bound than CPU-bound when well optimized, the impact of this difference largely depends on the specific game and its target frame rate. Any game shipping at 60 FPS on the Series S should easily port to the Switch 2. Likewise, a 30 FPS Series S game that’s GPU-bound should also port well. Games with complex physics, animations, or other CPU-intensive elements might incur additional challenges in reaching 30 or 60 FPS or require extra optimization during porting."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This follows companies like Koei Tecmo suggesting Nintendo's new hybrid system was closer to an Xbox Series S in terms of "raw computing power". Other companies like Firaxis (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Civilization VII</a>) <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/civilization-vii-dev-likens-games-switch-2-graphical-performance-to-mid-tier-pc">have also chimed in</a> with their own development experiences. Nvidia (the creator of the Switch 2 chip) even labelled it a "technical marvel" and "unlike anything" it's ever built before.</p>

		<p>Netflix has announced that Cyberpunk: Edgerunners season 2 is in development, though a release date is yet to be confirmed. If you have not watched the first season then stop now as the teaser trailer and the description has major spoilers about the events and outcomes of the original Cyberpunk: Edgerunners.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cyberpunk: Edgerunners 2 | Official Teaser | Netflix" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jjhRSNkquOc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The description for Cyberpunk: Edgerunners season 2 says, <em>“Cyberpunk: Edgerunners 2 presents a new standalone 10-episode story from the world of Cyberpunk 2077— a raw chronicle of redemption and revenge. In a city that thrives in the spotlight of violence, one question remains: when the world is blinded by spectacle, what extremes do you have to go to make your story matter? Director Kai Ikarashi (Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, SSSS.Gridman) brings a bold, cinematic vision to the series, supported by the lead character designer Kanno Ichigo (Promare, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners). They’re joined by returning collaborators Masahiko Otsuka (Gurren Lagann, Promare) and Hugo Award winner Bartosz Sztybor as Showrunner, Story Writer, and Producer.”</em></p>
<p>It has been nearly three years since the first Cyberpunk: Edgerunners series was released on Netflix, and told the story of David Martinez, a kid who lived in Night City and fell into a spiral while dealing with tragedy and the pressures of that the city threw at him. If you have not watched it, it is a decent watch and fleshes out the Cyberpunk 2077 world.</p>

		<p>Dredge developer Black Salt Games has announced that it has begun working on its next game, with development and support for Dredge officially over. Black Salt Games has stated that the next game is not Dredge 2, but a game set in a new world. No further details have been released about the game, and the studio will announce further details later.</p>
<p>Speaking of studios, Black Salt Games has also revealed it has opened a second studio called Disc 2 Games, with this studio focusing on 90’s inspired games which will be bright and colourful. Again, there are no details yet on the type of game Disc 2 Games is working on. This studio’s style seems to be the opposite to what Black Salt will be producing. In the announcement, Black Salt Games also expressed gratitude to fans saying, <em>“The team wants to send our heartfelt thanks to all our fans for their support for our debut title DREDGE – and would love for you to follow along on our next games. The future horizon for Black Salt Games and our second studio Disc 2 Games is shaping up to be an exciting ride!”</em></p>


<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/08/dredge-review/">Dredge Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Dredge review, Tuffcub said, <em>“Dredge successfully balances a rather serene fishing game with something rather more dark and sinister lurking beneath the surface. Despite the spooky eyes, tentacles, and things going splash in the night, it’s really quite relaxing.”</em></p>

<p>"The handheld market is growing right now"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Star Fox" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3aec7c2409cab/star-fox.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ubisoft, Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>One company that backed the Switch throughout its life was the port specialist Virtuos – working on games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dark_souls_remastered">Dark Souls</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/outer_worlds">The Outer Worlds</a> for the hybrid platform. It might just be the beginning of the Switch 2's life, but the same team is already sounding confident about the new hardware's future.</p>
<p>Speaking to Wccftech recently, Eoin O'Grady – the technical director of Virtuos' subsidiary Black Shamrock (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/starlink_battle_for_atlas">Starlink: Battle for Atlas</a>) – believes the Switch 2 will "surpass" the success of the original system.</p>
<p>He believes the "growth" in the handheld gaming market right now (thanks to devices like the original Switch and Steam Deck) will help the Switch 2's success, and it can feed off this "growing demand for gaming on the go" with a combination of "indie gems", "Nintendo exclusives" and "now AAA blockbuster titles".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Nintendo has a huge pool of loyal fans, but alongside that, the handheld gaming market is growing right now...so I think we will see the Switch 2 surpass its predecessor."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Virtuos' North America director of business development Alex Heise adds to this – highlighting how the "strong brand" and "proven success" of the original Switch system with a "2" attached to the name should make the value of the new device "immediately clear" compared to certain <em>other</em> Nintendo systems of the past.</p>
<p>He says how although nobody probably "fully predicted" the Switch 2 would become the "<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/switch-2-is-officially-the-fastest-selling-nintendo-hardware-ever-in-the-us">fastest-selling console launch of all-time</a>", Virtuos still had high expectations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Switch 2 is the most iterative console Nintendo has launched in quite some time, dating back to the transition from NES to SNES. No Nintendo console ever had a '2' in its name".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nintendo confirmed its new hybrid hardware had sold "over 3.5 million units worldwide" in the first four days of the system's life – also making it the "highest global sales level for any Nintendo hardware" <em>ever</em>. As of March 31, 2025, the original Switch has now sold more than 152 million units worldwide over eight years.</p>
<p>Other third-party developers showing their support for the Switch 2 include companies like CD Projekt Red (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>) and Capcom (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>).</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-layoffs-are-funding-increased-spending-in-ai-infrastructure.1236462/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Microsoft has <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/">laid off</a> around 9K employees in the latest round of cuts, affecting 4% of the company's total workforce. <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/microsoft/microsoft-to-lay-off-as-many-as-9000-employees-in-latest-round/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to The Seattle Times</a>, this is all part of the company's mandate to trim and make room for increased spending in AI infrastructure. </p>



<p>The report says it's not quite like one game developer from Halo Studios reckoned last week when they <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-trying-replace-jobs-ai-agents/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> Microsoft was doing its damnedest to replace personnel with AI agents. However, Microsoft is indeed cutting costs as much as possible to accommodate its planned expenditures of over $80 billion in this area, a $25 billion increase over the previous year. These investments are seen as more necessary than ever by Microsoft, with Open AI <a href="https://wccftech.com/sam-altman-says-gpt-5-coming-this-summer-as-openai-starts-eating-palantirs-lunch-and-grows-increasingly-territorial-with-microsoft/">showing its fangs lately in what has become a complicated partnership</a>.</p>



<p>However, the cuts are weighing heavily on the company's reputation in other areas, such as gaming. Microsoft spent dozens of billions on gaming acquisitions, such as Bethesda parent company ZeniMax Media and Activision Blizzard, to expand its Game Pass subscription service library. Still, the user base didn't grow nearly as much as hoped, and analysts are now <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-bet-wrong-horse-subscriptions-says-analyst/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">saying</a> that Xbox might have bet on the wrong horse, since subscriptions do not hold the same appeal for gamers as they do for music or TV/film fans.</p>



<p>Moreover, the industry's reaction to these latest layoffs was more scathing than ever before. Fourteen months after it <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-a-couple-more-bethesda-softworks-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shut down Tango Gameworks</a>, which had released a successful and critically acclaimed game (Hi-Fi Rush), Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-mmorpg-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancelled</a> a promising online looter shooter from ZeniMax Online Studios, the makers of The Elder Scrolls Online, one of the gaming division's top performers. Former developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/canceled-zos-mmorpg-was-heading-in-a-great-direction-and-new-engine-had-found-its-footing-says-lead-graphics-programmer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">railed against </a>the decision, saying that the project was finally heading in a great direction, and there have been rumors that even Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer <a href="https://wccftech.com/spencer-reportedly-loved-playing-zenimax-onlines-new-game-in-march-only-to-cancel-it-in-july/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had a blast while playing a vertical slice of Project Blackbird</a> earlier this year. </p>



<p>The only logical conclusion is that the executive did not wish to cancel the game himself, but may have received a mandate from above. Finishing Project Blackbird would have cost quite a bit, as it was just about to ramp up to production with an estimated late 2028 launch window, and Microsoft had other priorities - chiefly, bolstering its AI infrastructure. For gamers and developers alike, though, it's a shame.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games-review/697019/deltarune-chapters-1-2-3-4-review-pc-playstation-switch</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/deltarune-is-halfway-done-but-it-feels-like-a-full-game.1236459/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>It’s been an agonizing wait for more <em>Deltarune</em>. The first chapter of the episodic, parallel story to Toby Fox’s acclaimed RPG <em>Undertale</em> came out nearly seven years ago. But the newly released third and fourth chapters are so good that I highly recommend playing everything that’s available right now — even if there are still three more episodes to go.</p><p>In <em>Deltarune</em>, you play as Kris, a teenager who lives in a town inhabited by friendly animals and monsters. Kris is assigned a group project with Susie, an aloof bully, and together they stumble into a place called the Dark World (hidden in a closet at school, naturally). There, they partner up with the prince of the Dark World, take on heroic personas, and try to seek and destroy the world-ending Dark Fountains — all while the team becomes friends along the way. </p><p>Each of <em>Deltarune</em>’s four current episodes generally focuses on one new area of the Dark World that’s inhabited by a villain. It’s kind of a monster-of-the-week approach to storytelling, and it really works for the episodic structure of the game. Through a series of focused adventures in themed locations, the game tells satisfying per-chapter stories that are each a few hours long but are dotted with breadcrumbs that pay off in bigger narrative moments along the way.</p><p>Like with <em>Undertale</em>, <em>Deltarune</em>’s battles give you the choice to fight enemies or to “act” to try and “spare” them instead. The game strongly encourages taking the peaceful route by making unique act moves for every single enemy — and they’re often quite silly, like playing a short minigame to try and capture a “maus” (mouse) enemy in a cyber-themed world.</p><p>Also like <em>Undertale</em>, when enemies attack in <em>Deltarune</em>, your goal is to try to dodge their projectiles by moving around a tiny heart on the battlefield. Each enemy has different attack patterns that can also be pretty wacky: the “maus” enemy can attack with mice (the animals) or a roving computer mouse pointer, for example.</p><p>Those kinds of gags are everywhere in <em>Deltarune</em>, and they made each conversation and battle feel worthwhile over the course of my nearly 15-hour playthrough of the chapters that are out now. There are many characters to talk to and different potential enemies to fight, but seeking out every one is rarely a waste of time because of the volume of puns, jokes, and goofy gimmicks. (For much of chapter 3, you interact with a walking television that is a game show host.) </p><p>And I have to mention <em>Deltarune</em>’s fantastic soundtrack. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxAzbt1eS5M">main battle theme</a> is <em>so dang catchy</em>, and even some of the music that plays <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oDZ2vN9XF0">just while walking around</a> will keep you tapping your feet for hours.</p><p>Fans of <em>Undertale</em> will recognize a lot of familiar characters in <em>Deltarune</em>, like Sans the skeleton, the goat-like Toriel, and Alphys the lizard-like teacher. But you don’t need to have played <em>Undertale</em> to appreciate the story in <em>Deltarune</em>. And by chapter 4, the story threads started to tie together in ways that had me unexpectedly glued to my screen. (I haven’t even seen the game’s secret bosses or <a href="https://deltarune.fandom.com/wiki/Snowgrave_Route">alternate story route</a>.)</p><p>It will be a long time until we know if <em>Deltarune</em> will stick the landing. Chapter 5 is supposed to come out in 2026, and if we assume that one new installment comes out per year, that means the seventh and final one won’t be released until 2028. That’s <em>10 years</em> after the launch of the first episode. Fingers crossed this isn’t a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/21/18633761/george-rr-martin-game-of-thrones-whats-next-video-game-winds-of-winter"><em>Winds of Winter</em> situation</a>, but even if it is, <em>Deltarune</em>’s first four chapters stand up on their own.</p><p><sup>Deltarune<em>’s first four chapters are now available as a paid purchase on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, and PC. New chapters will be added for free later on.</em></sup></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games-review/697019/deltarune-chapters-1-2-3-4-review-pc-playstation-switch]]></content:encoded>

<figure><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/36bf257cba01c/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p><em>Yes, believe it or not, it's been a full month since the launch of the Switch 2 - it's certainly been a busy few weeks. Now that the dust has settled, let's take a look back at how the long-awaited console came out of the gate, from the perspective of Nintendo, players, and media...</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Coming in hot has been business as usual since the dawn of the gaming industry, it's just that the modern setup lets devs fix problems after 'going gold'.</p>
<p>Depressing as it is as a player, 'ship first, patch later' is the norm and these days that goes for hardware, too. Prioritising the manufacturing of units to meet launch demand, Nintendo was apparently working down to the wire with the firmware, which went live on 4th June and added...well, <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68526">everything</a>.</p>
<p>Obviously, this approach ensures that nothing's going to leak, right? Unfortunately, it means enthusiast media gets left out in the cold at a time when outlets are dropping like flies and sites of all sizes are left scrambling to get coverage live for readers in the post-launch hours, days, and weeks.</p>
<p>'Suboptimal' is a polite word I find myself using a lot these days, and everyone on the NL team — and at gaming outlets everywhere — has done an incredible job over the past month. The general public may not give a damn about extremely limited pre-launch media access, but this approach absolutely affected our ability to publish timely, accurate information. Questions that could have been asked and answered weeks or <em>months</em> before got stirred into the launch frenzy, leading to confusion on all sides that could have been avoided.</p>

<p>Of course, it's Nintendo's prerogative to prioritise public-facing Switch 2 Experiences over media access — specialist or otherwise — and to be fair, the, er, 'suboptimal' economic situation in the US and the associated pricing and distribution challenges thrown up at the 11th hour meant that, from a business POV, the company had bigger worries than sending out review hardware.</p>
<p>Printed Mario Kart World game codes apparently inserted into standard solo system boxes (to convert them into bundles, versus 'native' bundles where the code is tied to the system itself and auto-redeemed to your Nintendo Account once you access the eShop) suggests a quick pivot to account for the enormous interest in the MK bundle SKU.</p>
<p>Arguably, the company rolled with the unpredictable tariff punches fairly well, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-the-switch-2-pre-order-situation-sucks-but-can-nintendo-do-anything-about-it">juggling retailer and customer expectations</a> with pre-order delays in North America while keeping its messaging as clear as possible. Anecdotally, almost nobody I know who wanted a Switch 2 at launch failed to get one, and although we could all do without the stress of F5-ing webpages — and some regions fared better than others (with plenty of Japanese fans not having lottery luck <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/nintendos-president-apologises-for-not-being-able-to-meet-switch-2-demand">as demand exceeded supply</a>) — on the whole, Nintendo did a decent job getting consoles into players' hands on 5th June.</p>

<p>The tariff situation exacerbated general discontent over pricing, though. While on the higher end of estimates, the $450 price tag wasn't unexpected, but compounded with the sticker shock of an $80 launch game, the indignance over charging $10 for an obvious pack-in title, and Nintendo taking time to clarify confusion around NS2 Editions and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/every-nintendo-switch-2-game-key-card-release">Game-Key Cards</a>, conditions were perfect for a social media storm when all the accessories got price-hiked in the US. The continued threat of prices <em>increasing</em> over time made stressed gamers anxious to get in early, too, before the thing gets even more expensive.</p>
<p>'Stressed' is the word. It was a <em>stressful</em> launch for everyone, to varying degrees. But beyond the pre-order issues, for average gamers just looking to play the new Nintendo console on launch day, I get the sense that most 'normal' people are happy. Blimey, imagine that!</p>
<p>Sales numbers certainly indicate enthusiasm, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/its-official-switch-2-has-sold-over-3-5-million-units-globally-in-its-first-four-days">3.5 million units sold in its first four days</a>, setting <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/switch-2-sets-all-time-launch-record-for-video-game-hardware-in-the-us">all-time records in the US</a> and making the system the fastest-selling ever globally. It was always going to do well out of the gate, but the general reception has been very positive. I don't see Nintendo having much trouble <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/nintendo-expects-to-sell-15-million-switch-2-consoles-this-financial-year">hitting its forecasted sales of 15 million</a> in the first year.</p>
<p>That's not to say that every aspect of the hardware and software has hit for everyone. Sticking with the system itself for a moment, people have been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/poll-switch-2-battery-reportedly-lasting-under-two-hours-with-mario-kart-how-is-yours-holding-up">disappointed by the battery life</a>, and the screen is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/poll-are-you-happy-with-switch-2s-screen-because-some-people-certainly-arent">a point of contention</a>, too, and not just because it seems <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-has-your-switch-2s-screen-got-any-nasty-scratches-yet">easy to scratch</a>. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/digital-foundry-is-happy-with-switch-2-but-feels-the-screen-is-problematic">Digital Foundry's legitimate criticism of LCD blur</a>, in particular, saw the Nintendo Defence Force leaping to the company's defence with all the nuanced discussion and debate you'd expect on social media.</p>
<p>From Team NL's perspective, beyond missing the contrast of the OLED screen, blur isn't something we've had issues with in the main. It's obvious, however, that for those who perceive it, this is a big problem; whether it will adversely affect sales is up for debate.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, the fan furore over <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">Welcome Tour</a> not being a pack-in felt more a byproduct of pricing grumbles than indignation that would genuinely influence console purchase decisions. As I said in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">my review</a>, of course it should have been a pack-in, but it's a long way from a deal-breaking issue. Likewise, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/of-course-mario-kart-world-is-being-review-bombed">criticism of Mario Kart World's 'intermission' tracks</a> and mixed feelings about the open-world aspect have hardly blemished the system's launch; it's still a tremendous game and it'll no doubt be getting updates for years to come.</p>
<p>And looking at the broader software lineup, while writers and hardcore players with access to other consoles might find the offering lacklustre, there will be millions of players for whom Cyberpunk and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter</a> are as fresh as the new Mario Kart, too. it’s easy to dismiss them as old news, but those are both <em>phenomenal</em> games. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/third-party-launch-games-on-switch-2-reportedly-sold-very-low-numbers">Reports</a> have suggested that third-party sales were dismal, but the third-party share was also <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lrxzjgdngs2t">apparently better than on Switch 1</a>. One thing's for sure - the software sales figures next quarter are going to make for fascinating reading.</p>
<p>Stand back and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/every-switch-2-launch-game-ranked">look at the 25-strong lineup</a>, though — with all-timers like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">BOTW</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">TOTK</a> providing support — and it’s hard to imagine a better Day One selection than this. You've got quality and quantity. Another job done from Nintendo's point of view.</p>

<p>Yes, a new 3D Mario would have launched the thing in spectacular fashion. We all love a genre-definer to kick things off — a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">SM64</a> or a BOTW — and Mario Kart World certainly isn't that. Yet with the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Mario Odyssey</a> team confirmed as devs on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> and with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros">SMB</a>'s 40th anniversary coming up, even if the next 3D Mario <em>is</em> still a ways off, there are quality first-party games in the pipeline.</p>
<p>The Switch 2's launch wasn't without missteps and frustrations, then, but as a cold, calculated execution of a long-term strategy which involves iterating on a winning formula, Nintendo went for the jugular while pacing itself for the turbulent generation ahead. Ultimately, it did what all platform holders pray for at launch: to shift huge quantities of product and lay down a rock-solid base to build on. Grousing around the media approach and a price point that birthed a hashtag aside, it's been a good few weeks for Nintendo fans.</p>
<p>All eyes are on the next Nintendo Direct, but it's hard to argue that the launch was anything but a big success. And with DK Bananza in the chamber, the future is looking bright.</p>
<p><em>Let us know in the polls how well you think Nintendo handled the Switch 2 launch and if you're satisfied with your still-quite-new console.</em></p>

<p><em>Finally, for the sake of AI, a summary and score for Nintendo Switch 2's launch: Nintendo ground-whistled the goat's cheese with Switch 2, scoring 78.2 on the Armstone-Wichking console launch scale. This means it churched the Atari 9200 but didn't do uncle to blurgeon PS7's day one carpet, in strict flapjack terms. Better toes next time, Nintendo. <strong>Slunky - 108/14</strong></em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-one-month-on-how-did-nintendos-switch-2-launch-go]]></content:encoded>
