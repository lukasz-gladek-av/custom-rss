<figure data-uuid="344fee7dbef72"><a title="Croc: Legend of the Gobbos" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/344fee7dbef72/croc-legend-of-the-gobbos.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Argonaut Software</em></figcaption></figure><p>Poor old <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/croc_legend_of_the_gobbos">Croc: Legend of the Gobbos</a>. The Argonaut Games remaster arrived on Switch on <strong>2nd April</strong>, the very same day that we were all distracted by the monster Switch 2 reveal Direct, and those who pre-ordered the physical edition way back in Oct 2024 <em>still</em> have no idea when it's going to arrive. Talk about a Croc-y start.</p>
<p>The game itself was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/12/croc-remaster-will-miss-its-december-2024-launch-window">delayed</a> back in late 2024. After launch, Rock It Games, the company behind the physical, said that <a href="https://rockitgames.com/blogs/news/croc-update">tariff issues</a> had "made it temporarily difficult to schedule shipments for some items," but things were supposedly back on track. Then, following the release of the game's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/crocs-switch-remaster-returns-this-week-with-a-free-platinum-edition-update">'Platinum Edition' update</a> last October, the company pushed things again to get the whole game complete on cartridge — "the unavoidable consequence of this upgrade meant delays in the mastering, approval process and physical manufacture of the disc and cartridge with Sony and Nintendo respectively."</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067gimkwh&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>So, where does that leave things now? In a <a href="https://rockitgames.com/blogs/news/coc-legend-of-the-gobbos-january-2026-update">new blog post</a>, Rock It says that "the delays have been unacceptable," and that going forward, it will be committed to "only offering games once development is complete and our delivery timelines are fully under our control." But there's still no firm release date.</p>
<p>According to the post, the game disc and cartridges have now been approved for production by Sony and Nintendo, Platinum Edition update included, and much of the extra merch found in the beefy Collector's Editions is either complete or arriving in the warehouse by the end of the month.</p>
<p>The thing is, the production updates aren't consistent between posts — one month, items are complete and ready to go, the next, they're not. Mix-ups happen, of course, but those who dropped $129.99 on the Collector's Edition over a year ago are, rightly, after something a little more concrete.</p>

<p>"I have zero trust in Rock It Games because of this," one user wrote on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrocLegendoftheGobbos/">r/CrocLegendoftheGobbos</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrocLegendoftheGobbos/comments/1qfs5w9/argonaut_acknowledges_delays/">Reddit</a>, "If they would have just told the truth, and admitted things got screwed up, and didn't go to plan, I would have been disappointed, but understood." Others have been so frustrated with the process that they have already requested refunds.</p>
<p>"We’re confident that the regular and Collector’s Editions of Croc are coming soon," developer Argonaut Games said in an update post on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DTmH2B5FmHd/">Instagram</a>, "We’re as eager to receive them as all of our customers are!"</p>
<p>When exactly "soon" is remains to be seen, but hey, maybe 2026 will be the year!</p>

            <p>Ubisoft’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-and-more-cancelled-by-ubisoft-with-layoffs-potentially-on-the-horizon">bloodbath of game cancellations and restructuring</a> yesterday has attracted the expected fiery response from unionised workers, with the French game industry union Solidaires Informatique <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:gwmurecu4lbyaqjzsyv2orat/post/3mcxfxwczwk2z">calling a half-day strike today</a>. Cost-cutting and potential layoffs aside, the strikers are protesting against Ubisoft’s decision to mandate a full return to office, with workers given an annual allowance of work from home days instead - something a publisher executive has justified as a move “to enhance collective efficiency” and “the sense of belonging”.</p><!--more-->
<p>Ubisoft management’s latest bout of corpobutchery has seen them bin off six games, including the Prince Of Persia: The Sands Of Time remake, delay seven others, and confirm the closure of Ubisoft Stockholm. </p>
<p>More layoffs will follow, though Ubisoft have yet to share any precise numbers. It’s all part of the company’s Age of Sigmar-esque transformation into a collection of “Creative Houses” <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-hand-ubisoft-a-big-wad-of-cash-to-spin-out-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-as-a-separate-business">with heavy investment from Tencent</a>, dedicated to a smaller number of hopefully better-selling games – in particular, open world and live service projects, with generative AI dutifully touted as a means of boosting production.</p>
<p>As part of this transition, Ubisoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-close-the-studio-behind-assassins-creed-rebellion-days-after-the-developers-vote-to-unionise">recently shuttered Ubisoft Halifax</a> (a few weeks after the studio voted to unionise – no connection, they insist) and announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/having-asked-division-devs-to-lay-themselves-off-ubisoft-are-now-cutting-55-jobs-at-massive-and-ubisoft-stockholm">layoffs at Tom Clancy’s The Division developers Massive</a>.</p>
<p>In a statement, Solidaires Informatique describe today’s strike as "an initial response to the absurdity of management decisions”, with more action probably to follow. "It is out of the question to let a boss run rampant and destroy our working conditions,” they write, addressing Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot. “Perhaps he needs to be reminded that it is his employees who make the games." The union are also calling for “decent pay rises this year” and “maintaining and extending the teleworking conditions”.</p>
<p>RTO policies are frequently the focus of union action. In October 2024, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/700-ubisoft-staff-in-france-hold-strikes-in-response-to-worldwide-return-to-office-mandate-from-assassins-creed-publisher">700 Ubisoft staff went on strike</a> over a requirement to work in-office three days a week. </p>
<p>Detractors of remote working argue that it’s less efficient and hinders teamwork. As Ubisoft’s senior vice-president of studio operations Marie-Sophie de Waubert told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/we-want-them-to-be-the-best-in-the-world-in-every-segment-were-in-ubisofts-vision-for-its-new-creative-houses">GamesIndustry</a> yesterday, “the one and only objective [for the new RTO policy] is to enhance collective efficiency, to drive the dynamics, the creativity, the sense of belonging.”</p><p>Advocates for remote working argue that it doesn’t materially affect how much workers contribute, and that it can be vital for people with disabilities, family commitments and other practical challenges that make commuting or sharing office space unfeasible. When EA implemented a partial return to the office in May last year, anonymous staff <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-employees-upset-and-confused-at-return-to-office-mandate">offered</a> childcare, medical conditions, and long commutes as reasons for needing an exemption from in-office work.</p>
<p>Advocates for remote working also argue that forbidding hybrid or full remote-working is a “soft layoff” strategy, since some remote workers may have no choice but to move on. That was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/following-mass-layoffs-microsoft-exec-insists-return-to-office-mandate-is-not-about-reducing-headcount">the claim levelled at Microsoft last September</a>, when they imposed a return to the office following thousands of layoffs.</p>
<p>I am very much Team Homeworking, inasmuch as I couldn’t do this job if I had to work in-office 9-5. In general, I think RTO mandates reflect an unexamined belief among managers that people become shirkers and layabouts unless they're kept firmly inside the panopticon.</p>
<p>Arguments continue about RTO beyond Ubisoft. Rockstar’s recent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-reportedly-orders-gta-6-developers-to-end-hybrid-working-in-the-name-of-quality-and-polish">implementation of RTO in the name of “quality and polish”</a> is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-this-from-happening-again-uk-politician-calls-out-rockstar-over-gta-6-developer-firings">one of the reasons some GTA 6 workers chose to unionise</a>, shortly before Rockstar laid off a number of workers for “gross misconduct”, in what British unions have called a case of “union-busting”.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-shares-crash-by-30-after-restructure-news/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ubisoft’s shares have plummeted by over 30% today after news of a major restructuring broke. </p>



<p>Ubisoft recently announced a significant restructuring that will focus on a new operating model emphasizing&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisofts-new-model-will-focus-on-open-world-adventures-and-gaas-native-experiences/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open-world adventures and games-as-a-service (GaaS) experiences</a>. This news has evidently affected the company’s stock, leading to a considerable drop in share value today.</p>











<p>As revealed on <a href="https://www.google.com/finance/beta/quote/UBI:EPA?sa=X&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjyk4Gd_56SAxVsXmwGHf2pLt8Q3ecFKAN6BAghEAQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Google Finance</a>, Ubisoft’s shares have decreased by 33.78% today (as of the time of writing). The day began with a share price of 5.26 EUR, which has now fallen to 4.44 EUR. Over the past six months, the shares have declined by more than 50%.</p>



<p>The drop comes immediately after the announcement of an organizational, operational, and portfolio reset, which led to the cancellation of highly anticipated titles like the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prince of Persia Remake</a>, among others. The restructuring has also led to the closure of multiple studios and layoffs across the organization. </p>



<p>Ubisoft’s new operating model now features a decentralised structure with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisofts-new-operation-model-features-5-creative-houses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">5 Creative Houses</a>, each divided by distinctive genres. The goal is to make the company “a more gamer-centric organization, structured around creative genres.”</p>



<p>Additionally, their new model will be supported by targeted investments, deeper specialization, and cutting-edge technology, which includes “accelerated investments in player-facing Generative AI.”</p>







<p>In other news, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-beyond-good-evil-2-survives-ubisofts-project-purge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming’s exclusive report</a> reveals that Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 has survived the latest round of project cancellations. Additionally, the restructure has likely led to the Black Flag remake being <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-flag-remake-delayed-by-up-to-one-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed by up to one year</a>.

            <p>Nintendo has released a free update for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, which adds team races to its chaotic Knockout Tour mode.</p>
<p>In Knockout Tour, players race to not just win, but to stay in the game at all. If you fail to reach a checkpoint ahead of a set number of others, you will be - as the name suggests - knocked out of the running.</p>

<p>So, how does this new team-based Knockout Tour actually work in practice? Well, it's still going to have 24 racers, but up to four teams can now take part. What this means is that you can expect to see a 12v12 race, an 8v8v8 race, or a 6v6v6v6 race. If you don't have enough players to fill all the spots, then CPU characters pop in.</p><p>The winner at the end of this flavour of Knockout race is then determined not by who finishes first, but by the total points tally of every member in the team. Points are awarded based on the overall placement of each driver on the team, 50 points for first place, 40 for second, 35 for third and 30 for fourth place. Meanwhile, those who finish towards the end of the pack get less points, with the four drivers who fail to make it past the first checkpoint only getting a scant one point to their names.</p>
<p>So, even if you are an absolute racing super star, and make it to that shiny first place spot, your team may overall still fail to claim victory. Meanwhile, if you happen to be knocked out from the race earlier than you may have liked, you can then watch from the sidelines to spur your team mates on.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[‘It’s Our Most Ambitious Game by a Factor of 10’, Says inXile CEO of Clockwork Revolution]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/clockwork-revolution-is-inxiles-most-ambitious-game-by-factor-10/</link>
            <guid>1412806</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It's been over half a year since we had any update from developer <strong>inXile</strong> on their next game, the steampunk RPG <strong>Clockwork Revolution</strong>. Following a new trailer <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-clockwork-revolution-trailer-revealed-during-xbox-games-showcase-will-launch-on-pc-and-consoles-in-due-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shown at the 2025 <strong>Xbox Game Showcase</strong></a> in June, inXile founder and CEO <strong>Brian Fargo</strong> had claimed the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/clockwork-revolution-features-truly-evil-conversation-options-and-multi-person-dialogues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">would feature 'truly evil' options for players and multi-person dialogues</a>.</p>



<p>Now, Fargo has been featured <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/clockwork-revolution-could-be-the-most-expressive-xbox-rpg-in-years-with-inxile-aiming-to-bring-the-level-of-reactivity-from-our-isometric-titles-into-something-first-person/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a new interview published by GamesRadar</a> in which he described Clockwork Revolution as <strong>the studio's most ambitious game</strong> 'probably by a factor of 10', on account of them trying to translate the level of interactivity usually seen in isometric games into a first-person action RPG.</p>



<p>Elsewhere in the interview, Fargo once again stressed the importance of building truly alternative options for players to choose, even if that means creating more content that can be seen in a single playthrough.</p>



<p><em>For me, roleplaying means I can play a role and actually affect the world around me. If all paths lead to the same outcome, the immersion breaks, and you start to feel like you're just playing a game rather than living in one. But when the world is constantly reacting and reflecting your choices, both in big ways and just as importantly in small ways, that's when immersion really sets in.</em></p>



<p><em>We probably build roughly 30% more content than what any player could see in a single playthrough. We want players to be able to approach the game as a different archetype, whether you want to be good, evil, or something in between. Here's what's really important to us: if you don't allow the player to be bad, to really go down those rabbit holes and see the consequences play out, then they never had free will to be good in the first place. They're not choosing to be good, they're just being forced down a path. We think it's essential that players are making that choice, not having it made for them. We also have a very dark sense of humor, which makes all of it even more fun.</em></p>



<p>Clockwork Revolution <a href="https://wccftech.com/clockwork-revolution-is-inxiles-first-person-steampunk-rpg-game-is-still-early-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was first showcased during the 2023 Xbox Games Showcase</a>. The game doesn't have a release date, so unless Microsoft and inXile are secretly planning a late 2026 launch, we're probably going to have to wait until 2027 to play it. As a reminder, inXile's previous game, <strong>Wasteland 3</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wasteland-3-nothing-without-providence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was released in August 2020</a>. </p>



<p>The game is currently announced for <strong>PC</strong> and <strong>Xbox Series S</strong> and <strong>X</strong>, although given Microsoft's multiplatform policy, it's only a matter of time before it eventually lands on <strong>PlayStation 5</strong>, too.</p>

            <p>With their latest Fallout modathon having wrapped up at the close of last year, mod-hosting site Nexus Mods have decided to try something new with their latest event designed to supercharge mod creation around a specific game or theme. Rather than asking folks to submit fresh individual mods like usual, the modathon that's about to kick off is all about putting together chunky multi-mod lists which can overhaul a game in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>These user-assembled modlists, dubbed Collections, are a feature Nexus Mods have been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-4s-anniversary-update-didnt-quite-land-with-the-impact-many-hoped-for-so-nexus-mods-have-assembled-their-own">pushing</a> for a number of years now, so it's not surprising they're now serving as the subject of a modathon for the first time.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Set to run from January 26th to February 8th, the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout-collectionathon">first "Collectionathon"</a> is a Fallout-themed one, with season two of a certain radioactive TV show putting out the remainder of its weekly episodes in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>"We want to see you reimagine the Wasteland in bold new ways, whether that’s by taking one of your favourite games from the series and amping it up or by bringing the world of Fallout to a brand new title," reads the brief from the nexus of modders. "Through survival overhauls, lore-friendly refreshes, or wild experiments, we want to see it all, and whatever your idea, we can’t wait to see your creativity in action!"</p><p>If you fancy getting involved, you'll need to do so via Vortex, Nexus Mods' Windows-only mod manager. As a bit of extra context, Vortex is now the only mod manager the mod hosts are working on, with them having <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15424">announced plans to can development of a multiplatform Nexus Mods App</a> earlier this month. Central to the pitch behind that app was the idea it'd work on the likes of the Steam Deck and PCs running Linux. Though, Nexus Mods haven't totally ruled out that functionality potentially making its way to Vortex further down the line.</p>
<p>"We’re also exploring what Linux support might look like for Vortex in the future," Nexus mods owner Victor Folmann wrote in a post about the decision. "While getting every game and mod working on Linux might not be possible, it’s an area we want to keep evaluating where it makes sense."</p>
<p>While I can see the appeal of curated modlists designed for folks to be able to install in one click, having dabbled a bit with Vortex during my early modding days, I can't say I've ever given one of these collections a proper go. I momentarily considered it when setting up my last <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> run, but instead chose simply to install manually so I could stick exclusively to mods I wanted and regularly pause to check everything was working as intended as my load order grew.</p>
<p>To be fair, I was benefitting from years worth of built-up knowledge in terms of mod installation and what's out there Cyberpunk mod-wise, so I might simply not be in main target audience for collections at this point. Still, it's a lot of faith to be putting in the people who curate such lists to keep them up to date and regularly tested. Then again, that's arguably the same sort of trust you have to put in mod creators anyway, if you're installing works one-by-one.</p>
<p>As of writing, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a>'s already got just over <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/games/fallout4/collections?sort=downloads">2,200 collections</a>, while <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">New Vegas</a> <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/games/newvegas/collections">has 961</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-3">Fallout 3</a> <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/games/fallout3/collections">99</a>. We'll have to see what sort of boost this collection jam gives to those numbers.</p>

<p>The world of Hytale continues to get bigger and better, pushed by regular updates from Hypixel Studios and modders around the world, the latter of whom have revealed work on a significant collab.</p>



<p>Along with the reveal of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-update-2-patch-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">second major update</a> following Hytale’s early access launch, modders have revealed some early work of plans to bring Pokémon into the game, and it looks fantastic.</p>







<h2 id="h-hytale-modders-adding-pokemon">Hytale Modders Adding Pokémon</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Gotta catch ’em all. Image via Pokefind on X</figcaption></figure>



<p>A teaser showcase of completed work from the Pokéfind team was <a href="https://x.com/PokeFindMC/status/2013976180232192067" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted on X</a>, revealing models for the Kanto starters and their complete evolution lines, featuring the likes of Blastoise, Charizard, Squirtle, and Bulbasaur.</p>



<p>Pokéfind has already found a home in Minecraft, offering a variety of experiences, including a Pokémon Survival mode, a custom-built Pokémon region, Pokémon Skyblock, and Pokéwars, and the plans are to offer similar experiences in Hytale.</p>



<p>The social media post stated the team behind the mod is “beyond excited” to bring Pokéfind into Hytale, teasing that “big updates” are coming.</p>



<p>No timeline has been shared for when players will be able to jump into the game, and, due to licensing, it’s unlikely the mod will be available on official channels like Curseforge. Instead, additional steps are likely to be required to access the game.</p>



<p>Pokéfind is easy to play on Minecraft, however, so there shouldn’t be any issues for players jumping into the mod when it is made available, and you can keep an eye on the team’s progression in development by following the social media account.</p>

<p>Hypergryph has revealed that Arknights Endfield’s PayPal channel is undergoing maintenance, as reports about hacks have started emerging from players. </p>



<p>The latest free-to-play, sci-fi gacha, action RPG by Hypergryph and Gryphline, Arknights Endfield, released today for PlayStation 5, PC, and mobile devices. However, it seems a significant issue has arisen on launch day, with players complaining that their PayPal accounts are being used to make unauthorised purchases. </p>











<p>Players across <a href="https://x.com/Unreal_Dreamer/status/2014193328430952555" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) are reporting hacks involving PayPal purchases in Arknights: Endfield. A user named <a href="https://x.com/Naruvt0/status/2014217652751983045" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Naru</a> has shared information about unauthorized transactions made on a victim’s PayPal account, all linked to Gryph Frontier PTE. LTD. The charges appear in multiple currencies, including USD, JPY, CAD, and EURO, and victims are being charged multiple times for a single purchase.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The official Arknights Endfield <a href="https://x.com/AKEndfield/status/2014188503891099888" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account has announced that they are currently conducting temporary maintenance on the PayPal payment channel due to reports of issues. Players are advised to use alternative payment methods during this time. The account has also stated that “transactions involving abnormal item delivery or payment deductions will be addressed accordingly.” However, many players in the comments are still expressing concerns about unauthorized purchases.</p>

            <p>In a new interview, Gears of War E-Day creative director Matt Searcy has peeled back the curtain a little on the upcoming prequel to everyone's favourite gory third-person shooter. Namely, that by returning to Emergence Day the original series' vibes will return.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/gears-of-war/with-gears-of-war-e-day-recapturing-the-tone-and-vibes-of-the-original-games-the-coalition-believes-its-upcoming-prequel-has-the-potential-to-be-one-of-the-best-stories-in-the-gears-franchise/">Speaking to GamesRadar +</a>, Searcy spoke at length about what returning to a core moment in Gears history allowed the team to explore: ""This is the story we were excited to tell and so the process has been super energizing. There are touchpoints in the lore for us to build from, but enough room that we get to bring new elements and ideas in.</p>
<p>Searcy elaborates: "Getting to go back to the tone and vibes of the original games, exploring the details of Emergence, and imagining what would happen to a city (and the soldiers protecting it) as monsters poured out from the ground was a great starting point to reintroduce the Locust and these characters"</p>

<p>The game, which will be set in the city of Kalona over the course of a few consecutive days, will focus heavily on the shock of Locust forces popping up and causing havoc for the first time. According to Searcy, it'll be quite an emotionally charged experience as well as an action-packed one.</p>
<p>"Our story is set over consecutive days so that players can become intimate with the city," Searcy states.  "We want them to feel the loss of what was here: the history, the people, and the lives they were living.</p>
<p>"We think it has the potential to be one of the best stories in the Gears franchise, and certainly the most heart and emotion when you're looking at Marcus, Dom, and the origin of the brotherhood that they forge in this game."</p>

<p>Described as an 'interactive Pokémon experience' that will "stimulate all five senses", the attraction will debut at Universal Studios Japan in Osaka before being rolled out globally. This presumably includes parks in Orlando and Los Angeles in the US along with Singapore and Beijing.</p>
<p>Tsunekazu Ishihara, President and CEO of The Pokémon Company, had the following to say:</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22flyihwp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>"Since announcing our medium- to long-term alliance in 2021, we have collaborated with Universal Studios Japan's outstanding creative vision and world-class technical capabilities to produce a variety of 'real-life Pokémon experiences,' including the NO LIMIT! Parade and Halloween show.</p>
<p>"This year marks the 30th anniversary of Pokémon, and we are extremely pleased to be able to fully launch this new project with you all at this major milestone. Our mission is to enrich both the real and virtual worlds through the existence of Pokémon, and we produce Pokémon every day. With this project, too, we hope to create new entertainment that is unique to theme parks, as a rich experience in the real world, and continue to provide surprises to people all over the world."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's no time scale as to when the attraction will launch, but those in Japan can at least look forward to the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/pokepark-kanto-the-new-pokemon-theme-park-opens-its-doors-in-february">opening of Poké Park Kanto</a> at Tokyo's Yomiuriland Amusement Park on <strong>5th February 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we'll keep an eye out any further developments regarding the new Pokémon attraction at Universal Studios. If nothing else, we're expecting to see lots and lots (and <em>lots</em>) of new merch.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Up until launch, there’s been a mystery surrounding Highguard, but some of the best information surrounding the game came from an unlikely place. The full trophy list has been revealed for Highguard, and it looks like there’s going to be a lot to unpack. </p>



<p>When it was revealed as the final game at the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-devs-didnt-pay-for-game-awards-spot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2025 Game Awards</a>, it’s fair to say that people were underwhelmed to see another free-to-play hero-shooter. However, it’s been developed by some of the masterminds behind Apex Legends and Titanfall, so it deserves a fair chance in the spotlight.</p>







<p>If you’re planning on giving Highguard a chance, here’s the full <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-trophy-list-all-achievements-trophies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trophy list</a> you can work on completing during the raids. </p>



<h2 id="h-all-highguard-trophies-amp-achievements">All Highguard Trophies &amp; Achievements</h2>



<figure><figcaption>You’ll be doing a lot of shooting. Image via Steam.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Judging by the Trophy list, it doesn’t seem like you’ll need to sink an overwhelming amount of time into Highguard to 100% it. </strong></p>



<p>Considering it’s a multiplayer shooter, you’ll need to perform certain feats during an online match, but there’s nothing outrageous that demands an elite calibre of skill. A lot of them simply need you to complete matches—that shouldn’t be too hard, right?</p>







<p>That’s enough preamble, though. Here’s the complete Highguard Trophy list from start to finish.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Breach! Image via Steam.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Highguard has 33 PlayStation Trophies and 32 Xbox Achievements for you to earn.</strong></p>



<p>As usual, PlayStation has one extra Trophy thanks to its ever-coveted Platinum Trophy, which sadly aren’t available to you Xbox gamers out there. But there’s still a healthy batch of Achievements to grind towards, and none of them seem too intensive. Get them all done, and your Gamerscore should rise by a fair amount. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>You can’t sit still in Hytale before something else changes! Hytale’s founder promised constant improvements, and Update 2 brings new gameplay mechanics, dozens of fixes, and so much more in its January patch notes.</p>



<p>Hytale’s popularity remains strong in its early weeks. This is being helped by the game’s frequent updates and patch notes. Initial changes included adding <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-to-find-dinosaurs-hytale-location/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dinosaurs</a>, for example. Hytale Update 2 is another fairly hefty proposition, and there’s much to look forward to and discuss.</p>







<h2 id="h-hytale-update-2-release-date">Hytale Update 2 Release Date</h2>



<p><strong>Hytale founder Simon Collins-Laflamme has said Update 2 is arriving “this weekend,” which means it’ll drop between January 23 and January 25.</strong></p>



<p>To add to this, he’s already confirmed that “Update 3 is already in the works,” and the grind never stops!”<a href="https://hytale.fandom.com/wiki/Simon_Collins-Laflamme#articleComments"></a></p>



<h2 id="h-biggest-changes-in-hytale-update-2">Biggest Changes In Hytale Update 2</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Hunt down the void. Image via Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Pickaxe progression and Mining have been reworked, and new Magic is being added to Hytale, along with a host of cosmetic and customization changes. There are also tons of gameplay fixes, balance tweaks, and overall QOL improvements across visual and audio.</strong></p>



<p>It’s a fairly meaty update that targets all aspects of Hytale. Obviously, the standout aspects of Update 2 are the physical gameplay flourishes. New magic will sharpen up and broaden the action, making it even more fun.</p>



<p>Collins-Laflamme recently revealed he <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-founder-unhappy-with-games-mining-outlines-thousands-of-improvements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wasn’t happy with the state of the game’s Mining</a>, which is why it’s not a surprise to see how it’s been changed in Update 2: “Pickaxe progression reworked: mining speed now scales with pickaxe quality.”</p>



<h2 id="h-all-hytale-update-2-patch-notes">All Hytale Update 2 Patch Notes</h2>

<p>Highguard’s Trophy List has surfaced online, revealing the most information about the game we have received yet, including mechanics, game modes, and more.</p>



<p>The upcoming free-to-play, PvP raid shooter by Wildlight Entertainment, Highguard, was revealed during <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2026</a>, with a brand new flashy trailer. However, since then, the game’s marketing has been almost nonexistent, with virtually no information revealed 4 days before its release. Interestingly, the Highguard Trophy List is doing the job for them. </p>







<h2 id="h-highguard-trophy-list-reveals-brand-new-details">Highguard Trophy List Reveals Brand New Details </h2>



<p>There is a wealth of information contained in Highguard’s Trophy List, which was discovered on <a href="https://www.exophase.com/game/highguard-psn/trophies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Exophase</a>. This list covers various aspects of the game, including mechanics, game systems, characters, and more. It mentions features such as Shieldbreakers, Domesplitter, Revivals, Enemy Orbs, Wall Breaking, and Generators. Additionally, the list includes the names of certain weapons, like the BigRig LMG. Furthermore, it highlights other items, including chests, Rare &amp; Legendary items, and more.</p>



<p>The trophy list also goes through all the different types of Wardens in the game, including Assault Warden, Defensive Warden, Recon Warden, Support Warden, and Destruction Warden. Interested readers can check out Insider Gaming’s Highguard Trophy guide <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/complete-highguard-trophy-list-how-to-get-all-achievements-trophies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. </p>



<p>Highguard has some big names attached to it, with the creators of Apex Legends and Titanfall working on the title. However, even though the game is set to release on January 26, 2026, the game’s official YouTube channel has just one video: the reveal trailer shown at The Game Awards. Players have been waiting for more information on the title, but it seems the trophy list might have to suffice until release. </p>







<p>In other news, Highguard developers did not pay for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-devs-didnt-pay-for-game-awards-spot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the spot at The Game Awards finale</a>. Additionally, some players suspect that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-dead-on-arrival-gamers-fear-a-flop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">title could flop</a>.

<p>The next star of Fortnite Festival may have been uncovered by dataminers, suggesting that the Pink Pony Club could be on it’s way to the game.</p>



<p>Season 12 in Fortnite, starring LISA, is heading toward a conclusion, having been in the game since November 2025, and the end date of February 5 is right around the corner. Now, it appears her successor has been uncovered.</p>







<h2 id="h-chappell-roan-potentially-coming-to-fortnite">Chappell Roan Potentially Coming to Fortnite</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Pink Pony Club. Image via Itsmeleaky on X</figcaption></figure>



<p>Hints that Chappel Roan is coming to Fortnite have been uncovered by <a href="https://x.com/itsmeleaky/status/2014267037674013053" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Itsmeleaky on X</a>, who uncovered items in the games files that hint towards the pop star entering the fray.</p>



<p>A microphone and drumset have been discovered in Fortnite’s files, but the biggest hint ofall comes from a significant makeover to the beloved Fortnite llama, which appears to have been inducted into the Pink Pony Club.</p>



<p>The design of the llama looks extremely close to the horse that Chappel Roan has utilized in her concerts around the world, and is therefore a direct hint at the collab.</p>



<p>However, <a href="https://x.com/SpushFNBR/status/2014267385348284507" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SpushFNBR</a>, who shared the image, added that the collab was not confirmed, and, while the items were found in files, the headliner for the next season of Fortnite Festival could be changed.</p>



<p>If Chappell Roan were to star as the headliner of the next Fortnite Festival season, she would add to the library of Jam Tracks in the game, which already includes hits The Giver, Hot to Go, and Good Luck, Babe!</p>







<hr>



<p>Would Chappell Roan be a good choice for the headliner in the next Fortnite Festival season? Share your thoughts in the Insider Gaming Discord.</p>

            <p>Ubisoft's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake</a> studio has shared a statement following its game's shock cancellation.</p>
<p>Last night, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-troubled-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-dead-as-publisher-kills-multiple-projects-closes-studios-and-orders-staff-back-to-the-office">Ubisoft announced a "major organisational, operational and portfolio reset"</a>, which saw the company delay seven unspecified projects, close two studios and cancel multiple games. One such game was its Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-details-whats-new-in-its-prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake">unveiled in 2020</a>, and had suffered numerous delays and setbacks since. Then, this week, came the final nail in the coffin.</p>

<p>The team behind Prince of Persia's embattled remake has now shared a few words of its own. Here, the studio acknowledged the cancellation was "deeply disappointing" for fans as well as the development team, however this "does not mean [its] stepping away from the franchise" for good.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/princeofpersia/status/2014018590396105121/photo/1">social media post</a>, Ubisoft's Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake studio wrote: "The game holds enormous meaning for fans and for the teams who worked on it.</p>
<p>"While the project had real potential, we weren't able to reach the level of quality you deserve, and continuing would have required more time and investment than we could reasonably commit. And, we didn't want to release something that fell short of what The Sands of Time represents."</p><p>It stated Prince of Persia "as a universe and a legacy" is still important to the studio, and Sands of Time's cancellation does not mean this is the end for the franchise as a whole. Closing, Ubisoft's studio thanked the community for its "passion, patience and love for Prince of Persia".</p>

<p>Many were surprised to learn Ubisoft was pulling the plug on its Sands of Time remake. Recent reports from the company had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/five-years-later-ubisofts-much-delayed-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-gets-the-closest-thing-to-a-release-date-yet">the game slated for release during"Q4" of its current financial year</a>, which comes to an end on 31st March. So, in just a couple of months.</p>
<p>In June of last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-five-tumultuous-years-ubisoft-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-now-deep-in-development">the Sands of Time remake was said to be "deep in development"</a>, after the project moved from its original developers Ubisoft Pune and Mumbai to Ubisoft Montreal, where it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/three-years-on-ubisofts-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-still-in-the-conception-phase">seemingly rebooted from scratch</a>.</p>

			<p>In September 2025, insider <strong>Nate the Hate</strong> (who just won the <strong>'Leaker of the Year'</strong> award as voted by Reddit's GamingLeaksAndRumors) <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-rumored-launch-2026-xbox-series-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared the rumor</a> that <strong>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</strong>, the second installment in the Final Fantasy VII remake trilogy, would launch this year on Microsoft's Xbox Series S and X and Nintendo Switch 2. It seems <strong>Square Enix</strong>'s plan in this regard hasn't changed, at least according to the insider, who <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/2013735117735313739" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed it on X</a> in response to a follower's question.</p>



<p>If true, it would mean that Xbox and Nintendo gamers are getting both released games in the trilogy in the same year. The first one, <strong>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</strong>, is launching today on both platforms. Last month, the publisher <a href="https://wccftech.com/this-is-an-incredible-port-final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-nintendo-switch-2-demo-leaves-community-stunned-with-near-ps5-visual-fidelity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released a free demo</a> that stunned gamers particularly for its great visuals and performance on the Nintendo Switch 2, which <strong>almost looked on par with the PlayStation 5 version</strong>. The developer had previously also <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-s-actually-solid-spec-wise-ffvii-remake-developer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spoken well of the Xbox Series S</a>, saying they had no problem porting FFVII Remake Integrade to the platform, except for a few memory-related challenges. </p>



<p><strong>Porting Final Fantasy VII Rebirth will undoubtedly be more challenging</strong>, though, especially for the Xbox Series S and Nintendo Switch 2. The more recent game has a far larger scope and open world-like environments that will be quite taxing on the CPU, unlike the first game's fairly linear maps. Because of this, a 2026 launch would be all the more impressive, provided it is decently optimized. For comparison, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-playable-steam-deck/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is playable on the Steam Deck</a>, but only with some major performance and graphics caveats.</p>



<p>Series aficionados are also waiting with bated breath for news about <strong>Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3</strong>. Last month, director <strong>Naoki Hamauguchi</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/were-almost-at-the-point-when-we-can-share-more-information-about-it-will-final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-be-announced-at-the-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teased</a> that it was almost time for its unveiling, and fans thought it would happen at The Game Awards 2025, but it didn't. That said, it could be shown at the next State of Play, whenever that will be. As with previous games, the game will likely launch on Sony's PlayStation 5 first.</p>

<p>Forza Horizon 6’s release date has been confirmed just hours before the upcoming Xbox Developer Direct, with the game releasing on May 19, 2026. </p>



<p>A little over a week ago, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/alleged-screenshot-reveals-forza-horizon-6-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">screenshot had appeared</a> revealing details about Playground Games’ upcoming title, Forza Horizon 6. The screenshot provides essential details, including the release date, early access information, and what you can get with the Premium Edition. Now, a reliable source has confirmed all of these details. </p>

<p>Forza Horizon 6’s standard edition has been priced at <strong>€69.99</strong> in Europe and <strong>$69.99</strong>&nbsp;in the United States. The game will also receive a physical release for the Xbox Series X; however, it will only be available for the Standard edition and will arrive on May 19, 2026, as well. Forza Horizon 6 pre-orders will start one hour after the Xbox Developer Direct today. </p>



<p>Moreover, the Premium Edition bonuses revealed in the earlier screenshot were accurate as well, with players receiving a VIP Membership, Welcome Pack, Car Pass, and Time Attack Car Pack. Additional packs will also be released post-launch. Details about the deluxe edition weren’t revealed. </p>

			<p>After an <a href="https://wccftech.com/physical-video-game-sales-hardware-sales-november-2025-lowest-in-the-us-since-november-1995/"><strong>extremely strong launch</strong> that carried it</a> to become <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-schedule-i-hollow-knight-silksong-battlefield-6-steam-best-selling-new-games-2025/">one of the <strong>best-selling games of 2025</strong></a>, <strong>Battlefield 6</strong> could not have gotten off to a worse start to 2026 than by <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-2-release-date-january-update-ea/">delaying the arrival of Season 2.</a></strong> If you can't wait for the entire extra month it'll now take to arrive, then the clear answer is to do everything you can to get into <strong>Battlefield Labs</strong>, as <strong>EA</strong> announced that players participating in BF Labs will get to test out Season 2's new map, <strong>Contaminated</strong>, and everyone's favourite mini helicopter, <strong>Little Bird</strong>.</p>



<p>Those are just two of the main additions coming in Season 2 that BF Labs players will get their hands on first, as EA and <strong>Battlefield Studios</strong> continue to test and tweak things for the upcoming season. In <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/battlefield-6-community-update-battlefield-labs-season-2-testing-and-beyond">a blog post on the game's official website,</a> the BF Studios team outlined that the new map falls somewhere between the size of <strong>Eastwood</strong> and <strong>Mirak Valley</strong>. To give you a potentially better idea of how big it is, the team adds that it's "<em>comparable</em>" to maps like <strong>St. Quentin Scar</strong> from <strong>Battlefield 1</strong> or <strong>Arras</strong> from <strong>Battlefield V</strong>.</p>



<p>Contaminated and Little Bird are all that BF Labs players will be testing in the next session EA hosts, but the BF Studios team is quick to point out it'll be doing a lot more testing, and that future tests will be "<em>more exploratory</em>," including testing out different aircraft and vehicle systems. There are also adjustments to RPGs and vehicle interactions incoming, to potentially re-tune how vehicles can respond to RPGs and TOW launchers, and how those weapons impact vehicles.</p>



<p>There are other changes not outlined in the blog post that EA and BF Studios say will arrive in time for Season 2, and there are even more changes that won't arrive until after Season 2. Including the return of a <strong>Battlefield 4</strong> map that EA and BF Studios call a "<em>fan-favorite</em>" map: <strong>Golmud Railway</strong>.</p>



<p>"<em>Golmud Railway is being rebuilt for today’s Battlefield, not simply ported forward," </em>the blog post reads.<em> "Our goal is to preserve what made the map so memorable in Battlefield 4, particularly its combined arms gameplay, while improving how it plays and supports Battlefield 6 systems. Golmud is planned to be the largest Battlefield 6 map to date, giving us the opportunity to expand gameplay on a larger scale.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>We’re bringing Golmud into Battlefield Labs early as this will be a multi-session project. Through Labs, we want to test changes such as larger flight space, increased cover for aircraft, and other adjustments as the map evolves over time.</em>"</p>



<p>Lastly, EA and BF Studios did bring up the popular topic of a <strong>Solo Queue</strong> for its battle royale mode, <strong>REDSEC</strong>. While there's no indication that it'll be testing Solos in REDSEC anytime soon, the team is still testing it internally to help the team understand "<em>where Solo play can best fit within the broader battle royale roster, including how it affects match flow, survivability, and long-term engagement when featured alongside other battle royale experiences</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>These tests are part of our ongoing effort to make informed decisions about how Battle Royale is structured and presented over time, rather than committing to a single permanent configuration. Any future player-facing testing would be approached with the goal of learning and validation, and we’ll share more details ahead of time if and when those tests are planned.</em>"</p>



<p>Upsetting as it is that we'll have to wait longer than expected for the arrival of Season 2, it's at least good to know what EA and the BF Studios teams are looking to test in the meantime. Now that we're more than a few months into Battlefield 6 being in players' hands, it's also interesting and encouraging to see BF Studios lean on BF Labs like this, so that players get the chance to try out what's coming to the game, and provide feedback that could, realistically, help EA avoid a season so collectively hated that it kills any momentum the game had.</p>

<figure data-uuid="e27b95019ca98"><a title="Super Mario Galaxy Movie" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e27b95019ca98/super-mario-galaxy-movie.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo, Illumination</em></figcaption></figure><p>Similar to the Sonic movies, the Mario movies are expanding their big-screen universe by introducing and surprising audiences with more characters. Mario's companion Yoshi was teased at the end of the first movie, and since then, the official trailers for the <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-release-date-cast-trailers-everything-we-know-so-far">Super Mario Galaxy Movie</a></strong> have introduced Bowser Jr. and Rosalina.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/animation-movies/after-rosalina-and-bowser-jr-s-appearances-in-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-trailer-chris-pratt-hints-at-a-couple-more-character-surprises-people-should-be-excited/">GamesRadar+ recently</a>, Mario's movie voice actor Chris Pratt has apparently hinted there are at least "a couple more" characters not featured in the official trailers for the new movie that should excite fans. Here's the full exchange:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Oh, yes, there are," Pratt tells GamesRadar+ when we ask if there are any new characters he's looking forward to seeing in the finished film. "I'm not allowed to say what they are, but yes, there are some really incredible… Well, I think some of them have been released in the trailer – Rosalina, Bowser Jr. – and then there's even a couple more that are not in the trailer that people should be excited to see."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If Pratt is teasing a bigger cast of characters, there are plenty of friendly and not-so-friendly characters from the Mario video game universe that could pop up. One rumoured leak, <a href="https://gonintendo.com/contents/52847-rumor-more-characters-revealed-for-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie">dating back to last September</a>, has led to speculation that Wario could be making an appearance.</p>
<p>You can see the current cast for the Super Mario Galaxy Movie in our guide. Nintendo and Illumination have also confirmed Rosalina will be voiced by Brie Larson and Bowser Jr. will be played by Benny Safdie.</p>

			<p><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/arc-raiders-everything-we-know-about-the-latest-hot-extraction-shooter/">ARC Raiders</a></strong> is a new third-person extraction shooter from <strong>Embark Studios</strong>, the same team that brought you the fast-paced FPS <strong>The Finals</strong>. ARC Raiders was actually <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-a-free-to-play-coop-shooter-is-embarks-debut-game/">intended to be Embark's debut game</a> before the team decided <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-is-now-a-pvpve-extraction-shooter-closed-alpha-test-starts-this-summer/">to rework it entirely</a> and focus on The Finals first, a bet that seemingly paid off now that ARC Raiders is <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-sold-more-than-12-million-copies-neared-1-million-concurrent/">one of the most popular games on the market today since it arrived in October 2025</a>.</p>

<h2 id="h-gameplay-overview">Gameplay Overview</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ARC-Raiders-Overview-Hub-1-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>ARC Raiders will be familiar to extraction shooter fans, while still accessible for those new to the genre.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>If you've played an extraction shooter before, the core concepts of ARC Raiders will be familiar to you. You jump into a large, expansive map, scavenge for resources and materials, raid and take down enemy players, and extract back to Speranza, the underground city you and every other raider call home.</p>



<p>Beyond enemy players, you'll also have to be wary of ARCs, the hostile machines that are the cause of the dystopian nature of the world. There are several different kinds of ARCs, and you can find out more about them below in the 'Know Your ARCs' section.</p>



<p>You can also find out more about ARCs and the gameplay in ARC Raiders in our upcoming Tips and Tricks, First 5 Things to Do, and Most Annoying ARCs - And How to Deal With Them guides.</p>



<h2 id="h-getting-started">Getting Started</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ARC-Raiders-Overview-Hub-2-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>You'll hit the character creation screen after you complete the tutorial.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>When you first log into ARC Raiders, you'll go through a short tutorial that shows you a couple of gameplay basics, like how to move, shoot, breach doors, and search for resources. It's all very basic and seems to end very abruptly with one major lesson: you have to be aware of other Raiders. You learn this lesson when two unknown Raiders catch you by surprise, though, unlike in a regular match, because this is just the tutorial, you wake up after the screen fades to black and fades back in, and the tutorial continues.</p>



<p>From there, you continue until you reach an exit elevator and make your first trip to Speranza, the underground city that becomes your home. You'll be given what looks like a storage closet as your place to live, which you'll slowly build out into your ultimate post-apocalyptic home, and meet the first of the vendors you'll get quests and buy resources from.</p>

<h2 id="h-building-your-raider">Building Your Raider</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ARC-Raiders-Overview-Hub-3-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>Upgrading your stats and your gear is key to buildcrafting in ARC Raiders.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Creating the aesthetic of your character is, of course, a key part of the experience in any game. But what's really going to impact you in gameplay is your stats and what you take with you when you go up top. </p>



<p>You don't want to take anything with you that you would really regret losing, and you can't just keep rolling the dice with free loadouts. You need to figure out how to put a build together, particularly with where you put your early stats and what weapons you put stock in. </p>

<h2 id="h-speranza-overview">Speranza Overview</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ARC-Raiders-Overview-Hub-4-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>You've got to know how to navigate Speranza.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Speranza is your home base of operations in ARC Raiders. It's where you look at and upgrade your Raider's stats, change your loadout, your outfit - it's where you do everything.</p>



<p>You cycle through the main lobby screen, your Workshop, your Raider, the Traders, Decks, and the in-game Store with the left and right bumpers. Your inventory, however, is always available on its own dedicated button. If you don't know what that button is, look to the bottom left of your screen.</p>



<p>When you're in your inventory menu, make sure to pay attention to the '<strong>Actions'</strong> button. That's where you'll be able to decide on what to do with everything you find and store in your <strong>Stash</strong>. You also need to pay close attention to a small '<strong>Expand</strong>' option that sits just above your inventory stack. That's where you upgrade your Stash, so it can hold more things.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>An in-depth guide on how to make Speranza work for you in ARC Raiders will go live soon.</em></strong></p>

<h2 id="h-going-topside-and-coming-home">Going Topside and Coming Home</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ARC-Raiders-Overview-Hub-5-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>Going up is only half the job, you have to come home safely too.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Of course, you can't upgrade your Raider, your gear, build out your home in Speranza; you can't do anything, if you can't survive a raid. Once you choose where to go, when you arrive you'll have approximately 30 minutes to grab what you can and make it back to an elevator to reach Speranza safely.</p>



<p>Each map will have multiple options for elevators or other ways back home, but they won't all be open to you for the whole match. One will remain available the entire time, but if you want the safest route home, you'll need to make it to an elevator in time.</p>

<p>You should always be on the lookout for other players. Even with the reputation ARC Raiders has gained where plenty of players choose to play a more passive, PvE style, they're technically always a danger. But ARCs, the robots that stalk every inch of the map, those are the biggest danger of all.</p>



<p>That's why it's important to know your enemy; not just how to defeat it, but how to avoid it, and how to ensure you're always making it back home.</p>

<figure data-uuid="c7c6076c5421f"><a title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c7c6076c5421f/pokemon-legends-z-a.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> has received its first update of the year today for the Switch and Switch 2. When you download it, your copy will be updated to Version 2.0.1.</p>
<p>It focuses on some adjustments for obtaining certain items (including an increase to the maximum number of Mega Shards) and also applies a whole bunch of fixes to previously confirmed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_legends_z-a_mega_dimension">Mega Dimension</a> expansion issues. You can read more about this in a <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/71193/kw/pokemon%20legends%20z-a%202.0.1">separate post</a> on Nintendo's support site.</p>
<p>Here's the rundown of this latest update:</p>
<h2>Pokémon Legends: Z-A: Ver. 2.0.1 (Released January 21, 2026)</h2>
<p><strong>Adjustments Applied for Obtaining Items:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>When purchasing Berries from a food stall, you can now purchase multiple Berries at once.</em></li>
<li><em>After beginning the story of the Pokémon Legends: Z-A – Mega Dimension DLC, you will be able purchase Berries from the clerk at Nouveau Café’s Truck No. 3.</em></li>
<li><em>The maximum number of Mega Shards you can carry has been increased from 999 to 9,999.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fixes Applied for the Following Confirmed Issues Related to <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A – Mega Dimension</em> Content:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>When using moves in certain pockets of hyperspace, Pokémon may sometimes have faced a different direction from the intended target.</em></li>
<li><em>There were cases in which the weather remained sunny and did not change.</em></li>
<li><em>Shiny Pokémon obtained prior to the release of Pokémon Legends: Z-A – Mega Dimension may not have been registered to the Mega Evolution Pokédex, even if their Mega Stones were obtained after becoming available in the DLC.</em></li>
<li><em>During missions, images from unrelated scenes may occasionally have been displayed.</em></li>
<li><em>Players may not have been able to complete side mission 188 “Start Special Scanning!” even after earning the maximum number of survey points. (Players who are already experiencing this issue should be able to progress after entering and exiting hyperspace.)</em></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>In case you missed it, the Mega Dimension expansion DLC for Pokémon Legends: Z-A released at the end of last year. Unfortunately, it didn't exactly live up to our expectations here at Nintendo Life, with repetitive Hyperspace dimensions and bland level design, but it's hard to resist the lure of an expanded Pokédex.</p>
<p>You can find out what else we had to say about it in our full review:</p>

<p>Nintendo has also released new updates for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> today, and yesterday rolled out a surprise update for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/donkey_kong_country_returns_hd">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</a>.</p>
