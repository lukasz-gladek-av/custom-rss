            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/last-of-us-season-2-episode-1-review-welcome-back-to-apocalypse<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HBO's <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4bf991e9-1624-48e4-90de-202719d86a32" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/how-hbo-last-of-us-episode-1-adapt-game" rel="nofollow"><em>The Last of Us</em></a> was an incredible achievement for was a very spotty history of video-game-to-TV adaptations. It managed to convey the tense tones of the fungal apocalypse with the heartbreak of our protagonists for those they they loved, and the eventual repairing of those breaks with what they found. Season 2 has just begun, and we're excited to see how this quality can be maintained as they move into the storyline of <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>.</p>

<p>Ahead of the premiere, TechRaptor was lucky enough to watch <em>The Last of Us</em>&nbsp;season 2 Eeisode 1. <strong>Keep in mind there will be some spoilers for the episode below as well as <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="feb0b551-7fe5-4f74-9986-717a95c8865c" href="https://techraptor.net/games/last-of-us-part-ii" rel="nofollow"><em>The Last of Us Part II</em></a></strong>.</p>

<p>Season 2 opens with a reminder of the status quo at the end of the first. We see the final exchange between Joel and Ellie, her making him swear that what he said about the Fireflies was true, before we get to see a funeral scene attended by the surviving Fireflies and our introduction to Abby, played by Kaitlyn Dever, and her vendetta against Joel.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Slowly… [...] When we kill him, we kill him slowly" - Abby</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This short opening sequence does a great job of reminding viewers where we were when we left off from season one, while setting up important characters for this next leg of the journey before jumping ahead five years into the future.</p>

<p>The rest of the episode is set largely in the city in Wyoming, catching the viewer up on where everyone is in life, what the current status of relations are, and showing that in this post-apocalyptic world it is possible to live a relatively normal life.</p>

<p>Here we get to see Joel going about as City Planner, working to fix up new houses for settlers who need a place to stay or fixing breakers by hand.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The largest change in these five years has been the relationship between Joel and Ellie. In season one, the father/daughter dynamic grew when they needed to rely on one another for protection. They still have that father/daughter relationship but with Joel helicoptering (probably a side effect of the horrific way he lost his first daughter) and Ellie coming out of being a teenager and wanting to be seen as an adult she tries to distance herself.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed that even while their scenes together were tense--and who couldn't feel for Pedro Pascal's brooding expressions--that they felt very real and very normal for an otherwise not-normal world.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-last-of-us-season-2-ellie-workshop.jpg?itok=LFmVRiac 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-last-of-us-season-2-ellie-workshop.jpg?itok=YjR0KJXv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ellie dilligently cleaning her weapons in the garage.</figcaption></figure><p>These 'normal' moments also do some heavy lifting to set up narrative flags, but we know that for there to be a season, there has to be conflict--even if you haven't played the games--so you can feel that these happier moments are being set up to be reflected back upon.</p>

<p>Ellie's rebellion continues on a raid where she and Dina, played by Isabela Merced, take out some clickers in an abandoned building. This character, who was teased in season 1, is Ellie's main love interest for the season and a confidant for her. We don't get to see too much other than their flirty banter, self-assuredness when taking out the infected, and their kiss, but I'm looking forward to seeing more of their relationship develop.</p>

<p>This scene also introduces the plotline of a talking infected. This is only lightly touched on, so I'm intrigued to see where this goes as the season continues.</p>

<h2>The Powerful Small Moments</h2>

<p>For a TV show about infected mushroom people and the collapse of society, my favorite scene in the episode wasn't about action or stealth but was when Joel went to visit his therapist, Gail played by Catherine O'Hara.</p>

<p>While paying for his session with a massive bag of weed, Joel is offered a drink. Gail, while remaining professional (aside from the drink) laments that this is her "first birthday without [her] husband in 41 years," a statement that makes Joel tense.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-last-of-us-season-2-joel-and-gail-therapist.jpg?itok=UsuKSzf4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-last-of-us-season-2-joel-and-gail-therapist.jpg?itok=z9tOT-XZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>O'Hara gives an amazing performance as Gail speaks her mind about how mundane Joel's problems are. She verbalizes her internal monologue of having to say the scary things, otherwise nothing will be done about them, and then an incredible delivery of why she hates Joel, how she's tried to forgive him, but that she also knows that she can't.</p>

<p>Those who have played the game know that the rest of the season is fueled by revenge--the revenge of Abby for the climactic finale of season 1, and then the retaliatory revenge of Ellie. To have a moment in episode one of someone taking the higher road, expressing their hatred and anger at another, and accepting that you can not forgive someone but also not want to retaliate back,is a perfect way to set up just how poorly every decision from here on out will be made.</p>

<p>When Gail then asks Joel to "say the thing you're afraid to say," the camera lingers on Joel as he responds to her questions, unable to answer and reveal that the world could have been healed. Then he stands up and defiantly states, "I saved her," and walks out.</p>

<p>I had chills watching Pascal as Joel, recognizing on his face that he knows what he did was for him, and not for her… and definitely not for the world.</p>

<p>There's a lot crammed into this episode. It doesn't exactly go anywhere, aside from knowing Abby's group is nearby. The plot doesn't move forward, but the episode does a great job to show where we are five years later.</p>

<p>We know where Joel and Ellie are at, we know Dina and her relationship with the major cast, and we know the plans and strategies of the settlement. We've been perfectly welcomed back into the world and caught up so that as things begin to go awry, we're ready to worry about our heroes (and villains).</p>

<p>I'm very excited for the continuation of this show. It makes sense that a game that many already described "as a movie" is being so wonderfully adapted for TV, but all of the little details and the stellar performances from the cast really elevate the show to be something not just for those who played the games, but for a wider audience.</p>

            <p>While PCs and smartphones will be exempt from Trump's retaliatory tariffs in the US, consoles will not.</p>
<p>That's according to former GamesIndustry.biz boss Chris Dring, who confirmed in his newsletter, <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/pcs-and-smartphones-exempt-from-trump">The Game Business</a>, that not only could Nintendo's upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 console be impacted by the tariffs, but so too will PlayStation and Xbox's hardware.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, it's unclear if the exemptions for other tech components like SSDs and PCs were intentionally not applied to consoles or if it's merely an oversight. On the plus side, it looks as though Nintendo Switch cartridges will be spared the extra 125% levy.</p>
<p>Nintendo had already directed the vast majority of its Switch 2 manufacturing output <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-already-shipped-over-1m-vietnam-made-consoles-to-us-this-year-as-switch-2-launch-threatened-by-tariffs">from Vietnam towards the US over the first two months of this year</a>, as the threat of Trump's now-confirmed tariffs loomed, but the stinging tariffs applied to Vietnam - a key manufacturer for Nintendo - and China continue to cause considerable uncertainty.</p>
<p>This may also have the ripple effect of piting Asian players against US game studios.</p>
<p>"It is not far-fetched to think that even if 'a deal is struck' for tariffs and other issues between the US and China, Chinese consumers would protest the economic uncertainty by avoiding US products and even by avoiding US technology and games," said Lisa Hanson, CEO at <a href="https://nikopartners.com/nikos-opinion-on-tariffs-video-games-and-us-china-trade/">Niko Partners</a>.</p>
<p>"In fact, Chinese social media already has consumer discourse about a consumer-led rebuke against US-products. The same could become true in Vietnam, Japan, South Korea, Thailand and so many other countries. Chinese regulators could very well block US games from ISBNs, and may even take a closer look at blocking Steam International, which is currently a major part of China’s gaming ecosystem despite officially illegally operating."</p>
<p>Earlier this month, US trade group <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/trump-tariffs-will-have-a-real-and-detrimental-impact-on-games-industry-says-us-trade-group">the Entertainment Software Association said the Trump administration's tariffs will "have a real and detrimental impact" on the video games industry</a> as a whole. David Cole - founder of games industry marketing and research firm DFC Intelligence - told Eurogamer his firm <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-likely-to-stick-with-switch-2s-450-launch-price-despite-trump-tariffs-says-analyst">expected Nintendo to stick with its $450 launch pricing for Switch 2</a>, despite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-delays-us-switch-2-pre-orders-due-to-tariffs">temporarily briefly pausing pre-orders in the US and Canada</a>. Pre-order invites for American players are now expected to go out <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/how-to-buy/">"starting 8th May"</a>.</p>

<p>In a general all-hands meeting that united both companies last week in Japan, Niantic representatives sought to assuage concerns, insisting that Scopely bought Niantic because of the success of its games, not because it wants to change them.</p>

            <p>Marathon - the upcoming reimagined PvP extraction shooter from the Sony-owned Bungie - will release on 23rd September, 2025, with a closed Alpha test kicking off on April 23.</p>
<p>Bungie finally revealed Marathon's release date in a number of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-marathon-is-finally-getting-a-reveal-this-week">lengthy teasers, all embedded below, showing off its gameplay and cinematics over the weekend</a>.</p>

<p>"Marathon is a team-based extraction shooter set around the mysterious and cutthroat world of Tau Ceti IV," the voiceover teases. "You are a Runner, a cybernetic mercenary who's given up their human form for a biosynethic shell with unique abilities and stats, capable of both tactical and fast-paced combat.</p>
<p>"Here, you'll fight in a crew of up to three players across a variety of zones and points of interest. You'll face rival Runners in zones of up to 18 players, countless security forces, and otherworldly threats. To scavenge the remains of a lost colony for glory and fortune."</p>
<p>There are six classes, although only four were revealed; stealthy Void, tanky Glitch, as well as Locus and Blackbird. All four will be available in the upcoming alpha test, and there's no need to race to lock in your favourite as you ready up - your team can play as three Voids if you want, as there's no limit.</p>

<p>It goes on to describe the scavengable environments of Tau Ceti IV - they're "filled with weapons, materials, and equipment" - with sponsorship from factions able to help replenish your armoury.</p>
<p>It also stresses that Marathon has been designed to play as fireteams, with contextual pings, shared objectives, and down-but-not-out mechanics, although there is the ability to opt out of crew queues if you're a lone wolf wanting to "take all the glory for yourself as a solo Runner".</p>
<p>"Before deploying, you'll strategically build your loadout and select a Runner to ensure you're equipped for the run ahead. Your objective is simple: get in, gather as much loot as you can, and make it out alive. Die, and all your gear will be up for grabs. Survive, and your loot can be taken into future runs as you grow in power and fill your vault."</p>
<p>That said, death is, apparently, "inevitable, but it's never the end".</p>

<p>"Bungie brings its best in class, first-person person multiplayer action to the forefront. Dynamic and tactile gunplay. Runners with unique playstyles and customisable builds create highly dynamic and strategic team fights."</p>
<p>Because of its timed matches, dynamic events, variable weather, and unpredictable players, Bungie reckons no two matches will be the same. There'll also be endgame challenges, ranked play, secrets, seasonal storytelling, community events, "and more" in season one.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for me, Bungie also warns that no matter how geared up you are, "players with skill and strategy will always have the edge".</p>
<p>Marathon is coming to PC via Steam, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S with full cross-play and cross-save.</p>
<p>In case you were wondering, no, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-wont-require-a-playstation-network-account-on-pc-and-xbox">you won't need a PlayStation Network account to play Marathon</a> on PC or Xbox.</p>
<p>In response to a comment shared on Marathon's Discord channel in which one user said they were a tad "spooked" by the idea of having to use a PSN login to play, the Marathon team replied with a clear cut and straight to the point message: "Marathon will not require a PlayStation Account for players on PC and Xbox."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-will-compete-with-other-extraction-shooters-by-not-competing-interview/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Marathon is set to be a game-changing extraction shooter, but it’s hard to break into a genre that’s so dominated by existing titles. For instance, Escape from Tarkov has held the top spot in that vertical for many years, and those that have tried to challenge the game have ultimately failed or fallen to the wayside.</p>



<p>Bungie’s Marathon will attempt to rival the likes of Escape from Tarkov by <strong>not </strong>rivalling Escape from Tarkov. That’s straight from the mouth of the game’s director, Joe Ziegler, who recently sat down with Gaming World Media’s Jake Lucky to discuss all aspects of the upcoming shooter.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-most-interesting-stories">‘The Most Interesting Stories’</h2>



<p>Joe Ziegler was transparent when talking to Jake Lucky about Marathon following a recent behind-closed-doors playtest. He suggested that the reason why extraction shooters fail is because they come in and worry about competing with other, existing titles – but it’s all about trying to be <strong>different enough </strong>to live alongside those top dogs.</p>



<p>Here’s the full interview:</p>

<iframe title="Marathon TELL ALL with Bungie's Joe Ziegler" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LTSnXKDpQvE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>In another recent interview, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-boss-says-industry-doomed-to-unnecessarily-brutal-layoffs-while-chasing-after-the-battle-royales" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Arrowhead’s Johan Pilestedt</a> explained that trying to replicate the success of a game like Escape from Tarkov will always be fruitless because people don’t want to play the same game over and over again.</p>



<p>That’s what Ziegler alluded to in his interview with Jake Lucky:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I might be naive in saying this but I’ll be honest… To me, I don’t think of making games as like, directly competing and trying to eat a bunch of other people’s lunch. For me, whenever I think about it, it’s like, how do we offer something that’s interesting and cool and can live in its own space alongside other titles and be just as big and important as others.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>With that being said, Bungie has worked from a variety of perspectives to make Marathon as unique as possible.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We really do want to create some of the most interesting stories you’ve ever had, and we’re inputting a lot of dynamics to make that happen. At the end of a night of playing Marathon, we want you to tell a really cool story to somebody else, you know? To be excited.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The team is also making Marathon the most accessible extraction shooter in the market, doing away with punishing mechanics and a steep learning curve to make something that everyone can play and enjoy. They’re hellbent on ‘breaking the already existing military space’ and making something much more adventurous in Marathon.</p>



<p>Do you think Marathon can exist happily alongside a dominant extraction shooter like Escape from Tarkov? Let me know in the comments what you think, or visit the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

		<p>Throughout history and, unfortunately, right up to the present day, the world has thousands of examples of tyranny and oppression, where powerful groups use their influences to exert force over smaller or less powerful groups. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/croc-legend-of-the-gobbos-remaster-review/">Croc: Legend of the Gobbos</a> may not seem like the first port of call when considering this topic, but its story does touch upon the elements of tyranny, oppression, and resistance. The points this essay will touch upon include the use of military against a peaceful nation, the kidnapping of a group of people, those being the Gobbos, Baron Dante’s tyrannical actions, and Croc’s actions as a resistance fighter and liberator.</p>
<h2>Baron Dante’s Tyranny</h2>
<p>Croc: Legend of the Gobbos starts with the Gobbos taking in an abandoned baby Croc, raising him as one of their own. From what we see in the opening moments, the Gobbos are a peaceful society that work together to maintain a homeland where everyone is treated with respect, kindness, and supported. There seems to be no conflict with Gobbo society, nor does this society come across a warmongering. In fact, they seem almost childlike and naïve to the dangers of the wider world around them with barely any preparedness when having an aggressor as a neighbour. The most basic of plans seem to revolve around Croc saving them, but if he fails then Gobbo society goes extinct.</p>
<p><iframe title="Croc Legend of the Gobbos Remaster OUT NOW!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1CBD8kgxlDw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Completely unexpectedly, at least to the Gobbos, Baron Dante launches an invasion of the Gobbo homeland with his Dantini military at his side. Such is the ferocity of the attack, the Gobbos lose their homes as the Dantini army begin destroying everything. Moments before all the Gobbos are captured, King Gobbo manages to help Croc escape, giving a slither of hope in these dark times.</p>
<p>Post invasion, Baron Dante appears to order that each Gobbo is isolated away from their kin, with everyone thrown in their own cage, box, or used as a prize in mini games with only a brief shot of escape. Here, we can draw out that Baron Dante had no care for Gobbo society and what it stood for, was fine with separating families and putting his Gobbo prisoners in solitary confinement. To further exacerbate this, each Gobbo is imprisoned in areas that have no basic facilities, instead placed in some incredibly dangerous areas that could end up fatal for them. The minigames beg the question that if Croc did not win them, were these Gobbos to be prizes for those invited to take part, and trafficked away with their families never knowing what happened to them?</p>


<p>Baron Dante’s oppression and tyranny is not just saved for the Gobbos. Through the game we see that he does not respect the free will of most other creatures. As Croc makes progress in his liberation mission, Baron Dante uses his power to turn innocent creatures into unwilling combatants within his army, forcing them to fight Croc. These individuals do get hurt in their battles but if they fail they are left to carry on with their lives. They regain their freedom but it shows that Baron Dante has no duty of responsibility towards these drafted soldiers, leaving them to their fates.</p>
<h2>Croc As A Leader of Resistance</h2>
<p>Most that become symbols of resistance do not necessarily choose to become such symbols but are forced to through the events that occur around them. Martin Luther King Jr, Nelson Mandela, Bhagat Singh, Tiananmen Square’s Tank man, Harriet Tubman, Volodymyr Zelensky. These are just some notable figures who have stood up to either lead resistance against more powerful adversaries or become symbols or resistance themselves. Croc is an individual that is forced to act in his own world against a member of the royalty in Baron Dante and all of the resources available to him. This is another showdown between a focused yet disadvantaged person taking on a complex power structure to force a change for the better.</p>
<p>Croc is outnumbered with no allies except Beany, who can teleport Croc to new areas. No one else takes up the cause to free the Gobbos from their prison. This could be down to several reasons. First, there’s a clear lack of information available to anyone else who otherwise would have helped. Baron Dante would tightly control any message from the region, and the invasion of the Gobbos is something he may not have publicised. Second could be fear. It could be other groups have heard of the invasion and displacement of the Gobbos, but do not act out of fear that Baron Dante will turn his forces against them. Third, any other resistance has already been dealt with. We do not know the full history of the region, but Baron Dante may have already crushed other resistances that were rising up giving him free reign over his part of the land.</p>

<p>Croc is essentially a guerrilla fighter, striking at targets quickly to free up his Gobbo family from their prisons before quickly moving to the next area. While the path that he can take is quite predictable, he is not at first seen of as much of a threat with very little of the Dantini military standing in his way at the start. However, as Croc marches onwards and dispatches foes Baron Dante increase security to protect himself. Croc shows very little mercy to those who get in his way, engaging in close quarters combat to fight against the oppressors. This showcases how little in the way of resources Croc has as he has not even armed with a weapon, and even if he was it is unlikely he would know how to use having been raised by the Gobbos.</p>
<p>After facing the trials of navigating hostile environments, and fighting willing and unwilling enemy soldiers, Croc eventually confronts Baron Dante having freed the Gobbos and dismantled much of Baron Dante’s power structure. Croc successfully overthrows Baron Dante and takes his people back to their homeland, with the world around them once again thriving. While this is a good ending for the Croc and Gobbos, it leaves behind another land where there is no one in charge which paves the way for a power struggle and further strife that will impact the Gobbos again. Filling that vacuum is not Croc’s responsibility, but this does show that even successful resistance movements can lead to unintended consequences.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Croc: Legend of the Gobbos is a game that on its surface looks like a standard, colourful, and innocent platformer. What this essay has outlined is that Croc: Legend of the Gobbos actually tells a story of oppression, tyranny, forced displacement, the imbalance of power, and the need for resistance against tyranny. If there is no resistance then the majority of victims will the innocent, like the childlike and naïve Gobbos. Croc is an unexpected symbol of resistance but his actions show that even one person with the necessary drive can bring about change for the better in an unjust world.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-doesnt-have-proximity-chat/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bungie-wants-marathon-to-be-a-%E2%80%98social-extraction-experience%E2%80%99-but-the-game-doesn%E2%80%99t-have-proximity-chat.1163091/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-doesnt-have-proximity-chat/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It has been confirmed that Bungie’s Marathon will not have proximity chat despite the developers wanting the game to be a ‘social extraction experience’.</p>



<p>The news of no proximity chat came via a new interview with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/marathon-wont-have-proximity-chat-because-itd-be-way-too-toxic-i-dont-think-anyone-has-a-good-solution-to-that-just-yet/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=dhtwitter&amp;utm_content=null" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PCGamer</a>, game director Joe Ziegler told PC Gamer that they don’t “have a solution yet” when it comes to the toxicity that proximity chat brings to players.</p>



<p>“I don’t think anyone really has a good solution to that just yet. Because we’re so dedicated to making sure that we’re creating a safe space where we don’t have players just flaming each other or doing terrible things to one another, I think we’re not ready to invest in prox chat until we have a solution,” he said.</p>







<p>The comments come <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-wants-marathon-to-be-a-social-extraction-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">following an interview that we published in collaboration with Jake Lucky</a>, where in the same day of interviews Joe Ziegler told Lucky that they want the game to be “more of a social extraction experience”.</p>



<p>Ziegler explained, “The key thing for us was making Marathon a little bit more of a social extraction experience where there’s a lot value in playing with other people that you know or people that you want and you all feel like you can create that adventure together and we’re not trying to fragment you all the time, you know?”</p>



<p>In the interview, Ziegler gave the example of being able to be respawned instead of just watching your teammates complete the match, or another example of “data cards” where your entire team can cash them out together.</p>



<p>However, I think a <strong>big point</strong> is being missed here and the conflicting comments are a bit of a head scratcher. Proximity chat ADDS the much-needed social aspect to a game and while I understand Bungie’s stance on toxicity, surely players who don’t want to engage with proximity chat can just… you know… turn it off? Or better yet, just give players the ability to report others for toxicity. These are not new ideas and with the right infrastructure (moderation), they are the solution that Bungie is looking for.</p>



<p>At the end of the day, you’re never going to stop people from being toxic, no matter what you do.</p>



<p>Without proximity chat, Bungie is missing the mark entirely on not only what makes extraction shooters fun and exciting and to be honest… Makes the whole ‘social extractions shooter’ comment laughable.</p>



<p>Marathon is set to be released on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC on September 23, 2025.</p>

    <div>
        
<p>A new list of characters that are supposedly coming to Fortnite in the near future have been leaked online.</p>



<p>The leak comes courtesy of ShpeshalNick of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnJBa4Q0JSw&amp;ab_channel=XboxEra" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">XboxEra podcast</a>, who has a tendency to be fairly accurate when it comes to Fortnite information. According to Nick, the following characters are coming to Fortnite sometime in the future:</p>



<ul>
<li>Jack Black (apparently its just Jack Black and not connected to the Minecraft release)</li>



<li>More Mortal Kombat Characters</li>



<li>Death Stranding Characters</li>



<li>Tony Hawk Pro Skater Characters</li>



<li>DOOM The Dark Ages Doom Slayer (a DOOM slayer version of The Dark Ages model)</li>



<li>Double Dragons Characters (Billy and Jimmy)</li>



<li>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 Characters</li>



<li>Agent 47 (Hitman)</li>



<li>Marvel Characters (in a pixel art style)</li>



<li>A player from the NBA</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-tony-hawk-fortnite-event">Tony Hawk Fortnite Event</h2>



<p>Another surprising detail to come from the leak is that Nick also revealed that there is going to be some kind of Tony Hawk Pro Skater event, but what that looks like is currently unknown and which characters will be coming to Fortnite from the game is unclear (obviously we can assume Tony Hawk himself is one).</p>



<p>You can watch the full discussion of the leak below:</p>

</p></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-remake-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3 + 4 has already been confirmed to release on July 11</a>, 2025, so it’s entirely possible that the event will be take place around the release. But as Nick points out, Epic Games has been notorious in the past with not abiding by any key dates, so it could release before or after the games release.</p>



<p>Which characters are you most looking forward to seeing coming to Fortnite?&nbsp;Let me know what you think on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>, or post a comment below.</p>

		<p>To my great shame, I have never played a Kirby game. This is what I told the gentleman next to me as I picked up the Switch 2 Controller to play the Switch 2 edition of Kirby and the Forgotten Land at the Nintendo Switch 2 event in London.</p>
<p>I am missing out, I was reliably informed, as I embarked on a time preview of one of the early levels of the game. Kirby and Forgotten Land + Star-Crossed World is definitely one of the clunkiest game titles we have seen on the Switch 2 so far, but it makes sense when you realise it’s a Switch port bundled with a brand new DLC. Fans will be glad to hear that if they already own Kirby and the Forgotten Land for Nintendo Switch, they can purchase the upgrade pack to play the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, complete with the DLC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kirby and the Forgotten Land – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed World – Nintendo Direct" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q5peJd37J-k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Around three years ago, we awarded the original Nintendo Switch release <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/03/23/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-review-switch/">a lofty 9/10</a> for being “a gorgeous and vibrant new world to explore”, while also being an excellent 3D platformer for what was traditionally a 2D platforming series. The jump to the Switch 2 has certainly made it more vibrant. The display on the new console is gorgeous, and the jump in specs is certainly welcome, doubling the frame rate from 30fps to 60fps, and running at 1080p in handheld mode and 1440p docked.</p>
<p>The main difference between the Switch 2 version and the original, however, is the Star-Crossed DLC. Rather than adding new maps, it effectively remixes the existing one with an overlay. The world is struck by a whopping great meteor, scattering magical crystals throughout the campaign. Kirby must use his abilities, including some brand new Mouthful Modes, to destroy these crystals and pick up all the collectibles they drop.</p>


<p>The new bits are clearly differentiated from the original campaign in the way they look — the blue mystical gunk really stood out against the luscious green grass in the portion I played at the event in London.</p>
<p>As I played, the guy running the booth told me about how he played through the original campaign with his niece, and was now looking forward to the rerun. That kid is three years older and hopefully still into Kirby, and he was really looking forward to the bonding time and seeing how things would be different this time around, both in terms of the level and how she played the game.</p>

<p>I can see where he’s coming from. I grew up passing the controller to my brothers as we worked our way through the Crash Bandicoot games. Kirby, however, is fully playable in co-op – with the second player taking on the role of Bandana Waddle Dee. My own son is far too young to play this (he’s much more likely to just try and chew the controller), but I am already looking forward to kicking back with my wife and seeing what Kirby and the Wordiest Title on the Switch 2 has to offer.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-2-clear-bosses-without-beating/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hideo Kojima recently revealed on an episode of the Koji Pro radio broadcast that Death Stranding 2 will have a unique boss battle mechanic. If you succumb to a boss, you’ll have the option to simply move on and soak up everything you need to know about that boss fight via a ‘visual novel’ feature.</p>



<p>This is good news for players who traditionally struggle with intense boss fights, which are often front and centre in Kojima’s games.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-effortless-victory">Effortless Victory</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://x.com/koji10_tbs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Koji Pro radio broadcast</a> uncovered (and helpfully translated) by <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1910720581085126707" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Genki_JPN</a> has revealed that boss fights in Death Stranding 2 can be walked through without any effort. If you want to skip through the game as quickly as possible, you simply need to <strong>lose </strong>the boss fight and select an option on the death screen to ‘skip over’ the boss.</p>



<p>Some have complained that this is giving in to the ‘hand-holding’ trend that’s coming up far too often in video games, but I, for one, am happy to see it. There’s a reason why I don’t play games like Elden Ring, and it’s because I suck ass at boss battles.</p>



<p>Instead of seeing the results of a successful boss battle, the player will see a breakdown of the fight through a ‘visual novel’ mechanic that gives them the full scope and ensures they’re not missing any lore or context.</p>



<p>I love this, and I really hope it catches on.</p>



<p>It was noted by Kojima in the same segment that Death Stranding 2 is now ‘95% complete’.</p>



<p>Do you think this kind of mechanic is babying players, or are you happy to see it? Let me know what you think on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>, or post a comment below.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/12/bungie-shares-first-marathon-gameplay<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>After <a href="https://gameinformer.com/playstation-showcase/2023/05/24/bungie-is-revitalizing-its-old-shooter-series-marathon">announcing the project in 2023</a>, Destiny and Halo developer Bungie is finally ready to reveal gameplay for the next evolution of its Marathon franchise, which predates both of those. In a livestream earlier today, studio members offered early details about the project while sharing several videos that helped clarify how the game will look, play, and feel.</p>

<p>Marathon and its sequels were part of Bungie’s earliest catalog of game releases, with the first arriving in 1994. This new iteration is a dramatic departure, though some of the connected elements of lore suggest meaningful links between the original games and this new project.</p>

<p>The new Marathon is built as a team-based extraction shooter that includes both PvP and PvE elements. Each player takes on the role of a Runner, a cybernetic mercenary who has given up their natural body to inhabit an artificial form to explore and retrieve valuable equipment from a lost and abandoned colony on the planet of Tau Ceti IV.</p>

<p>Visuals have a bright and neon aesthetic, a notable departure from much of Bungie’s recent work on Destiny. Even so, seeing the game in action makes the Bungie connection much more apparent; from the way guns and scopes work to the sensation of running, sliding, and other movement, Marathon seems to maintain the tight and intuitive shooting action that is a hallmark of the studio’s work.</p>



<p>Each Runner has a name and a personality, including the likes of Glitch, Void, and Blackbird. Your choice of Runner appears to set a baseline of playstyle, even as subsequent matches, equipment selection, and upgrades allow you to dramatically reshape and build-craft a character that matches a desired playstyle.</p>

<p>Matches include up to 18 players, usually in crews of three, though there was a mention of a way players may choose to go lone wolf and attempt extractions solo. During a match, teams scavenge through the alien ruins while fending off computer-controlled robots and other dangers, as well as the assaults of real enemy players controlling their own runners. Each match has a time limit, and you must try to extract as much equipment as possible before the match ends; the retrieved equipment can then help fuel subsequent runs.</p>

<p>As a player navigates through maps, in addition to various weaponry, there are several special abilities and gear that add to the tactical complexity of play. In the brief snippets of gameplay shown, we saw things like stealth tools, explosives, agility implants, shield charges, and other enhancements. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Alongside an early look at gameplay, Bungie’s showcase also revealed a lengthy animated short by acclaimed director Alberto Mielgo, who some may recognize from his directorial work on “The Witness,” one of the animated shorts that was part of Netflix’s Love, Death, &amp; Robots. Mielgo’s new Marathon short helped to layer in some tonal understanding of what Bungie appears to be going for. Elements of body-horror and existential angst are prevalent throughout the film, which sees a few different Runners moving through battles on Tau Ceti IV while questioning the nature of their own personal past and human nature. In keeping with some of the feelings of the original Marathon game, the film short suggests a disquieting and uncomfortable vibe about a future in which humanity has veered into some dark places.</p>

<p>Marathon targets a launch on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (Steam) on September 23. Ahead of that, Bungie has suggested that joining the <a href="https://discord.gg/marathonthegame">Marathon Community Discord</a> opens up a chance to interface more directly with the development team and get a chance to be in on early playtests.</p>

            <p>
It's coming up to a year since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/v-rising">V Rising</a> received its 1.0 release, and ahead of that anniversary developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/stunlock-studios">Stunlock Studios</a> shared a trailer earlier this week for the game's first big update, Invaders of Oakveil. The update itself will be free (nice!), and introduces a whole new area to explore, the titular Oakveil Woodlands, a woodsy area where "corruption" is spreading (not nice).
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The big baddie of this update is Megara the Serpent Queen, presumably the source of said corruption. She's got some minions called The Venomblades, which sounds like a great name for a goth rollerblading group. In terms of gameplay additions, there's a new arena-building feature to be found in your castle, alongside one-on-one duels that can be found out in the wild that are consequence free. Oh, there's three new weapon types to mess around with, claws, twinblades, and throwing daggers, as well as seven new spells to boot.
</p>

<p>
Combat is also getting a big refresh, with stats seeing a rework, gear receiving some balance changes, and the addition of "new customization tools." Blood types have been reworked too, passive spells are apparently "more impactful", and unlocking spell points gives you some passive bonuses too. Lots of changes!
</p>
<p>
Crafting will be a bit easier too now as you can take ingredients from your vault without having to actually go to your vault to get them. Horse girls will delight in the fact that there'll be stables to store your horses in as well, alongside the ability to fill your prisons with creatures to take blood from (that one's not so much for the horse girls).
</p>
<p>
Alongside a few other changes that you can read about on the game's <a href="https://playvrising.com/oakveil">official website</a>, there's also the fact that V Rising will also be officially supported on Steam Deck. All of this is coming April 28th, so you've only got a couple of weeks to wait.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/vegas-falcons-win-first-cdl-match-by-beating-optic-texas.1162962/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/vegas-falcons-won-first-cdl-series-match/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The most insane losing streak in the history of esports has just been broken as the Vegas Falcons <strong>finally </strong>found a win over OpTic Texas in the Call of Duty League. It was a loss streak of 20 matches back-to-back for the Vegas Falcons, and it took a monumental roster overhaul for the first victory to be found.</p>



<p>Given some of the changes between teams, the win over OpTic Texas is nothing short of poetic.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-falcons-soar">Falcons Soar</h2>



<p>Before this fixture against OpTic Texas, the Vegas Falcons sat on <strong>zero wins </strong>in the CDL 2025 season. From Major to Minor and through the qualifying stages, the team failed to gain traction in a single series, falling against all comers in historic fashion.</p>



<p>It was harsh, but several elements contributed to the streak, such as an ever-changing lineup of players that never let chemistry be made. The all-Saudi roster was recently refreshed with North American players, except Exnid, who has been a consistent talent in recent weeks.</p>



<p>One of the most talked-about signings was Pred, the SMG aficionado who came over from OpTic Texas mere days ago. Pred won the CDL Championship with OpTic Texas last season, but a troubled hiatus and a paltry return to the roster led to this change landing.</p>



<p>In the series against OpTic Texas, the comms were on point, the team was frying, and the movement was slick. In the last week, something stunning must have happened to the Vegas Falcons because this win revealed a hunger to succeed.</p>



<p>It was as though every map was neck-and-neck. The opening Hardpoint was evenly matched, the first Search went to an eleventh round, and the Control was a back-and-forth. The final Hardpoint was all Falcons, though. That sealed the deal and landed the organisation its first win in the Call of Duty League.</p>



<p>Damn.</p>

You can cancel your <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> pre-order, you can hold off on picking up a Switch 2 for that inevitable The Duskbloods release, because there's a pretty good reason to return to the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a>. Earlier this week, modder extraordinaire Yui released the Dark Souls Remastered seamless co-op mod, which, if you can believe it, allows you to play through the game in online co-op with minimal interruptions.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Yui shared a look at the mod in action in a video on her YouTube channel, and it certainly looks like it's doing what it says on the tin. One thing she did note is that this is an "early release" of the mod, meaning there might be a few bugs along the way, though there shouldn't be too many, and asked to let her know if you do encounter any.

<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/557559/dark-souls-remastered-seamless-co-op-mod">Polygon</a> she also explained that this one was apparently easier to make than her <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-seamless-co-op-mod-lets-you-play-the-entire-game-with-a-friend">Elden Ring co-op mod</a>, though there was a particular challenge in how old Dark Souls is. One big thing Yui had to work hard on was making it so that parts of the game wouldn't unload if someone got too far away from the host. In any case, the mod is apparently in good working order, so it still seems like the best way to play if you aren't a fan of how Souls games' co-op generally works.
</p>
<p>
It's a cool mod because you can play with up to five other people too, and progression will save in your copy of the game even if you're not the host. Unlike the base game, regular enemies scale in strength depending on how many people you're playing with, so there'll be a bit more of a challenge too.
</p>
<p>
Definitely seems like a good way to kill some time ahead of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-release-date-knocks-back-an-estus-and-takes-a-swing-at-may-2025">Elden Ring Nightreign's release next month</a>.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-explains-why-marathon-is-an-extraction-shooter/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bungie-explains-why-marathon-is-an-extraction-shooter.1162938/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-explains-why-marathon-is-an-extraction-shooter/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s a bold move to stand up an extraction shooter game in this day and age. Many have come before and have fallen short of expectations, and the ones that have stuck around have effortlessly dominated the scene – I’m looking at <em>you</em>, Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>Regardless, Bungie is breaking into the genre with Marathon, an upcoming extraction shooter set in a sci-fi universe. In a recent interview, Gaming World Media’s Jake Lucky sat down with Joe Ziegler, the game’s director, to learn <strong>exactly why </strong>the team wants to try making a success of an extraction shooter when so many have failed.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-super-exciting-and-super-unique">‘Super Exciting and Super Unique’</h2>



<p>The extraction shooter model ebbs and flows, but it’s fast becoming a staple of the wider industry, with many developers having thrown their hat in the ring. The next biggest studio working on an extraction shooter is Bungie, breaking into the vertical with Marathon, a reboot of a game from the 1990s.</p>



<p>Here’s the full interview:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Marathon REVEAL Interview with Bungie's Joe Ziegler" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LTSnXKDpQvE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>When Jake Lucky caught up with Joe Ziegler after a session testing Marathon, he asked <strong>why </strong>the team had aimed to produce an extraction shooter when the market has a tentative reception at best for new games in that space.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Extraction shooters to us symbolise this rare circumstance in gaming where you have a lot of different choices inside of a game experience, and all of them become meaningful in a weird way. As you’re playing it, you get these really dramatic stories that occur about survival. Every decision you make kind of becomes a point of regret or a point of excitement.</p>



<p>This idea that behind the corner there’s this brand new light that could exist there or this dark hole that you will get destroyed in. That adventurous aspect of trying to survive a dangerous environment is just super exciting and super unique, and I think that’s really why the extraction shooter was such a perfect game for us to make. </p>



<p>It’s because, the studio likes to do these crazy FPS experiences that really have uplifting and very emotionally engaging moments – we wanted to take that to the next level with something like Marathon.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The team explained that, with Marathon, they want to create a social extraction experience that’s more enjoyable, accessible, and entertaining. It’s not trying to become the next Escape from Tarkov and it’s certainly not as punishing as the 10-year-old Battlestate Games extraction shooter.</p>



<p>Marathon is all about revelling in an adventure with friends, that’s why the core gameplay loop is accessible only in a team format – for now. Bungie wants players to have an exciting experience that never culminates in a depressing loss after an hour in a single raid, which can be typical for Escape from Tarkov players.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to this new extraction shooter, or do you think the genre is done? Let me know in the comments or over on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/marathon-hands-on-preview-can-bungie-do-to-escape-from-tarkov-what-fortnite-did-to-pubg<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">If Escape From Tarkov is the PUBG of the extraction shooter, boldly striking out into a new genre despite humble origins, then Bungie’s upcoming shooter, Marathon, is the big-budget refinement that could become the emerging category’s Fortnite. Coming from a studio with a pedigree for first-person shooters that’s virtually unmatched, and which wields the resources to take a good idea and reimagine it in a disturbing, beautifully detailed sci-fi universe, it’s easy to see how Bungie just might pull it off. But with a concept that’s so inherently geared towards the hardcore PvP crowd and such a clear departure from what they’ve done in the past, it’s certainly not without risks, even if they do manage to capture the usual FPS magic they’re known for. Even so, after spending the better part of two days sliding and gunning my way through Tau Ceti’s relentless ruins, I was hooked, and can’t wait to group up with my most tryhard friends and ruin people’s day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Marathon is an extraction shooter where you and two friends are dropped into an extremely unmerciful wasteland to battle deadly enemies, including rival players, all in the name of loot and glory. If you’ve played Escape From Tarkov, then you’ll be familiar with this PvPvE framing, which forces you to ante up any loot you bring along with you, as it’s permanently lost if you fail to exfiltrate before time runs out or your team is killed. Those distressingly high stakes immediately got my blood pumping and made each match feel like the most important one so far. After fighting tooth and nail against surprisingly challenging AI enemies and ruthless fellow Runners to get a high-level rifle that could down most enemies in two hits, I wasn’t about to let my guard down for even a moment and risk losing it all to some unworthy foe.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Marathon - Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If, like me, you bemoaned the quiet, undignified death of PvP’s relevance in Destiny 2, then you might share my eagerness to see Bungie focused squarely on a competitive experience here, and everything I played so far indicates they’ve still more than got what it takes to pull it off. Weapons and movement feels crisp, fluid, and incredibly satisfying in that rarified way that few studios can achieve, and the added element of hero shooter-like abilities, like one that lets you blast enemies with kinetic energy, sending them flying away, gives that extra kick you need to feel like a supernaturally powered badass. Marathon almost immediately feels fantastic to play, and as soon as I took out a robot who took a potshot at me from the window of a nearby building and tried out his weapon for myself on a nearby enemy, it was love at first snipe.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This gets even better once you start to familiarize yourself with the class-based Runners available to you (four of which I got to play extensively, out of the six that will be available at launch). Glitch is all about mobility and controlling positioning, and has abilities that help her move fast, jump up to areas others can’t reach, and push enemies away with a blast of kinetic energy. Locus is a tanky soldier who can pull up a shield to block incoming fire and launch a flurry of homing missiles at enemies, while Blackbird is all about intel and using her gadgets to ping any enemies within an area for the whole team, and sending out little robotic drones to seek and destroy nearby enemies. My personal favorite though, was Void: a deft ninja who can turn invisible for a time and deploy massive clouds of smoke to lose and confuse the enemy within. Each of these characters offers a completely different way to play Marathon, and by coordinating with my teammates, we were able to put together a balanced team of Runners who complemented one another’s strengths and helped make up for any weaknesses.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That came in handy as we explored dark and forgotten places throughout Marathon’s maps, which were filled with deadly creatures, like a species of giant ticks who ran at me frantically, and surprisingly accurate robots who were much, much better at surrounding and overwhelming players than the vast majority of AI enemies found in other games. Fighting these foes was no joke, but the loot was well worth it, whether it was finding a backpack that allowed for more storage space, a weapon that gave me better odds against a rival crew, or just some consumable healing items I could rely upon in a pinch. Some of the extremely rare and powerful items, of which my team only found a handful during our matches, changed things up quite significantly, like a backpack that turned the user invisible whenever they interacted with a container while wearing it – extremely useful in a game where you’re being hunted by everyone else on the map.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Marathon provided me with tons of memorable moments of elation after a narrow victory and the occasionally sour taste of defeat.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Marathon’s tensest moments, though, happen when you encounter enemy crews and inevitably clash in a bid to claim one another’s loot. Maybe we’d spot a crew in the distance and stealthily follow them – waiting for the right moment to stage an ambush – or sometimes we’d hear other players in the distance fighting off security forces and decide to go catch them when their guard was down, scooping up whatever goodies they were about to claim. And, of course, sometimes we found ourselves on the receiving end of that ruthless equation and had to scramble as one of us was downed by sudden gunfire from a rival team. These moments are when the PvP magic really shines and leaves you with stories to tell your friends, like the time my group got entangled in a nine-player free-for-all and came out unscathed thanks to some well-timed smoke grenades, or another time where both of my teammates were killed, but we came back to win it thanks to a clutch revive the other team didn’t see coming. Just like the most epic, heart-pounding moments of a battle royale match, Marathon provided me with tons of memorable moments of elation after a narrow victory and the occasionally sour taste of defeat.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Once we’d gotten our spoils or completed an objective or two, it was time to haul ass to the exfiltration beacon and stand near it long enough to be pulled out of the firefight and returned safely back to our base in outer space with our bloody bounty. But lighting that beacon also lets everyone else on the map know you’re trying to make off with your goods, via a giant blue light that shoots up into the sky for a prolonged period of time. This makes your last moments in the area pretty intense, or, if you’re like me, offers some exciting opportunities to kill a group right as they’re preparing to leave and benefit from all of their hard work.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The downside of Marathon’s “to the victors go the spoils” reward system is that in a pretty short amount of time, those with skill will enter fresh matches with gear that easily outmatches less skilled players, making them even less likely to be able to pull off a victory. Bungie’s gone out of its way to try and make it so a poorly geared squad still stands a chance against those with better loot if they play well, and you can always simply employ the strategy of avoiding other players until you’ve got a few extractions and some at least decent loot under your belt, but even so, it seems like it could get pretty demoralizing in short order if you run into a bout of bad luck and start to feel like you’ll never catch a break.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I was lucky enough to win the vast majority of my matches, and after the initial hump of stockpiling some basic equipment in my vault and unlocking a few permanent upgrades to make the going easier, I felt like even if I fell in battle and lost all my best stuff, at least I’d have some adequate backup gear to recover with. But that won’t be the case for everyone, and I wonder how big the chunk of players will be who simply run into a brick wall in their first few hours, log off, and never return. At least in Escape from Tarkov you’ve got your Kappa case to hold your most valuable items and protect them from being lost on the battlefield – Marathon has none of those safety measures, instead opting for a system where you’re given a sort of pity loadout, called a sponsored package, which sets you up with some basic gear after you’ve been quite literally bled dry. This definitely helps ice the wound of a string of bad luck, but might not exactly be the most comforting consolation prize.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I wonder how big the chunk of players will be who simply run into a brick wall in their first few hours, log off, and never return.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">To be clear, it very well might be a good thing that Marathon seemingly refuses to compromise on its dedication to ensuring each match has real, keenly felt stakes, even if it turns some folks off from it – I certainly count myself among those who enjoy a bit of sweatiness and quite liked how invested I was forced to be every single time I deployed onto a new map. But they definitely risk a situation where it feels like the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer, to the detriment of those who are on the unfortunate side of that brutal equation. Time will tell before we know how that will shake out, but even in my short time with it, I already felt a bit of friction emanating from those on the server who kept dying repeatedly and felt like they were getting outclassed by those with quality loadouts.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Marathon PlayStation Showcase 2023 Trailer</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">One thing that could be the key to preventing people from falling off is Marathon’s ongoing meta progression system, which I found surprisingly engaging in my time with it. Even though your loot is probably destined to be stripped off your still-warm corpse and stuffed into some rude opponent’s backpack, you can at least comfort yourself in the various perk trees and ongoing quests you’ll find in the menus between rounds of play. You might not have made it back alive from your most recent escapade, but maybe you were able to loot some chests from a specific part of the map or complete some other objective in your quest log before you went cold. In that case, you can at least still make your way through the faction questlines and upgrade systems, which unlock new bits of story and improve your reputation with each of the three groups who have taken a marked interest in your progress. Doing so grants you perks that make the going a bit easier, like those that let you buy slightly better gear from the vendor, in case you find all your existing loot confiscated by the enemy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, despite some clear indications that some kind of plot will be included in Marathon even though multiplayer mayhem is plainly the focus, it’s still unclear to me how much that story will matter or deliver something that makes me want to progress, beyond just finding better weapons to use. As a mercenary called a Runner, your consciousness is repeatedly uploaded to a synthetic body and sent into dangerous territory in search of riches. Beyond this basic premise and some really cool details, like how your artificial bodies are sewn together out of synth silk by robotic caterpillars, there wasn’t a whole lot to go off of, and I could easily see this not being an area of particular focus for Marathon. That said, the world Bungie has built is every bit as beautiful as it is creepy and dystopian, and there are moments where they satisfyingly hint at the events of the Marathon trilogy from the ‘90s. But Bungie also told me that they’re not entirely following the events of the original games, and what little I saw did only slightly more than pay lip service to the world.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There’s the question of whether Bungie will add enough content at a fast enough pace to appease ever-ravenous players.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Another question is just how much support and longevity we can expect from Marathon. Bungie has earned its reputation for mastering the live-service model over the past decade of Destiny, and shows no signs of letting players down here, as they told me they already have plans to support Marathon with new maps, weapons, characters, and more as they develop it, but as always, there’s the question of whether they’ll do so at a fast enough pace to appease ever-ravenous players. And importantly, Marathon also plans to use the seasonal reset model found in the likes of Diablo 4, where you’ll be stripped of your loot and progress at the end of each season to do so again with new content and a new meta to mix things up. While I could definitely see this working for Marathon, there’s always the question of how they’ll manage to incentivize making that arduous climb from scratch each season.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After playing enough Marathon to get a pretty good feel for it in its alpha state, I’m already fairly confident it’ll scratch the Bungie PvP itch that’s been left unscratched for a number of years now. Here’s hoping they’ll knock it out of the park when it comes to PC and consoles in September.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Death can come fast in this kind of game, and since you lose all the stuff you’re carrying if you can’t make it out alive, loss feels particularly demoralizing.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196131" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: November 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="328" data-playlist="196131,195189,196599" data-current="196131"><div><p>The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: November 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196131/196131_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196131/196131_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196131/196131_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196131/196131_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21668.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>This is especially true with something like <em>Escape from Tarkov</em>, in which survival mechanics like thirst and specific health conditions like bone fractures are accounted for. But even in more casual takes on the genre like <em>Call of Duty</em>’s shortly lived “DMZ” mode from <em>Modern Warfare 2</em> (2022), defeat often results in such an uphill battle in the next match that you’re usually too underequipped to be able to withstand even encounters with all but the most trivial AI, let alone fully equipped players. Many folks like this kind of a challenge, but it’s a niche crowd for sure. </p><p>But <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marathon-gameplay-trailer-release-date-price-season-ps5-1851775940&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-gameplay-trailer-release-date-price-season-ps5-1851775940">today’s gameplay reveal of <em>Marathon</em></a></span> shows perhaps the most casual and approachable take on the genre yet. As someone who deeply loves the thrill that comes with this kind of game, I’m hopeful Bungie’s take on this hardcore genre opens the door for more folks to enjoy its highs without getting too mired in the lows. </p><h2 id="h406332"><a id=""></a>A class-based structure makes all the difference</h2><figure id="" data-id="2c84b988f542df25fab3ae3fc3e3c288" data-recommend-id="image://2c84b988f542df25fab3ae3fc3e3c288" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows a threeway split of the Glitch, Locus, and Blackbird Runners." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows a threeway split of the Glitch, Locus, and Blackbird Runners." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bungie / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2c84b988f542df25fab3ae3fc3e3c288" data-recommend-id="image://2c84b988f542df25fab3ae3fc3e3c288" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows a threeway split of the Glitch, Locus, and Blackbird Runners." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As we learned from today’s gameplay reveal, players will select from one of six Runners at launch to jump into a map with. These sound very similar to classes in <em>Destiny</em> or even the abilities of characters in something like <em>Apex Legends</em> or <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>. Today’s event showed off the four that will be playable during the game’s closed alpha period: </p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Locus</strong>: A soldier-type character that’s “all about push-forward gameplay,” described during the stream as “the first one in” during combat scenarios.</li><li><strong>Blackbird</strong>: A “reconnaissance-based” Runner who focuses on spotting enemy threats for the team</li><li><strong>Glitch</strong>: An speedy “disruptor” who encourages fast, get-in, screw-with-enemies, get-out tactics</li><li><strong>Void</strong>: A stealthy Runner who can use smoke grenades and even go invisible with active camouflage</li></ul><p>Players will be able to find various implants and “Cores” to spice up their Runners, but given the inherent traits of each runner, such as Glitch’s double jump and Locus’ deployable shields, it sounds like you’ll always be able to deploy into a match with a baseline of defensive and offensive capabilities. Another exciting ability is Blackbird’s Ultimate, as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fps/marathon-hands-on-preview/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fps/marathon-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Gamesradar</em> observed in their preview,</a></span> which basically lets you interrogate a downed enemy to reveal their teammates’ positions.</p><p>But perhaps most importantly, these class dynamics provide a bit of a script that players should ideally follow during a match. See a Locus? You know that character likely has superior firepower. See a Void? You’ll know to expect some sneaky shenanigans. You’ll also know that those are the roles you’re expected to fill for your team, and you’ll be able to opt into that role at the start of the match, not <em>after</em> you’ve acquired the necessary gear to play as a tank, healer, or any other meta role. This establishes a clear expectation of what you should be doing during the match aside from just gathering loot and getting out alive.</p><figure id="" data-id="7086602e36ee470764f3ffbea0ca5b38" data-recommend-id="image://7086602e36ee470764f3ffbea0ca5b38" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A gif shows a player highlighting enemy targets in a foggy area." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A gif shows a player highlighting enemy targets in a foggy area." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Marathon promises more than just shooting and looting in its gameplay loop.</figcaption><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bungie / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7086602e36ee470764f3ffbea0ca5b38" data-recommend-id="image://7086602e36ee470764f3ffbea0ca5b38" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A gif shows a player highlighting enemy targets in a foggy area." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It also means that you’ll spend less time scavenging things from the map for the sole purpose of being able to fill those roles after you’ve died. In extraction shooters in which you’re deprived of everything after death, it’s easy to get caught in a death spiral of being far too underequipped for subsequent matches. Writing for <em>IGN</em>, Travis Northup reflected on this <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/marathon-hands-on-preview-can-bungie-do-to-escape-from-tarkov-what-fortnite-did-to-pubg&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marathon-hands-on-preview-can-bungie-do-to-escape-from-tarkov-what-fortnite-did-to-pubg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in his preview of <em>Marathon</em></a></span>, wondering how that brutal feeling that “you’ll never catch a break” after repeat deaths and being deprived of useful loot will sit with folks who are new to the genre. </p><p>From my experience with the genre, <em>Marathon</em> sounds like it has a more manageable and capable baseline to fall back on after losing everything. Even though previews have stressed that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/after-thousands-of-hours-in-destiny-i-had-serious-concerns-about-bungies-marathon-reboot-but-now-ive-played-it-my-worry-isnt-whether-or-not-it-will-be-good/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=dhtwitter&amp;utm_content=null&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/after-thousands-of-hours-in-destiny-i-had-serious-concerns-about-bungies-marathon-reboot-but-now-ive-played-it-my-worry-isnt-whether-or-not-it-will-be-good/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=dhtwitter&amp;utm_content=null" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the default starter kit of weapons isn’t terribly powerful</a></span>, at least you won’t be deploying as a featureless, unarmored soldier bearing nothing but your bare fists if you’ve lost it all. You’ll have your Runner abilities and a sponsored loadout given to you before you jump into the next match. </p><p>While it’s clear <em>Marathon</em> will reward those players who stay alive the longest, being able to jump back in after dying with a set of useful abilities should make it way easier to dust yourself off and be of use to your team. Mix in the fact that the game features no survival mechanics like hunger or thirst, or an injury system that requires you to heal ailments to specific limbs, <em>plus </em>Bungie’s signature talents for creating shooters that feel responsive and satisfying to play, and <em>Marathon</em> might just be the extraction shooter’s chance to shine.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
