			<p>MindsEye's terrible launch may have impacted more than developer Build a Rocket Boy's future, judging from some recent statements from Io Interactive's CEO Hakan Abrak.</p>



<p>Speaking in a new interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/that-was-definitely-tough-right-ceo-of-mindseye-publisher-ioi-responds-to-disastrous-launch">IGN</a>, the company's CEO talked about collaborating with Build a Rocket Boy, saying that the publisher appreciated some of the great ideas the developer had for their game and the great world in the background, and wanted to help them distribute the game. MindsEye's launch, however, was terrible and far from what IO Interactive hoped for its IOI Partners publishing push. As such, the company will continue to self-publish its own titles, like the upcoming 007 First Light, but may not publish other studios' games in the future.</p>



<p>MindsEye is among the worst-reviewed games of the year, and it's easy to understand why, as it is a very underwhelming experience that would require a ton of work to reach an acceptable level of quality. Unfortunately, it seems like these improvements will take a long time to get implemented, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-updates-less-frequent-hitman-crossover-delayed/">updates have become less frequent</a> since July, with developers getting<a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-developer-reportedly-beginning-mass-layoff-process-potentially-impacting-over-100-employees/"> layed off</a> from the studio following the game's release. Likewise, a cross-over with the Hitman series was also delayed, and with today's statements from the IOI CEO, it wouldn't be surprising for it to never see the light of day.</p>



<p>MindsEye is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

            <p>Roblox will roll out selfie-based "facial age estimation technology" as a mandatory requirement for all of its players, as part of efforts to "limit communications" between minors and adults they don't know.</p>
<p>The corporation behind the massive game filled with smaller games, many of which are made by young people, say they aim to bring in this measure by the end of 2025. The news is part of a "long-term" vision for child safety in the wake of the US state of Louisiana's <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/louisiana-attorney-general-sues-roblox-calling-platform-perfect-place-rcna225144">lawsuit against Roblox Corporation over child safety concerns</a>, with Louisiana attorney general Liz Murrill accusing the game of being a "overrun with harmful content and child predators".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Roblox chief safety officer Matt Kaufman wrote in <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/09/roblox-to-expand-age-estimation-to-all-users">an announcement</a> spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/roblox-to-begin-using-facial-age-estimation-technology-on-its-users-promises-to-limit-communication-between-adults-and-minors-unless-they-know-each-other-in-the-real-world/">PC Gamer</a> that this age estimation tech will be deployed to everyone who uses the game's built-in communications systems, and will work alongside the likes of ID age verification and parental consent to "provide a more accurate measure of a user's age than simply relying on what someone types in when they create an account." On top of that, they promise "new systems" to limit minors' interactions with adult strangers.
</p>
<p>"We’re taking this step as part of our long-term vision as a platform for all ages," Kaufman added. "We expect that our approach to communication safety will become best practice for other online platforms, whether lawmakers pass laws requiring age verification for all platforms in the future or not."</p><p>Roblox's facial age estimation works by "analysing a selfie of your face and examining your facial features", at which point the user's assigned to one of three groups, under 13, over 13, and over 18. The experience the game offers changes based on which bucket folks land in, and "certain personal data, including your email and phone number, will be removed from Roblox" for those flagged as under 13 years old.</p>
<p>So, it's a slightly more in-depth iteration of the photo-based age checks you may well have had to do as part of the measures many sites and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-begin-rolling-out-xbox-account-age-verification-checks-in-response-to-uk-online-safety-act">services</a> have launched in response to the UK's Online Safety Act, with the likes of credit card and ID checks often being the alternatives. These checks haven't proven to be totally bulletproof (hello, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/714402/uk-age-verification-bypass-death-stranding-reddit-discord">Norman Reedus' Death Stranding mug</a>).</p>
<p>In addition to the legal action from Louisiana, Roblox has also faced child safety criticism from politicians like <a href="https://act.rokhanna.com/a/save-roblox-petition">Democrat Ro Khanna</a>. This isn't the first time the game has made headlines for mistreatment of children, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/roblox-studio-head-you-can-say-okay-we-are-exploiting-child-labour">accusations</a> of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/jan/09/the-trouble-with-roblox-the-video-game-empire-built-on-child-labour">exploiting game creators</a> who're often just kids or teenagers also having been lobbied at it. </p>
<p>Those behind Roblox have annoucned other steps recently to protect kids who are hopping in for a bit of Grow a Garden. That's included <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/08/more-on-removal-of-vigilantes-from-roblox">cracking down on "vigilantes"</a> who were impersonating minors in an alleged effort to catch adults behaving inappropriately, something the game's overseers argued was only confusing matters.</p>

<p>Techland is set to make us all feel alive again with Dying Light: The Beast—the third mainline entry in the survival horror series. If you want to know Dying Light: The Beast’s release date and launch times, you’ve come to the right, safe place.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-dying-light-docket-codes-the-beast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dying Light: The Beast</a> has been a long time coming. What started as DLC has become a beast within its own right. The Beast is smaller but more focused and dense compared to Dying Light 2. Old-school fans are thrilled to learn that OG protagonist Kyle Crane is back—even if he has become an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/techland-explains-kyle-crane-thirst-dying-light/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unexpected thirst trap</a>!</p>



<p>We’ve loved Dying Light: The Beast in our initial <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-preview-evolution-beyond/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming previews</a>. So let’s see its release date and what to expect.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-dying-light-the-beast-coming-out">When is Dying Light: The Beast Coming Out?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Ready for some more? Credit to Techland</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Dying Light: The Beast is locked in for a September 19 release date across various platforms.</strong></p>



<p>The hearts of the Dying Light community were broken back in July 2025 when Techland announced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-delayed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dying Light: The Beast was delayed by 4 weeks</a>. The official reasons given were “To allow for extra polishing work” and “Finetuning the balance of gameplay elements, looking into clarity of UI, increasing the quality of physics, as well as tweaking cutscene and player animations further.”</p>



<p>Again, we’ve played The Beast, and the improvements are noticeable. Expectations are very high for Dying Light: The Beast, and its release date (and start times) can’t come soon enough.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-dying-light-the-beast-s-start-times">Do We Know Dying Light: The Beast’s Start Times?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The latest. Credit to Techland</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>According to the PlayStation Store, Dying Light: The Beast is dropping at 9 PM PDT on September 18.</strong></p>



<p>Dying Light: The Beast’s <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP3050-PPSA24002_00-DLTHEBEASTP5US00" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PSN</a> listing shows the exact start time for BST above. However, this translates into 9 PM PDT on Friday, September 18. If PlayStation has this information wrong, we’ll update the guide. For now, you can go ahead with this information. </p>



<p>I’ve also listed off some other time zone starts for you below.</p>

            <p>
Roblox has announced it will expand its age estimation requirement to all users of the platform who access its communication features by the end of the year.
</p>
<p>
Back in July, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-introduces-new-safety-features-including-an-ai-to-estimate-a-teenagers-age-through-video-selfies">platform introduced new safety features</a>, including an AI used to estimate a user's age through video selfie. Now, in a new statement, the company plans to roll out age verification for all users, through facial age estimation, ID age verification, and verified parental consent.
</p>
<p>
Roblox also plans to limit communication between adults and minors, unless they know each other in the real world.
</p>
<p>
"These added layers of protection will help provide users with access to developmentally appropriate features and content," reads the <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/09/roblox-to-expand-age-estimation-to-all-users">statement from chief safety officer Matt Kaufman</a>. "We hope this move sets a standard that other gaming, social media, and communication platforms follow."
</p>
<p>
In addition to age estimation, Roblox has made a number of other advancements in its safety features:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Introducing Trusted Connections, as per its <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/07/advancing-safety-on-roblox-with-age-based-communication">previous update</a>, to safeguard communication</li>
<li>Using its open-source AI system Roblox Sentinel to detect early signs of child endangerment</li>
<li>Improving voice and text filters</li>
<li>Rolling out new technology to detect specific servers where large numbers of users are breaking rules</li>
<li>Refining its avatar detection model to scan for player characters breaking rules</li>
</ul>

<p>
Since January 2025, Roblox has shipped over a hundred safety initiatives in an effort to prove its commitment to child safety.
</p>
<p>
This is in response to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-accused-of-being-unsafe-environment-for-children">numerous reports of questionable safety</a>, for which Roblox has long been criticised.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>A new revision of the PlayStation 5 is reportedly on the way, with Sony deciding that, instead of price increases, they might give shrinkflation a try instead for PS5 model CFI-2100. Specifically for the PS5 Slim Digital Edition, the built-in SSD is set to decrease in size from 1TB back to 825GB.</p>
<p>Japanese regulatory documents were picked up on by <a href="https://kunkoku.jp/playstation5-cfi-2100-3.html">Japanese site Kunkoko in June</a>, with reliable leaker <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps5-slim-numerique-chassis-e-vers-une-reduction-du-stockage-ssd-60471">billbil-kun on French deals site Dealabs</a> now furthering this information for how Sony plan to launch the new revision.</p>


<p>PS5 model CFI-2100, also termed as Chassis E, will also have other internal tweaks and efficiencies while retaining the now standard PS5 Slim outer design. Strangely, billbil-kun reports that Sony will split production of this chassis beyond just whether or not there is a disc drive attached, so now the lower-priced Digital Edition will only come with 825GB, while the Standard edition with a disc drive will still have 1TB, as was typical since the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/10/new-ps5-slim-revealed-with-uhd-blu-ray-drive-add-on-1tb-ssd/">PS5 Slim’s debut in 2023</a>.</p>
<p>An expected release into the European market is coming on 13th September, with the current €499.99 digital edition and €549 standard edition pricing remaining since earlier this year. The separate disc drive will remain at €79.99, but it makes the digital edition even worse value than trying to find an extra €50.</p>
<p>The days of games consoles getting cheaper are seemingly well and truly gone. While Sony has made significant hardware changes to their console since launch, bringing die shrunk chipsets, reducing the size of heat sink, shrinking the console as a whole, and more, they’ve not reduced the price over time. Certainly, it has been a difficult half decade with a pandemic, massive supply chain issues, and then economic inflation, and now US tariffs all hampering their ability to do this, but it’s still pretty galling that Sony and Microsoft have both chosen to make their console hardware more expensive over time.</p>

<p>The PS5 Digital Edition has been the focus of increasing prices this year, having started at £349 / €399 in 2020, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/08/25/ps5-price-rise/">jumping to £389 / €449 in 2022</a>, holding that price with the Slim redesign and 1TB SSD increase in 2023 (at the cost of including a vertical stand), but having both <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/14/ps5-price-increases-hit-uk-eu-aus-nz-but-at-least-the-disc-drive-is-getting-cheaper/">a price increase to £429 / €499</a> and now an SSD reduction in 2025. By contrast, the Standard Edition has merely increased by £30 / €50, so Sony is really just shrinking the value margin between the two, for the time being.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-hlx-optimization/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/half-life-3-hlx-progresses-with-optimization-and-gameplay-updates.1288521/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The development of Valve's HLX project, speculated to be Half-Life 3, is proceeding with optimization, changes to gameplay mechanics, and new features.</p>



<p>In a new video shared on YouTube, known Valve dataminer and leaker <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TylerMcVicker1">Tyler McVicker</a> provided an overview of every update made for the HLX project found in the most recent Counter-Strike 2 update. While no major change has been introduced, quite a bit of work has been done on the project, with the expansion of the vehicle system, a new particle system specifically made for HLX that will handle liquids, a friction system, and a new system that will determine what happens when an enemy part is destroyed.</p>



<p>The most notable changes introduced in the project rumored to be Half-Life 3 in what has been Valve's busiest month in decades, looking at Perforce activity, the version control software used by the company that creates builds based on the most recent version of files, are related to optimization. For example, a new system that logs how much time is needed to load any game element has been introduced, suggesting work on load times optimization. Also, some cleanup and further optimization have been made in the enemy AI files, specifically for the system determining how an enemy reacts to events. This is particularly notable, as doing optimization work on these systems suggests the game is content locked. From this alone, it is impossible to tell when the project speculated to be Half-Life 3 will be revealed, but the fact that such work is being done suggests that the wait is definitely becoming shorter.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>While it was rumored that <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-playtested-summer-reveal/">Half-Life 3 HLX could finally be revealed this Summer,</a> the project remains a complete mystery. Although there's still this year's The Game Awards show, it's unlikely Valve will need any major gaming event to unveil what may be one of the most anticipated games of all time, so an announcement could really be coming at any time, to the joy of all those who have continued to be fans of the series despite its absence from the spotlight.</p>

<p>Helldivers 2 has sold more copies on Xbox than PlayStation within the first six days of launch. </p>



<p>The Xbox launch has been a great plan for Helldivers 2, contributing to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-player-numbers-surge-on-steam-after-xbox-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam player count</a> in recent days as well. Moreover, Arrowhead has also released the collaboration with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-collab-with-halo-odst-lands-with-xbox-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HALO ODST</a> alongside this launch, along with all the content the game has released since launch may have helped push more players over the edge. Now, new sales details for Helldivers 2 on Xbox have been revealed.</p>

			<p>The humble scrolling beat ‘em up has been experiencing something of a golden age in recent years, with the indie-scene enjoying a resurgence in the old-school coin-fed darling. We’ve seen modern reimagining’s of arcade classics, beat ‘em ups with roguelite elements, and even attack inputs controlled with a thumb-stick. Now, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ra-ra-boom">Ra Ra BOOM</a>, we’re witnessing a scrolling beat ‘em up combined with a scrolling shoot ‘em up. Oh, and it includes space cheer leaders.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ra Ra BOOM Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wKowKZpM2Ow?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>A rogue AI has taken over the world. We’re not told why, but maybe it got fed up with answering inane questions about Roman sanitary systems, or perhaps that’s just me? Either way, humanity has fled to a space colony to survive, but doesn’t give up hopes of fighting back. No, we’ve actually been preparing for counter AI’s aggression by… training up a group of cheerleading heroes – Saida, Aris, Vee, and Ren – to take the fight back Earth and free the world from its oppressive digital overlord.</p>


<p>What follows is a bold, bright, Saturday-morning cartoon inspired adventure in which you and up to three friends get to beat seven shades of oil out of hordes of despotic, yet oddly charming, robots. Visually Ra Ra Boom stands out with it over-the-top characters designs and a punchy colour palette. Animation is slick and smooth, our heroes cartwheeling, sliding, and double jumping around the environment with stylish abandon. Combat is strong too, made up of accessible combos and easy to implement dodges. Chargeable special attacks are suitably bombastic, laying waste to swarms of foes in blooming patters of blue fire.</p>


<p>Entire sections of the game transform into something akin to a scrolling shoot ‘em up, in which the speed of the player characters’ increase, enemies spawn in greater numbers, and you are encouraged to squeeze the trigger to unleash a delicious spray of machine gun fire, cavalcade of rockets, or a smattering of ninja throwing stars. Thanks to clear horizontal pathways mowed into the ground like the level is a fancy lawn, it’s easy to tell if you are on the same attack plane as your enemy, removing the common frustration of not being able to hit your foe as you are slightly in the wrong position.</p>
<p>It’s all eminently enjoyable silly stuff, particularly in local co-op. The problem comes with how slight the game is, perhaps even being unfinished. For example, early on in the game you’re encouraged to choose between two paths, with the tutorial informing you that this will be a regular occurrence. However, no further path choosing occurs – it’s like the devs ran out of time to actually include the feature. There are also lengthy expanses of level where nothing much happens, you just walk from left to right; no dialogue, no enemies, no nothing. The final two levels also feel rather cheap, one seeing you fight evil versions of yourselves again and again, the other featuring a supremely underwhelming final boss that is an unexpected doddle to defeat.</p>

<p>Upon completion, there’s little reason to return. Sure, you can play through each level to tick off certain challenges, but these activities are exactly the same on each stage. After being forced to shoot every enemy rather than engage in close combat five times in a row, things get pretty boring. In short, there’s a distinct vibe of this not being fully fleshed out.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		The debut release from Gylee Games has a lot going for it; a charming cartoony aesthetic and reliably punchy fisticuffs being at the forefront of that particular list. Yet, it also feels too light on content, suggesting we might have to wait for a sequel before Ra Ra Boom’s true potential is realised.	</p></div>

			<p>In true survival-horror fashion, Cronos: The New Dawn features a few items that The Travel has to acquire to complete the mission. These items like keys and keycards, are discarded automatically once they no longer useful. There's only one exception to this rule: the Bolt Cutter.</p>



<p>Much like the keys above, the <strong>Bolt Cutter</strong> is an item that is required to proceed toward one of the early game's main objectives, but once it is used to open a door locked with a chain, it isn't discarded like every other progression-related item. As inventory space in Cronos: The New Dawn is limited, bringing an item that may not look particularly useful during the moment-to-moment gameplay doesn't sound like a great idea, so <strong>is there any reason why you should bring it with you?</strong></p>



<figure><figcaption><em>There are plenty of good reasons to bring the Bolt Cutter with you in Cronos: The New Dawn</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Though some may prefer to carry more useful items as they make their way through New Dawn, <strong>bringing the Bolt Cutter with you may still be a good idea</strong>. Even though there aren't a lot of doors that require the item to open, there's at least one of them in all of the game's main locations, and inside these doors, you will find <strong>a ton of useful resources</strong> that can really make a difference in an experience where resources like ammo and crafting materials are scarce. As such, consider <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/cronos-the-new-dawn-upgrades-to-get/">expanding your Shell's inventory slots</a></strong> as much as possible in the early game, not only to always have the Bolt Cutter with you, but also to be able to carry all the items you can find inside the rooms you can access with it.</p>



<p>However, if a bit of backtracking doesn't scare you, you always have the option to leave the Bolt Cutter inside your storage crate and backtrack to retrieve it whenever you find a locked door. Cronos: The New Dawn doesn't make stage navigation too simple without a map, but after spending a few minutes inside any of the game's main locations, you should have decent knowledge of their layouts, making backtracking a little easier.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>PRAGMATA was among the most interesting titles shown at Gamescom 2025, as evidenced by <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-gamescom-hands-on-preview-an-unexpected-surprise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Francesco De Meo's preview</a> published earlier today:</p>



<p><em>Before Hugh can damage any enemy using any weapon, Dana will first have to hack them to lower their defenses. Hacking is done via some puzzle grids that are generally easy to complete, but that can be a challenge to clear with the attention divided between the minigame and avoiding damage. Once the puzzle has been completed, the enemy will be left defenseless for a short while, allowing Hugh to dispose of it. The hacking minigames promise to become more complex as Hugh discovers new abilities, as it is possible to apply debuffs via some slightly more complex puzzle grids. At the beginning of the demo, handling the two core elements of the combat system felt a little forced, but before long, I was hacking and taking down enemies with ease, all the while having extreme fun.</em></p>



<p>I also played a bit of the Gamescom 2025 demo and came away equally impressed and looking forward to the release next year. However, just in case you're among the die-hard Mega Man fans who have been speculating that PRAGMATA could somehow be connected to CAPCOM's Mega Man franchise, game producer Naoto Oyama has officially killed your dreams in a statement <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/capcom-settles-it-no-pragmata-isnt-a-secret-mega-man-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released to VideoGamesChronicle</a>:</p>



<p><em>Pragmata is not a Mega Man game. It is a completely new game from Capcom. I was actually one of the producers on the Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection as well, so I’m happy to see that people who love Mega Man are passionate about Pragmata too. From my standpoint, it’s nice to see people are being so positive about it.</em></p>



<p>It always seemed a bit of a stretch to me, but as Oyama said, ultimately it doesn't matter much as long as Mega Man fans can enjoy it all the same. The single player action/adventure game will be released at some point next year on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X after several delays (PRAGMATA was originally slated for 2022, then <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-teaser-art-delay-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2023</a>, and then again indefinitely until the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-new-trailer-provides-new-look-at-gameplay-confirms-2026-release-window/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2026 window</a>).</p>

            <p>Mewgenics finally has a release date! The endless cat breeding RPG from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-binding-of-isaac">The Binding of Isaac</a>'s Edmund McMillen will be released on 10th February, 2026 on PC. That's over 13 years since its original announcement!</p>
<p>Alongside this announcement, McMillen (one half of the Mewgenics team) released a gameplay reveal on his personal YouTube account. It's a whopping 50-minutes long, and showcases how the much-anticipated indie will actually play. You can check it out yourself down below.</p>
<p>For those unaware, Mewgenics has been on a bizarre development journey. First revealed in 2012 after the smash hit <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-meat-boy">Super Meat Boy</a>, the game was described as the "strangest project" McMillen had ever worked on. However, this version of Mewgenics was shelved and ultimately cancelled, with McMillen focusing on The Legend of Bumbo until 2018 when he acquired the rights for Mewgenics from Team Meat and began development on the game alongside Tyler Glaiel.</p>

<figure><a title="007 / Hitman" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/68598632611c7/007-hitman.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Judging from the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/007-first-light-is-more-that-just-spies-and-style-launches-march-2026-on-switch-2">recent gameplay reveal</a>, IO Interactive's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/007-first-light">007 First Light</a> is looking pretty marvellous, and it's heading to the Switch 2 on <strong>27th March 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>Now, in speaking with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hitman-dev-io-interactive-put-daniel-craigs-head-on-agent-47-when-pitching-for-james-bond-game-007-first-light">IGN</a>, game director Hakan Abrak has revealed that IO managed to secure the video game rights to James Bond in a rather amusing (albeit not entirely surprising) way. Essentially, the studio took the (digital) head of Daniel Craig, the most recent actor to portray Bond, and stuck it on Agent 47's body from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hitman-world-of-assassination-signature-edition">Hitman: World of Assassination</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="_evSaRNgyaU" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_evSaRNgyaU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_evSaRNgyaU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_evSaRNgyaU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c6dc3qmizky&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_evSaRNgyaU" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>The team then demonstrated how a Bond game would work by exploring the Sapienza level from 2016's Hitman:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We actually did put Daniel Craig in there. We just modeled his head and put it in instead of Agent 47, just for demo purposes, giving an impression of what these living, breathing spaces mean in an IO game. And if you are acquainted with the franchise, there is a level called Sapienza with the virus in the caves underneath the compound. So we showed some things off there and, yeah, it was well received.</p>
<p>"I think what they saw in us and what we are also conveying is our angle would be to try to deliver a 360 experience where it's not necessarily about only shooting and cut scenes — there's certainly that in our game as well — but it's also being able to explore the part of the Bond fantasy where he is in social spaces where he is using not only his fisticuffs, but also his charms and bluff and figuring out different ways in those social spaces to overcome the obstacles or get what he wants. How would a charming Bond fare in a situation like this where he doesn't have to necessarily resort to violence?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, we reckon it's safe to say that folks weren't exactly shocked to discover that IO, who really did tremendous work on the Hitman series, would be the ones to bring James Bond back into the world of video games. Hitman is basically Bond, but... maybe a bit more violent. Just a bit.</p>
<p>Regardless, it's a fun little story about how that project came to be, and we can't wait to check out the full game next year. 007 First Light will be available via a standard edition priced at <strong>$69.99 / €69.99 / £59.99</strong> along with a deluxe edition priced at <strong>$79.99 / €79.99 / £69.99</strong>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>CAPCOM's sci-fi game PRAGMATA has been a mystery for a good while. In the months following its announcement in <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-sci-fi-game-pragmata/">2020</a> and its eventual delay from the <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-teaser-art-delay-2023/">2022 release window</a>, very little was said about the game, making players feel it would follow in the footsteps of the ill-fated <a href="https://wccftech.com/deep-down-hasnt-been-completely-given-up-on-by-capcom-says-ono/">Deep Down</a>, an action role-playing game by the Japanese publisher that never saw the light of day. Thankfully, that was not to be the case, as a trailer shared in 2023 confirmed it was a real game with some rather unique gameplay mechanics, which were further defined in <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-new-trailer-provides-new-look-at-gameplay-confirms-2026-release-window/">subsequent showings</a>. While opinion is divided between action game fans regarding the game's unique combination of action and puzzle game elements, I feel that once PRAGMATA is in their hands sometime next year, the general consensus will be generally positive, expecially if the game's quality will be on the same level as that of the Gamescom 2025 demo.</p>



<p>The PRAGMATA Gamescom demo takes place aboard a deserted lunar research facility deep in space, where protagonist Hugh and the android Dana work together to uncover what happened to it and eventually return to Earth safely. On the surface, the game doesn't feel much different from a lot of other third-person action-adventure games, as Hugh has to navigate an intricate enough facility and complete a few simple puzzles, mostly of the navigational kind, while fighting enemies here and there. To be fair, everything feels pleasing enough to play, but the game definitely wouldn't have been very remarkable without its unique combat system combining action and puzzle game elements, which is sure to become the defining highlight of the entire experience.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>PRAGMATA's hacking mechanics add a new dimension to traditional third-person action combat that makes the game extremely fun to play.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Before Hugh can damage any enemy using any weapon, Dana will first have to hack them to lower their defenses. Hacking is done via some puzzle grids that are generally easy to complete, but that can be a challenge to clear with the attention divided between the minigame and avoiding damage. Once the puzzle has been completed, the enemy will be left defenseless for a short while, allowing Hugh to dispose of it. The hacking minigames promise to become more complex as Hugh discovers new abilities, as it is possible to apply debuffs via some slightly more complex puzzle grids. At the beginning of the demo, handling the two core elements of the combat system felt a little forced, but before long, I was hacking and taking down enemies with ease, all the while having extreme fun. The boss fight possibly even did a better job showcasing just how nicely this gameplay setup works, making for an intense battle that felt extremely dynamic with the constant switching between hacking and action gameplay, and properly taking advantage of the enemy's vulnerable state to maximize damage.</p>



<p>Having had so much fun with the demo, my time with PRAGMATA flew by way too quickly, leaving me hungering for more. With hints of things to come already noticeable from the demo, I really cannot wait to see how creative the development team got with an experience that is set to be among the most fun in action-adventure games in years. Sadly, we still don't know when we will be able to embark on this journey together with Hugh and Dana, as PRAGMATA is slated for a generic 2026 release window on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. What we do know, however, is that <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-isnt-secret-mega-man-game-says-capcom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this is not a 'secret Mega Man game'</a> after all.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <article data-ads="true" data-article-type="news" data-article-group="news" data-paywalled="false" data-premium="false" data-sponsored="false" data-type="article">


<header data-component="article-header">
  

    <div id="main-content">
  

        <p>Loose-lipped patent filings sink ships again</p>

    </div>


  

    

</header>
  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Thanks to a combination of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-might-be-moving-closer-to-a-steam-controller-2-and-new-vr-controllers-rumours-say">datamining</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valves-latest-patent-filing-is-for-a-new-vr-headset">public paperwork</a>, we know that Valve are working on, have recently been working on, or are vaguely interested in working on a thick catalogue of different PC hardware. Besides a long-rumoured Steam Machine successor, we’ve also seen evidence of an all-in-one VR headset – codenamed Deckard – and a new take on the Steam Controller, while preliminary tinkerings with a Steam Deck 2 are likely underway even with Valve’s warnings that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-community-continues-to-blow-our-minds-valve-talk-the-steam-deck-one-year-on">it’s a few years off</a>. Now, it looks like one of these has a name: the Steam Frame.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The moniker appears in, once again, <a href="https://uspto.report/TM/99370857">a Valve filing</a> with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). <a href="https://uspto.report/TM/99370861">Two</a>, in fact: one to trademark the Steam Frame as computer hardware and another to cover it under game consoles and peripherals. As well as "Cutlery, Machinery, Tools and Parts Thereof" and "Musical Instruments and Supplies," apparently. Trademark law is weird.</p>
<p>I’m going to ignore my legendarily poor record of predication-making on this website and take a punt on the Steam Frame most probably being Deckard, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-index-review">Valve Index</a> replacement that can supposedly run games off itself instead of needing to be hooked up to a separate PC. I’m guessing that the included controllers would require that second trademark application to cover it under peripherals specifically, and although that could also mean the filings are pointing to the new Steam Controller (or maybe even the next <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a>)... I dunno, "Frame" just sounds like a more fitting name for a VR kit, mainly because all the straps and clips involved can make it feel like you’re wearing scaffolding. Doubt it’s going to be a knife and fork set, anyway.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rock Paper Shotgun</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Then again, maybe it’s all just a spot of arse-covering in case Valve simply like the name and want to dibs it for something later. Trademark and patent documents are, infamously, a source of fanciful bullshit (<a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/sony-patent-mcdonalds/">MCDONALD'S!</a>) as often as they are for genuine glimpses of future tech. Then again, it wouldn’t be the first time that Valve’s regulatory dealings hinted at real, almost retail-ready products: the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-oled-review">Steam Deck OLED</a> was indirectly revealed by US and South Korean authorities certifying its upgraded Wi-Fi card.</p>
<p>We’ll see, either way. Also, just to avoid this article ending on an exceptionally nerdy note about Wi-Fi, did you know the USPTO is currently trying to <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/09/02/u-s-appeals-court-uspto-must-reconsider-if-fucks-are-for-everyone/">decide if someone can trademark the word 'Fuck'?</a></p>

<p>For a full overview of what’s being added in Marvel Rivals Season 4, including a look at the buffs and nerfs, take a look at our early patch notes.</p>

<p><strong>The full patch notes for Marvel Rivals Season 4 have not been shared yet. However, we do have an overview of some of the major additions and changes.</strong></p>



<p>In the latest <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1963300965437538535" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dev Vision video</a>, general details were provided of the new additions to the character roster, maps, and game modes.

<p>We’ve split the early patch notes for Marvel Rivals Season 4 into specific sections below to make it easier to navigate.</p>



<h3 id="h-angela-new-playable-character">Angela – New Playable Character</h3>



<p>Angela, Asgard’s Assassin and sister of Thor, is arriving at the start of Season 4 as the latest playable character, filling the Vanguard role.</p>



<p>Equipped with Ichors, a type of living fluid that can be used to create various weapons. A razor-sharp spear is used to dive on enemies, while a shield is used to block incoming damage. Finally, the Ichors can be transformed into dual axes to dish out significant damage.</p>

<p>Marvel Rivals Season 4 adds a new Team-Up, removes another, and adjusts the members of two others. We’ve detailed them below.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kidas-ceo-says-roblox-age-verification-measures-are-%E2%80%9Ceasily-bypassed%E2%80%9D-and-are-%E2%80%9Cnot-the-full-answer%E2%80%9D.1288464/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Despite The Roblox Corporation’s best intentions to protect children with new age verification tools, Kidas CEO Ron Kerbs believes it’s not enough, and has told Insider Gaming that Roblox needs to incorporate “Real-time behavioral monitoring.”</p>



<p>A new wave of age verification has emerged in the last 12 months, with businesses worldwide beginning to clamp down on who can access specific content. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-online-will-soon-require-age-verification-to-play-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA Online</a> is reportedly getting age verification, for example, and Roblox has added <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-adding-video-selfie-security-measures-to-protect-teenagers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">security measures to protect teenagers</a> in 2025.</p>



<p>There have been concerns that while this is a good start, a lot more needs to be done.</p>



<h2 id="h-roblox-requires-real-time-behavioral-monitoring-says-kidas-ceo">Roblox Requires Real-Time Behavioral Monitoring, Says Kidas CEO</h2>



<figure><figcaption>No Roblox game or community is truly safe! Image credit: Roblox Corporation</figcaption></figure>



<p>Ron Kerbs is the CEO of <a href="https://getkidas.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kidas</a>: A “Cybersecurity company committed to enhancing the safety of young gamers in the digital realm. Employing advanced AI technology, ProtectMe monitors and mitigates cyberbullying, online predators, and other digital threats in real time.</p>



<p>The company’s goal is simple: Protect kids and young gamers from online predators and harassment so they can enjoy video games with safety and peace of mind.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has obtained an exclusive quote from Ron discussing Roblox’s recent age verification measures:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Roblox’s new age verification effort is a step in the right direction—but it’s not the full answer. While technology like facial analysis and ID scans can help restrict access to mature content, these tools are still easily bypassed and don’t address the most pressing safety issues kids face online every day.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Kidas has seen evidence of how predators operate and take advantage of younger children, and is doing all it can to increase security measures:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The reality is that no verification method—AI or otherwise—can guarantee that the person behind a screen is who they claim to be. We’ve seen kids be groomed and scammed by individuals who pass verification checks but still engage in harmful behavior. What’s needed isn’t just more gates, but better guardrails. Roblox and platforms like it must invest in real-time behavioral monitoring, not just one-time identity checks. Protecting kids isn’t about proving you’re over 13—it’s about detecting when a conversation is going dangerously off track and stepping in fast. We applaud the intention. Now let’s raise the standard for execution.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We definitely need to see more action like this and companies paying greater attention to child safety. Kidas says it’s protected over 400,000 gamers and counting and issues an alarming statistic on its home page: “3&nbsp;out of&nbsp;5 U.S. kids who play online games will be scammed or harassed before age 18.”</p>



<p>Insider Gaming wants to know what <em>you </em>think. Is enough being done to protect young gamers who just want to experience the joys and thrills we all had growing up playing games without the fear of strangers and predators on the internet? Please let us know.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/how-to/cronos-the-new-dawn-how-to-defeat-armored-tier-3-orphans/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cronos-the-new-dawn-%E2%80%93-how-to-defeat-armored-tier-3-orphans.1288458/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Cronos: The New Dawn features a lot of powerful Orphan enemies to defeat, but for the vast majority of them, accurate headshots with any weapon are more than enough to take them down with relative ease. This is not the case for the most powerful Orphans and those who manage to consume multiple bodies, which are easily recognizable by a peculiar trait: <strong>most of their body is covered in tentacles</strong>, making them look as if they are wearing a suit of armor. Besides making them look markedly different from any other Orphan, <strong>this sort of armor made of tentacles makes them more difficult to take down</strong>. If you try shooting at any part covered in tentacles, you will notice that your shots will <strong>bounce off.</strong> As such, you will have either have to <strong>deal with the tentacle armor first, or completely change your combat approach.</strong></p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Shooting canisters to set enemies on fire and weaken them is one of the core gameplay mechanics in Cronos: The New Dawn.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Lowering the extreme defenses these Cronos: The New Dawn enemies have is not too difficult, if you have the right resources or if you are in the right place, as <strong>setting them on fire will leave them defenseless for a short while</strong>. To do so, you will either have to use the flamethrower, a Pyre bomb, or shoot canisters and the like if any are nearby. If you are in a bind, this is also the easiest way to deal with these armored enemies, as you won't need to do any accurate shooting to damage them once you set them on fire.</p>



<p>If you have no means to set these armored Orphans on fire, you can still take them down with a bit of effort. Although the tentacle armor seems impenetrable,<strong> it always leaves some parts of their bodies exposed</strong>, usually one of their arms, so if you focus your shots on these parts, you can take them down without setting them on fire. As these enemies have a lot of health, you'd better use a weapon with high firepower like any shotgun, otherwise you risk prolonging the fight too much and wasting precious ammo for the handgun, which you should save for weaker enemies.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Helldivers 2 shows no signs of slowing down, with releases coming thick and fast, with the new Dust Devils Premium Warbond now available—but is it worth it?</p>



<p>After the long-awaited Xbox launch last week, which coincided with the release of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-halo-odst-legendary-warbond-price-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo ODST Legendary Warbond</a>, a fresh update has brought a wealth of new challenges. Whether you’re taking down the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-hive-lord-hp-best-loadout/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hive Lord</a>, or <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-destroy-spore-lung/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">destroying Spore Lungs</a>, new gear will not go amiss.</p>



<p>We’ve got all the details on the Dust Devils Premium Warbond here, including a breakdown of what’s included and whether it’s worth spending your hard-earned Super Credits on.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-much-is-the-dust-devils-premium-warbond">How Much is The Dust Devils Premium Warbond?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Plenty of gear. Image via Arrowhead Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Dust Devils Premium Warbond in Helldivers 2 costs 1,000 Super Credits, the standard price of Warbonds in the game.</strong></p>



<p>This translates to $9.99 in real-world money, though you don’t need to spend at all, as Super Credits can be farmed in the game. You can also use a Warbond Token to unlock the full pass.</p>



<p>As usual with Warbonds in Helldivers 2, there is no limited-time period to make the purchase, and it will remain available permanently, so you can purchase it whenever you like.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-rewards-in-the-helldivers-2-dust-devils-premium-warbond">All Rewards in the Helldivers 2 Dust Devils Premium Warbond</h2>



<p><strong>The Dust Devils Warbond in Helldivers 2 has a total of 22 rewards to claim, including two armor sets, three Stratagems, and a new assault rifle.</strong></p>



<p>Rewards in the Dust Devils Warbond are geared around the latest content drop, introducing Hive planets, providing effective firepower to take down the threats they pose, along with accompanying cosmetics.</p>



<p>We’ve got a full breakdown of every reward in the Dust Devils Warbond below, including the Medals required to unlock them.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Reward</th><th data-align="center">Type</th><th data-align="center">Medals Required</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Rightful Occupier</td><td data-align="center">Cape</td><td data-align="center">8</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">DS-42 Federation’s Blade</td><td data-align="center">Helmet</td><td data-align="center">30</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">100x Super Credits</td><td data-align="center">Bonus</td><td data-align="center">7</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Rattlesnake Hellpod</td><td data-align="center">Pattern</td><td data-align="center">20</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">DS-42 Federation’s Blade</td><td data-align="center">Armor</td><td data-align="center">45</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Rightful Occupier</td><td data-align="center">Player Card</td><td data-align="center">2</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">AR-2 Coyote</td><td data-align="center">Assault Rifle</td><td data-align="center">35</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Speargun</td><td data-align="center">Stratagem</td><td data-align="center">85</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">DS-191 Scorpion</td><td data-align="center">Helmet</td><td data-align="center">45</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">DS-191 Scorpion</td><td data-align="center">Armor</td><td data-align="center">55</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Windswept Wayfarer</td><td data-align="center">Player Card</td><td data-align="center">7</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Windswept Wayfarer</td><td data-align="center">Cape</td><td data-align="center">25</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Rattlesnake Shuttle</td><td data-align="center">Pattern</td><td data-align="center">50</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Expendable Napalm</td><td data-align="center">Stratagem</td><td data-align="center">85</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">100x Super Credits</td><td data-align="center">Bonus</td><td data-align="center">12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Solo Silo</td><td data-align="center">Stratagem</td><td data-align="center">110</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Raider’s Cheer</td><td data-align="center">Emoted</td><td data-align="center">20</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Rattlesnake Exosuit</td><td data-align="center">Pattern</td><td data-align="center">50</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">100x Super Credits</td><td data-align="center">Bonus</td><td data-align="center">32</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Rattlesnake Vehicle</td><td data-align="center">Pattern</td><td data-align="center">55</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">G-7 Pineapple</td><td data-align="center">Throwable</td><td data-align="center">65</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Burier of Heads</td><td data-align="center">title</td><td data-align="center">20</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-is-the-dust-devils-premium-warbond-worth-it">Is the Dust Devils Premium Warbond Worth it?</h2>



<p><strong>The Dust Devils Premium Warbond in Helldivers 2 is definitely worth purchasing for additional firepower to take down the Hive Worlds introduced in the Into The Unjust update.</strong></p>



<p>With missions on the Hive planets taking you deep underground, where your Stratagems are ineffective unless you manage to find an opening in the tunnel system, the weapons included in the Dust Devils Warbond are the perfect tools for the job.</p>



<p>The AR-2 Coyote assault rifle is ideal for mowing through the Terminid hordes, with the incendiary ammunition packing a punch, and the G-7 Pineapple cluster frag grenade is similarly effective for taking out large groups of enemies.</p>



<p>Both pale in comparison with the EAT-700 Expendable Napalm, a single-use missile that contains napalm cluster bombs, and the MS-11 Solo Silo, which calls down a Hellpod-sized missile silo with a single, ultra-powerful missile and a handheld targeting remote—though the latter may require being outside of the cave system.</p>



<p>The Dust Devils Warbond is a worthwhile addition for any Helldiver, though it’s particularly useful for any new Xbox players who perhaps don’t have an arsenal as expansive as their PC and PlayStation counterparts just yet.</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> CEO Hakan Abrak has commented on the disastrous launch of Build A Rocket Boy's action game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mindseye">MindsEye</a> back in June, stating it wasn't what the company hoped for.
</p>
<p>
IOI provided assistance distributing the game through its IOI Partners publishing arm. Now, at a recent event for the company's forthcoming Bond game, Abrak spoke to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/that-was-definitely-tough-right-ceo-of-mindseye-publisher-ioi-responds-to-disastrous-launch">IGN</a> about MindsEye's launch.
</p>
<p>
"The initial talks we had with those guys were to support them," said Abrak. "We thought they had some great ideas and a great world in the background that they were building, and hopefully they'll get the opportunity to show more of that in the future. And we just wanted to help them distribute the game."

<p>
"Well, that was definitely tough, right?," Abrak continued, speaking of the launch itself. "It was a tough reception. It wasn't what they hoped for, and also what we didn't hope for at IOI Partners. They're working hard on turning that around to regain the trust of the gamers out there, and they have tons of potential and content they're working on. So hopefully they'll succeed with that in the future."
</p>
<p>
Ahead of the game's release, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-boss-claims-games-negative-reaction-ahead-of-release-has-been-paid-for-in-concerted-effort-against-studio">co-CEO of Build A Rocket Boy suggested negative reaction to MindsEye had been paid for</a> in a "concerted effort" against the studio. At the time, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-publisher-doesnt-believe-negative-comments-were-paid-for-despite-developer-suggesting-otherwise">Abrak stated</a>: "I don't believe that."
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-studio-execs-depart-build-a-rocket-boy-one-week-before-games-debut">Two studio execs departed the studio</a> just one week before it debuted and then, once released, it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-launches-with-myriad-of-glitches-and-issues-as-developer-promises-performance-update">clear MindsEye was full of technical issues</a>. The studio promised performance updates, but later a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseyes-hitman-crossover-mission-delayed-leaving-its-community-starving-for-content">Hitman crossover mission was delayed by IO Interactive</a>.
</p>
<p>
So, has the Hitman and Bond studio been too burned by its work with Build A Rocket Boy to continue with similar publishing work?
</p>
<p>
"So, IO Interactive will publish our own games internally," said Abrak. "IOI Partners? That remains to be seen."
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-review">MindsEye received a one star review from Eurogamer</a>. "Although it shows some early promise, MindsEye is sunk by a ridiculous story, inconsistent writing, poorly designed mission scenarios, and utterly atrocious combat," it reads.

<p>Now, there's no eShop page currently live, nor are there any pre-order options for this one, so if you want to dive into the hotly anticipated sequel as early as you possibly can, you'll want to be there at drop time. Don't worry, we've got you covered.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Team Cherry revealed the release times in a handful of regions, but we thought it was only right to recap 'em all for you now, so you don't miss out on any valuable metroidvania minutes. You'll find the exact time Silksong launches in your region below:</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067jmslzn&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>The game will set you back <strong>$19.99 / €19.99 / ¥2300</strong> (there's no GBP price info available at the time of writing, but we have to imagine it'll be £19.99 too), and there's even a free upgrade path to the Switch 2 version of the game if you decide to pick up the S1 edition today.</p>
<p>And we'll be diving right in with you. Team Cherry confirmed that it wouldn't be sending our pre-launch codes, so we'll be setting out on our underground adventure today and will endeavour to have our review with you as soon as possible.</p>

The Valve Fremont <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valve-fremont-steam-console-appears-on-geekbench/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">recently appeared</a> in a listing on benchmarking platform Geekbench, further fueling speculation around the project.</p><p>While the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-machines-first-impressions-the-specs-prices-/1100-6425734/" data-ref-id="1100-6425734">Steam Machine</a>, Valve's first foray into compact gaming hardware running the Linux-based SteamOS, was a flop, the company has had better luck with recent releases including the popular handheld Steam Deck. Many have speculated that Valve would return to console-like hardware for SteamOS after the Steam Deck's success, and recent news is making a console announcement look more likely.</p><p>As for what exactly the Steam Frame will be, the multiple trademarks suggest the branding could be intended to cover multiple upcoming hardware devices, as well as their related peripherals.</p>

                <p>Prior to this year, the release date for the Nintendo Switch 2 console was the subject of numerous rumors and speculative reports. The wait for fans officially ended in early June, but a new report states that Nintendo pushed back the Switch 2 launch multiple times despite the frustration of third-party companies.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2025-nintendo-switch2/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, the reason Nintendo didn't rush Switch 2 to the market is because its designers requested extended deadlines for the launch titles in order to "perfect" them. Nintendo prioritized that above all other concerns, including the third-party publishers and fans who clamored for the console for years.</p><p>Earlier this summer, a separate report noted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-dev-kits-still-sound-somewhat-rare-even-2-months-after-launch-report/1100-6534247/" data-ref-id="1100-6534247">Switch 2 development kits are still rare among third-party</a> companies even months after launch. It's believed that issue may be the reason <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lack-of-switch-2-dev-kits-could-explain-limited-third-party-game-announcements-report/1100-6533186/" data-ref-id="1100-6533186">why some Switch 2 third-party titles have yet to be officially announced</a>. Nintendo's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-third-party-developer-claims-that-sales-were-below-our-lowest-estimates/1100-6532572/" data-ref-id="1100-6532572">Switch 2 launch titles have also outsold the third-party games</a> for the console by a much higher ratio than expected.</p><p>Nintendo released a statement last month that said it regrets <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-regrets-the-inconvenience-of-switch-2-selling-out-all-the-time/1100-6533634/" data-ref-id="1100-6533634">the inconvenience caused by Switch 2's scarcity</a>. The company confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-sales-blast-past-expectations-now-6-million-globally/1100-6533625/">Switch 2 sold over 6 million units</a> by the first week of August, and it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-sales-massively-outpacing-switch-1-sales-so-far-in-the-us/1100-6534305/" data-ref-id="1100-6534305">has reportedly moved 2 million consoles</a> in North America alone.</p><p>For now, Switch 2 is the only major modern console that hasn't been hit by a price hike over tariffs. However, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-could-get-more-expensive-in-2026-analyst-predicts/1100-6534130/" data-ref-id="1100-6534130">that may change in 2026</a>.</p>

            <p>Nintendo recently released an update for Switch Online, which among other little tweaks adds a nice, nostalgia infused Easter egg to the Game Boy Advance app.</p>
<p>This Easter egg can be found by twiddling with the analogue stick while booting up the Game Boy Advance app. If you do this, you will be met with the classic GBA bootup sequence.</p>
<p>You can see how the Easter egg looks via the video I took this morning.</p> <div>

<p>Marvel Rivals developers have confirmed plans to introduce Placement Matches to the ranked mode for new seasons, though there is no details on exactly when it will release.</p>



<p>Since its launch in December 2024, Marvel Rivals’ ranked set-up has attracted criticism from players, particularly at the start of new seasons when things reset, as higher-ranked players drop several tiers.</p>



<p>This has made the first few days of a new season in ranked incredibly unbalanced, a frustrating experience for players, but devs have been listening to feedback and announced plans to bring placement matches into the fray.</p>

<p>Announced at the end of the latest <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1963300965437538535" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">dev Vision video</a> ahead of the drop of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-marvel-rivals-season-4-release-exact-release-date-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 4 on September 12</a>, Marvel Rivals devs acknowledged the discussions in the community on the back of the recently released details explaining <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-developers-explain-matchmaking-system-after-player-criticism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how the matchmaking system works</a>.</p>



<p>It was confirmed that the team is “already working on implementing Placement Matches,” but, as it is a “complex feature with a lot of moving parts,” the team needs “more time for development and thorough testing.”</p>



<p>While Placement Matches won’t be ready for the drop of Season 4, the team is “pushing forward as quickly as we can.”</p>



<p>It remains to be seen whether Placement Matches will be a major feature that drops as part of Season 5, which is expected to launch in early November. Exact details of the Season 5 launch are not known, though the start date should be revealed by the Season 4 Battle Pass.</p>
