		<p>Koei Tecmo has announced and released a demo for its monster hunting game Wild Hearts S on Switch 2, ahead of the game’s release on July 25th. The Wild Hearts S demo consists of the first area of the game, called Haragasumi Way, and it can be played either solo or in multiplayer for up to four players to hunt together. You can grab the demo by heading to <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-games/WILD-HEARTS-S-2848001.html#">WILD HEARTS S page&nbsp;</a>on Nintendo’s site, or on the Switch 2 store.</p>
<p><iframe title="WILD HEARTS S: Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gGflRQNZk-I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In the Wild Hearts S demo, players can wander around all of Haragusumi Way, experiment with the different karakuri tools that get unlocked, and find the tsumoko robots that can assist in battle. There are also different weapons to forge and upgrade while in the area, so you can figure out what the best weapon style is for you from wielding the starter katana to other things like a giant hammer, and a deadly umbrella. If you are planning to get the full release of Wild Hearts S it is definitely worth jumping into the demo as all progress will carry over to the main game.</p>

<p>In our Wild Hearts review, Dom said, <em>“Wild Hearts has proved to be an immense surprise. It navigates the line between well-worn ground and exciting new innovation immensely well. It’s the best non-Capcom hunting game we’ve ever had, and a hugely enjoyable action RPG in its own right.”</em></p>

<p>We knew that the team behind <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a> has been busy working on Donkey Kong Bananza, but it's now been confirmed that Kazuya Takahashi is serving as the game's director, while Kenta Motokura is the game's producer.</p>
<p>Motokura previously directed Super Mario Odyssey and worked on the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_mario_sunshine">Super Mario Sunshine</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/pikmin">Pikmin</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/super_mario_galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a>, while Takahashi only joined Nintendo back in 2020, bringing with him some key experience in open-world game design.</p><div><figure data-videoid="Vb6JFhMsLFI" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c2cb8hzwqms&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb6JFhMsLFI" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Of course, the key question in our minds now is what this might potentially mean for the next 3D Mario title. With Motokura on producing duties for Bananza, does this mean he's also been busy creating a new Mario title. It's almost guaranteed at this point that <em>something</em> is in the works, but when and how it shows up is anyone's guess.</p>
<p>Donkey Kong Bananza is scheduled to launch exclusively on the Switch 2 on <strong>17th July 2025</strong>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nba-2k26-announced</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nba-2k26-announced-for-september-switch-2-version-also-coming.1240287/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>2K has announced that&nbsp;<em>NBA 2K26</em>, the latest installment in the long-running&nbsp;<em>NBA 2K&nbsp;</em>series of basketball sim games, will be launching in September, and that the game is coming to the Nintendo Switch 2 as well.</p>

<p>Judging by the <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250709742024/en/NBA-2K26-Unveils-2025-MVP-and-Finals-MVP-Shai-Gilgeous-Alexander-WNBA-All-Star-Angel-Reese-and-Hall-of-Famer-Carmelo-Anthony-as-Cover-Athletes" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a> in which the game was revealed, the Switch 2 version will boast the same features as the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S versions, so for the first time in many years, Nintendo's platform won't be getting the last-gen edition.</p>

<p>Those features include an updated ProPLAY system, which 2K says will allow you to "experience the immersive technology like never before", as well as the City hub, the WNBA-focused The W game mode, and the MyNBA mode, in which you can lead your own franchise to legendary status.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nba-2k26-shai-gilgeous-alexander.jpg?itok=yy1vmEts 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nba-2k26-shai-gilgeous-alexander.jpg?itok=0L2guqkw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>NBA 2K26&nbsp;</em>will feature Shai Gilgeous-Alexander as its cover star.</figcaption></figure><p>The cover athlete for the Standard Edition of&nbsp;<em>NBA 2K26&nbsp;</em>will be none other than Oklahoma City Thunder point guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, while WNBA star Angel Reese will adorn the cover of the GameStop-exclusive WNBA Edition of the game. Finally, the Superstar Edition's cover star is Hall of Famer Carmelo Anthony.</p>

<p>As well as all of the above, 2K says you can look forward to "a reimagined MyCAREER journey" in&nbsp;<em>NBA 2K26</em>, in addition to "a fresh and more optimized City" in the current-gen versions of the game. This iteration's MyNBA mode will feature "30 unique storylines", as 2K tells it.</p>

<p>Otherwise, you know what to expect from&nbsp;<em>NBA 2K26&nbsp;</em>if you're a fan of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nba-2k25-release-date" rel="nofollow">the series</a>:&nbsp;a slick basketball sim with plenty of improvements and new features, plus the usual egregious microtransactions, I'd imagine. You can check out the debut trailer for the game right here.</p>




<p><em>NBA 2K26&nbsp;</em>launches across PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch consoles on September 5th. Picking up the Superstar Edition or the Leave No Doubt Edition of the game will allow you to check it out a week early, as has become customary among new releases.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>The creation of <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/642699/donkey-kong-bananza-hands-on-preview-switch-2">Donkey Kong Bananza</a></em> started with destruction.</p></div><p>“What we were really going for was this gameplay experience that comes from destruction,” <em>Bananza</em> director Kazuya Takahashi says in an interview with <em>The Verge</em>. From that simple premise, <em>Bananza</em>’s creators have built an entire game about breaking stuff. </p><p><em>Bananza</em> is the second major Switch 2 exclusive from Nintendo, and it’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/695726/donkey-kong-bananza-developers-super-mario-odyssey">made by the same developers that worked on <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em></a>, one of the games that came out during the launch window of the original Switch. According to the developers on<em> Bananza</em>, Donkey Kong’s appetite for destruction didn’t start with his beloved bananas, as one might expect, but with cheese. </p><p>“We had used voxel technology in <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>,” says <em>Bananza</em> producer Kenta Motokura. “For example, in the luncheon kingdom, you can dig through large piles of cheese, and in the snow kingdom, can plow your way through snow.”</p><p>Voxels, simply put, are the chunks that make up a digital world. The same way a pixel represents the smallest unit of a flat digital image, a voxel is like the smallest unit of a 3D object, and a technology Nintendo was working with way back in the days of the original Switch. In fact, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/671611/mario-kart-world-9-nintendo-explanation">much like <em>Mario Kart World</em> before it</a>, <em>Bananza</em> was originally planned to be an OG Switch title.</p><p>“We had in mind all of these possibilities using voxel technology,” says Motokura. “But we realized when we learned about Switch 2 that there were even greater possibilities to explore.”</p><p>Those greater possibilities were twofold: variety in the kinds of materials DK could smash and the ability to make that destruction persist. “With the Switch 2, we found that we could create lots of different kinds of destructible objects,” says Takahashi. “This created a very diverse experience of destruction within the game.”</p><p>In <em>Bananza</em>, there’s very little DK can’t break, smashing through layers of rocks, mud, snow, thorns, and molten chocolate masquerading as lava. They fracture in different ways and make different sounds when hit. And rather than having a destroyed chunk of material reappear after some time, as some games with destructible environments do, the damage you do sticks.</p><p>“What’s really important to that experience is that this destruction is continuous,” Takahashi continues. “That you can destroy something and find something interesting behind it, and then destroy something behind that, and keep on going with new discoveries.”</p><p>For the developers, another part of the <em>Bananza</em> puzzle was figuring out who Donkey Kong is now. He hasn’t been the kind of character to go explorin’ since his days of digging up bananas in <em>Donkey Kong 64</em>, 26 years ago. He’s also rarely alone, accompanied by any number of Kong sidekicks or attached to whatever Mario and friends are doing at the time. He’s not alone in <em>Bananza</em> either, this time palling around with a young Pauline. </p><p>It makes sense that Pauline would accompany him, since in the deep Donkey Kong lore, Pauline was the woman he (or a younger version of Cranky Kong) kidnapped in the original <em>Donkey Kong</em> arcade game. But DK already has a gallery of sidekicks, and Motokura says that the subject of partners came up early in the development process, with Pauline being one of the potentials. </p><p>“Very early on this idea came up that Pauline would be a good choice in this case, but it wasn’t implemented right away,” he says. Pauline’s addition would only come later as the development team worked out the kinds of powers DK would use.</p><p>There are animals Donkey Kong can transform into, with each animal giving him a unique power. His base form, which is simply DK himself, allows him to smash through harder materials, like concrete. The zebra form allows him to run over water and other crumbly materials. There are several animal powers DK can use, and the developers asked the music department to create special songs for each transformation. Pauline is a performer. We got a bit of that during the New Donk City performance in <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>. Once it was established that music would initiate Donkey Kong’s transformations, Pauline became a natural fit as a sidekick. </p><p>“From that idea,” Motokura says, “suddenly it was like, ‘Okay, well, then Pauline should be the one to sing.’” Pauline’s music is just as integral to the game as DK’s destruction. Her singing creates musical notes DK can follow to the next objective and it helps her communicate with the creatures they encounter. It even lets her get in on the destructive fun.</p><p>“We also have in co-op play the opportunity for a second player to control Pauline’s voice blasts that affect enemies and the environment,” Motokura says. “So a lot of unique gameplay ideas really just fell into place in <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> once we had placed Pauline as the accompanying character.”</p><p>In <em>Bananza</em>, your job is to move fast and break things. It’s baked into nearly every aspect of the game, right down to its UI, where selecting an option breaks the corresponding button into little pieces. And though the idea of “just break stuff” seems like it’d be a little one-note to hang a game on, the developers have created a game in which you gotta break it to make it.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/703468/donkey-kong-bananza-developer-interview-switch-2]]></content:encoded>

With charge jumps, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-world/" data-ref-id="5000-658545">Mario Kart World</a> seemed to add yet another technique to get some marginal gains and edge out opponents--but the story isn't that simple.</p><p>Charge jumps, which are essentially drifts done on straightaways instead of corners, come with all the same visual indicators of granting a speed boost as classic drifting, but it turns out that the technique may technically slow you down. Following intensive investigation from the Mario Kart community, fans have seemingly confirmed that normal acceleration on a straight is preferable to charge-jumping.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmwKJiP4r-8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EmwKJiP4r-8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>YouTube user Karting All Day comprehensively explored the differences in speed between charge-jumping and normal racing in the video embedded above. <a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-charge-jump-speed-boost-too-slow-1851785905" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a> also independently confirmed the results across different top-speed builds.</p><p>So what, then, is the point of Nintendo even adding this capability to the game? There are a few reasons why charge-jumping can still be useful. In general, they're a way to gain access to certain things; a quick charge jump can get you up to the requisite height to grab a grind rail, and they can also help start wall rides.</p><p>Mario Kart World launched alongside the Switch 2 last month, and it has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/79-of-switch-2-buyers-in-the-us-also-bought-mario-kart-world/1100-6532449/" data-ref-id="1100-6532449">a commercial success</a>.

Ahead of that release, Bungie has made the past three years' worth of Destiny 2 content available to anyone, absolutely free.</p><p>Starting with 2022's The Witch Queen, you can now dive into the story of Savathun, explore the villain arc of The Witness in Lightfall, and watch it all come to a conclusion in The Final Shape until July 22. That gives you a few weeks to blast through the main story content of each of the expansions before diving into The Edge of Fate to find out what comes next.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Destiny 2: The Edge Of Fate Might Revitalize My Interest</p>
      </div>
<p>Alongside the expansions, Bungie has also given open access to all players to the Echoes, Revenant, and Heresy Episodes. These Episodes follow the events of The Final Shape, setting up the story for the new expansion as well as tying up a few loose ends left behind. These Episodes are only available until the release of The Edge of Fate, meaning they'll be unavailable after July 15.</p><p>However, all rewards, Titles, Triumphs, and cosmetics earned as part of those Episodes will remain on your account after the open access ends.</p><p>The Final Shape marked the conclusion of a decade-old saga, but The Edge of Fate starts a new story, with new enemies, and a fresh location to explore in the form of the planet Kepler. This time around, we'll be dealing with The Nine--a strange alien lifeforce which no one really understands. There'll be plenty of mysteries and secrets to uncover, and you can even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-can-break-the-new-destiny-2-expansion-but-bungie-wants-you-to/1100-6532890/" data-ref-id="1100-6532890">sequence break</a> the game in order to unravel them all, which Bungie says is intentional.</p><p>There are plenty of new additions coming with The Edge of Fate, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/destiny-2-edge-of-fate-livestream-all-the-new-exotics-weapons-and-artifact-mods/2900-6699/" data-ref-id="2900-6699">new weapons</a>, a complete overhaul of the gear system, and a new location to explore with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2s-kepler-destination-has-a-limited-time-activity-thatll-give-you-new-exotics/1100-6532892/" data-ref-id="1100-6532892">time-limited activity </a>never seen before. Alongside this, all players will have their power level reset to 200, meaning you'll no longer be horribly overleveled compared to your newcomer friends. That does come with the caveat that you might have to work a little harder to be ready for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-edge-of-fate-raid-race-start-date-duration-and-epic-raid-details/1100-6532888/" data-ref-id="1100-6532888">The Edge of Fate raid </a>race. If you're waiting for the perfect moment to force your unwilling friends into the sprawling space shooter, it might just be right now.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/subnautica-2-delayed-2026</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/subnautica-2-delayed-to-2026-new-gameplay-trailer-revealed.1240257/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Krafton has announced that upcoming underwater survival sequel&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>has been delayed to next year, but we've got a new gameplay trailer to keep us going in the meantime.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1962700/view/528724684296950298" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> on Steam, Krafton and developer Unknown Worlds (which Krafton <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pubg-owner-krafton-buys-subnautica-dev-unknown-worlds" rel="nofollow">acquired back in 2021</a>) say that while early player feedback convinced the studios they were "swimming in the right direction", more development time is needed to "improve" in "a few areas", as well as to provide "a little bit more content" for the Early Access release.</p>

<p>This new content will, according to Krafton, include "more biomes, more vehicle upgrades, additional tools", and an expanded story, as well as "more creatures to discover". Given the breadth of the biological phenomena in the original&nbsp;<em>Subnautica</em>, I'd call that a good reason for a delay.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/subnautica-2-early-access-delayed-2026-lava.jpg?itok=98lLW2Ye 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/subnautica-2-early-access-delayed-2026-lava.jpg?itok=mWXu_PLk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Subnautica 2</em>'s Early Access release has been delayed.</figcaption></figure><p>Although&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2</em>'s Early Access release won't be happening in 2025 anymore, Krafton says it doesn't intend to change anything about the game's creative direction or the team working on it, although that presumably doesn't include the former leaders of Unknown Worlds, who <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/subnautica-developer-unknown-worlds-loses-leadership-team" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">left the studio</a> earlier this month. No reason was provided for their departure.</p>

<p>Additionally, Krafton says you can look forward to a new&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>devlog that will provide more information about the game soon, although it'll be coming out "a little later than intended".</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2</em>, it's the upcoming sequel to the 2018 survival game&nbsp;<em>Subnautica</em>, which has already had one standalone followup in the form of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/subnautica-below-zero" rel="nofollow">2021's&nbsp;<em>Below Zero</em></a>.</p>

<p>Unlike the original game,&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>will emphasize co-op play, although it will also feature a solo play option. The game will tell a new story set on a brand new planet full of strange aquatic life to discover (and run away from screaming, if it's anything like the first game).</p>




<p><em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>is due to launch for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1962700/Subnautica_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/subnautica-2/9PJPCB188SVG" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> via Early Access in 2026. Stay tuned for more.</p>

Huge warehouses, bases, and ruins so stuffed with cover and walkways as to suggest the dominant species on the game's pre-alien invasion earth were sandbag piles. These sprawling layouts aren't just for show or getting a nice height advantage, either. The city is explorable between battles with your gang of resistance members, letting you poke around and scavenge before sneaking into optimal positions for the next scrap against invading aliens.</p>

<p>My own personal reaction to realising I'm trapped in a time loop would be the Bill Murray approach, i.e <a href="https://youtu.be/dTbGzGQCe-o">inserting large slices of cake</a> into my mouth, to the audible disgust of Andie MacDowell. Here, you'll be using it to your advantage by learning the location of useful discoveries for subsequent runs. These roguelite bits also make themselves known through a sort of push-your-luck heat meter, where subsequent fights get tougher and enemies more numerous, but also offer better rewards.</p>
<p>The executive producer on the game is YouTube tactics man ChristopherOdd, who I credit for making me markedly less rubbish at XCOM many years ago by offering the simple but transformative advice to prioritise finishing off aliens over everything else - the thinking being that one stray shot from one lowly sectoid can feasibly still kill your best guy. Good advice! Here's him narrating <a href="https://youtu.be/UGywygR2oLA">the game's feature overview trailer</a>. I should also point out how much I appreciate this kind of calm, epic strings-free explanation of what a game actually is. Good trailer!</p>
<blockquote><p>The arrival of the Rifters brought the world to a standstill, but life goes on for your fighters. Uncover their checkered pasts as they learn to work together. Unveil the mystery of the alien invaders and their control over time as you fight through the streets of a once-beautiful city to reveal the full truth about the war. Your resistance grows stronger with each success, and with each failure – after all, death is only the beginning.</p></blockquote>
<p>Every Day We Fight should be on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1546080/Every_Day_We_Fight/">Steam in early access</a> by the time you read this, unless you've somehow snuck in the RPS content management system, in which case: get out! The lingering scent of bumeggs and Peter Monyleux squirming is ours to enjoy alone.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/manor-lords-publishers-time-loop-tactics-rpg-every-day-we-fight-is-out-today-in-early-access]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo will discontinue its Switch Game Vouchers scheme, which currently allows Nintendo Switch Online subscribers to buy Switch 1 games at a discount.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Detailing its plans in a lengthy <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Support/Nintendo-Switch/Nintendo-Switch-Game-Vouchers-FAQ-1560656.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FAQ page</a> published today, the company said Switch Game Vouchers would be ditched as of January 30, 2026 — meaning fans still have six months should they still wish to buy more. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">No reason has been given for the scheme's ending, though it follows Nintendo's decision not to allow vouchers to be redeemed for Switch 2 software, and after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-isnt-the-only-nintendo-switch-2-game-that-costs-80-some-nintendo-switch-2-edition-games-do-as-well">the launch of Nintendo's first-ever $80 game</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo Switch Game Vouchers were first introduced in 2019, and offer a flat purchase price for two Nintendo Switch games bought within a 12-month period. In the UK, this price is set at £84, meaning you pay an average of £42 for a game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This typically represents an £8 saving per game from the standard £50 Switch game RRP — and an even greater saving on the select games that Nintendo prices at £60: Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And while Nintendo has not extended the scheme to Switch 2 games, fans have realised they can still use vouchers to buy the original, Switch 1 versions of games with paid Switch 2 upgrades, such as Zelda: Breath of the Wild, offering a cheaper method of obtaining those too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For example, Switch 2 owners can currently buy a pair of Switch Game Vouchers and redeem them to play cross-generational games such as Metroid Prime: Beyond, or the upcoming Pokémon Legends: Z-A, which is due for launch in October. Z-A is priced at the usual £50 for Switch 1, or £60 for its Switch 2 Edition. Buy it using a Game Voucher,  and you can still get the £8 saving for Z-A's Switch 1 edition, before simply paying the £10 upgrade fee to access the Switch 2 Edition.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As ever, Switch Game Vouchers must be redeemed within 12 months after purchase, though Nintendo has said that additional Switch titles will continue to be added to the Game Voucher catalogue throughout 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa recently suggested that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-says-game-development-risks-increasing-due-to-higher-game-prices-and-rising-production-costs-suggests-shorter-development-periods-as-one-solution">the company was now exploring shorter game development cycles for some projects</a> to help keep its costs down, and avoid pricing games too highly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

                <p>Owlcat Games' The Expanse: Osiris Reborn is a space-set third-person action-RPG based on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sci-fi-fans-can-save-big-on-the-expanse-complete-series-on-blu-ray-at-amazon/1100-6520164/" data-ref-id="1100-6520164">The Expanse TV series</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-expanse-james-sa-corey-captives-war-trilogy-amazon-prime-deal/1100-6525559/" data-ref-id="1100-6525559">the novels by James S. A. Corey</a> (aka Daniel Abraham and Ty Franck). When the trailer debuted earlier this summer, the comparisons to Mass Effect were almost immediate. Alexander Mishulin--the game's creative director--recently acknowledged that Mass Effect influenced the development of Osiris Reborn. But the team plans to go in its own direction rather than simply copying Mass Effects' approach.</p><p>"It's different [from Mass Effect] in many ways," Mishulin told <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/611007/expanse-osiris-reborn-mass-effect-comparisons" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>. "First of all, we make our story a little bit differently. We're making more choices and consequences, and we want to make sure that this game still has a lot of them provided with a lot of agency."</p><p>As an example, Mishulin noted that players won't be locked into character paths like paragon or renegade. The player can decide whether their characters come from Earth, Mars, or the Belt. That choice will affect how NPC and companion characters react and relate to them during the game.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIQifuOTTe8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="2">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pIQifuOTTe8?start=2" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The game's story is set during the first two and a half seasons of The Expanse, and the player's character will be the captain of the most advanced ship in the galaxy. Regardless of the player's choices, the captain is also a twin, and both siblings are on board the ship. However, the twins may not always see eye-to-eye about the best course of action.</p><p>While there will be multiple romance options on the ship, Mishulin noted that Osiris Reborn will feature "a lot more convenient user interfaces [and] convenient approaches to the gameplay," rather than trying to replicate Mass Effects' gameplay.</p><p>Owlcat Games hasn't set a date for The Expanse: Osiris Reborn yet, but it will be available on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC.

            <p>Snail Games' Aquatica expansion for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ark-survival-evolved">Ark: Survival Evolved</a> has landed itself a release date.</p>
<p>The DLC will make its debut later this month, on 15th July, via Steam. Ark: Aquatica will submerge players under the waters, tasking them with "new survival mechanics, extreme environmental hazards, a huge explorable map area, and unique gameplay elements".</p>
<p>It will additionally introduce 21 new tameable creatures, as well as 74 new Engrams (including 7 tek Engrams), and "underwater survival thanks to things like air pockets and propulsion vehicles". </p>
<p>Perhaps feeling a sense of 'once bitten, twice shy' due to those AI slop accusations from earlier this year, the developer has released a really very, <em>very</em> brief release date teaser for the upcoming expansion, which you can see below.</p>

<p>Snail Games and Ark: Aquatica made headlines back in March, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ark-aquatica-dlc-trailer-slammed-for-its-blatant-use-of-ai-slop">when a trailer released during GDC was clearly AI-generated</a>.</p>
<p>The video - which is no longer available to view on YouTube - featured things like a single person using three hands to hold onto a spear gun, as well as fish phasing in and out of existence, an octopus with the wrong number of tentacles and a human with flippers where there should have been feet.</p>
<p>Soon after this trailer for Ark: Aquatica went live, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ark-aquatica-developer-shifts-blame-for-disastrous-ai-trailer-onto-marketing-team">Snail Games moved to distance itself from the video</a>, blaming its marketing team. "They took our assets and then ran them through an AI to animate them. That was marketing," lead game designer Matt Kohl said in March.</p>
<p>At this time, Kohl stated: "There has been no AI use in development of Aquatica."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/after-accusations-of-ai-slop-ark-aquaticas-release-date-trailer-is-playing-it-very-safe]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Last month, it was widely reported that a stapler ruined the Nintendo Switch 2 launch for some unlucky players who ordered a unit by a GameStop New York store. Now, you can own this involuntary piece of memorabilia and help a charity in the process.</p>



<p>On X, GameStop has confirmed that the infamous stapler used by an employee to staple a receipt directly to a customer's Nintendo Switch 2 box, puncturing both the box and the screen, has been put up for auction on eBay. The stapler comes with a certificae of authenticity and the first unit that has been damaged by it, complete with damaged packaging, although GameStop assured the system has been repaired and is in full working conditions. The stapler and the repaired system are currently going for almost $109,000, but the price is likely going to get higher by the time the auction ends next week. All proceeds will be going to the <a href="https://childrensmiraclenetworkhospitals.org/#:~:text=Children's%20Miracle%20Network%20Hospitals%20raises,most%20urgent%20needs%20are%20met.">Children's Miracle Network Hospitals charity.</a></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Though the Nintendo Switch 2 launch was marred by this incident for some unlucky players, the release of the next-generation Nintendo console was a smashing success, which is throughly deserved, as the new console is a considerable step up from its predecessor in every possible way. You can learn more about the console by checking out <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/">Chris's review.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Switch 2 Download Upload Speeds" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/83f52c8599a65/switch-2-download-upload-speeds.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>It's now well over a month since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/hardware-review-nintendo-switch-2-a-faster-slicker-sexier-switch#conclusion-should-you-get-a-switch-2">Switch 2</a>'s June launch, and it seems the majority of owners are happy with their new console. Gripes about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/poll-are-you-happy-with-switch-2s-screen-because-some-people-certainly-arent">the screen</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/video-we-put-the-switch-2s-battery-through-its-paces-with-a-full-timelapse">battery life</a>, and how quickly the internal memory fills up are all valid, but <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-one-month-on-how-did-nintendos-switch-2-launch-go">the general consensus</a> indicates that the joys outweigh the cons; it's a neat system and we're having a brilliant time with it.</p>
<p>Slow download speeds is another area that has been frustrating some people, although it appears to be far from a universal problem. Asking around the Nintendo Life team, our Switch 2 internet speeds across the board either equal our old Switches or they're faster, significantly faster in some cases. But some Switch 2 users online — and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/forums/nintendo-switch-2/switch_2_game_download_speeds_via_wifi_are_slower_than_switch_1_in_spite_of_the_newer_faster_hardware">on our forums</a> — have been encountering connection issues, with eShop downloads sometimes taking multiple hours.</p>
<p>Now, one of the many problems with diagnosing and solving download issues is the number of variables involved. I could quote you my WiFi down/upload speeds standing across the room from my router (81.5 Mbps down, 46.6 Mbps up - you can run a test yourself via your Switch 2's System Settings&gt;Internet&gt;Test Connection), but that's not much help when you have a different ISP package with different limits and a router with different capabilities and settings.</p>
<p>Physically connecting your dock to your router via the Ethernet port is an obvious thing to try. Looking around online, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbivpQlpc4Y">people have recommended</a> changing your connection settings by upping the MTU value from the default 1400 to 1500 (which increases the packet size and potentially boosts download speeds). Try System Settings&gt;Internet&gt;Internet Settings&gt;[your network]&gt;Change Settings&gt;MTU for that one.</p>
<figure><a title="Switch 2 Download Upload Speeds" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/82c2c4ac44d69/switch-2-download-upload-speeds.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Over on Reddit, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/switch2/comments/1l6aurs/comment/mzi7hig">Shonryu79</a> suggested disabling 'IPv6 Connection' via the same settings menu, and several people apparently saw their download speeds leap after that.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, people have fiddled with manual DNS settings and tried power cycling — which, for the non-technically minded, is the posh term for turning it off and on again — to mixed results. Again, with so many factors potentially influencing your connection speeds, a one-fix-for-all solution isn't likely.</p>
<p>Nintendo has its own <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/au/support/articles/troubleshooting-slow-download-and-upload-speeds-on-nintendo-switch-2">Troubleshooting Slow Download Speeds page</a>, which I'll paraphrase thusly:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>'Move closer to the router'</em></li>
<li><em>'Move other metal and electronic things away from your console'</em></li>
<li><em>'Connect to a different wireless band'</em></li>
<li><em>'Turn your router off and on again'</em></li>
<li><em>'Update your router's firmware'</em></li>
<li><em>'Still nothing? Contact your Internet Service Provider'</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Hmm. The first four are definitely worth a shot, but Nintendo doesn't offer any Switch 2 settings tweaks to potentially solve the problem. And, personally, I'd rather eat my own foot than initiate any contact whatsoever with my ISP.</p>
<p>Have you had any download speed issues with Switch 2? We're keen to get an idea of how widespread the issue is and try to narrow down whether there is an issue with the console itself that Nintendo could potentially address, or if it's the many and various other internet factors causing upset. Let us know in the poll below, and feel free to share with the community any solutions you've found to Switch 2 connection woes.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-shiny-firmware-update/">Cyberpunk 2077</a> on Nintendo Switch 2 is likely to be remembered for a very long time as a great technical achievement, given what the console manages to achieve using so little power in both docked and handheld modes compared to other versions of the game.</p>



<p>In a new video comparing the Nintendo Switch 2 version and the PC version running on Steam Deck, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry">Digital Foundry</a> also provided an in-depth look at how the graphics settings of the Switch 2 version compare to the different options available on PC. The comparison is favorable for the new generation Nintendo system, as many settings, like crowd density and volumetric fog, are closer to the medium settings, rather than the expected low settings, while others are closer to the high settings, like ambient occlusion and mirror quality in docked mode. Other settings are difficult to match on the PC version of the game due to the ample customization made for the Switch 2 version, but even then, there are many instances where the port impresses, such as with screen space reflections, which are close to the high PC setting in some scenarios, and distant shadow resolution, which are similarly closer to the high settings on PC in several istances.</p>



<p>Even comparing the Cyberpunk 2077 Nintendo Switch 2 settings to those of the PlayStation 5 version, the port looks impressive, as some options are set higher on the Nintendo system, although that is easily explained by the fact that the Switch 2 version renders at a much lower resolution. In terms of what's been actually rendered, the Switch 2 version, on the other hand, is in the same ballpark as the PS5 version, and superior to the PS4 and PS4 Pro versions, which was expected given the much better CPU and storage of the new Nintendo system.  The comparison between the two systems, much like the comparison with the PC settings, is quite favorable to the Nintendo system, as it shows how CDPR did not have to deal with extreme cutbacks for the new version of their open-world RPG.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-review-kick-push-kick-push-glide.1240191/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I remember walking around a yard sale I got dragged to as a nine-year-old and spotting a copy of <em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3</em> for the original PlayStation. Begging my parents to buy it for me, I spent countless hours skating around Foundry and Suburbia (not even sure I ever made it to Canada). With the release of <em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4</em>, I was so excited to hop back into mostly familiar levels, listen to some incredible music, and rack up a high score.</p>

<p>Starting off with the Career Mode, this is everything you should expect returning to <em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3</em> and 4. Each game is its own separate career track so you can start at the beginning of <em>THPS 3</em> in the Foundry, or in <em>THPS 4</em>'s College.</p>

<h2>Relive the Classics</h2>

<p>You'll have two minutes to attempt to complete a variety of goals; the more goals you complete, the more levels you'll unlock. There isn't really some big "end goal" or celebration at the end, it's a Career Mode but not a Story Mode.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tony-hawks-pro-skater-34-goals.jpg?itok=oJ8WYL33 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tony-hawks-pro-skater-34-goals.jpg?itok=ugGvg1Be 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The most basic goals are to simply rack up a high score or a high combo. Past that there's objectives to pick up the letters S-K-A-T-E which are a fun challenge that also normally teaches you an interesting line in each level, and a number of very specific challenges to complete.</p>

<p>In London, you'll be performing wall rides on double-decker buses, College lets you hassle frat kids, and you'll be trying to collect stray rivets in the Shipyard. Each of these challenges will prompt players to explore different kinds of tricks, hunt interesting collectibles, or seek out secret spots based on context clues. It does a great job of teaching the player and prompting exploration.</p>

<p>While most of the collectibles to pick up are floating objects that glow and are extremely easy to spot, there's also a number of collectibles that are a bit more vague, like photobombing tourists in Alcatraz. These are definitely the 'harder to come by' objectives, but you'll likely stumble into a few of them while playing the level normally, then it's just up to you to remember where they are and get them all in a single run.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For those who played <em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 and 4</em> on the original PlayStation, expect to see some differences in map layouts and even ordering as we have to remember this was a time where there would be wild differences between ports of the same games.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An aspect of many of the levels in <em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4</em> that I loved, and maybe just something I'm appreciating returning to these games as an adult, is there's normally so much more to a level than what you first experience. In London, a variety of buildings can be grinded to the top of revealing hidden half pipes, and there's a reward for exploration on Skater Island that's <em>Spongebob Squarepants</em> inspired.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tony-hawks-pro-skater-34-bikini-bottom.jpg?itok=aNM5I5Uu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tony-hawks-pro-skater-34-bikini-bottom.jpg?itok=LicR83P7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Thi isn't where I parked my boat...</figcaption></figure><h2>New Levels, Skaters, and More</h2>

<p>There are a few new additions to the game for those who have already explored the originals from top to bottom. Of course, the most basic change is that the game handles fantastically; secondly, there is the addition of two new levels. Pinball, a track that begins with you getting boosted out into a downhill style track, and Waterpark, set in a derelict and shut-down waterpark.</p>

<p>Once you've completed the game, you'll also unlock new, more difficult goals for each level. Just when you think you've mastered a track, don't be surprised when a COMBO line or new objective has you stumped. This is a great addition for a pseudo post-game, letting those who know the game like the back of their hands be tested in a whole new way.</p>

<p>I loved exploring Waterpark. There are handrails to slide over, the remains of what I can assume was a lazy river creating a halfpipe through the whole track, and each ride has doors that you can skate into at the bottom, allowing you to pop out at the top.</p>

<h2>Free Skate and Level Creator</h2>

<p>If you don't want to set yourself a two-minute time limit, you can also skate around in Free Skate. Here you'll have access to all of the levels you've unlocked from the campaign as well as access to the directory of fan-created levels.</p>

<p>The fan-created levels are something that I'm most looking forward to. Unfortunately, at the time of review, there hasn't been much movement there. In addition to having the full freedom to create levels like those in the main campaign, the Level Creator has new objects like the boost pads found in Pinball, but also the ability to make goals.</p>

<h2>The Soundtrack Is Some of the Same, and a Lot New</h2>

<p>It wouldn't be <em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</em> without a fantastic soundtrack, and while not all of the original tracks are returning, new ones have been added that fit the tone and vibe of the original game fantastically.&nbsp;Skating through each level, two minutes at a time, you're able to really enjoy all of the music without it getting repetitive.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tony-hawks-pro-skater-34-massive-bail.jpg?itok=ovBdKT7b 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tony-hawks-pro-skater-34-massive-bail.jpg?itok=T5zE1hS- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>I enjoyed a lot of the new tracks. They all fit the vibe of the game fantastically, but there's a special bit of nostalgia that hits when one of the classic tracks comes on.</p>

<h2>Visual Upgrades Across the Board</h2>

<p>An extremely satisfying aspect of revisiting these levels ~23 years later is that, comparing the visuals of the original game, even that of the PS2 ports, you can see what the team was going for dialed up to 11 with this remake.</p>

<p>You can see it as soon as you drop into the Foundry. The predominantly grey slabs have been replaced with a factory floor. Flashing lights, workers standing around, and more dynamic scenery (including things to skate on or around). All of these improvements show how much care was put into taking what was already a fun playground and filling it with shiny new toys.</p>

<h2><em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>This is the kind of remaster that you want to see. It looks like a shinier version of all of your best memories playing the original and adds just a bit more for new and old players alike to experience.</p>

<p>Even two minutes at a time, it's a delight to skate around the world, interact with all of the different elements of the world, hunt down secrets, and hopefully score some top scores.</p>

<p>After the incredible success of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="74d91fb2-42d4-403a-99bf-6dd4d42182c9" href="https://techraptor.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-12" rel="nofollow"><em>1+2</em></a> and now <em>3+4</em>, all I can hope for is <em>THUG </em>to grace our screens again.</p>

            <p>Sometimes it's fun to just do things that don't make sense. Especially in a game like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a> that generally rewards you for embracing the chaos and behaving a manner that'd leave onlookers scratching their heads and slightly afraid.</p>
<p>Sadly, there's one immensely satisfying bit of action those who play the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">the RPG</a> as a tadpole-slupring hypocrite have, to the best of my knowledge, been unable to get in on since November 2023. No longer. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-ambitious-baldurs-gate-3-custom-campaign-mods-first-build-is-up-and-running-and-its-devs-are-teasing-demo-news-soon">BG3 modders</a> have stepped in to save us from the scourge that is logical decision making.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This is your warning that the minor spoiler gun is about to be fired. Remember the scene when The Emperor offers you a nice tadpole to eat, and you can choose whether to accept that gift or politely decline? Well, there's also the option to unleash your inner drama demon, chuck the Illithid worm on the ground, and stomp on it.</p>
<p>It's cathartic, a bit harsh on the virtual slug, and something any unhinged character worth their salt would go for in an instant. Sadly, all the way back in 2023, Larian opted to use <a href="https://baldursgate3.game/news/patch-4-now-live_96">the game's fourth patch</a> to ban <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BG3/comments/17sw69a/no_option_to_stomp_the_tadpole/">folks who've already consumed tadpoles</a> and embraced their worm powers by that point in the game from picking the stomp option.</p>

<p>It makes sense. After all, if you're already on the pro-tadpole train, why would you stomp on one to prove just how against inhaling them you are? That's logic, though. My RPG runs, whenever possible, are not bound by the science of reasoning. I lurch from one choice to the next, unpredictably gravitating towards whichever option takes my fancy, no matter how badly it meshes with my earlier choices.</p>
<p>Enter '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/17485?tab=description">Stomp that Tadpole</a>', from modder whatsontheflip. It lets those of us who've been "slurping down tadpoles on the regular" randomly decide to engage stompage, either freely or provided we can pass a level 14 constitution check.</p>
<p>Squish. A squid guy wondering just what you actually stand for, if anything at all. Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh. Bliss. You will never know my true intentions, purple fellow. I am the great stompy slurper, and I am beyond your comprehension.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/attention-massive-baldurs-gate-3-tadpole-hypocrites-this-modll-let-you-get-stompy-for-the-first-time-since-2023]]></content:encoded>

And while it wasn’t technically supported on Switch 2, you could use it to save on Switch versions of games and then just pay extra for the upgrades.</p><p>That’s effectively what Switch 2 owners can do with <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> and <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> this fall, spending a total of $120 on the vouchers and upgrades instead of the $140  they would cost&nbsp;if bought a la carte. The vouchers don’t expire until 12 months after they’re purchased so it’s conceivable that fans could still stock up on them to buy games throughout 2026, though Nintendo hasn’t yet confirmed any new first-party releases for the original Switch next year besides <em>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</em>.<br></p><p>With over 150 million Switches sold and a massive install base, it would make sense for Nintendo to continue supporting the platform—the PS4 continued getting Sony first-party games for years after the PS5 was released--but we’ll have to wait and see.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/switch-2-vouchers-pokemon-za-metroid-prime-4-preorder-1851785969]]></content:encoded>

In the future, NetEase has plans to incorporate more content from the MCU and comics, while also ensuring that it doesn't interfere with the game's pre-planned storylines.</p><p>Marvel Rivals progression systems game director Guangyun Chen recently told <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/marvel-rivals-lead-confirms-future-content-createdsystemic-manner-mcu-comics/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Video Gamer</a> that the game is "driven by its own universe and seasonal storylines" and that the seasons are planned out far ahead of time. He went on to explain that the dev team is developing new seasons in "a systemic manner" while also keeping an eye out for fresh additions from the films and comics.</p><p>"We are closely monitoring the release schedules of comics and movies, and we will incorporate relevant content when appropriate," said Chen. "However, this will not disrupt our own content development timeline."</p><p>After The Fantastic Four: First Steps, the next Marvel movie to hit theaters will be Spider-Man: Brand New Day on July 13, 2026. That seems far enough ahead to incorporate some Spidey-related characters, but it's also possible that NetEase may pull content from some of Marvel's TV shows on Disney+. Daredevil, for example, seems like he'd be a good fit for the game. NetEase also recently disclosed that it has the rights to include any character from the past eight decades of Marvel comics.</p><p>Season 3 of Marvel Rivals will begin on July 11.</p>

The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-make-a-furnace-in-minecraft/1100-6526071/">standard furnace</a> works for all types of resources you can smelt, such as food, ore, and sand.

The build requires four wood logs and a furnace.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Campfires">Campfires</h2><p dir="ltr">While these don't look like the other furnace types, it's worth mentioning you can also cook food on campfires.

Here we'll list several resources you can use as fuel, including efficient sources and the less recommended options.</p><p dir="ltr">The most efficient fuel sources:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Lava bucket: Can smelt 100 items</li><li dir="ltr">Coal block: Can smelt 80 items</li><li dir="ltr">Dried Kelp block: Can smelt 20 items</li><li dir="ltr">Blaze Rod: Can smelt 12 items</li><li dir="ltr">Piece of coal: Can smelt 8 items</li><li dir="ltr">Piece of charcoal: Can smelt 8 items</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Resource-wise, stacks of coal will be one of the easiest and most efficient fuel sources, especially early in your game. Lava Buckets will be best suited for when you're trying to smelt large qualities of ore.</p><p dir="ltr">Less efficient fuels sources:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Wood logs, planks, fence pieces, wood crafting tables, bookshelves, and more will smelt 1.5 items each</li><li dir="ltr">Wooden tools, signs, and wooden doors will smelt 1 item each</li><li dir="ltr">Then you have other normal items that will smelt less than 1 item each, including wool blocks, carpet, seeds, and bamboo</li></ul><p dir="ltr">These normal items aren't efficient to use as fuel, but in a pinch, you can throw these in your furnace.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Experience_points_and_achievements">Experience points and achievements</h2><p dir="ltr">It's worth noting that smelting contributes to your experience points. You gain valuable XP every time you retrieve smelted items from the furnaces.</p><p dir="ltr">There are also Minecraft achievements tied to smelting various items, including cooking your first cake and bread.</p><p dir="ltr">Now that your furnaces are up and running, make sure to check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-guides-hub/1100-6526408/">Minecraft guides hub</a> for more tips and tricks.</p>

            <p>Nintendo is ending its Switch Game Voucher service in January next year, the company announced today.</p>
<p>Nintendo Switch Game Vouchers, for those unaware, are a special offer for Nintendo Switch Online members, which can be purchased in a set of two, and are used to save on games.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, <a href="https://ec.nintendo.com/GB/en/pretickets/70020000000101">members can purchase two vouchers for £84.00</a>, and redeem them against Switch games such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">Tears of the Kingdom</a>, which retail individually for £59.99 each. Buying these games on their own would come to £119.98, but if vouchers were used to make these purchases, users would save £35.98. (Vouchers can not be used for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> titles.)</p>
<p>However, the popular service is set to end next year, on 30th January, and after this time, vouchers will no longer be available to purchase. Any vouchers purchased prior to 30th January 2026 will remain valid for 12 months, and Nintendo has said Switch titles will continue to be added to the Game Voucher catalogue throughout 2026.</p>
<p>Nintendo has not said if it will introduce a similar offer for Switch 2 games down the line. You can find more information on Switch vouchers, and the end of the service, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Support/Nintendo-Switch/Nintendo-Switch-Game-Vouchers-FAQ-1560656.html?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=NintendoSwitchOnline|NULL|NSOGameVoucherDiscountinuationAN|m_id_SnUV8HHzNg|1560656">via Nintendo</a>. </p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, many are disappointed to hear of Nintendo's decision to end its Switch Game Voucher service. "Well this is sad," <a href="https://x.com/NintendoUK/status/1943222381528395877/quotes">reads one of many social media posts</a> following today's announcement.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>After January 30th, 2026, <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NintendoSwitch?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NintendoSwitch</a> Game Vouchers will no longer be sold. Any Game Vouchers bought will remain valid for 12 months after purchase.

In the world of Umamusume: Pretty Derby, racehorses are reborn as cute anime girls, complete with equine ears and tails. The franchise started off in 2018 as an anime, followed by a Japan-only release of the mobile game in 2021. In the game, players can talk to, train and manage horse-girls like Special Week and Mejiro McQueen, sharing in their triumphs and losses. As a result, the Umamusume franchise has inspired a cult following, and apparently many fans have become interested in the real-life Japanese racehorses behind their favorite characters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, in their enthusiasm, it seems that some fans may have caused distress to their favorites and their owners in real life. As previously reported by <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/umamusume-pretty-derby-devs-urge-fans-to-not-pester-real-life-racehorses-3224393/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Dexerto</u></a>, Cygames shared guidelines for those who want to visit real-life racehorses in Japan, reminding people that you can’t just rock up to a ranch and that horses are easily startled by loud noises and camera flashes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The 9-point guideline was created by the <a href="https://uma-furusato.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Racehorse's Hometown Information Center</u></a>. The first two points urge would-be visitors to check with the center for tour availability and to confirm tour times before visiting. The rules also remind visitors to follow the instructions of ranch staff at all times, to refrain from smoking on-site, and not to enter stables or pastures without permission. The rest of the rules are centered on the horses’ wellbeing — don’t make loud noises and refrain from touching, feeding or taking flash photography of the horses.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/10/image005-1752142593002.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Umamusume: Pretty Derby's English language launch has exploded.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Developer Cygames has been fostering strong connections to the Japanese horse racing world — it often shows up alongside and provides support for racehorse-related exhibits at events in Japan, and has donated to the Retired Racehorse Association of Japan (source: <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/20240304-27999/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Automaton</u></a>).

            <p>The infamous stapler used by GameStop that ruined <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> launch day for some customers has now been put up for auction.</p>
<p>As we reported previously, one retail store in New York was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-launch-ends-in-disappointment-for-some-as-major-retailer-accidentally-staples-receipts-into-consoles-screen">stapling customers' receipts to the console's packaging</a>, damaging screens in the process.</p>
<p>Now - in an offer of goodwill, but also something of a publicity stunt - GameStop has put the stapler up for <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/388688595731">auction on eBay</a>, with proceeds benefitting Children's Miracle Network Hospitals. Children's Miracle Network Hospitals is a charity founded over 40 years ago, and has raised over $9bn for 170 children's hospitals.</p>

<p>The stapler is being offered alongside a Switch 2 console and a certificate of authenticity for the bundle.</p>
<p>Reads the certificate: "The black stapler used by a GameStop associate who, in a moment of launch night excitement and misjudged enthusiasm, stapled a receipt directly to a customer's new Nintendo Switch 2 box - puncturing both cardboard and screen in one swift motion. Features authentic field-use wear throughout and retired immediately from service, the stapler now stands as a retail legend born from a half-second decision."</p>
<p>The included console is also the first to be stapled, though GameStop assures the screen has been repaired. It will arrive in the original, stapled packaging, and also include the actual staple "carefully extracted and preserved".</p>
<p>As per eBay, the item is in "used" condition: "The item may have some signs of cosmetic wear, but is fully operational and functions as intended." At the time of writing, the auction stands at almost $109K, with another six days until it ends.</p>
<p>Following the launch day incident, GameStop stated staplers "have been confiscated" and that their use was "isolated to one store".</p>

<p>Despite this stapling incident, the Switch 2 launch was a success for Nintendo. With 3.5m units sold worldwide in its first four days on sale, it's the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-is-nintendos-fastest-selling-hardware-ever">fastest-selling piece of Nintendo hardware ever</a>.</p>
<p>And if children are unable to afford a Switch 2, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa stated there are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-president-says-children-should-engage-with-its-characters-elsewhere-if-they-cant-afford-a-switch-2">plenty of other ways for them to engage with Nintendo characters</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-ruining-stapler-now-up-for-online-charity-auction-by-gamestop]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Nintendo has announced that they are ending the Nintendo Switch Game Vouchers scheme for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-online">Switch Online</a> subscribers, removing them from sale on 30th January 2026.</p>
<p>Any vouchers purchased prior to the end of the programme will still be valid for use for the usual 12 months before they expire, but no further vouchers will be sold after 11:59 PM in your local market on 30th January 2026. So the vouchers will last until 30th January 2027.</p>


<p>Nintendo Switch Game Vouchers were introduced as part of Nintendo Switch Online, a popular way of getting Nintendo’s games at a discount, outside of rare sale periods. Purchased in a pair for $100 / £84, you could then redeem these vouchers against two games from a curated catalogue of titles. With games often priced at $60 / £50, this could net a combined saving of $20 / £16. Potentially even more, as the £60 Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is also a part of the program, and the new and upcoming titles, such as Pokémon Legends: Z-A, can also be included.</p>
<p>The writing was on the wall for this program when Nintendo announced increased game prices for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. Nintendo Switch Game Vouchers can only be redeemed against Switch games, as it stands, so the aforementioned Pokémon Legends: Z-A and Tears of the Kingdom would then need a further upgrade to the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition.</p>

<p>The value of the offer can also be seen to be diminishing for savvy gamers who are happy to wait for Nintendo to put parts of their back catalogue on sale. At those times, games can drop to around £30, which is obviously a much larger discount.</p>

<figure><a title="GameStop" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9650f1602f54c/gamestop.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Remember when GameStop made the news following a rather <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/random-one-gamestop-apparently-stapled-receipts-to-brand-new-switch-2-boxes-and-guess-what-happened">unfortunate incident involving a newly-bought Switch 2 console and a stapler</a>? Yeah, one store thought it wise to staple receipts onto the Switch 2 box, puncturing the cardboard and damaging the screen of the Switch inside.</p>
<p>It wasn't a good look for the company, but now, GameStop is looking to turn the whole thing into a positive by auctioning off the stapler and the damaged Switch 2 on <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/388688595731?mkcid=1&amp;mkrid=710-53481-19255-0&amp;campid=5336736927&amp;toolid=10001&amp;mkevt=1" rel="sponsored noopener">eBay</a>, with all proceeds going to Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals.</p>

<p>And y'know what, fair play! Yes, it's a massive publicity stunt to save face, but it's a decent one at that, and bidding has already reached <strong>$108,895</strong> at the time of writing with over 6 days remaining.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/random-gamestop-tries-to-make-light-of-switch-2-staple-fiasco-but-lands-in-more-trouble">GameStop tried to make light of the whole situation</a> in the days following the staple incident, but wound up getting into even more trouble when it became evident the company used someone else's photo without providing credit. It posted a joke announcing restocks of the Switch 2 along with the tagline "Staples not included", but the photo used belonged to Janelle Jones of Bloomberg.</p>
<p>Water under the bridge, and all that. GameStop gets a lot wrong, but this might be one of those rare occasions in which it's made a pretty good decision. Keep going.</p>
