They’re taking the fighting scene by storm, and now 8BitDo, one of the most consistent accessory manufacturers in the business, has launched its own <strong>Arcade Controller</strong> for the Switch, Switch 2, and PC, priced at <strong>$89.99</strong>.</p>
<p>But what the heck is a leverless arcade controller? Well, some folks call them Hit Box controllers, but <a href="https://www.hitboxarcade.com/">Hit Box</a> is actually just one of many branded products released over the years, so it’s kinda like calling a games console ‘a Nintendo’. In reality, they’re largely referred to as ‘leverless’ thanks to the obvious lack of a joystick / lever in favour of an all-button setup. If you’re dead set on a more traditional setup, 8BitDo also has its own <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/01/hardware_8bitdos_arcade_stick_grants_that_coin-op_feel_to_your_switch">Arcade Stick</a> available for purchase.</p><div><figure data-videoid="myrpG5TN7_Q" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/myrpG5TN7_Q?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/myrpG5TN7_Q?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/myrpG5TN7_Q?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed53c808rpzksv&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myrpG5TN7_Q" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>So let’s take a closer look at the buttons on this thing, starting with the standard circular inputs (we’ll come back to those bean-shaped ones shortly). These are your basic inputs, and their positioning on the controller is such that your fingers can rest comfortably across the majority of them. The black buttons represent your movement, with ‘left’, ‘right’, and ‘down’ grouped together, and ‘up’ situated down toward the bottom. The red buttons, meanwhile, are a mixture of the face buttons and shoulder buttons on a standard Switch Joy-Con or Pro Controller.</p>
<p>What’s particularly nice about this is that the Arcade Controller boasts a dynamic button layout depending on whether you’re playing on Switch or PC. The dial in the top left corner of the controller lets you flick between the two modes, and internal lights will indicate how each of the red buttons function, changing automatically when switching from one mode to the other.</p>

<p>So in other words, the light indicators are a lovely way of easing you into the experience of using a leverless controller, since a lot of brands don’t include them at all. I won’t lie, getting started with a leverless controller can be daunting at first, even if you’re used to a regular arcade stick. Any muscle memory you might have accumulated over the years goes out the window, and you’ll probably find yourself making all kinds of wild mistakes when you start trying to string combos together in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/guilty_gear_-strive-_nintendo_switch_edition">Guilty Gear -Strive-</a> or pulling off a Drive Reversal in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>. Trust me when I say, however, that it’s well worth the time investment.</p>
<p>Going back to the buttons, those four extra bean-shaped inputs are essentially programmable to your liking. So for example, if you’re really not keen on having ‘up’ be near the bottom of the device, you can map this to the bean situated just above the ‘down’ button, making your directional inputs more akin to the familiar WASD setup on a keyboard. To map them, you simply hold down the button you want to map to along with the target input, then press the yellow star button at the top of the device. Alternatively, if you’re <em>really</em> not keen on them, the Arcade Controller also includes four replaceable lock caps to render them completely unusable.</p>
<p>As for the button quality, you’re looking at <a href="https://www.lofree.co/products/lofree-wizard">low-profile Kailh Wizard mechanical switches</a>, and they feel incredibly satisfying to press. They’re clicky and tactile, and the clicking noise can really help beginners understand when they’ve completed an input to help with those essential combos. That said, they're a little <em>too</em> loud at times, and the noise can be pretty distracting when playing either docked or in tabletop mode. Thankfully, like most leverless controllers, the button caps and switches can be modded with replacements, so feel free to experiment to see what suits you.</p>
<figure><a title="8BitDo Arcade Controller 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/056c2f877143e/8bitdo-arcade-controller-5.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>In an effort to be tournament ready (granted, you won't find many tournaments utilising the Switch or Switch 2, but still...), the 8BitDo Arcade Controller also comes with a lock switch at the top left of the device, along with SOCD cleaning. The former can be switched on to prevent any accidental presses of the start button, the blue home button, or whatever else might get you disqualified from a tournament.</p>
<p>But what is SOCD? It stands for Simultaneous Opposing Cardinal Directions, and refers to the simultaneous input of directions that, on a single analogue stick or d-pad wouldn’t be possible, but with separate directional buttons <em>is</em> possible. For example, pressing ‘up’ and ‘down’ or ‘left’ and ‘right’ at the same time would sometimes result in unwanted in-game behaviour, but SOCD cleaning alleviates this entirely. Here, pressing opposing directions at the same time will simply yield a neutral stance in fighting games by default. Jolly good.</p>
<p>Like most 8BitDo products, you can also link up the Arcade Controller with the Ultimate Software V2 app on Windows. There is a version of the app available on Mac, but as of right now, the Arcade Controller will not link up there at all – only Windows. You’ll want to link the controller to the app as soon as possible in order to update it to the latest firmware (v1.04 at the time of writing) and make it Switch 2 compatible. So if you’re only on Mac, you’ll want to borrow a friend’s Windows PC or simply wait until the controller is compatible with the version on Mac.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the app will also let you create controller profiles and remap the buttons as you see fit. You can completely rearrange the layout of the inputs to your desire, or even set macros for special attacks; a good option for those extra bean-shaped buttons. It’s worth noting that you can only map single buttons to the programmable beans via the controller itself, while macros are only possible in the app. Once you’re all set up, however, you simply press the yellow star button on the controller to swap between profiles – easy. If you wish, you can also alter SOCD rules; so for example, rather than two opposing inputs rendering a neutral stance, you can make it so the first button pressed takes priority.</p>

<p>Aesthetically, 8BitDo’s Arcade Controller is absolutely stunning. Like its previous Arcade Stick, it looks to pay homage to the NES with the black, red, and light grey colour combination. Boasting a frosted tempered glass surface on top which, yes, might pick up a few minor fingerprints over time, this look is far preferable to a completely glossy surface, in my eyes. Meanwhile, over on the back, you’ve got a non-slip silicon cover that’s enhanced with a beautiful, consistent pattern of fighting combo patterns; seriously, it needs to be seen in person to really appreciate how cool this is.</p>
<p>You’ll also find a couple of other notable features on the back of the device. First up is the USB dongle, and this is magnetic, so holding the dongle close will cause it to snap into place, and believe me, it’s surprisingly satisfying in practice.</p>
<p>On the topic of the USB dongle, by the way, you can connect the Arcade Stick to your Switch or Switch 2 either via Bluetooth, the dongle, or the USB-A to USB-C cable, and all of them are completely viable with minimal latency from my experience. Linking via Bluetooth for the first time is simply a case of holding the green sync button while in the ‘Change Grip/Order’ section of the controller settings. Again, make sure you’ve updated the controller before attempting this on Switch 2.</p>
<p>Finally, there are switches on either side of the silicon cover which you can flip to add a slight bump to the device's angle when set upon a flat surface. It’s a minor change, but it does make a nice difference if you’re playing on a desk. Alternatively, the Arcade Controller is just as comfortable when used on your lap on the couch. If you opt to go wireless, then you can be safe in the knowledge that you'll get about 15-20 hours out of the battery life, which is incredibly generous.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>8BitDo's Arcade Controller is a fantastic piece of kit whether you're a leverless veteran or a complete newcomer to the fighting scene. Heck, it's even a great option for retro 2D platformers too, if you wish. At less than $100, it's a remarkably affordable device for those looking to dip their toes into the world of leverless controllers, and like the vast majority of 8BitDo's products, the quality far outweighs the cost.</p>
<p>The only major downside is the noise of the stock buttons, which can prove quite distracting in practice. Thankfully, however, you can completely replace the switches for something a little more kind on those auditory nerves. Otherwise, it's hard to fault. Leverless controllers definitely take a bit of getting used to, but they can really help to give you a competitive edge once you're comfortable with the setup. Crucially, however, it's just a lot more fun and satisfying than a bog-standard controller. 8BitDo has done it again.</p>

<p>The news was announced with an intense live-action trailer on the studio's official YouTube channel, where the release date first shown on the watch of a downed soldier, and then more prominently displayed on a computer screen as the final shot of the trailer.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>Ahead of its launch, players in attendance at any of the following events will be able to check out the 1.0 build for Escape from Tarkov, with the final event in South Korea overlapping with the game's 1.0 launch.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Image credit: Battlestate</figcaption></figure>



<p>When Escape from Tarkov arrives this coming November, it will have spent a little more than nine years in early access before its 1.0 launch. At the time of this writing, it's not completely clear what changes are coming and what specifically will be included in the 1.0 version, but with the coming build appearing at the above four global events, hopefully, we'll start to hear more about the new version soon.</p>



<p>In the meantime, Battlestate just recently released a new patch for the game, with <a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/news/id/351">update 0.16.9.0</a> now live, bringing a slew of balance changes and tweaks. </p>

              <p>Ubisoft’s long-promised animated series&nbsp;<em>Splinter Cell: Deathwatch</em> has finally been given a longer trailer and a release date. Due October 14, the Liev Schreiber-fronted anime also stars comedian Janet Varney as Anna “Grim” Grímsdóttir, and has been in the works for about four-hundred-thousand years.</p> <p>OK, five years, but it really has dragged on. In the meantime we learned an entire <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-splinter-cell-movie-tom-hardy-1851700151"><em>Splinter Cell</em> movie starring Tom Hardy was canned</a>, while there’s been no word on other announced Ubisoft TV and movie projects like <em>Watch_Dogs</em>,&nbsp;<em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Division</em>,&nbsp;<em>Ghost Recon</em>, <em>Riders Republic</em>, a <em>Rabbids</em> feature, and even a <em>Just Dance&nbsp;</em>movie. So honestly, the fact that anything at all is coming to screens feels fairly miraculous.</p> <p>The trailer, however, is…not what I was expecting. In 2024, Michael Ironside—who voiced title character Sam Fisher in the games—<a href="https://screenrant.com/splinter-cell-anime-cast-update-liev-schreiber-sam-fisher/">said that he was “too old” to play the part</a> at 75, with the role handed over to 57-year-old Liev Schreiber for the anime. So it’s something of a surprise to see Sam appearing in the trailer looking like a 75-year-old man.</p>

 <p>There’s still no clear idea what the show will actually be&nbsp;<em>about</em>, beyond it being personal to Fisher, following the death of someone called Douglas Shetland. What we do see is a lot of guns being fired, and Sam mistaking a fair few people for knife racks. Oh, and while it’s weirdly tossed away in the middle of the short teaser, at least the three-light googles appear at one point. I mean, I’m not in charge of Netflix marketing, but given most of the trailer looks like Sam Fisher: The Retirement Home Years, I’d perhaps have ended on the iconic headwear and maybe&nbsp;<em>something</em> that suggested some sort of intrigue.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Splinter Cell: Deathwatch | Official Teaser | Netflix" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LAM63Dj3XBQ?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>The better news is the team behind the show. The creator is Derek Kolstad, responsible for Bob Odenkirk’s reinvention as an action hero in&nbsp;<em>Nobody</em>, and the writer of the first three&nbsp;<em>John Wick</em> movies. That’s some caliber, although I struggle not to imagine the scripts for <em>John Wick</em> are mostly “John punches a man, and then another man and then he shoots three guys, and then he gets shot in the leg but shakes it off and punches four other guys and throws knives at a guy.” Along with Kolstad is a writing team that features scribes from <em>Shooter</em>, and some fresh faces too.</p> <p>It’s an oddly witless and plotless teaser, although given Kolstad is head writer, it seems implausible the show itself could fall that way. Right? Please? As for Fisher’s age, perhaps the show is canon to the games, given the last one—<em>Splinter Cell: Blacklist</em>—came out an extraordinary 12 years ago. Maybe it’s to make the people who remember playing the games feel seen.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Infinity Nikki devs told Eric Barone: "We're still learning from you every day."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/stardew-valley"><u>Stardew Valley</u></a> developer Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone has revealed he doesn't ask for any compensation when his fan-favorite farm sim collabs with other franchises, saying he only does them because "[he] was a fan of the other games, or because [he] genuinely thought players would like it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The statement comes as fans prepare for a crossover event between Stardew Valley and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/infinity-nikki"><u>Infinity Nikki</u></a>, which goes live on September 1. Although we still don't really understand what this will involve, exactly, there are already some surprisingly mixed reactions coming from the community, with some players upset about the timing, suggesting it's an all-too-convenient <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/infinity-nikki-is-getting-a-stardew-valley-collab-in-september-but-not-everyone-is-happy-about-it"><u>distraction from the recent controversy around leakers</u></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There have been a few collaborations between Stardew Valley and other games over the years," Barone <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1958574815495037251" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>posted</u></a> on X/Twitter yesterday. "To be clear, I never receive any money from these collabs. I've only done them because I was a fan of the other games, or because I genuinely thought the players would like it."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Interestingly, Infinity Nikki responded directly to Barone from its official X/Twitter account.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We really appreciate you sharing your feelings on this. Any unintended stress was the last thing we wanted. It was our way of saying thanks — a free love letter to Stardew Valley from our team and for the community," the message <a href="https://x.com/InfinityNikkiEN/status/1958609280535519445" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>said</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Working on it felt like we were all tending a little farm together. The care and detail you pour into your world is exactly why we want to make cozy games too. We're still learning from you every day."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To be fair, it feels as though the fallout from the Stardew Valley collab is just a matter of bad timing here. The Infinity Nikki community has been unhappy ever since <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/infinity-nikki-players-threaten-to-uninstall-the-game-as-dev-introduces-controversial-changes-with-update-15"><u>update 1.5</u></a> added some controversial changes to the game, such as retconning Infinity Nikki's story, and ramping up the money and time investments required to collect full outfits. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's not that Barone does this all that often, either. Stardew Valley has only ever worked with a handful of other games, such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/balatro"><u>Balatro</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/terraria"><u>Terraria</u></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Back in May, Barone admitted that he "didn't want to just be the Stardew Valley guy," explaining that was why he's currently working on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-haunted-chocolatier">Haunted Chocolatier</a>. We shouldn't expect a release date anytime soon, though — there's "still a lot to be done," Barone recently admitted, particularly as he feels it's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-creator-says-he-might-eventually-make-a-stardew-valley-2-but-its-so-much-easier-to-add-more-stuff-to-stardew-valley-than-make-a-new-game-from-scratch"><u>"got to be better" than Stardew Valley</u></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/syberia-remastered-launches-on-pc-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-meta-quest-3-this-november.1278132/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Microids has finally announced a release date for Syberia Remastered, a "<em>fully modernized</em>" version of the classic title that it <a href="https://wccftech.com/syberia-remastered-unveiled-for-q4-2025-launch/">first revealed earlier this year</a>. As expected, it'll arrive on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S, and it'll be out on November 6, 2025. What wasn't expected was that it's also making the jump to VR, and will launch on <a href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/syberia/6794327920669318/?srsltid=AfmBOoryYxnvWd-oUHWGBdjHWbRYZHo7vAEtjwAE69Dtc_vGvS0-jbac">Meta Quest 3</a> headsets a week after its PC and console launch, on November 13, 2025.</p>



<p>Alongside the news of the confirmed release date and the coming VR version, Microids debuted a 'Before/After' trailer that shows off the visual improvements fans of the original can enjoy in this new remaster. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Syberia Remastered – ESRB Before/After" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aMyKwVlDs_A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Fans looking to keep a piece of this remaster for themselves will also be able to pick up a physical version of the game on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, though it's unfortunately only being released physically in the UK.</p>



<p>The story of Syberia follows Kate Walker, a lawyer from New York who sets out to remote parts of the French Alps alongside her companion Oscar to find Hans Voralberg, an inventor obsessed with making a discovery thought to be impossible, to find the last remaining living mammoths on a mythical island, Syberia.</p>



<p>The trailer revealed today focuses on the visual improvements, but fans of the original are likely more interested in seeing what Microids has done regarding the redesigned puzzles, and to see how the quality of life improvements coming in the remaster smooth out the entire Syberia experience.</p>



<p>Now, thankfully, those fans have a date to look forward to that will satisfy their curiosity.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Bungie CEO Pete Parsons Steps Down After Over 20 Years]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-pete-parsons-steps-down</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bungie-ceo-pete-parsons-steps-down-after-over-20-years.1278129/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bungie CEO Pete Parsons has announced he's stepping down after over 20 years with the company, and he'll be handing his responsibilities over to another long-time Bungie staffer.</p>

<p>In an announcement on the official Bungie <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/passing_the_torch" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>, Parsons says he's "decided to pass the torch" and that now is the "right time for a new beginning", but he doesn't elaborate on his reasons for leaving any further than that.</p>

<p>Parsons will be handing his CEO role over to Justin Truman, who previously served as&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>'s General Manager and the chief development officer of Bungie as a whole. It sounds as though the transition will be instantaneous, since no other date is given.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/destiny-2-bungie-pete-parsons-stepping-down.jpg?itok=XO3gZ-KA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/destiny-2-bungie-pete-parsons-stepping-down.jpg?itok=cEHOpJW5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Bungie CEO Pete Parsons is vacating his role after over 20 years with the studio.</figcaption></figure><p>Truman begins his own message by reminding fans of his credentials; he worked as a coder for the original&nbsp;<em>Destiny&nbsp;</em>and served as a designer on&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>, crafting many systems for the game (including the endgame mechanisms, which he says he got "terribly wrong" at launch).</p>

<p>He's also been helping Bungie to develop&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>, so it's fair to say he's been across everything the studio has worked on for the last ten years or so. It's easy to see why Parsons picked Truman for a successor.</p>

<p>The extraction shooter also found itself in hot water back in May, when it was revealed that artwork used in the game had been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-marathon-art-stolen" rel="nofollow">taken from an online artist</a> without permission or compensation (which, incidentally, is <a href="https://x.com/elementj21/status/1671281580831297536" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">not the first time</a> Bungie has been caught doing something like this).</p>

            <p>The Rogue Prince of Persia celebrated its 1.0 release yesterday with a remarkably honest behind-the-scenes video from developers Evil Empire, detailing the ups and downs of a year-long Early Access period, including the decision to completely overhaul the game's art style and redesign its purple-skinned protagonist.</p>
<p>The video opens with the admission that this Roguelike take on the wall-jumping, time-rewinding Prince suffered multiple blows upon its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-is-a-new-roguelite-that-combines-wall-running-with-arkham-style-agile-combat">Early Access release</a> in May 2024. The first of these was the surprise drop of heavyweight <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a>, which also launched in May and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dead-cells-devs-the-rogue-prince-of-persia-dodges-hades-2-with-a-release-date-delay">stole most of the Prince's limelight</a>. The second was the negative player response to both the game's lack of content and its colourful visual style, which was inspired by Persian miniature paintings and the artwork of Mœbius/Jean Giraud.</p>

<p>Notably, the decision to give the titular Prince and all NPCs a purple skintone was met with confusion. In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKOM1f9KCWQ">developer diary</a> from 2024, it was revealed that this was intended as a direct ode to the PC CGA port of Prince of Persia from 1990, which featured neon skin for all due to a limited 4-colour palette. Unfortunately, this homage went over the heads of most players.</p><p>"During a brainstorming session about skins, our art director had raised a seemingly innocent question," says Evil Empire Marketing Manager Matthew Houghton in the video. "Are we sure that making the Prince purple won't be a problem? At the time, everyone told him no. He was overthinking it; colours are cool, they're stylish, it adds a bit of fantasy! Well...now we all know how that turned out."</p>

</figure>
<p>The rest of the footage details how Evil Empire not only packed The Rogue Prince of Persia with additional content, but also revamped the art style - a decision that is now conveyed in more detailed levels and a decidedly less-purple Prince adorning everything from the game's key art to the album cover of its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_nE-Q-EmpvPc2YArqWRhFOd60vkNP8WYR4">impressive soundtrack</a> by Persian American musician ASADI. Alas, even this visual update faced unexpected friction in the form of a bizarre Steam issue which required the devs to use a Spanish phone number to get their own product updated.</p>
<p>"Through all those problems and roadblocks," Houghton continues, "we've had a great community giving us a helping hand the whole way. Even when it was clear we had a tonne of work to do, they've been there giving us support, feedback and encouragement. So a special shoutout to you guys for sticking with us on our crazy journey."</p><p>Despite these nice words, Houghton acknowledges that the game has faced a low player count during its Early Access. The 1.0 release is now considered final, and throughout the video there does seem to be a slight feeling of "well, we sure hope more folks play this, or else we'll never make a sequel." Which would be a shame, considering that last year's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-review">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</a> was a superb effort that Ubisoft sent out to die with poor promotion before <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown">disbanding</a> the team behind it.</p>
<p>I intend on giving the Rogue Prince of Persia a proper go this weekend and am looking forward to it. I also liked the purple Prince look, because I can't help but admire unorthodox art design decisions, especially when they're an ultra-niche homage to computer colour schemes that existed when I was a kid. But I can see how his grape skin along with the game's more cartoony and dreamy original visuals failed to latch onto players, and it does feel as if the final result is actually a tad more reminiscent of the Persian miniature inspiration.</p>
<p>Most of all, however, I'm sticken by the frankness of Evil Empire in this video. Despite taking over <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-cells">Dead Cells</a> DLC from Motion Twin, Houghton consistently acknowledges that the team was inexperienced in certain regards, and that this was their first fully-fledged project. It's rare to see admissions of setbacks that aren't couched in corporate industry speak (particularly for a gaming brand owned by Ubisoft). I only hope that the Rogue Prince of Persia manages to catch a few more eyes because of it.</p>

		<p><em>Sleep is overrated. This is what someone tells themselves when it's 4:30 a.m. and your body is fully awake because either believes it's in another part of the world. Sure, it might mean you drink too much coffee today, but hey, who's counting (Your body. Your body is counting.)</em></p><p><em>When Patrick decided to travel to Paris for long enough to feel like he'd lived there, it turns out that also means his body wanted to stay there when he came back, too. Outside of aging, traveling is one of the rare ways to completely upend the way your body senses the world. </em></p><p><em>Rob and Patrick decided to reflect on the ways their bodies' rhythms have changed over time. Learn how Rob was almost run over by forklift!</em></p><hr><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> So Rob, when we traveled to London, jet lag wasn’t a thing. Everyone overslept the first few days, sure, but broadly we transitioned over without skipping a beat, thanks to everyone catching a critical few hours of sleep during the overnight flight. It was awesome, and made me optimistic we could make a similar transition coming home. The results are in: absolutely not!</p><p>Handwaving an awful 24-hour stomach bug that made me deeply uncomfortable on the flight home and feeling weirdly feverish overnight, the big problem is that <em>we keep waiting up so early.</em></p><p>The first few days, it didn’t matter when I went to bed. Early. Late. In-between. I’d wake up around 5am. The kids were on the same cycle, too. It’s a seven-hour difference between Chicago and Paris, so apparently our bodies were simply saying “hey, I’d like some lunch.”</p><p>Am I a morning person? Well. I’m not <em>not</em> a morning person—but I really, really enjoy my sleep.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m also not a person who usually has trouble falling back asleep after briefly stirring awake?</p><p>But there was no going back to sleep during these moments, so instead of being frustrated, I woke up and got on with it. The consequences of lacking sleep were a problem for a future version of Patrick. It was in these early hours, as the sun slowly peered out, that I found a lot of enjoyable solace in—excuse the grindset term—”attacking” the day. I surfed through a series of indie games—<em>Sword of the Sea, Herdling</em>—because of the extra quiet time I had in these hours.</p><p>Honestly, the biggest problem was pumping the breaks on my coffee intake. I’m used to taking down two cups of coffee in the day’s opening hours—one while prepping the kids for the day, another slowly sipped while heading towards lunch—and I’d downed both of ‘em before 8am.</p><p>I can feel my normal routine slipping back into place, though. Days ago, I couldn’t make it past 9pm. Last night, I caught up on episodes of <em>Alien: Earth </em>until nearly midnight. I slept until nearly 7am this morning. My brief moment of hacking the universe and getting 2x grindset morning returns appears to be fading. Of course, I could just set an alarm and get up earlier. But that would require making a conscious effort to get up early, not respond to my body demanding it.</p><p>Are there moments in your life where your daily routine, whether it’s when you wake up or otherwise, suddenly shifted? I found this shift, however temporary, to be very pleasant. I’m not sure I’m prepared to sleep early enough to make it happen, but I very much get the appeal of it.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@joyceromero?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Joyce Romero</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Rob: </strong>Probably the most intense version of this I had to deal with was when I worked at a factory where your crew rotated through shifts. You’d have a week of day shift, a week of swing shift, and then a week of night shift. It made it a lot easier to work the night shift but at the cost of just making time itself seem blurry. You’d wrap work at midnight and suddenly you’re hanging with friends until two or three in the morning like it’s nothing. Then the next thing you know you’re going on a date at five in the afternoon, going into work at 11:30, and coming home to have breakfast with your family before you go to bed. There were times it was kind of liberating to be completely divorced from any kind of normal daily routine, to just be doing whatever you wanted or needed to do whenever you had the chance outside work hours.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, I don’t think I ever felt like I was fully rested and healthy while I was doing that, and a <em>lot </em>of people I worked with were taking drugs to sand off the edges of exhaustion or overstimulation. I remember one forklift driver kept having accidents because she was jacked-up all the time, and we busted ass trying to conceal how bad and dangerous the situation had gotten. She’d nearly run you over with a shipping pallet, then she’d scatter the whole load a second later trying to take a turn too fast and we’d swarm her trying to get everything cleaned-up before the foreman could notice. Nobody liked her that much: you can only have someone come inches from inflicting grievous bodily harm so many times before you get righteously pissed about it… but nobody wanted her to get fired. And I think everyone was aware that if management got concerned about the stimulants people were taking as a matter of course, it would cause a <em>lot </em>of problems beyond one forklift operator.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-preview-reveal-harlowe-demo-exclusive/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/borderlands-4-hands-on-preview-my-exclusive-first-look-at-harlowe-gameplay.1278117/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In the last few weeks, I’ve been rinsing the Borderlands series, which prepared me quite nicely for an extended demo of Borderlands 4 at  Gamescom. However, my preparation was rendered mostly insignificant when I discovered just <strong>how much of an evolution Borderlands 4 is </strong>over Borderlands 3 (and the rest of the series).</p>



<p>As I explored the seamless and sumptuous open world of Kairos with Harlowe, the ‘Gravitar’ Vault Hunter, I found myself marvelling at the sheer level of differences that set Borderlands 4 apart from everything that came before, while still managing to retain most of what makes Borderlands <em>Borderlands</em>.</p>



<p>Read on to scope out my full Borderlands 4 preview, pieced together from an exclusive, never-before-seen demo at Gamescom.</p>



<p>Before you dive in, here are 35 minutes of Borderlands 4 gameplay, featuring Harlowe:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="35 Minutes of Borderlands 4 Gameplay | Exclusive First Look at Harlowe" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XK2qNsnKLqc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-less-border-more-lands">Less Border, More Lands</h2>







<p>Borderlands 4 has a stunning open world that’s the biggest single environment Gearbox has created in the 20-year history of the franchise. It’s a hugely ambitious undertaking that reflects nothing but the sharpest quality. The classic cartoon visuals of Borderlands 4 are more detailed than ever before, allowing players to study the most minute elements of this enormous map.</p>



<p>To accommodate the size and scale of Kairos, Gearbox has created a Borderlands game that has more traversal options than you can <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-will-feature-30-billion-guns/">shake 30 billion guns at</a>. From grapple hooks and gliders to double-jump mechanics and multiple customizable vehicles, there’s no shortage of ways to get around this vast map.</p>



<p>Those elements feed into the game’s combat sequences, too. I found myself flying around the battlefield as Harlowe, employing powerful gadgets to hold enemies in stasis or blast them with an incredible launcher that corroded them from the inside out. It’s easy to never stop moving in Borderlands 4, which is great, as you’ll be digging through the map for <strong>many, many hours</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-humor-but-different">Humor, But Different</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>In a pre-demo presentation, I learned from Gearbox that the traditional humorous elements of Borderlands are still present in Borderlands 4, but they’ve been toned down a little to reflect the tone of the game. I still had a chuckle at some of the more entertaining character introductions and dialogue choices, though.</p>



<p>The core gameplay loop around the campaign has also been altered, going from a mostly linear path to a truly flexible, sandbox-based RPG. You’re free to do what you want, when you want, where you want, and that suits me down to the ground. It has been revealed by Randy Pitchford that Borderlands 4 has immensely tough bosses, so you’ll want to grind and level up before challenging them.</p>



<p>From a technical perspective, I played Borderlands 4 on both controller and with a keyboard and mouse, and both inputs were accessible, enjoyable, and familiar. I didn’t experience a single bug in an hour, the game rendered and ran beautifully, and the weapon variation and abilities popped nicely.</p>



<p>The same old weapons manufacturers are present, but new ones have been added to the mix, and cross-licensing now happens, bringing one brand’s parts and abilities to other weapons – at a cost. Vehicles can be deployed from anywhere, the skill paths are varied and support multiple styles, and customization has been improved.</p>



<p>Like I said, it feels like an entirely new game, but it still takes a few key elements from the older titles. </p>



<h2 id="h-officially-a-contender">Officially a Contender</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>I’d say that Borderlands 4 is a contender for Game of the Year. Given how strong the year has been for me thus far, that’s not a light statement. I was overwhelmingly impressed by Borderlands 4 during my preview at Gamescom, and one hour of gameplay wasn’t enough for me.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-randy-pitchford-100-million-units-borderlands-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">love that Randy Pitchford</a> has for this game is so clear and tangible, which also fills me with faith for the road ahead.</p>



<p>Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum">Insider Gaming forum</a> what you think about Borderlands 4 and whether you’ll be getting it on day one.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/crimson-desert-hands-on-preview-a-little-refining-is-needed-but-it-has-promise.1278114/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The wait for Crimson Desert keeps getting longer, and players have been patient since 2019 to finally see the game in action. As we wait, Insider Gaming had the chance to play the preview build for Crimson Desert at Gamescom 2025, and here are our early thoughts on it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For those unaware, Crimson Desert is an upcoming open-world action adventure set on the continent of Pywel. Players take on the role of Kliff, the leader of the Greymanes, as they explore this beautiful yet brutal landscape, defending Pywel from all types of foes.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-complicated-yet-exciting-combat">Complicated Yet Exciting Combat</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Crimson Desert preview build was around 50 minutes long, which was easily one of the longest demos at the event. During this time, players received a comprehensive tutorial on combat and movement, experienced a war sequence, and engaged in a proper boss fight.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Right from the get-go, youre introduced to a variety of moves and skills, and that’s just with one weapon. You can get in all types of different combos and special moves by using different button combinations. However, this game is not a button masher, and repeating the same moves might get you through the minions, but you really need to know your skillset when taking on the bosses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Players were only able to face one faction during the preview, which featured several enemy times. Some were small and quick, inflicting relatively minor damage at once but causing more damage over time. The other type was big and slow, but could unleash some hefty blows at the same time. </p>



<p>The boss is an entirely different matter—a true monster who could eliminate you in an instant if you found yourself cornered. There’s a specific system in place, and if you’re not adhering to it, you’ll find yourself in a challenging situation.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-great-blend-of-magic-and-brute-force-nbsp">A Great Blend of Magic and Brute Force&nbsp;</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Combat heavily relies on melee combat, but it’s blended with several magic-based skills. You were able to access three different types of elements in the preview build: Fire, Freeze, and Thunder, which can be used to enchant your weapons and deal some mighty blows to the enemies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We had access to two different types of arrows, too, for ranged attacks. One of the other weapons could be imbued with one of your chosen elements to inflict damage as well as a status effect on the enemies. The other arrow called for a barrage of raining fire arrows from the sky, damaging masses of enemies at once.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It took me some time to get used to all the attacks and abilities they had to offer, but once things started going, I was having a whole lot of fun. I was slashing one enemy, stabbing another; I think I even pulled off a WWE move once, smacking the enemy straight down into the ground.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-a-visual-treat-nbsp">A Visual Treat&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The graphics and performance of Crimson Desert were brilliant, at least for a preview build. <a href="https://crimsondesert.pearlabyss.com/en-US/Main" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pearl Abyss</a> brings players to an intriguing fantasy world, which is filled with all types of flora and fauna. The world feels massive, although I was only able to explore a tiny part of it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With such a massive world, you need to have different ways to traverse, and the game offers several. Of course, like most games, you can jump and sprint wherever you need to go, and there are plenty of climbable surfaces. On top of that, the main character has a floating/gliding ability, which can be used to cover a lot of distance when dropping from heights.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You also have a trusty steed, like most fantasy games. However, the horse’s movement felt very clunky and slow; it needs a bit of work. Sprinting was almost always faster to get to a location.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>



<p>Crimson Desert has excellent potential and has a lot going for it. It will be the perfect title for players who are looking to sink their teeth into a new fantasy adventure. Combat is extensive and complex. It can be unforgiving at times, especially with the bosses, if you don’t know your way around it.&nbsp;It isn’t a Soulslike game, but it will require some effort from casual gamers.</p>



<p>However, there was not a lot to explore in Crimson Desert’s open world, so it’s hard to tell how it’s shaping up or if it feels lived in. At the same time, if the developers have put in the same amount of attention to detail with the world design as they have with combat, then players have a solid experience waiting for them.&nbsp;</p>

Rediscover its iconic locations and unforgettable characters through a stunning visual overhaul, redesigned gameplay, and the same captivating storytelling that made it a classic.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Kate Walker, a brilliant lawyer from New York, is sent to a remote village in the French Alps to finalize the sale of an old automaton factory. But what begins as a routine assignment soon turns into an extraordinary journey across Eastern Europe and its snow-covered landscapes.</p><p>Accompanied by Oscar, a loyal and one-of-a-kind automaton, Kate sets out to explore mysterious and forgotten places, filled with eccentric characters, as she follows the trail of Hans Voralberg, a genius inventor pursuing a seemingly impossible dream: finding the last living mammoths on the mythical island of Syberia.</p><p>An unexpected, thrilling, and deeply emotional voyage that will challenge everything she thought she knew. First released in 2002, <em>Syberia</em> became a reference in the <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,507 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> genre, praised for its unique atmosphere, sharp writing, and the richness of Benoit Sokal’s artistic vision. This remaster is a new opportunity to (re)discover the masterpiece, following in the footsteps of other titles from Benoit Sokal such as <em><a title="Games > Syberia: The World Before [6 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/syberia-the-world-before">Syberia: The World Before</a></em> and the newly released <em><a title="Games > Amerzone: The Explorer's Legacy (2025) [5 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/amerzone-the-explorers-legacy-2025">Amerzone: The Explorer’s Legacy</a></em>.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>A Faithful and Stunning Overhaul</strong> – Meet Syberia’s iconic characters fully redesigned and explore the game’s most emblematic locations brought to life in beautifully enhanced 3D. Every environment has been carefully rebuilt with an art direction that stays true to Benoît Sokal’s unique style, offering an even deeper immersion into his singular visual universe.</li><li><strong>Reimagined Mechanical Puzzles</strong> – Enjoy a fresh take on the game’s intricate puzzles, redesigned to provide a smoother and more intuitive experience while preserving their essential role in uncovering the secrets behind Voralberg’s genius.</li><li><strong>A Modernized Gameplay <a title="Companies > Experience [212 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a></strong> – Rediscover Kate Walker’s journey with an updated user interface, improved 3D navigation, and more fluid controls tailored to today’s standards, all without compromising the game’s contemplative and narrative soul.</li><li><strong>A Rich and Immersive World</strong> – From the alpine town of Valadilène to the frozen edges of Eastern Russia, Syberia transports you into a world of mystery, automatons, and poetic machinery. Dive into a clockpunk adventure where realism blends seamlessly with dreamlike wonder.</li><li><strong>A Moving and Unforgettable Story</strong> – Experience a deeply human narrative, as Kate Walker’s legal assignment turns into a profound journey of self-discovery.

    <p><span>Seed and Orphie &amp; Magus join the fray.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 2.2 update for <em><a title="Games > Zenless Zone Zero [26 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/zenless-zone-zero">Zenless Zone Zero</a></em>, dubbed “Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night,” will launch on September 4, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [202 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-987401"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>After thwarting the Exaltists’ conspiracy previously, the Defense Force dispatches the Obol Squad to join the conflict, introducing the new agents Seed and Orphie &amp; Magus. With trustworthy allies and various in-game events, Proxies will get to delve deeper into the power struggles in New Eridu and uncover the past of the familiar yet fresh faction, the Obol Squad.</p><p>The Defense Force’s intervention—spearheaded by Major General Lorenz and commanded by Colonel Isolde—throws Waifei Peninsula’s power struggles into even more turbulent waters. Beyond eliminating the Exaltists’ remnants, the Obol Squad will also uncover long-buried truths and reveal the hidden stories behind team member Seed’s mysterious past and inner world.</p><p>As a genius mechanic, the S-Rank Electric Attack Agent Seed has transformed the Seed Sr. mecha into a formidable partner with overwhelming firepower and suppression capabilities. Seed excels in synergizing with other Attack agents to enhance the team’s sustained damage output. Orphie &amp; Magus, the S-Rank Fire Attack Agent and Obol Squad’s captain, excels in coordinated team combat using powerful lasers. Through EX Special Attack that assists allies, Orphie can accumulate Bottled Heat, and place all squad members into the Zeroed In state upon hitting enemies, boosting Attack and allowing Aftershocks to ignore a portion of the enemy’s Defense. Joining the stellar lineup is Mercury, the outstanding S-Rank Bangboo who operates a tank as combat support on the battlefield. S-Rank Electric Stun Agent Trigger and S-Rank Fire Attack Agent Evelyn will return in Version 2.2. Additionally, Soldier 0 – Anby is currently undergoing intensive training, and Proxies can expect her to return even stronger with her activated potential in future versions.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_987402"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
        <blockquote><p>As for events, the Bangboo tower defense event Band of Brave Bangboo will come with new maps, enemies, and mechanics, including bushes and Miasmic environment. Successfully clearing stages will reward Proxies with the A-Rank Excaliboo. This Bangboo will attempt to draw his holy sword before attacking—success results in powerful sword strikes, while failure leads to determined hammer attacks against opponents. For lighter entertainment, the Rhythm Rave event challenges Proxies to sync beats with classic tracks and earn abundant in-game rewards.</p><p>Continuous optimizations has also been implemented to further improve player experience. For example, Proxies can now choose between Belle or Wise before starting companion events such as Quality Time invites.</p></blockquote><p><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [10,226 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,789 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [24,070 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">client download</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/zenless-zone-zero-c7c151" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zenless-zone-zero/id1606356401" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HoYoverse.Nap&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a>.</p><p>Watch a new set of trailers and the version 2.2 special program below.

<p>"We've built it for solo or four-player squads as well. You cannot pick a difficulty like past games. We've baked it in because you have to approach a co-op campaign differently, and we wanted to make sure the missions felt right for solo players," Leslie told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-campaign-does-not-have-difficulty-options-treyarch-explains-why" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>.</p><p>For players who enjoy a solo experience, Leslie said, "We're not forgetting about you; we love you." However, Black Ops 7's campaign was designed to be a "social experience."</p><p>"We want to make sure it's fun, but the right amount of challenging for two, three, and four players as well," Leslie said.</p><p>Call of Duty's difficulty levels over the years have included things like Recruit, Regular, Hardened, and Veteran, along with a super-challenging Realism mode.</p><p>For Black Ops 7, the campaign difficulty <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-again-black-ops-7-does-plenty-to-avoid-feeling-like-dlc/1100-6534011/" data-ref-id="1100-6534011">will scale when playing co-op</a>, meaning partying up with friends doesn't necessarily make it easier, and teamwork is needed to get through missions.</p><p>Another thing that's new for Black Ops 7's campaign is how XP progression from the campaign is connected to multiplayer, Zombies, and Warzone. Additionally, Black Ops 7's campaign closes with a mission called "Avalon Endgame," which is described as a "brand-new, replayable experience where you and your squad will need to survive overwhelming odds, adapt under pressure, and break the rules of what you thought a Black Ops campaign could be."</p><p>Black Ops 7 launches on November 14, and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-start-time-how-to-get-in-and-everything-else-to-know/1100-6534073/" data-ref-id="1100-6534073">multiplayer beta will be held in October. </a>The game is coming to PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox, and PC, and it'll be included with Xbox Game Pass.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight’s reveal at Gamescom 2025 has ignited a wealth of excitement for the upcoming title from TT Games, and we’ve gathered everything we know about the release date.</p>



<p>Revealed as the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-revealed-at-gamescom-onl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next LEGO title from TT Games</a>, LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight impressed us during a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hands-on preview</a>, although some eyebrows have been raised with marketing stating that there are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-will-feature-only-7-playable-characters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">only seven playable characters</a> in the game.</p>



<p>There’s still plenty to be revealed about LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight, and, if you want to begin your countdown to release, we’ve got all the details you need.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-have-a-release-date">Does LEGO Batman: Legacy of The Dark Knight Have a Release Date?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Fire up the Bat Signal. Image via TT Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, a precise release date for LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight has not been shared by TT Games.</strong></p>



<p>After being revealed at Gamescom, it’s understandable that players are keen to know exactly when they will be able to get their hands on the title, but there’s going to be a bit of a wait before those details become available.</p>



<p>In fact, don’t expect a precise release date to be shared this year, given the release window that has been issued is pretty broad.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-release-window">What is The LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight Release Window?</h2>



<p><strong>TT Games announced at Gamescom, following the reveal of LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight, that the release window for the title is 2026.</strong></p>



<p>Unlike many other games, no specific month or season for <a href="https://warnerbrosgames.com/article/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</a>‘s launch has been shared, resulting in a pretty broad window, but there are some trends that could be followed.</p>



<p>For example, Grand Theft Auto 6 is looming large in 2026 with a release date in May, and most, if not all, developers will want to avoid going head-to-head against the titan, giving it is expected to be one of the biggest gaming launches of all time.</p>



<p>Although LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga was released in April 2022, that was an outlier in TT Games’ history, as, traditionally, releases have come in May/June or September/October/November.</p>



<p>In 2018, LEGO: DC Super-Villains was released in October, while in 2017, LEGO: Marvel Superheroes 2 was released in November. Going back further, LEGO Dimensions was released in September 2015, and LEGO Batman 3: Beyond Gotham was released in November 2014.</p>



<p>Though that doesn’t clear the release window up exactly, it does mean that TT Games’ previous schedule suggests we won’t see LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight in the first half of 2026.</p>

                <p>Battlestate Games has been developing its intense first-person tactical shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/escape-from-tarkov/" data-ref-id="5000-673440">Escape From Tarkov</a> since 2012. Although the closed beta debuted in 2017, players had no idea when to expect the full release. Now, Battlestate Games has shared a new live-action Escape From Tarkov trailer that confirms its exit from early access this fall.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpeLk_OJ9-M" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HpeLk_OJ9-M" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The November 15 release date was revealed in the closing seconds of the video above.

Presumably it will have some story content as well as refined maps, weapons, and quality-of-life improvements. But absent any firm details from Battlestate Games, we can only speculate.</p><p>Battlestate Games has kept a community of Escape From Tarkov players together for over eight years. However, there have been some issues that caused friction between the studio and its fans. After releasing a $150 Edge of Darkness limited edition that was said to include all future DLC, Battlestate Games released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/escape-from-tarkov-arena/" data-ref-id="5000-450666">Escape From Tarkov: Arena</a> and the game’s PvE mode as a separate $250 purchase. That led to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-escape-from-tarkov-edition-locks-pve-behind-250-paywall/1100-6522990/" data-ref-id="1100-6522990">a backlash against the studio</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/escape-from-tarkov-boss-didnt-expect-players-to-get-mad-about-paid-pve-content/1100-6523084/" data-ref-id="1100-6523084">a subsequent apology from Battlestate Games</a> came with a promise to let Edge of Darkness owners access the PvE mode as well.</p><p>Escape From Tarkov is only available to play on PC and can be found on <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/escape-from-tarkov-arena-d3e23b" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Epic Games Store</a>.</p>

                <p>2025 has already been a banner year for Nightdive Studios, the team behind the recently released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/system-shock-2/" data-ref-id="5000-278">System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster</a> and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/heretic-plus-hexen/" data-ref-id="5000-689540">Heretic + Hexen</a> remaster. The studio has made its name by giving classic games a modern coat of paint. One of the titles that Nightdive Studios CEO Stephen Kick is still eager to get his hands on is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/eternal-darkness-sanitys-requiem/" data-ref-id="5000-2569">Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem</a>, which has only ever been released on GameCube back in 2002.</p><p>Kick shared his desire to revisit Eternal Darkness during a recent appearance on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRbxQmqRenc&amp;t=431s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shacknews </a>(via <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/nightdives-ceo-reiterates-desire-to-remaster-eternal-darkness" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Life</a>). But since the rights to the game are fully owned by Nintendo, it may never get an official re-release.</p><p>"[Eternal Darkness has] been kinda locked behind the GameCube/Nintendo wall all this time, and it's something that I would personally love to see get re-released," Kick said. </p><p>Silicon Knights developed Eternal Darkness, which was the first M-rated game published by Nintendo. Although the game wasn't considered a survival-horror title, it did have horror elements and a unique way of messing with players through sanity effects that were meant to break the fourth wall.</p><p>Eternal Darkness director Denis Dyack made multiple attempts to develop a spiritual sequel called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/shadow-of-the-eternals/" data-ref-id="false">Shadow of the Eternals</a>. However, two separate crowdfunding initiatives fell short and production of the game was ultimately shut down.</p><p>Kick has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/system-shock-remake-dev-is-trying-very-hard-to-rev/1100-6480003/" data-ref-id="1100-6480003">previously shared his desire</a> to revive <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-operative-no-one-lives-forever/" data-ref-id="5000-2505">The Operative: No One Lives Forever</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/no-one-lives-forever-2-a-spy-in-harms-way/" data-ref-id="5000-3854">No One Lives Forever 2: A Spy in H.A.R.M.'s Way</a>. During the Shacknews interview, Kick reiterated that those games remain a priority for him. However, the rights to that franchise have been difficult to untangle for the last two decades.</p><p>Nightdive's next release, Outlaws + Handful of Missions: Remaster, will hit Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and PC on November 20.</p>

                <p>Gearbox Software's Randy Pitchford has predicted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6529507/" data-ref-id="1100-6529507">Borderlands 4</a> will push the franchise's total sales numbers to a new stratosphere: 100 million units. Speaking to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-randy-pitchford-100-million-units-borderlands-4/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming</a>, Pitchford said plainly, "We will break 100 million units with this launch, easily, all in, with the franchise."</p><p>That's not actually a very bold prediction. The series currently stands at <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/4caa8ce3-9cd2-45d5-b267-593e2391801f" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">more than 94 million units</a>, so Pitchford is predicting sales of at least 6 million for Borderlands 4. By comparison, Borderlands 3 sold more than 23 million copies and is 2K's fastest-selling game ever. The top-selling game of all time for 2K is Borderlands 2, which has achieved sales of more than 30 million units.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Borderlands 4 - 20 Minutes of Siren Gameplay</p>
      </div>
<p>Not many video game franchises have reached 100 million units sold. If Borderlands 4 can help push the series to that level, Borderlands would join the likes of GTA, Red Dead, Pokemon, Call of Duty, Minecraft, Final Fantasy, and Assassin's Creed.</p><p>Pitchford said in the interview that when he was first trying to sell Borderlands, he had to "scream from the tallest mountain to get anyone to pay attention to it." Back then, Pitchford said "nobody cared" about Borderlands and that, "A lot of people predicted that Borderlands wasn't going to work."</p><p>Prior to Borderlands coming on the scene in 2009, Gearbox was better known for the WW2 FPS series Brothers in Arms, along with Half-Life expansion packs. Borderlands became a gigantic success, and the franchise remains strong.</p><p>"We went from an industry that predicted that we would die--that Borderlands would find no audience--to being one of the leading video game franchises in the world. And it's kind of humbling, frankly, to be a part of it," Pitchford told <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/borderlands/gearbox-boss-randy-pitchford-says-the-game-industry-once-expected-a-genre-experiment-like-borderlands-to-die-but-it-actually-became-one-of-the-leading-video-game-franchises-in-the-world-its-kind-of-humbling/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar.</a></p><p>Borderlands 4 launches on September 12 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, with a Switch 2 edition coming in October. A major point of online discussion about Borderlands 4 has been its price--which is $70. Pitchford said the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-would-still-be-worth-it-at-5x-the-price-gearbox-boss-says/1100-6534143/" data-ref-id="1100-6534143">delivers so much value that it would still be worth it if 2K charged $350.</a></p>

<p>And it's looking gooey</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>It only feels like yesterday that Bloober Team confirmed that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> would be launching on the Switch 2. Yet here we are, merely a couple of weeks from its <strong>5th September</strong> release, and the lovely Felix has gone hands-on with the title during his stint at Gamescom (yes, Felix said it's out on the 4th, but it's been a very busy week for him).</p>
<p>Despite some initial confusion around his appointment, Felix got to spend a decent chunk of time with Cronos and came away feeling pretty good about the whole thing. The demo showcased some solid survival horror gameplay in which creepy creatures would merge with corpses to form all new types of monstrosities, all of which are simply <em>begging</em> to be put out of their misery.</p>
<p>It's important to note with the Switch 2 version that the game runs at 30fps with some key visual downgrades when compared to the likes of the PC and PS5. That said, it still looks pretty decent, and Bloober Team's fantastic work on the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/silent_hill_2">Silent Hill 2</a> remake gives us high hopes for this one.</p>
<p>If you're more keen on checking out some direct-feed gameplay with no commentary, then good news, because we also have that for you just below. Enjoy!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">DICE has outlined what it's learned — and what it's changing — following the open beta test for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6"><u>Battlefield 6</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With "tens of thousands connecting on Discord to play together, over 600,000 hours streamed, and over 30 million hours watched," the Battlefield team said it would "like to take a moment to look back at the recent Open Beta to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1mwddm7/battlefield_6_community_update_open_beta_debrief/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">share our key learnings</a> and in-game changes we’re making based on your feedback and in-game data," including tweaks to weapons, movement, maps, modes, player counts, and playlist options.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps one of the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1mwdur5/movement_will_be_changed_for_the_final_release/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>biggest complaints from players</u></a> was around movement mechanics, particularly the speed of movement, and moving out of a slide into a jump. DICE says it's now "adjusting" this "to create a more balanced and traditional Battlefield experience."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Momentum, especially horizontal speed, carried from a slide into a jump has been reduced," the team wrote. "There is now a greater penalty for consecutive jumps, which lowers jump height when jumps are spammed. Firing while jumping or sliding will result in increased inaccuracy. These changes are designed to make sliding and jumping more situational, so they are no longer ideal options for engaging in gunfights, and will contribute to a gameplay pace that rewards skillful movement without becoming too fast or unpredictable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Parachute physics have also been re-tuned, with reduced initial acceleration when opening the parachute for more controlled aerial movement."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team was also keen for you to know that it heard your "strong feedback" about larger-scale maps, and says that while the Open Beta intentionally featured smaller, more fast-paced maps, "larger-scale maps are already part of our package, delivering action-packed gameplay and memorable, unique moments for every player." As Battlefield Labs continues — that's the closed test available to select players who sign an NDA — it'll introduce two new multiplayer maps: one set in Mirak Valley, the other a remake of the fan-favorite from Battlefield 3, Operation Firestorm. These two maps "include the full complement of vehicles, like Liberation Peak, along with a more vast combat space." Details about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/much-bigger-battlefield-6-maps-leak-online-following-datamine"><u>Mirak, you may remember, leaked earlier this week</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And of course, the studio is looking at feedback on modes, too. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-knows-you-dont-like-rush-mode-and-has-already-cut-mcom-timers-by-33"><u>DICE recently made changes to Rush mode after a negative response from fans</u></a>, noting "the conversation we observed wasn’t just about player count, but also about how maps play, and the tactical experience they offer."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those who aren't aware, Rush was initially known as Gold Rush in Bad Company, where matches typically ranged from 12v12 to 16v16 players. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We’ve experimented with larger player counts over the years, such as 64- and even 128-player versions. While these matches created intense, fast-paced moments, they also led to issues: Overwhelming defenses, stalled frontlines, and too many games ending in the first sector," DICE explained. "Rush is especially sensitive to higher player counts due to its tactical and strategic requirements; when a player tries to arm the M-COM while more than 20 opponents are defending, the intended gameplay becomes less tangible. Based on feedback throughout recent titles, we’re lowering the default player count for Rush to improve the flow of combat and restore the tactical, methodical experience that defines the mode."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those who enjoy a "large-scale" Rush, however, will still be able to "experiment" with different player counts via the Portal from launch. "Finding the right balance is an ongoing process as everyone gets familiar with map size, lanes, and combat spaces," the team added. "For now, we’ve found that 8v8 provides a solid starting point for small-scale, fast-paced modes like Team Death Match, Squad Death Match, Domination, and KOTH."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"With the insights gathered during the Open Beta play sessions, we will be introducing in-game adjustments in upcoming Battlefield Labs events. Stay tuned for progress updates and future opportunities to get involved," the team concluded. "Lastly, thanks again for joining the Battlefield 6 Open Beta. Your feedback and participation made it an incredible experience."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We're having a great time with what we've played so far, writing in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-review-multiplayer"><u>Battlefield 6 review-in-progress</u></a>: "We are still in the beta period, but I’m already having an absolute blast with Battlefield 6’s multiplayer. The action is sublime, with a cinematic quality to the constantly raining debris that is enhanced by how legitimately effective it is to take strategic advantage of that destruction.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Right now, even in beta form, Battlefield 6 might be the most fun shooter I’ve played this year."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Don't forget that from now until October 7 — Battlefield 6's launch day — EA has a "wave of content" planned for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-2042"><u>Battlefield 2042</u></a>, including a free new pass "celebrating the legacy of Battlefield," new hardware, and a reimagining of the fan favorite Iwo Jima map. As you progress through the 'Road to Battlefield 6' pass, you can expect 50 "exclusive cross-rewards," including 20 for Battlefield 6 that will be ready for you on launch day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

<p>Docked and loaded</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Earlier this week, we were lucky enough to head to the Nintendo booth at Gamescom and go <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/video-uh-oh-elden-ring-on-switch-2-has-issues-in-handheld-mode">hands-on</a> with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition</a> on Switch 2. Bandai Namco didn't allow any footage to be recorded from our handheld session (and we quickly saw why), but it seems such recording rules are not in place at Canada's <a href="https://fanexpohq.com/fanexpocanada/">Fan Expo</a>, which kicked off yesterday and was allowing over-the-shoulder recording of the docked demos.</p>
<p>One visitor, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MDee14">MDee14</a>, recorded footage of their entire play session and has quickly shared it online, giving us our first proper look at how this thing runs when the Switch 2 is up on a big screen. Fortunately, it looks better than the handheld offering seems to be.</p>
<p>The video (above) shows the attendee's entire preview session, from the opening tutorial section to some early exploration around Limgrave. The performance is far from what you'd expect to see on a PS5, but it seems to hold up <em>pretty</em> well, with the noticeable drops coming from big sequences like the opening of the Limgrave gate. Things seem okay otherwise, but let's bear in mind that this kind of over-the-shoulder footage isn't always the best way to see every little detail.</p>
<p>Our brief hands-on time with the game in handheld told a very different story. It looks like docked mode might be the way to go with this one (at least, in whatever build is being shown in expos at the moment), as our handheld play was plagued with hefty frame drops and stutters a-plenty — though no capture was allowed for these sessions, naturally.</p>
<p>We're still waiting on a release date for Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition, but let's hope that we don't have too long to wait before we can see the launch performance really put through its paces.</p>

</p>
<p>
Future updates will also be free for those with the base game, though post-launch content is yet to be divulged.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, for those intrigued, a technical test will run this weekend from 23rd - 24th August on all three platforms - simply search for the game on your platform of choice.

            <title><![CDATA[Rogue Point Preview – When tactical shooting goes rogue…]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/22/rogue-point-preview-when-tactical-shooting-goes-rogue/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rogue-point-preview-%E2%80%93-when-tactical-shooting-goes-rogue%E2%80%A6.1278024/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>There’s something special about tactical shooters that the more hyperactive likes of Call of Duty and Battlefield simply can’t match. The tension of knowing that every corner and doorway could hold a swift end to your mission, the close camaraderie of working through a scenario with friends, the elation of coming out on top. Now blend that, in a somewhat lightened form, with the brinksmanship of a roguelite and you’ve got Rogue Point.</p>
<p><iframe title="Rogue Point | Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yy039nGgwj0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Coming from the team behind Black Mesa, the four player tactical action of Rogue Point is a rather different project for Crowbar Collective. To be clear, this isn’t a hard-nosed tactical shooter in the vein of classic Rainbow Six, Ghost Recon and modern Ready or Not, but it holds onto that same general tone and mission structure in a way that should appeal to the same audience, just with the need to string successful missions together and the threat of losing everything and starting over.</p>


<p>There’s some neat touches in the planning phase: as a mission map is presented to you, highlighting the objective areas that you’ll need to scour — naturally these are randomised alongside the enemy placement — and you’re able to doodle and draw to quickly plan out a mission. I’ve no doubt that, after 3 or 4 stages, these discussions could get very serious.</p>
<p>Alongside that, there’s loadout adjustments, but being a roguelite naturally imposes some restrictions here. You’ll only have a limited initial pool of cash to spend on guns and gear initially, with more kit coming through both run and metagame unlocks. You do have an option to gamble though, dropping $500 on a mystery crate that could be just what you want or force you into a different playstyle and role.</p>


<p>Naturally you want to try and have loadouts and builds that compliment one another, but there’s a great co-op feature in the form of backpack items. Instead of tucking things like health kits away in your pocket for you and only you to use and activate, here they are held in your backpack, and anyone and everyone on your squad and wander up and grab something they need.</p>
<p>Beyond that, there’s also that sharing spirit between missions. If you die on a mission but your teammates are able to complete it, you will have lost all the gear you took in, but they’ll be fully equipped. To try and get you back up to speed, your group can share their inventory, helping even out your builds again.</p>
<p>A lot of a tactical shooter’s vibe relies on the quality of the AI, and Rogue Point’s exhibits different characteristics and behaviours. The standard grunts will blast away and take cover where necessary, but berserker AI will just rush you and close the gap. Heavies are the more armoured foes, but the most interesting is the lookouts, who will be keen to retreat and back away from you. How you approach them is vital, and end with a face full of lead if you mess up, as kicking down a door will require three hefty kicks alerting anyone on the other side in the process.</p>

<p>There’s always a tricky balance to strike between accuracy, aggressiveness and other traits, which Crowbar Collective will tweak right up to and after release. From what we saw at Gamescom, it looks to be quite forgiving to start with, at least. Health kits will a literal lifesaver, but you can probably take a couple more hits than in Ready or Not.</p>
<p>Each mission builds up to an extraction after successfully completing the main objectives, where you have that tense wait and defensive action to hold on until you can get away. Here the game can spawn in more enemies to spice things up again, though I do wonder if this could be over-egging the pudding.</p>
<p>The challenge of each roguelite run will escalate as you complete stages and missions, and you have a set number of mission failures before it’s game over. They can break down levels into smaller areas for early missions, so perhaps just the lower floor of the oil rig, as opposed to the full complex. Add to that the player choice between what missions you take on, with a higher challenge rating promising greater bonuses at the end, and there’s some real risk and reward here.</p>
<p>Rogue Point is a really fascinating blend of tactical shooter and roguelite — two styles of game that, the more I think about it, have a lot of common ground. I’m keen to see how it all comes together as it heads to Steam Early Access later this year.</p>
