            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-mans-sky-worlds-part-i-update<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hello Games has released the&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>Worlds Part I update, introducing "a complete refresh of the universe", increased flora and fauna diversity, and big visual enhancements, plus lots more.</p>
<p>Visual changes include new water effects with "realistic wave formations and foam generation", as well as deeper and more detailed shadows, better definition for clouds, and more. Suffice it to say that the worlds of&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>should now be significantly more beautiful places to visit.</p>
<p>The changes aren't just visual, though; several of the game's planets have also been dramatically transformed with new floating islands that could serve as perfect places for "bases in the sky", as Hello Games puts it. You can't tell me you've never wanted to live amongst the clouds!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/no-mans-sky-worlds-part-i-update-art.jpg?itok=WR5R0efT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/no-mans-sky-worlds-part-i-update-art.jpg?itok=jPNsg0br 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The new&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>update promises a significant visual overhaul for the almost eight-year-old game.</figcaption></figure><p>Those worlds will also be populated by new creatures, "bizarre floral hybrids" that boast "stamen-like whiskers and petal-like faces". Just in case you weren't quite unsettled enough by what's already out there in the galaxy.</p>
<p>Tons of other changes, including improved wind simulation, more diverse desert worlds, and even frozen sub-zero planets with icy trees and glacial rocks, have also been implemented, hopefully bringing&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky</em>'s galaxy to life like never before.</p>
<p>You can check out the announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>Worlds Part I, which shows off some of the game's new visual changes in motion, right here.</p>

<p>Additionally, Hello Games head Sean Murray has also released a deep dive video detailing some of Worlds Part I's changes in close-up, so if you're interested in the technical side of things, you can check that video out here.</p>

<p>Of course, it's not just visual and world changes; Worlds Part I also has new content for you to discover, including a new insect-themed armor set, new UI label elements, and much more. You can check out the full&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>Worlds Part I <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/worlds-part-i-update/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">patch notes here</a>.</p>
<p>Worlds Part I is just the latest update in Hello Games' ongoing redemption story, with previous updates bringing features like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-mans-sky-orbital-update">starship customization</a>, new <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-mans-sky-omega-update">expeditions</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-mans-sky-echoes-update">additional story elements</a> to make&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>a more enticing prospect.</p>
<p>It's safe to say that if you haven't played&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>since its launch, it's a very different beast today, especially with Worlds Part I's visual update. You can grab the game right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/275850/No_Mans_Sky/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/216600" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/no-mans-sky/BQVQTL3PCH05" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/no-mans-sky-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.</p>

Crocs has teamed up with The Pokémon Company to offer more official versions of its shoes.
</p>
<p>
Following the Pikachu-themed Classic Clog released earlier this year, four more variants are due to arrive this year based on Gen 1 favourites Gengar, Charizard, Snorlax, and Jigglypuff.
</p>
<p>
Each design features a Jibbitz charm to go with its colour scheme, as well as Pokéball logos on the straps. I hate them all.

"This new pack promises to captivate fans of both brands, merging the playful essence of Pokémon with the comfort and style of Crocs," reads the post. "Style" seems like a stretch.

Perhaps these garish, jellified shoes are your thing, but I can't think of anything worse to put on my feet, let alone wear them in public. Pokémon Crocs, I choose... none of you.

Still, Pokémon merchandise always seems to sell well, and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/four-van-gogh-museum-employees-suspended-after-pokemon-exhibit-chaos">exclusive card at the Van Gogh Museum caused quite the furore</a>.

Some hoped for custom space stations, others guessed a complete universal reset, and a few wondered if Hello Games might finally be ready to share more information about it’s other upcoming project, the fantasy survival RPG <em>Light No Fire</em>. We didn’t end up getting a new trailer for that game, but it did come up in today’s update. </p><p>“Six months ago we announced<em> Light No Fire</em>,” Murray wrote. “It’s this insanely ambitious game. Over the last five years making game, we’ve learnt new things, and we’re feeding that back into <em>No Man’s Sky</em>. It feels like we’re bringing technology back from the future!” That’s effectively another way of saying that the new planetary features players can now experience in No Man’s Sky also act as a teaser, and potentially an early preview, of what they can expect from the look and feel of<em> Light No Fire</em>. The game doesn’t have a release date but here’s hoping we hear more about it at one of the gaming showcases coming later this year.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHfNDBIQ1kk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new trailer</a> today, Hello Games finally announced the Worlds Part 1 update coming to No Man’s Sky, following a series of cryptic teases on X.</p>



<p>Sean Murray of Hello Games led a deep dive trailer for the update, confirming all of the key changes players can expect. </p>



<p>Worlds Part 1, Update 5.0, will introduce improved visuals, more planetary diversity, and a variety of new features. </p>



<p>That includes the fourteenth community expedition, where Liquidators must hunt down bugs spreading across the universe. Liquidators will also be armed with a combat mech, and corresponding insect armor. For some, it partly resembles Helldivers 2, which did <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-12-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sell 12 million units</a> in weeks.</p>

</p></figure>







<p>Hello Games also released <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/worlds-part-I-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lengthy patch notes</a> on No Man’s Sky anticipated Worlds update. In Worlds Part 1, players can finally rename discoveries at any time, “even after upload.” </p>



<p>Planets throughout the game universe are also transformed due to gravitational distortions. As a result, players will find floating islands and can build bases in the sky. </p>



<p>Fans can also craft Solar-class starships, find unusual new creatures, and enjoy new interaction labels.</p>



<p>Between living, walking planetary buildings and a host of engine improvements, Worlds Part 1 is one of the game’s most ambitious updates yet. It has DLSS3 support, fresh biomes, and extensive quality-of-life improvements.</p>



<p>No Man’s Sky is available now on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, and Xbox. Fans still await <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hello-games-light-no-fire/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Light No Fire</a>, which Hello Games announced at The Game Awards 2023.</p>

First up you’ll need to grab the <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Iron_Rivet_Armor">Iron Rivet Armor</a> after defeating Red Bear in the Northern Nameless Mausoleum located to the northwest of Castle Ensis in the Land of Shadow, and equipping a plain set of bracers. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/17/he-man-elden-ring-1721220621235.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image credit: Reddit user SethKlock.</figcaption></figure></output><p>SethKlock opted to go with <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Elden_Lord_Greaves">Godfrey’s Grieves</a> to complete his He-Man armour set, which can only be obtained from Finger Reader Enia in the Roundtable Hold after defeating Hoarah Loux at the climax of the base game. For the final touch, you’ll need to seek out the Sword of Light introduced by the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC.</p><p>In the He-Man and the Masters of the Universe animated series, the Power Sword served as a conduit through which Prince Adam channelled the power of Castle Grayskull, in order to transform into his alter ego He-Man, the most powerful individual in the universe. Elden Ring's Shadow of the Erdtree DLC just so happens to have introduced a new weapon called the Sword of Light, which does an uncanny job of mimicing this transformation upon triggering its special ability.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree DLC Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Sadly, the Sword of Light won't go so far as to change you into an all powerful avatar of justice, though it <em>will </em>set off a light show that damages surrounding enemies while buffing your holy damage output. Actually getting your hand on the sword is a little tricky, involving the use of an Indiana Jones-style invisible bridge, and some in-depth exploration.

Featuring huge leaps in water and cloud visuals, increased planetary diversity, new gameplay features, and more.</p><ul><li><strong>Big Hunt Expedition: The Liquidators</strong> – Engage in a galactic bug hunt in <em>No Man’s Sky</em>‘s fourteenth community expedition. A vile brood is spreading corruption across the universe—join the Liquidator Vanguard to do your part and purge the rot from the stars! Report for duty alongside other Travellers to liquidate biological <a title="Genres > Horror [439 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/horror">horror</a>s and hosts of giant insects in a high-paced combat expedition full of custom-balanced swarm combat. An exclusive selection of rewards await those that do their part in the war on bugs, including mounted bug trophies, new posters, and a complete set of organic armor parts forged from the bodies of the brood themselves.</li><li><strong>Discovery Renaming</strong> – Discovered systems, planets, flora, fauna, and minerals can now be renamed at any time, even after upload.</li><li><strong>Dramatic New Worlds</strong> – Planets across the universe have been transformed in wild and radical ways. Gravitational distortions have warped some lush and tropical worlds, shaking loose floating islands that now drift in the atmosphere above the planet’s surface. Hop from rock-to-rock with the jetpack or starship, build bases in the sky, or simply marvel at the dramatic waterfalls that cascade down from the sky.</li><li><strong>New Volumetric Clouds</strong> – A total overhaul of the clouds brings vastly increased detail and definition. The cloud system has been rewritten from the ground up to improve performance, fix visual artefacts, and introduce fine details such as wispy cirrus clouds and dark, rain-laden nimbus clouds. In addition, cloud coverage variety has been boosted, varying significantly from planet-to-planet, as well as over time and in response to local weather conditions.</li><li><strong>Customize Solar Ships</strong> – The Starship Fabricator now supports the <a title="Genres > Crafting [17 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/crafting">crafting</a> of Solar-class starships. Select and combine a vast array of unique components for cockpits, fuselages, wings, and sails to design your dream Solar starship.</li><li><strong>Detailed Shadows</strong> – Shadows have new depth and realism. Planetary environments are now more richly lit, with natural features, structures, starships, and Travellers accurately self-shadowing and representing exposure to sunlight—especially noticeable on finely-detailed flora such as grass. Additionally, shadows cast by clouds are now calculated in relation to the sun position.</li><li><strong>High Definition Water</strong> – An astounding range of sights await explorers on water planets, as seas, oceans, and lakes now ripple and sparkle with realistic wave formations and foam generation. As well as these living, dynamic water conditions, a total overhaul of the water rendering technology also brings dramatic reflections and beautifully lit surface details.</li><li><strong>Otherworldly Life</strong> – Discover strange new creatures all across the universe. Bizarre floral hybrids stalk some planets, exploring their environments with stamen-like whiskers and petal-like faces.</li><li><strong>Full Wind <a title="Genres > Simulation [524 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/simulation">Simulation</a></strong> – The wind system has been reworked to bring planets to life with dynamic and consistent weather. Leaves and grass rustle in gentle wind while whole trees rock and sway during storms. Smoke effects, billowing dust clouds, rain, snow and other environmental effects all go through the same wind system, for an immersive and consistent exploration experience.</li><li><strong>Dynamic Water</strong> – Bodies of water respond to the weather—ranging from glassy lakes to turbulent oceans, depending on the stillness of the breeze and the depth of the water. Violent storms can generate dramatically choppy seas and huge ocean swells.</li><li><strong>Liquidator Combat Mech</strong> – Carve through the toughest enemies in a new heavy duty mech suit. All those who do their part in the Liquidators expedition will unlock these new combat-focused components for the Minotaur. As the community purge the vile brood from the universe, plans for these parts will become available at the Quicksilver Synthesis Companion for those unable to take part in the expedition.</li><li><strong>Sub-Zero Worlds</strong> – Frozen worlds have been transformed with ice-laden trees and glittering glacial rocks. New planet surfaces as well as a significant number of new flora and mineral formations bring a new diversity to sub-zero planets.</li><li><strong>Desert Diversity</strong> – Biodiversity of sand-swept planets has been expanded, with large feather-fronded palms adorning the horizon of some worlds.</li><li><strong>Sky Colors</strong> – Step deeper into a 1970s science fiction palette with a range of new sky colors—including some especially rare hues for dedicated explorers to discover.</li><li><strong>Insect Armor Set</strong> – Complete the Liquidators expedition to earn a full-body set of organic armor. Embrace the aesthetic of the vile brood—or flaunt the evidence of their undoing—with chitinous gauntlets, spurs, mandibles, and exoskeleton.</li><li><strong>Engine <a title="Companies > Enhance [31 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/enhance">Enhance</a>ments</strong> – Many underlying systems have been reworked for improved visuals and increased performance. Rendering of environmental objects such as trees, rocks, and grass has been moved to a GPU-based system, allowing for denser worlds with increased performance. Planetary flora, minerals and curiosities have improved levels of detail from further distances and a broader range of angles. Terrain generation has been rewritten to incorporate dual marching cubes voxel meshing, increasing loading speed, improving framerate and saving memory.</li><li><strong>New Interaction Labels</strong> – Labels for interactive and destructible objects in the universe have been restyled and made more responsive, providing critical information without obscuring the view.</li><li><strong>Beetle Diversity</strong> – A wide variety of new insect-like creatures can now be discovered scuttling across the universe. While some of these alien insects are hostile, many species are gentle, peaceful beings. Study their natural patterns, harvest their nourishing slime, or adopt them as companions.</li><li><strong>Dramatic Storms</strong> – Exploring a planet during a blizzard or thunderstorm is more exhilarating than ever. New ambient effects and atmospheric fog combine with wind-responsive particle effects to create dramatic storms that sweep across the planet’s surface.</li><li><strong>Twitch Drops</strong> – Watch experienced Travellers stream <em>No Man’s Sky</em> on Twitch, and earn rewards! Even if you don’t own the game yet, you can earn rewards during the campaign, and claim them in-game at a later date. To sign up, visit the Twitch Drops page. Then just sit back and tune into the campaign running from Thursday, July 18 to Monday, July 22.</li><li><strong>Walker Battles</strong> – Walker battles are now framed by a detailed combat HUD, indicating the targetable vulnerabilities of these elite Sentinel units.</li><li><strong>Chitin Flight Pack</strong> – A new jetpack is available to claim from the Liquidators expedition. A fusion of advanced technology and resinous organic secretions, the Chitin Flight Pack represents the apex of bio-organic engineering.</li><li><strong>Water Color Variety</strong> – Discover oceans in a huge range of vibrant colors—from iron-rich red seas to algae-dense pools of green. Committed explorers may find some especially unusual colors on rare planets…</li><li><strong>Strange Nutrients</strong> – Brew, bake, churn and fry more than 40 new Nutrient Processor recipes from the flesh and larvae of alien insects. Impress other Travellers—or Iteration Cronos—with expertly baked Mucal Doughnuts, Seeping Pies, Juicy Thoraxes and many more new dishes.</li><li><strong>Living Buildings</strong> – Very rarely, in sectors where the anomaly field is strongest, planetary buildings have evolved legs and transformed themselves into sentient constructs that roam across the landscape.</li><li><strong>Aquatic Landing Jets</strong> – New technology allows starships to land directly on the surface of water, enabling Travellers to dive directly into the sea from the nose of their ships. Starships may also be summoned to the water for a quick escape from the middle of the ocean.</li><li><strong>Skylight Base Parts</strong> – Bring the view of the stars into your base with new skylight roofing parts. These new pieces are available for the stone, timber, and alloy construction sets and can be purchased aboard the Space Anomaly.</li><li><strong>Atmospheric Variety</strong> – Planetary atmospheric effects are deeper, richer and more varied, with thick snowfall, flakes of ash and ember, heavy rain, whorls of dust, and storm crystals all visually enhanced.</li><li><strong>Vile Insect Queens</strong> – A vile brood of insects has begun to infest planets across the universe. Find and destroy their grubs and then confront the heart of the hostile swarm: their huge, hideous, brood mothers. These colossal lumbering bugs are heavily armored, and will challenge even the most experienced exterminators with devastating spit attacks.</li><li><strong>Quality of Life</strong> – A significant number of quality of life features have been improved throughout the game. The docking tractor beam at Space Stations and Freighters is now smoother; reloading can be interrupted to quickly cycle weapon modes; refiners can now be quick-filled with an entire stack of items; core technology can be instantly repaired from the Quick Menu; the range of the Analysis Visor’s Target Sweep has been dramatically improved, and much more – see the full patch notes for more detail.</li><li><strong>New Gestures</strong> – Express yourself with four new animated gestures. Browse the Quick Menu to get poised for <a title="Genres > Action [2,010 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>, ponder the landscape, fold your arms in readiness, or burst into energetic dance.</li><li><strong>Spectacular Underwater Bases</strong> – Build cozy aquatic hideouts—or lavish underwater lairs—and enjoy improved views of the waterline.</li><li><strong>DLSS3</strong> – Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) is an NVIDIA technology, available to <a title="Platforms > PC [20,660 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> players with compatible RTX cards, which uses a deep learning neural network to boost frame rates and generate beautiful, sharp images. The latest iteration, DLSS3, multiplies performance by up to 4X compared to traditional rendering, while retaining great image quality. Learn more on the NVIDIA site.</li><li><strong>Vile Brood Nexus Mission</strong> – The observers aboard the Space Anomaly regret the spread of the vile brood across the universe, their queens and grubs disturbing the delicate balance of local ecosystems. They request that Travellers band together to cull these invasive species and restore balance to nature. Group up with friends or strangers at the Nexus to sign up for this new mission.</li><li><strong>Noxious Worlds</strong> – Venture into totally unexplored toxic climates. These new worlds have horizons alive with alluring but poisonous flora, while the ground underneath your feet bubbles and <a title="Companies > ooze [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/ooze">ooze</a>s with living slime.</li><li><strong>Colossal Insect Trophies</strong> – Decorate your living space with a set of bughunter trophies, earned by those who do their part in the Liquidator expedition.</li><li><strong>Hungering Tendril Encounters</strong> – Test your skills against pumped-up hungering tendrils.

                <p>A two-year-old is dead after her father left her in a car in 100-degree heat as he was "distracted by playing video games," according to court documents obtained by <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/07/16/arizona-hot-car-death-christopher-scholtes/74431098007/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">USA Today</a>. Christopher Scholtes, 37, of Arizona, left his daughter in the car as he went inside to put groceries away and play video games.</p><p>Scholtes said his daughter was sleeping when they got back from running errands, and he didn't want to wake her, so he left her in the car with the air conditioning running. He told police he "wanted her to remain in the vehicle while she slept," but the air conditioning switched off after 30 minutes, the documents say. Police are now saying the child was left in the vehicle for about three hours at the home in Marana, Arizona.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2YPsrcmkZQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/u2YPsrcmkZQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Scholtes did not realize he forgot about his daughter until after his wife Erika came back from work a few hours later, the documents state. Together, they found their daughter unresponsive in the car. They attempted life-saving measures before she was transported to a local hospital where she died.</p><p>While the toddler was on the way to the hospital, Scholtes is said to have texted Erika, saying, "Babe I'm sorry! ... Babe our family. How could I do this. I killed our baby, this can't be real."</p><p>Police seized a PlayStation 5 and other electronics as part of the investigation, while Scholtes' vehicle was also taken by authorities. Authorities are now examining the PS5 and Scholtes' laptop to attempt to determine what Scholtes was doing while his child was left in the vehicle.</p><p>Scholtes is facing charges for second-degree murder and child abuse.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/17/24200072/no-mans-sky-next-update-worlds-part-1<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The developers of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/29/24166275/no-mans-sky-adrift-update"><em>No Man’s Sky</em></a> have announced their next update, which is dubbed Worlds Part&nbsp;I. According to Hello Games founder <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/3/11152396/no-mans-sky-preview-sean-murray-interview-ps4-pc">Sean Murray</a>, this update will be one of the game’s prettiest yet, literally changing the way players see the universe. “In <em>No Man’s Sky</em>, what you see on screen is generated by the computer,” Murray wrote. “The level of variety we are achieving is far beyond what was possible before.”</p><p>The update is largely graphical, adding a host of new weather and terrain features designed to make planets feel even more real. Water will produce waves and reflections, waves will now respond to different weather phenomena, and the game will finally let ships land directly on the water. Worlds Part I will add new atmospheric conditions as well. Lava flows will belch sparks into the air while fog, blizzards, rain, and clouds make the procedurally generated locations feel more like living planets.</p><p>According to Murray, creating realistic clouds presented a unique challenge to the team. With the Worlds Part I update, new cloud technology — no, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/27/24187164/xbox-cloud-gaming-tv-app-fire-tv-stick-amazon-launch">not that kind</a> — will introduce even more variety to planets. He also shared that the update will have a <em>Starship Troopers</em> vibe featuring a new mech players are going to need to fight off enemies.</p><p>Murray wrote about how new technology and work on Hello Games’ next project, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23990841/hello-games-light-no-fire-trailer"><em>Light No Fire</em></a><em>,</em> has allowed the team to go back and work on <em>No Man’s Sky</em>. “Over the last five years making the game, we’ve learnt new things, and we’re feeding that back into No Man’s Sky,” Murray said. </p><p>The update is available today, but with a name like World’s Part I, you can naturally be sure that a part two won’t be far behind.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Nintendo's mysterious horror game - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-just-uploaded-a-bizarre-horror-game-teaser">glimpsed last week via a brief and bizarre teaser trailer</a> - is in fact a new entry in the Famicom Detective Club series. 
</p>
<p>
Emio - The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club will launch on 29th August, Nintendo confirmed today, showing off a first look at the game's artwork, featuring its creepy paper bag-headed villain.
</p>
<p>
If you're unfamiliar with the retro adventure series, this is a Nintendo-developed franchise originally released in the late 1980s. Two games were released, but only in Japan. And there they remained for more than 30 years, until a Nintendo Switch remake of the pair launched worldwide in 2021.

<p>
Nintendo veteran designer Yoshio Sakamoto, of Metroid fame, is returning to the series for Emio - The Smiling Man, Nintendo confirmed today. </p>
<p>
In a brief developer interview, Sakamoto said the game's creepy villain will pop up in-game after previously being thought of as an urban legend. It's up to you to investigate a murder and discover the truth behind the paper bag-wearing myth.
</p><p>

More concrete detail on the game from a Nintendo press release reveals that you will play the role of a junior private investigator aiding local police with a murder case. A student has been found dead, his head covered with a paper bag bearing the same smiling face as the legendary Smiling Man, who was also linked to other murders in the past. 
 
"Has a serial killer returned, or is this the work of a copycat? Are these crimes inspired by the Smiling Man story, or the origin of it? Players will discover the answers and more as they investigate in Emio – The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club," Nintendo writes.

			<p>Nintendo has announced Emio The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club - the first new game in the series in 35 years.</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq_NGMM2FWE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo uploaded a teaser</a> for what looked like to be some kind of horror title. Some suggested that this teaser was related to a new game from Bloober Team, but as it turned out, this wasn't the case. Fast forward one week and Nintendo has now officially revealed a new entry in the Famicom Detective Club series - Emio – The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club. We've included the official announcement trailer below:</p>
<p><iframe title="Emio – The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club – A Chat with Producer Yoshio Sakamoto" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AHBtMQaj7w0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><em>A student has been found dead! His head was covered with a paper bag with an eerie smiling face drawn on it—much like the victims of Emio, the Smiling Man—a killer of urban legend who is said to place such a bag over his victims’ heads.</em></p>
<p><em>As an assistant private investigator, you are tasked with helping police solve this crime, which is reminiscent of a series of unsolved murders from 18 years ago. Has a serial killer returned, or is this the work of a copycat? Are these crimes inspired by the Smiling Man story, or the origin of it?</em></p>
<p><em>Discover the answers to these questions and more as a member of the Utsugi Detective Agency in this intense story of suspicion, isolation, and fragility.</em></p>
<p>In the game, players take on the role of an assistant private investigator with Utsugi Detective Agency. Players are tasked with helping police solve a crime. Along the way, scrutinize the clues and testimonies you gather for potential connections to the gruesome events of the past.</p>
<p>Emio – The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club launches for the Nintendo Switch next month on August 29. As said, this is the first new entry in the series in 35 years - the most recent game (The Girl Who Stands Behind) was released in 1989.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-announces-august-release-date-for-mysterious-emio-game/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In a new <a href="https://x.com/NintendoUK/status/1813560024750321730" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a>, Nintendo officially announced that Emio – The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club has a release date for August 29, 2024.</p>



<p>Today’s announcement included a very brief trailer, which again featured the titular Emio. However, the grainy footage transitions from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-reveals-trailer-for-m-rated-game-teases-creepy-emio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the previous teaser</a> into the art style fans might expect to see in-game.</p>



<p>It also confirms that Emio is part of the Famicom Detective Club IP. This classic Nintendo IP originally released in the late 80’s with two memorable games. </p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Currently, fans can play Famicom Detective Club: The Two-Case Collection, which released in 2021. The collection includes both The Girl Who Stands Behind and The Missing Heir. Both titles currently have strong user ratings on Metacritic, respectively 8.1 and 7.9.</p>



<p>Emio was just <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/emio-has-been-rated-in-australia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rated in Australia</a> last week, signaling that the release date was coming soon. The existing trailer gained an enormous amount of interest from Nintendo fans due to its horror atmosphere and M Rating by the ESRB.</p>



<p>The Nintendo brand is often family-friendly, but its connection to Famicom Detective Club reveals the tone players should expect.</p>



<p>Nintendo recently held <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-direct-june-2024-everything-announced/">a massive direct</a> showcase that lasted about 40 minutes. It revealed many games coming in 2024, though Emio was not among them. Some highlights included Mario &amp; Luigi Brothership, Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection, and The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom.</p>

			<p>Let’s get the obvious out of the way: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Splintered Fate is an awful lot like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/09/17/hades-review-switch-pc/">Hades</a>. Instead of venturing through the Greek underworld as a demigod, you’re fighting through New York City as the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. TMNT: Splintered Fate is a roguelike action RPG where each run is a little bit different, partly thanks to having four playable characters instead of one.</p>
<p><iframe title="Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Splintered Fate - Release Date Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fIaR93sOHRQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>TMNT: Splintered Fate’s story begins with Leonardo training, only to be ambushed the Foot Clan and Shredder, who breaks the news that Splinter has been kidnapped. This starts a chain of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles facing off against the Foot Clan, as well as some other groups that have it out for the Turtles.</p>


<p>As a roguelike, progress is made through repetition. At the start of a run you can choose which of the four turtles you want to play as, with each having their own unique specials and skills. Michelango has the largest attack area size and has the most chance to deal multi-damage. His tool is taunting, which damages enemies and briefly stuns them when they are hit. Leonardo has a master strike that hits at the end of a combo, and his base tool is throwing three shuriken. Raphael has increased chances to deal critical hits, and his tools are a turtle line that pulls enemies towards him while dealing damage. Finally, Donatello has a shield blast that deals damage and briefly makes him immune to damage. His tools also charge 80% faster than the others, and at the start of each level he regains some health.</p>
<p>While all of them have these unique abilities and own weapons, the basic combat remains the same for all. That is getting in close and dealing damage to multi enemies in various ways. Even so, my personal preference was Donatello purely because of the health advantage, and being able to use tools faster than others.</p>


<p>Of course, picking your Turtle of choice is just the first step. Every run is different due to the random nature of the bonuses you can acquire. You may get bonuses that deal flame or water damage, and others that allow you to move faster. Some of the elements, which are flame, water, electricity, ooze, astral light, and astral dark, can be combined together to improve the damage you deal. However, there are also times when one selection can replace another bonus. This could be a good or bad thing. For example, I had an unstable ooze container tool that dealt decent area damage, and accidentally replaced it with a shuriken storm, which dealt less overall damage. If you get lucky, you will have higher powered versions of these abilities appear at the end of each level, which can lead to attacks becoming more powerful.</p>
<p>Like any roguelike, you lose all of your acquired abilities at the end of a run, but can unlock permanent upgrades through the Dragon and Dreamer bonuses. These unlock after a few levels, once you hit that skill brick wall where you cannot advance without permanent buffs. Dragon bonuses focus on direct effects, like increasing attack power, health, and improved rates for critical attacks. Dreamer bonuses impact the intangible aspects of the game, increasing chances of various drops and items appearing during a run. To unlock these you have to collect Dragon and Dreamer coins, which can then be spent back at base.</p>
<p>On top of these, there are artifacts which are unlocked for completing specific events and tasks in a run, like beating specific bosses. You can change which artifact you want to equip between attempts. Some artifacts increase the likelihood of specific element ability options appearing for you to select while others increase odds of dodging an attack.</p>

<p>There are four stages within TMNT: Splintered Fate, with these being The Sewers, The Docks, The Streets, and The Rooftops. These areas follow the same pattern with rooms of enemies to power through, with a miniboss battle taking place halfway through, and a boss battle at the end of the stage. What TMNT: Splintered Fate does well is mix up the mid boss and boss level fights. The mid bosses switch between each run, and a couple of the bosses grow stronger following the end of a successful run. Completing your first successful run is satisfying but it also really marks the true start of the game.</p>
<p>At the end of this run optional Dreamer and Gauntlet challenges are added to the game. Dreamer portals grant boons but can require some sacrifice to obtain those bonuses. Gauntlet challenges are the true tests of TMNT: Splintered Fate. These challenges are available for midboss and end boss fights for every stage, making bosses stronger and introducing additional strong enemies. For example, in one boss fight, the boss gains more powerful elemental abilities while also being accompanied by elite enemies that are essentially mini bosses themselves.</p>
<p>One of the issues with TMNT: Splintered Fate is that while it is entertaining, it starts to feel repetitive and the story is really not that gripping. The voice actors do a very good job, but the story feels elongated to pad the game out. After my fourth successful run, April exclaimed we were likely halfway through the process to rescue Splinter. It is supposed to come across as encouraging, but instead I asked out loud if the game was serious. There is only so many times you can go through the same four stages and bosses, even if they have tweaks each time, before wanting to stop.</p>

			<p>The Nintendo Entertainment System is a true industry icon, but has a somewhat more diminished role in the memories of many British gamers. Unlike in the US and Japan where it reigned supreme, the NES was less ubiquitous over here, and I personally found myself more immersed in the Amiga and Atari wars, before Mario-mania took over with the Super Nintendo. I did have a mate with a NES and so had some time with the little grey box, but not enough for it to be deeply embedded in my childhood memories. However, Nintendo’s focus on legacy franchises and rereleasing its most famous titles has resulted in a kind of second hand nostalgia.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition — Overview Trailer — Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wW3rNlfRgyM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Inspired by the occasional real world championships, Nintendo World Championship: NES Edition brings a competitive tilt to retro NES gaming on the Switch as you are challenged to take on bite-sized sections of the console’s most famous titles and complete them in the fastest possible time. With a sizeable line-up of games and dozens of individual missions across each, this is a veritable playable museum of Nintendo’s first console.</p>


<p>Booting up Nintendo World Championship: NES Edition brings you to a menu offering solo and local multiplayer modes. The former contains three main game modes – Speedrun, World Championships, and Survival. The latter two here require a Nintendo Switch Online membership, and with servers only opening at the start of the week, the bulk of my time with the game has therefore been spent on the Speedrun mode. There are 169 micro challenges here to challenge and master, serving as training for the online sections as well as being compulsive in their own right. These challenges are spread across 13 games but not equally as some have over 20, whilst poor Ice Climbers and Excite Bike only have 6 each.</p>
<p>The lineup includes most of the system’s iconic titles, but the lack of games by Capcom and Konami is a missed opportunity. Instead we have Nintendo’s first party range fully represented with four Marios, both Zeldas, Metroid, Kirby, Kid Icarus, Donkey Kong, Balloon Fight and the aforementioned Ice Climbers and Excite Bike. Throughout each set of challenges, you’ll be taking on timed boss fights, tricky platforming sections or even micro tasks befitting a WarioWare game, like collecting the first mushroom in Super Mario Bros in the quickest time possible. The thrill and addictiveness comes from refining your technique to shave off milliseconds each time and aim for the coveted S ranking.</p>


<p>After unlocking all of an individual game’s challenges, your final obstacle will be a more lengthy and involved Legend level. These vary depending on each game but include completing the whole first Mario game using the level skips and completing the first dungeon of Zelda. For anyone outside the <a href="https://gamesdonequick.com/">Games Done Quick</a> crew, the Legend challenges include a useful Classified Information page that looks like a guide straight out of an Official Nintendo Magazine. To further encourage replayability (if beating your own time was not enough) every task is ranked and an in-game pin is awarded if you get an A rank or higher. As I write this review I’ve successfully finished all the main challenges and am working on the Legend ones.</p>
<p>One aspect of the game I found a little unnecessary was the coin system. Finishing a challenge opens up the opportunity to purchase the next one for 100 coins (300 for the Legend ones), but while coins are plentiful to begin with there aren’t enough to unlock everything, even if you succeed each time, meaning some grinding is needed. With a handful of levels taking less than two seconds to complete, this grinding isn’t hugely time consuming but it takes away from the feeling of progress.</p>

<p>Online modes are where you’ll be testing your skills against players around the world. First up in Survival you’ll be taking on ghost data uploaded by other players in a series of three challenges randomly picked from the full range. The first round sees eight players whittled down to four and then a final head-to-head for victory. These are fun and there are silver and gold divisions to offer varying levels challenge. If nothing else, seeing how the very best scores are obtained is useful training for your own skills even in defeat. That being said, the default view has eight individual screens showing all your competitors and that is very difficult to focus on when playing on handheld.</p>
<p>World Championship mode contains 5 missions and you can continuously repeat these with only your best time being recorded. New Championships take place every week but there is no indication of how well you are doing until the results come in. This means that there is a nagging compulsion to go back and try and get the time down a little bit more, but doesn’t have the same effect as a traditional high score table.</p>
<p>The other nagging feeling, though, is that it’s a bit rich to demand a Nintendo Switch Online subscription to play these modes. There’s no direct online head-to-head competition, so you’re always just playing against ghost data in glorified leaderboards. Locking fairly minimal online features behind a subscription is pretty cheeky.</p>

<p>Finally there is a local multiplayer mode that allows for up to eight players to take on levels competitively. Obviously I’d recommend only doing this hooked up to a TV as visibility becomes an issue with more than two players. This mode really brings back the glory days of playing with/against my brother and triggered waves of nostalgia, even if the actual games were different from my own experience. My kids enjoyed the micro challenges and I’m hopeful that this will be a gateway into them trying some of the full original games too.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1527950/view/4365760492630422412" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on Steam</a>, Shiro looks ahead to major&nbsp;<em>Wartales&nbsp;</em>content drops for August and October, with more to come in the fourth quarter of 2024 as well. Suffice it to say you're eating well if you're a&nbsp;<em>Wartales&nbsp;</em>fan.</p>
<p>First up, if you felt like&nbsp;<em>Wartales</em>' <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wartales-dlc-the-tavern-opens-release-date">recent tavern DLC</a> was too combat-light for your tastes, you'll be pleased to know a more battle-focused DLC pack is coming in August.&nbsp;<em>The Pits&nbsp;</em>promises 25 uniquely-designed battles across five distinct locations, and you'll need your wits about you to prevail.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wartales-roadmap-new-combat.jpg?itok=AE-EDLl0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wartales-roadmap-new-combat.jpg?itok=Ps_C0WhL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Wartales</em>' new&nbsp;<em>The Pits&nbsp;</em>DLC will offer plenty of new combat challenges.</figcaption></figure><p>Following that, a fourth community update will arrive in October, bringing lots of new additions to the game. Unlike&nbsp;<em>The Pits</em>, the update will be free for all players.</p>
<p>Community Update 4 will offer the chance to engage in drop-in, drop-out co-op with your friends, so you can join an in-progress&nbsp;<em>Wartales&nbsp;</em>game whenever you feel like it and leave when things are getting too hairy for you.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can look forward to a new champion and several new places of interest to explore, as well as some balance changes to smooth out your&nbsp;<em>Wartales&nbsp;</em>experience.</p>
<p>Beyond that, another DLC is apparently planned for the fourth quarter of 2024, although Shiro is remaining quiet as to what you can expect from that DLC. We'll likely learn more in the coming months.</p>

<p>As such, you can expect a gritty story filled with gray morality, as well as tough turn-based combat that will challenge your strategic planning and forward thinking skills.</p>

            <p>
England superstar Jude Bellingham makes the box art of EA Sports FC this year. 
</p>
<p>
Fresh from unpacking his bags after England's attempt at glory in the Euros, Bellingham was announced today as having taken the coveted cover slot. 
</p>
<p>
It's not a huge surprise. Bellingham also features on the EA Sports FC 25 Ultimate Edition cover, alongside football/product placement legend David Beckham and Spanish star Aitana Bonmatí. Zinedine Zidane and Gianluigi Buffon also appear.

"I played this game with my brother all the time growing up," Bellingham said of the series once called FIFA. "I've always thought about how incredible it would be to one day be featured on the cover. 
</p>
<p>
"There have been so many iconic players on the cover over the years, and I am delighted to be the most recent English player to be bestowed with this honour since 2011."

            <p>
If you've been hoping for another No Mans's Sky universe refresh, today's your day. The exploratory space sim's latest update is all about bringing more variety to planets - and it's chucking in angry Starship Troopers-esque bug hunts and a flamethrower mech too.
</p>
<p>
No Man's Sky's new Worlds Part 1 update owes at least some of its existence to the developer Hello Games' upcoming fantasy planet sim Light No Fire. "Over the last five years making the game, " it explains, "we've learnt new things, and we're feeding that back into No Man's Sky".
</p>
<p>
Some of No Man's Sky's freshly expanded variety comes from the way its new simulated systems combine. There's new cloud tech that creates skies based on weather conditions, with planets now featuring their own wind patterns. Water has also had a significant overhaul, featuring dynamic waves that react to weather, reflections, and improved oceans.
</p>

<p>
Addtionally, planets have recieved new volumetrics and atmospherics, meaning explorers can expect to see the likes of rolling fog, more dramatic storms, blizzards, and lava sparks on their travels - and all these elements should interact, meaning clouds grow closer during storms while waves rise higher. And beyond the improved atmospherics, World Part 1 introduces new biomes with accompanying flora and fauna (including burnt, noxious, irradiated, and idyllic garden landscapes) for increased variety.
</p>
<p>
Other new features (and there's a <em>lot</em>) include aquatic landing jets so ships can land on water, flamethrower arm attachments for the new Liquidator mech, and new Vile Brood hunt missions. No Man's Sky's latest update also heralds the start of a new limited-time, combat-focused Expedition, this one sending player out among the stars to explore some of the planets now possible with No Man's Sky's improved tech. And while they're there, they'll need to work alongside the community to blast massive angry bugs, Starship Troopers style - earning Expedition rewards along the way.
</p>
<p>
No Man's Sky's Worlds Part 1 update arrives today on all platforms, and Hello Games hints more planetary improvements will follow - as the conspicuous "Part 1" in the title suggests. Lengthy patch notes for today's update are <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/worlds-part-I-update">available on the No Man's Sky website</a>, and there's even a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmU3_6BK-Ro">behind-the-scenes video</a> for today's update, giving some insight into its creation.
</p>
<p>
As for the studio's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-studio-unveils-procedural-fantasy-planet-adventure-light-no-fire">procedural planet adventure Light No Fire</a>, we've not had an update on that since last year's reveal, but hopefully it won't be long before Hello Games shares more.

            <p>
Robot Entertainment has announced Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap, the next in the popular orc-slaying series.
</p>
<p>
Deathtrap brings four-player co-op, as well as a rogue-lite progression system and new heroes with unique abilities. Players will need to beat waves of enemies while coping with randomised buffs and debuffs, choosing from six War Mages.
</p>
<p>
It's set for release in early 2025 across PC (Steam, Epic) and Xbox Series X/S.

<p>

The Orcs Must Die! series has proven popular since the first game in 2011. The latest third game was released in 2021, continuing the tower defence gameplay either solo or two-player co-op.
</p>
<p>
Deathtrap will support up to four players with adaptive difficulty, and the unique play styles of each War Mage will promote synergy and experimentation.
</p>
<p>
"Our goal has always been to push the boundaries of fun and creativity," said Patrick Hudson, co-founder and CEO of Robot Entertainment. "With Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap, we embraced the challenge of innovating within a thirteen-year-old franchise by listening closely to our fans and their requests. We've stayed true to the classic chaotic action and light-hearted tone, while introducing four-player co-op, new and versatile heroes with deeply unique abilities, expanded level variety, and new roguelite progression choices. This game is all about delivering the most exhilarating orc-slaying experience yet."

What's more, if you're yet to play any of the Orcs Must Die! games, the whole series has been heavily discounted on Steam until 31st July to celebrate the announcement of Deathtrap.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/orcs-must-die-review">Eurogamer reviewed the first Orcs Must Die!</a> back in 2011, awarding it 7/10: "Rewarding and frustrating in equal measure, but rarely boring, it's a memorable dose of mass slaughter."

			<p>Hello Games returns once again with a major No Man's Sky update called Worlds, which is only Part I of a larger overhaul. It's so big that the UK studio also created a deep dive video this time around.</p>
<p>Founder and game director Sean Murray explained that this update adds a lot of new technology to No Man's Sky, some of which has been borrowed by the advancements made while developing <a href="https://wccftech.com/light-no-fire-is-a-planet-sized-fantasy-online-multiplayer-sandbox-rpg-from-no-mans-sky-developer-hello-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Light No Fire </a>over the past five years.</p>
<p>For example, the new water tech can create waves and reflections, giving life to oceans that look so different from what you've seen before in the game. Ocean planets feel completely new, and ships can now land on water. Planets have wind patterns. Waves are dynamic and react to the weather. A brand new cloud technology also creates detailed skies with weather conditions, providing beautifully detailed skies with tons of variety.</p>
<p>Hello Games also added new volumetrics and atmospheres to the planets' surface: rolling fog, rain, blizzards, and lava sparks now combine with wind and clouds. According to the developers, this changes the feel of exploring planets in No Man's Sky and adds much more life to the experience. Sometimes, there is a storm, and you might see the waves rising and the clouds gathering. The new wind, the clouds, the oceans, and the atmosphere all come together for a visual spectacle.</p>

<p>The Worlds Update Part I also introduces new creatures to discover in these new biomes, all of which can be pets or mounts. Moreover, Hello Games is trying to add more activities. The new Expedition is reportedly very Starship Troopers-inspired and takes players on a tour of some of these cool new planets. The No Man's Sky community will fight bugs together, and progress is community-driven. There's a new mech with heavy armor and a cool flamethrower arm, and you will need it.</p>

<p>Finally, Murray expressed the desire to continue pushing the boundaries of what's possible in No Man's Sky, doing things that people haven't seen before. As hinted by the fact that the update is called Worlds Part I, more improvements to the overall variety and realism of the universe are coming in a future patch.</p>

<p>In a recent <a href="https://x.com/devolverdigital/status/1813380843747914040" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a>, Anger Foot publisher Devolver Digital revealed plans for a new game announcement tomorrow, July 18, 2024.</p>



<p>The team did not offer further details about the potential announcement, nor a concrete time. However, it will be revealed “Thursday night,” so it should come up around Devolver Digital’s evening time zone.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>[new game announcement siren starts]</p><p>New game announcement on Thursday night.</p><p>[new game announcement siren ends]</p></div>— Devolver Digital (@devolverdigital) <a href="https://twitter.com/devolverdigital/status/1813380843747914040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 17, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>Fans are quickly speculating on the possible IP involved. As publisher, Devolver Digital only just released <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/anger-foot-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Anger Foot on PC</a> last week to ‘Very Positive’ Steam reviews. </p>



<p>Following solid word of mouth, some players are already requesting a sequel. Insider Gaming called Anger Foot “hilarious,” and “one of the zaniest FPS titles ever made.” </p>



<p>Many will also recognize Devolver Digital for publishing titles like Cult of the Lamb, Stick It to the Stickman, The Talos Principle 2, and more. </p>



<p>It also worked on the Serious Sam IP for years, so it would also make sense to continue that series in some way. Most recently, Devolver published Serious Sam: Tormental in 2022. The roguelite top-down title in the series currently has ‘Mostly Positive’ reviews on Steam.</p>



<p>Devolver often includes striking humor in its marketing and games. Most recently, it held a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/devolver-direct-2024-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Devolver Direct 2024 showcase</a> in June. </p>



<p>During the event, Devolver Digital made a few big announcements for Cult of the Lamb, Tenjutsu, Possessor(s), and more.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/valve-publish-new-cs2-tournament-rules/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/valve-publishes-new-cs2-tournament-rules.929487/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/valve-publish-new-cs2-tournament-rules/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Building on a new ruleset released before the launch of Counter-Strike 2 last year, Valve has just published an update to the CS2 tournament ruling. The latest batch of rules concerns tournament licensing and organisation regulations for tournament operators working with Counter-Strike 2 <strong>after </strong>2025. Valve recognised the substantial overhaul as potentially disruptive, with the company writing in a blog post, <em>‘… we expect that there will be some rough edges as we transition to the new requirements.’</em></p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-are-the-new-cs2-rules">What Are The New CS2 Rules?</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://www.counter-strike.net/newsentry/7090437900079084674" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">new rules</a> pertain to the CS2 ‘Open Circuit’, and at the top of the table sits the core requirement that all events are split into two types: Ranked and Unranked. Both of these will require operators to seek differing licenses. To put a definition on those terms, Unranked events <strong>will not </strong>contribute towards the centralised team standings operated by Valve. They also have prize pool restrictions – $100,000 per event or $250,000 per year.</p>



<p>Ranked events must rely on Valve’s standings and a qualification structure – they’re prohibited from directly inviting teams to compete. There’s also a new ‘Tier’ system that determines which teams can compete in a tournament based on their position in the overall standings. </p>



<p>Any operators looking to hold Tier 1 events in 2026<strong> must </strong>announce said tournaments before January 2025. <a href="https://escorenews.com/en/csgo/news/59416-blast-2025-schedule-features-new-formats-shows-how-valve-s-open-circuit-might-work" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">BLAST’s latest roadmap</a> is one of the few working examples we have of this new operating model being put into practice.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, some players have voiced concerns about the new competitive update. We’ve seen complaints surfacing online talking about how the same teams will get their invite to the top-tier tournaments every time, making it impossible for new or low-level teams to rise.</p>

                <p>Tim Sweeney, the founder and CEO of Fortnite studio Epic Games, has weighed in with his thoughts on AI and generative AI. Advancements to these technologies have been much-discussed of late in the world of video games, entertainment, and numerous other business sectors. Speaking to researcher <a href="https://www.matthewball.co/all/sweeneystephenson" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Matthew Ball</a>, Sweeney said AI will change the world and create a lot of jobs, while also noting there are numerous issues and problems in the road ahead as well.</p><p>Starting off, Sweeney commented on how companies train their AI models. Sweeney said companies should not train their models on data if they do not have "clear and explicit permission from the creator of the data to do that." Researchers at universities who are not creating commercial products, however, could consider training data this way, Sweeney said.</p>

<p>"If a company buys ownership of the data from the creator of the data or gets permission to use it for training AI, it's fair game. And they shouldn't train AI on that data if they don't have that permission," he said.</p><p>Research institutions can be treated differently, Sweeney said, because there is "much more compelling public interest" in this area.</p><p>Part of what's giving AI a bad name for some people in the current market is how AI has been "taken over by the Wild West," Sweeney said, with companies doing whatever they want to train their models.</p><p>"I think that's unfortunate because AI is a really important technology that is going to change the world. I think that after this first generation of rather wild practices fades away, we're going to see companies with a lot much more responsible data usage practices coming to the forefront and use of AI in a way that's much more well-thought-out and specialized to particular usage cases," he said. "I still think that the idea of creating a chatbot that's supposed to have all the world's knowledge and be an agent of good is a very long way from coming to fruition. And the folly of all the current efforts, both being lamed down to the point where they aren't as useful as they ought to be, but also doing things that are egregiously wrong, like <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd11gzejgz4o" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">telling you to eat rocks</a>. It's kind of an artifact of this technology being adopted way too widely, way too quickly."</p><p>Sweeney went on to say he wished AI researchers didn't immediately turn to commercializing their models, and instead launched programs like ChatGPT as a work-in-progress tool where everyone knows and understands it's going to have all manner of issues.</p><blockquote data-size="small" data-align="left"><p>"We shouldn't let that early misadventure with AI dissuade us from the long-term value of the technology" - Tim Sweeney on AI</p></blockquote><p>"If ChatGPT were, like, some university's chatbot, with this massive disclaimer of this chatbot might make stuff up and say ridiculous things at times and it's just no big deal, don't treat it too seriously. But unfortunately, everybody in their race to have their first-mover advantage has gone away from the standards that govern most forms of technology development, and that's leading to regulatory backlash and all sorts of other problems, and that's very unfortunate," he said. "But I think as optimists for the future of technology, we shouldn't let that early misadventure with AI dissuade us from the long-term value of the technology. And so I'd encourage the same sort of patience I encourage with blockchain and cryptographic technology in the field of AI."</p><p>As for generative AI and its impact on game development, Sweeney said it will lead to "dramatic productivity gains" because creators will be able to create all manner of objects much more quickly than before.</p><p>"If you want a bunch of cool trees, you can go into the Quixel library and get a tree off the shelf from us for free for Unreal Engine use. But if you want a specific tree that meets a specific need for a specific scene in your game, you can have a modeler build it right now, and that takes an enormous amount of time and expense. In the future you're going to be able to create a mashup by giving some high-level instructions as to exactly what kind of tree you create," he said. "And based on training data that was properly owned or licensed, it will make the tree you want. I see dramatic productivity gains coming to a lot of areas of game development."</p><p>Sweeney also predicted that generative AI will increase "employment opportunities" across the technology sector. Games made using generative AI could be far more rich and robust, and this will require more people, he said. "We're going to take all the people we have and perhaps some more and build even bigger, better games using the technology," he said. "And so the technology is going to enable us to improve the scope and quality of our products and build bigger and better games. And so that will certainly come and it will come at different rates. You have to remember, the reason that we had a massive revolution in generative AI and text AI beginning last year was because of the 30 years of research that had gone into the foundations of how to train and manage those sorts of AIs."</p><p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-says-ai-will-help-its-teams-get-to-holy-grail-of-game-development/1100-6523265/" data-ref-id="1100-6523265">fear of job displacement due to AI is a significant one</a> among video game workers, and companies like EA have been up front in saying <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-ceo-on-how-ai-will-impact-video-games-and-the-people-who-make-them/1100-6513969/" data-ref-id="1100-6513969">advancements to AI systems will lead to job losses</a> in the short term. In the long run, more jobs could be created thanks to AI, EA and others have said.</p><p>The video game industry is a long way off from implementing generative AI to its fullest extent, however, Sweeney said. "This AI isn't going to come to all fields with equal speed. 3D object generation AI isn't going to be revolutionized next year. It's probably going to take many years because a lot of the things that were done for 2D have not yet been done for 3D, nor does anybody know how to do them," he said. "And so there's a huge amount of research and development effort needed to unblock AI contributing to specific fields in specific new ways and creating game content at the level of quality that you expect."</p><p>Sweeney said he can't predict just how much of a positive impact on video game revenue generative AI might have, but he said it's "definitely going to bring us the capability of building better, bigger, and more compelling games faster."</p><p>He added: "Better games means players will be spending more. Better games means that companies get more returns by investing more in building games. And so you'll probably see increases in employment and you'll probably see a lifting of all ships and also an upending of a lot of things."</p><p>Finally, Sweeney reflected that in the early days of Epic, its artists drew pixels. Now, Epic's artists create 3D objects. And in the future, Sweeney said the things its employees do with mouse clicks will be different still. "I think the value of creators will not be undermined by AI in the long run because all of these companies are competing with each other. We need a lot of humans to make a lot of awesome creative decisions about how these games are to work," he said.</p><p>Epic is not the only big believer in AI in the tech space. Microsoft partnered up with ChatGPT and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-invests-billions-more-into-ai-which-it-believes-could-be-as-big-as-the-internet/1100-6510758/" data-ref-id="1100-6510758">reportedly invested $10 billion into the AI company</a>. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer believes AI will be a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-says-ai-will-be-an-additive-positive-force-for-video-games/1100-6511913/" data-ref-id="1100-6511913">positive, additive force in gaming</a>. Strauss Zelnick, the head of GTA parent company Take-Two, believes in AI as well, but he <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-true-gta-competitor-wont-be-made-with-ai-take-two-boss-says/1100-6511244/" data-ref-id="1100-6511244">doesn't think a rival developer could use it to make a genuine GTA competitor anytime soon.</a> PUBG creator Brendan Greene's new game, meanwhile, is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-creator-using-machine-learning-to-create-massive-open-worlds-tech-demo-coming/1100-6495912/" data-ref-id="1100-6495912">using advanced machine-learning to create massive and realistic open worlds</a>. Nintendo, too, has said it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-sees-potential-in-generative-ai-but-wont-make-games-created-by-technology-alone/1100-6524707/" data-ref-id="1100-6524707">sees the potential in using generative AI for game development.</a></p>
