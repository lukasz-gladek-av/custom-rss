		<p>Gearbox has put the spotlight on the beefcakiest of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> Vault Hunters, Amon the Forgeknight, showing off the character’s axe chucking abilities and role as the frontline tank of the party.</p>
<p><iframe title="Borderlands 4 - Official Gameplay Overview - Amon" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4lCbxjy0zI4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>As a Forgeknight, Amon can draw upon drones to quickly craft the weapons and gear that he needs. This includes a Forgehammer to smash enemies with, Forgeaxes to throw at and slice enemies, a Forgeshield to soak up damage, and more.</p>
<p>These Action Skillsdepend on which of the three skill trees you’ve levelled up, though, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Crucible (Cybernetics skill tree) – Wield the elemental might of fire and ice with Amon’s twin Forgeaxes, which deal Incendiary or Cryo damage by default, have multiple charges, and can be picked up to reduce their cooldown. The Forgeaxes make any damaged target Primed, causing them to explode in a damaging, bloody mess when killed.</li>
<li>Scourge (Vengeance skill tree) – Charge headlong into the fray as Amon summons his Forgeshield, which will soak up incoming damage and fill up a Vengeance Meter. Once you’ve absorbed the brunt of the incoming hurt, you can return the favor by firing back a Forgewave that consumes Vengeance to deal freezing Cryo damage.</li>
<li>Onslaughter (Calamity skill tree) – Wallop your foes in the face with Amon’s Forgefist, which dashes to your target to unleash an explosive Rocket Punch. The force of this Incendiary Melee Damage impact will Stagger most enemies, leaving them dazed so you can finish them off with a flurry of bullets.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/game-info/vault-hunters/amon/">view each tree in depth here</a>.</p>

<p>But here’s the thing. Amon’s Forgeskill trait gives him a secondary Action Skill, which comes with a separate cooldown, so you can really bounce back and forth between them. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Double-Edge (Crucible Action Skill equipped) – Throw a twinned Forgeaxe, dealing Cryo Damage to enemies it passes through and returning to Amon, dealing Incendiary Melee Damage on the way back.</li>
<li>Firewall (Scourge Action Skill equipped) – Deploy a Firewall that absorbs enemy projectiles, and grants friendly projectiles that pass through it increased damage and velocity. Absorbed damage is converted into Vengeance if Scourge is active, and enemies near Firewall get burned with Incendiary damage over time.</li>
<li>Molten Slam (Onslaughter Action Skill equipped) – Slam a Molten Forgehammer into the ground, dealing Incendiary damage to enemies in a large area.</li>
</ul>
<p>Amon is the third character that Gearbox has released a deep dive on, following on from <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/news/vex-spotlight/">Vex the Siren</a> and <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/news/rafa-spotlight/">Rafa the Exo-Soldier.</a> There’s just Harlowe the Gravitar to go, which will doubtless be coming soon, what with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/29/borderlands-4-gameplay-state-of-play-is-airing-tomorrow-30th-april-release-date-moved-forward/">Borderlands 4’s release date being set for 12th September</a>. There’s not much time left!</p>

<p>Reef Entertainment has released a new overview trailer for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/terminator_2d_no_fate">Terminator 2D: No Fate</a>, and sorry, but we know you're all excited for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Silksong</a> and whatnot, but this looks <em>bloody amazing</em>.</p>
<p>Clocking in at just over three minutes, the trailer takes us through some of the levels you'll be exploring, the types of gameplay at hand, and the modes available at launch. You can go through the campaign as standard, partake in a boss rush mode, an infinite mode, or an arcade mode to really get those nostalgia juices flowing.</p>
<p>Gameplay will be a mix of stealth and full-on action, with supplies hidden throughout the levels to aid in your progress. Multiple difficulty modes will also be available, including 'Easy Money', 'No Problemo', 'Hasta la Vista', and 'Judgement Day'. You know we're going straight for the latter.</p>
<p>Terminator 2D: No Fate launches on the Switch on <strong>31st October 2025</strong>. It's a bit odd that the trailer didn't include the Switch box art at the end, but we suspect there's some promotional campaign in place with Sony / PlayStation. Nothing to panic about.</p>
<p>We recently spoke to the developers behind the new title, so if you want a bit more information on what to expect and how the team came up with the project, be sure to check it out.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Battlefield 6 Beta has Surpassed Battlefield 2042’s Highest All-Time Concurrent Player Count on Steam with Over 300K Concurrent Players]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-beta-surpassed-battlefield-2042-all-time-concurrent-player-count-steam/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-battlefield-6-beta-has-surpassed-battlefield-2042%E2%80%99s-highest-all-time-concurrent-player-count-on-steam-with-over-300k-concurrent-players.1264815/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/battlefield-6/">Battlefield 6</a> is currently available for players to try in an early access, semi-closed beta form, which is only semi-closed because technically anyone could have acquired a code through specific channels, but only those with a code can jump into the beta today and tomorrow before it opens to the rest of the non-code-having public on August 9-10 and then again next weekend from August 14-17.</p>



<p>And even in that confusing, not entirely closed, yet not entirely open form, hundreds of thousands of players have jumped through every necessary hoop to play Battlefield 6 as soon as possible, with today's kick-off of the beta already seeing concurrent player numbers on Steam alone surpass the all-time high concurrent player count of Battlefield 2042.</p>



<p>We expected Battlefield 6's beta numbers to be high, since <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-beta-servers-already-full-thousands-in-queue/">servers were already starting to fill up yesterday</a>, but no one thought they'd necessarily be this high. Per SteamDB, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1517290/charts/#max">Battlefield 2042's highest concurrent player count</a> on Steam only reached 107,376 players, a mark reached two years after it launched, and beating out its launch concurrent player numbers by about 2,000 players.</p>



<p>The Battlefield 6 beta, once again according to SteamDB, has already reached a peak of <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3081410/charts/?peak=334549"><strong>334,549</strong> concurrent players</a>. At the time of this writing, there are 303,222 players in the beta on Steam.</p>



<p>It's all a clear sign that there are hundreds of thousands who were hungry for a new Battlefield game that at least looks like it has the chance of capturing the same attention and hold the series once had on the shooter genre.</p>



<p>It's a great start for a game that EA has put so much behind, with four studios all working together on various aspects of Battlefield 6 to ensure that it gets the best chance at being the comeback-kid the series and EA desperately needs it to be.</p>



<p>Of course, the real test will come when the game actually launches later this year in October, and if its launch can not only repeat, but beat these numbers - and then sustain them for longer than a day.</p>



<p>If you're not able to check out the beta this weekend but want to find out more about how Battlefield 6 plays, then you can check out <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-hands-on-impressions/">Wccftech's Kai Tatsumoto's impressions of the game</a>, as Kai got the try it out last week during the multiplayer reveal event EA hosted. </p>

            <p>
Folk Emerging describes itself as a turn-based 4X <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game, but in practice, it's possibly more of a 2.5X strategy game, in that it puts you in charge of a nomadic hunter-gatherer community from before the rise of agriculture and the founding of towns and cities. 
</p>
<p>
As this <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2275300/view/517468855824548048">developer update suggests</a>, it's like the turn or two at the very start of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civilization</a> when you just have one Settler unit, but stretched out across thousands of years, with a social element and rustic spreadsheet aesthetics that remind me of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/king-of-dragon-pass">King Of Dragon Pass</a>. It's got somewhat doofy cartoon Stone Age muzak, but is otherwise the most intriguing Civlike strategy game I've laid eyes on since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/4x-strategy-game-entrotria-is-in-theory-galactic-civilizations-but-looks-like-a-jackson-pollock-painting">the one that looks like an octopus murder scene</a> - and whadayaknow, by happy coincidence there's a public playtest running from right now till August 18th.

<p>
Going by <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2275300/view/517468855824548048">the Steam page</a> descriptions, you'll move your tent-dwelling tribe continually around a procedurally generated hexagonal map that consists of nine climates. Each climate has a different food web that is represented by an actual web, with a node for each predator and prey species. Ideally, you'll pick a mixture of food sources from that web so as to keep your cavepeople hale and hearty, without reducing the local ecosystem to dust.
</p>
<p>
While the hunter-gatherer premise obviously precludes construction elements, there <em>is</em> a research tree. You start off splitting flints, later gravitate to the mysteries of fire, and eventually clock domestication and the process of sowing and reaping. Alongside this, you'll flesh out your community's culture by picking between binary norms such as "pride" or "modesty" and "diligence" or "hedonism": these affect things like the odds of war with other human tribes and how you approach trade.
</p>
<p>
And then there's the social simulation elements, which are represented as a tangled natto ball of coloured faces. "Manage the relationships between individuals, families, and tribes," explains the Steam page. "Watch your collective adapt over countless generations. Beware the unintended consequences current choices can have on your great-great-great-grandchildren." Mental note: try not to accidentally invent the patriarchy.
</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>
Lastly, there's combat, which takes the form of autobattling with charcoal cave paintings. You'll want to be wary of picking fights, because if Grarg the Forager takes a sharpened stone to the kisser, you'll not only lose her foraging skills but also all of the "hard-won wisdom" she might otherwise pass on to her kids. So the technologies and practices at your disposal are hereditary, then, like in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/norland">Norland</a>? 
</p>
<p>
Other points of interest: the world periodically succumbs to an Ice Age, which obviously takes ingenuity and preparation to survive. You can join up with other roving communities to form bustling tribes. I'm going to sign up for that playtest and see how long it takes me to become an evolutionary dead end.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-endless-mode-datamine-depths-relics-2000616334</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>I’m desperate for <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-mode-option-patch-1-02-ps5-1851786981"><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em></a> to enter its next phase, and dataminers may have finally revealed what that is, thanks to references hidden in the multiplayer roguelite’s latest update. It sounds like an endless mode could be on the way, complete with ranked matchmaking. I wouldn’t care about any of that in most games, but <em>Nightreign</em> isn’t most games, and this new mode could be exactly what it needs to get me hooked again.</p> <p>Players have spent the summer circulating through a new rotation of tougher Everdark Sovereign variants of the game’s existing Nightlord boss fights. They’ve mostly been pretty fun, even last week’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-augur-evergaol-everdark-time-1851787245">divisive overhaul of Maris Fathom of Night, AKA Augur,</a> which forced players to use a magic sword that drops during the fight. Otherwise, most players have burned through the main campaign and each character’s remembrance side quests. We know the randomized Limveld map like the palm of our hands. Most runs have become a walk in the park. We need something different. We need something harder.</p> <p>That could be precisely what a new endless mode is bringing. References to it were discovered in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Adminisitrator/comments/1mh908l/elden_ring_nightreign_new_mode_deep_of_night/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=post_body&amp;embed_host_url=https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/elden-ring-nightreign-dataminers-have-uncovered-plans-for-a-new-endless-mode-with-armored-core-6s-rank-system-and-skill-based-matchmaking/">a recent datamine</a> posted on Reddit (via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/elden-ring-nightreign-dataminers-have-uncovered-plans-for-a-new-endless-mode-with-armored-core-6s-rank-system-and-skill-based-matchmaking/"><em>PC Gamer</em></a>). The images reveal a new matchmaking option called The Deep of Night with the following description: “The Deep of Night is a battlefield of endless Night. Victory will increase your rating, burnishing your Depth. The Darkness extends unto infinity.” Screenshots shared in the post suggest five levels each with ranked ratings of 0 to 9,999. Bosses in the Deep of Night look slightly different, and the weapons you earn down there each come with unique de-buffs to make things harder. Players will also seemingly unlock additional slots on vessels where new “Depth” relics can be equipped.</p>

 <p>It’s unclear how much the map itself will change in this mode, but it sounds like players will keep going until they die rather than ending after night three with a final boss fight. At the very least, the increasing difficulty, new gear, and extra relic slots are enough to establish a completely new endgame, while the ranking system gives the sweatiest Nightfarers among us a new goal to reach for.</p> <p>It’s not clear when FromSoftware is planning to add this mode, but sometime in September seems like a good bet, as players wrap up the last run of Everdark Sovereigns this month. I’m excited for a Bell Bearing Hunter at the bottom of the castle on night one to become the least of players’ worries if this new endless mode ends up delivering on the level of difficulty teased in these datamining leaks.</p>

<p>A new claim states that proximity chat is coming to Fortnite’s battle royale mode. </p>



<p>With Fortnite introducing a brand new season for Chapter 6, Epic Games has a boatload of content for players to try out. The Shock ‘N Awesome season goes live today, introducing the highly anticipated <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-power-rangers-collaboration-confirmed-in-new-teaser/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Power Rangers collaboration</a>, along with brand new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-shock-n-awesome-season-details-revealed-new-enemies-weapons-pois-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weapons, enemies, POIs</a> and more. The latest development reveals that Fortnite might have more in store for us. </p>



<h2 id="h-fortnite-is-reportedly-bringing-proximity-chat-to-battle-royale">Fortnite is Reportedly Bringing Proximity Chat to Battle Royale</h2>



<p>The update about Fortnite’s proximity mode comes from a <a href="https://x.com/Wensoing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Wensoing</a> and <a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Loolo_WRLD</a> (corroborated by <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1953377603588345984" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">HYPEX</a>). Their latest post on X (formerly Twitter) states that this feature is being developed for the battle royale mode. Epic Games has seemingly separated some “Creative Proximity Chat files” so that they can be incorporated into the battle royale mode. The feature will also include a setting to deactivate or activate it according to the player’s preference. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Proximity chat will introduce another layer of chaos and strategy to Fortnite’s battle royale mode. For those who are unfamiliar, this feature enables players to hear the voices of other players in the lobby, depending on their in-game proximity. Proximity chat has been an integral factor in creating numerous viral content pieces for games like Call of Duty and Among Us, as it enables interactions that were previously impossible in the base game. </p>

<p>The next party game coming for the Mario Party crown has an official release date as Lego Party is set to launch on September 30. </p>



<p>The game will be available for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam.</p>



<p>Lego Party is your standard party board game, featuring customizable Lego characters, 60 minigames, and multiplayer with up to four players locally or private online games no matter the platform. What it won’t have, however, is online matchmaking with random players.</p>



<p>Lego Party is presented like a game show where you’ll travel around the board, avoiding obstacles, and playing mini games to collect Golden Bricks. The player with the most Golden Bricks at the end of the game wins. And don’t worry, there aren’t any bonus bricks at the end of the game that will snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.</p>



<p>In our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-party-hands-on-preview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">preview of the game</a> from hands-on time at Summer Game Fest, I called Lego Party a game with all of the <strong>“makings of being the next great party game”.</strong> </p>



<p><strong>“Throughout the entire Play Days event, the LEGO Party booth was the loudest and most active among all of the games being shown. That’s a good sign when the goal is to bring people together.”</strong></p>

It is available via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/333640/Caves_of_Qud/" target="_blank">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/caves_of_qud" target="_blank">GOG</a>, and <a href="https://freeholdgames.itch.io/cavesofqud" target="_blank">itch.io</a>.</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via its store pages:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p><em>Caves of Qud</em> is a science fantasy roguelike epic steeped in retrofuturism, deep simulation, and swathes of sentient plants. Come inhabit a living, breathing world and chisel through layers of thousand-year-old civilizations. Decide: is it a dying earth, or is it on the verge of rebirth?</p><p>Do anything and everything. <em>Caves of Qud</em> is a deeply simulated, biologically diverse, richly cultured world.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Deep Physical <a title="Genres > Simulation [802 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/simulation">Simulation</a></strong> – Don’t like the wall blocking your way? Dig through it with a pickaxe, or eat through it with your corrosive gas mutation, or melt it to lava. Yes, every wall has a melting point.</li><li><strong>Fully Simulated <a title="Companies > Creature [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/creature">Creature</a>s</strong> – Every monster and NPC is as fully simulated as the player. That means they have levels, skills, equipment, faction allegiances, and body parts. So if you have a mutation that lets you, say, psionically dominate a spider, you can traipse through the world as a spider, laying webs and eating things.</li><li><strong>Dynamic Faction System</strong> – Pursue allegiances with over 70 factions: apes, crabs, trees, robots, and highly entropic beings, just to name a few.</li><li><strong>Richly Detailed Science Fantasy Setting</strong> – Over fifteen years of worldbuilding have led to a rich, weird, labyrinthine, one-of-a-kind storyworld, layered on top of the simulation, all for you to explore. Live and drink, friend.</li><li><strong>Tactical Gameplay</strong> – Turn-based, sandbox exploration and combat offers as many solutions as you and your mutations, implants, artifacts, and skills are creative enough to invent.</li><li><strong><a title="Genres > RPG [17,483 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPG</a> Elements</strong> – <a title="Platforms > Quest [146 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/meta/quest">Quest</a>s, NPCs, villages, historic sites; some dynamic and some handwritten, interwoven to produce a transportative RPG experience.</li><li><strong>Atmospheric Original Soundtrack</strong> – Over two hours of otherworldly music to delve to.</li></ul><p><strong>Character Creation</strong></p><p><em>Caves of Qud</em> has one of the most expressive character creators of all time.</p><p>Play the role of a mutant indigenous to the salt-spangled dunes and jungles of Qud, or play a true kin descendant from one of the few remaining eco-domes—the toxic arboreta of Ekuemekiyye, the ice-sheathed arcology of <a title="Games > Ib [7 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/ib">Ib</a>ul, or the crustal mortars of Yawningmoon.</p><p>Build your character out of:</p><ul><li>Over 70 Mutations—outfit yourself with wings, two heads, four arms, flaming hands, teleportation, the power to clone yourself…</li><li>Dozens of cybernetic implants (and more to find as treasure)—night vision, translucent skin, carbide fists, spring-loaded ankle tendons…</li><li>24 castes and kits from across the social order of Qud and beyond Moghra’yi, the Great Salt Desert</li><li>Too overwhelmed to build a character from scratch? Choose one of nine preset characters and start your <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,441 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> right away. Then return to character creation when you are ready.</li></ul><p><strong>Modes</strong></p><p>Play one of four modes:</p><ul><li><strong>Classic</strong> – Like other traditional roguelikes, this mode has permadeath, meaning you lose your character when you die. Extremely challenging even for experts.</li><li><strong>Roleplay</strong> – Play it like an RPG. Save your progress at checkpoints located in settlements.</li><li><strong>Wander</strong> – Focus on exploration. Most creatures will not attack you, you don’t gain experience by killing, but you DO gain experience by discovering new locations and treating with legendary creatures.</li><li><strong>Daily</strong> – One chance with a fixed character and world seed. How long will you survive?</li></ul><p><strong>What’s New in Version 1.0?</strong></p><p>After nine years of continuous development and frequent updates, <em>Caves of Qud</em> has finally reached its 1.0 release! Here are some highlights of what’s been added for 1.0:</p><ul><li>The last leg of the main quest.</li><li>The new, fully graphical user interface.</li><li>Hundreds of visual and sound effects.</li><li>Lots of polish and stability.</li></ul><p><strong>History</strong></p><p><em>Caves of Qud</em> is a project of epic proportions that’s been in development for over fifteen years, since 2007. It began as the science fantasy roguelike dream of co-creators Jason Grinblat and Brian Bucklew, who released the first beta in 2010. Since then, it’s accrued a few more contributors who have enriched the project by helping to add visual effects, sound effects, an original soundtrack, a new user interface, new game systems, new lore, and half a world of content. <em>Caves of Qud</em> has grown into a wild garden of emergent narrative, where a handwritten story weaves a path through rich physical, social, and historical simulations. The result is a hybrid handcrafted and procedurally-generated world that’s alive in a way few games are.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Switch Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Caves of Qud - Announcement Trailer - Nintendo Switch" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HGueIQVO_fY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/caves-of-qud-coming-to-switch-in-q4-2025]]></content:encoded>

Up until a few days ago, this would have been a $50 discount. Not bad, but not terribly exciting either. But earlier this week, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-increasing-price-of-switch-and-other-devices-in-the-us/1100-6533633/" data-ref-id="1100-6533633">Nintendo increased the prices</a> on Nintendo Switch hardware and select accessories. The new Switch console prices included all three of legacy consoles, with the Switch OLED seeing the largest increase by moving from $350 to $400. That puts the Switch OLED just $50 shy of the Switch 2. So, if you want a Switch OLED, now seems like a good time to buy one.

		<p>PGA Tour 2K25 is kicking off Season 3 with the build up to the&nbsp;FedExCup Playoffs, but what’s this? You can now be a magician?</p>
<p><iframe title="PGA TOUR 2K25 Season 3 Trailer I 2K" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PZXz5V3IkMA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Well kind of. Instead of pulling rabbits out of bunkers, making golf balls come out of people’s ears or drawing endless linked handkerchiefs out of your pocket, this is a new playing archetype. The Magician is a player type that’s able to get out of sticky situations, with the featured pro players that exemplify this being Max Homa, and the “World’s Greatest Golfer” Chris McDonald.</p>
<p>Through Season 3, players that choose this archetype will have specific quests to try to complete, and then once their MyPlayer character has reached an OVR of 85, they’ll learn the Recovery shot type.</p>
<p>Regardless of your player type, Season 3 of PGA TOUR® 2K25, is all about the FedExCup playoff championships, including the FedEx St. Jude Championship at TPC Southwind and the TOUR Championship at East Lake Golf Club. There’s themed quests and ranked tour events that will take place through the season as well, and alongside new apparel and equipment in the PGA Tour Superstore, the Wear and Earn event will boost VC earnings to help you afford it.</p>

<p>There’s also the Challenges mode, which adds new skill-based challenges with rewards, new themed maps that will be added through the season, and Clubs can now be upgraded to Diamond Tier to let you improve your kit even further. A new free and premium Clubhouse Pass is also available, including the Lob Shot, which can be unlocked for free by reaching Tier 25.</p>
<p>We had a good time with this latest iteration of HB Studios’ golf game, with Nick saying, “While not striking the same feeling of EA’s golf games of old, PGA Tour 2K25 is HB Studios’ best effort yet. There’s enough here to keep you going for a while and if the PGA Tour 2K series continues on this trajectory, might just have the best take on golf games in years to come.”</p>

            <p>Oh, hello there, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/is-this-seat-taken">Is This Seat Taken?</a> The logic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzler</a> with a name that's real awkward to stick midway through a sentence has surprise-released today, August 7th, right off the back of an appearance in a Nintendo Indie World showcase.</p>
<p>When we woke up this morning, all we knew was that this game about telling people where to stick their bottoms would be coming out in August - a vague window previously announced during June's Whole Direct. Now, it be here.</p>

<p>"We are thrilled to finally release our debut game," devs Ausiàs Dalmau Roig and Sergi Pérez Crespo wrote in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3035120/view/545616987916599655?l=english">Steam post</a>. In doing so, making official the release they'd revealed with a fresh trailer in Nintyland. "Over the past two years, we have worked hard to bring you Is This Seat Taken? We hope you enjoy playing it as much as we enjoyed making it!"</p>
<p>As you might have gleaned from the name, the game's all about pleasing little shape-people -  who each have different wants and demands - by seating them in the appropriate spots, with the infinite whims and limited chairs in each scene forming the challenges you'll bang your head against. Well, relatively. It looks pretty chill.</p>

<p>If you want a taste of what it offers before dropping your hard earned cash, the demo our Nic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-stress-free-logic-puzzles-of-is-this-seat-taken-make-for-my-favourite-demo-in-ages">played earlier this year</a> is still free to grab on Is This Seat Taken?'s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3035120/Is_This_Seat_Taken/">Steam page</a> as of writing.</p>
<p>"I'm almost positive it's a very ancient of genre of game and/or basically an elaborate GCSE Maths test question, although I'm struggling to think of any comparisons off the top of my head," the Reuben wrote of his time with said demo, "The world's first Seatlike? No, that's terrible. Either way, its nice to be surprised by something that also feels quite traditionally designed."</p>
<p>So, there you go. It's like the video game version of a nun's robe that's secretly concealing a strap-on. Or maybe that's not quite what he meant there. You can see why when I ask Is This Seat Taken?, the answer's often a look of disdain, can't you?</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/is-this-seat-taken-i-hope-not-because-the-sitting-themed-logic-puzzler-is-out-now]]></content:encoded>

              <p><i><span>War of the Worlds</span></i><span> isn’t one of those films that unravels, revealing its dreadfulness as it begins to fall apart. Instead, it begins by falling apart, and then just gets worse and worse and worse.</span></p> <p><span>Amazon Prime’s latest movie could so easily have been a modern take on H.G. Wells’ all-time classic novel, employing found footage and gonzo documentary-style reporting to revive the spirit of Orson Welles’ notorious 1938 radio production of the story. There’s the sense that at some point, somewhere during production, this was the intent. It is, after all, cobbled together from video feeds, cell phone calls, surveillance footage, webcam views of people’s faces, and all the other sorts of very modern lenses through which we now parse reality. There’s an imagined version of this film that has the vibes of the original </span><i><span>Cloverfield </span></i><span>if its events had been</span><span>&nbsp;perceived by people with more agency, more expertise.</span></p> <p><span>But that’s not the film we get. Instead, what we have here looks like an in-house corporate video, complete with perfectly lit footage of perfectly made up people, slickly delivering Amazon commercials in between the potential end of the world, with the most atrocious script you could ever imagine.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000616279" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616279"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616279">© Amazon Prime / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>The immediately credulous plot begins as government worker Ice Cube sits in front of his monitor for a day’s…staring at </span><i><span>all</span></i><span> of the surveillance camera feeds in central DC? He leaps between cameras placed at various recognizable landmarks, listening in to three seconds of a random person’s phone call, before bouncing off to stare at a nondescript stretch of road to listen to about seven words of conversation someone’s having in some randomly chosen car, in between zooming in on a police officer stationed outside the White House to receive the improbable information that this cop has never exhibited any suspicious activity and has no known “breaches.” It’s </span><i><span>Watch_Dogs</span></i><span> levels of improbable nonsense, but performed by a bored man sipping coffee, flitting across an entire city as if this scattershot invasion of privacy could or would achieve anything, ever.</span></p>

 <p><span>This one man doing the watching—his name is William Radford—appears to be responsible for monitoring activity at the Pentagon, the White House, an airport, all roads, pregnant ladies who walk through parks, and the NSA. Incredible. However, midway through his morning blitz, Eva Longoria calls him from NASA. I know she’s at NASA because of the model space rockets on the table beside her, and the (I swear) giant NASA logo on the side of the stairs outside her window. She’s calling to ask Radford if he’s seen the crazy weather that’s going on. “Any noise about it on your end?” she asks, while showing him crisp 4K videos of a ludicrously busy electric storm, then jumping to a mega-tornado of the sort that would make </span><i><span>Twisters </span></i><span>jealous. “Nope,” says Mr. Cube. “I watch people, not weather.” Duh, Eva Longoria. Who—and again I’m not making this up—is credited on the movie as “NASA Scientist Sandra Salas.”</span></p> <p><span>“I’ve never seen global storms like this,” NASA Scientist Sandra Salas says to William Radford, not pausing to explain what a “global storm” could possibly be. “We can’t figure out what’s causing this atmospheric phenomena.”&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>That was enough to bring Radford around. “All right, that’s crazy right there,” he says, having watched a montage of exquisitely well-shot and streamed thunderstorm videos, which are apparently affecting everywhere in the world </span><i><span>except for</span></i><span> Washington DC. (It wasn’t even raining on his surveillance feeds.) And then come some lines that made me certain I was going to be in for a riveting ride.</span></p>

 <p><span>“All of NASA’s satellites are blind,” says NASA Scientist Sandra Salas. </span><span>“We haven’t been able to see anything for two days.”</span></p> <p><span>I have only awe. Someone convinced Amazon to give them enough money to make a movie, albeit a desperately cheap-looking one, cast proper actors like Clark Gregg, Andrea Savage, and Iman Benson, and yet was cool with NASA just beginning to worry something might be wrong after </span><i><span>two days</span></i><span> of </span><i><span>none of their satellites working</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>Oh, but bad news, Radford’s lost interest. “Yeah,” he sneers. “Well, I got bigger fish to fry than watching clouds.” DHS Dir. Briggs has just messaged him on Microsoft Teams, “FBI team on standby for Disruptor raid.” Some hacker is about to maybe do something, see.</span></p>

 <p><span>We are three minutes and twenty-one seconds into this film.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000616280" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616280"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616280">© Amazon Prime / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>While simultaneously spying on both his adult son and pregnant daughter, to the level of monitoring what food his daughter orders in cafes (his surveillance tools can do this automatically, including listing the protein content of the ordered food), Radford gets on with his proper job: trying to bring down baddies. We find out that the evil terrorist action he needs to thwart is this mysterious hacker, Disruptor, who’s planning to reveal a secret government surveillance program called Goliath. The one Ice Cube is using? Incredibly, no, it’s a different one. A worse one, one capable of doing </span><i><span>more</span></i><span> spying than being able to listen in to any call, take over any phone, track all card purchases, and profile any human from their face. Disruptor has posted a YouTube video saying he will soon release the proof, so Radford begins tracking his possible locations by—hold on tight—right-clicking and looking at the page source for his YouTube video, copying out a random string of letters and numbers, and then pasting those into an IP search. Like I said, awe. And then meteors start raining out of the sky.</span></p> <p>People, the aliens are coming. The meteors–they’re used to take out our satellites and create those dreadful storms, all so the beastly beings can sneak up on us for their invasion. As in the original story, the creatures crash to earth in spherical rocks that break open to reveal the tripod aliens within. Unlike in the original story, this doesn’t take days of tension-building mystery to occur, but instead (genuinely) about two minutes. Crash, crack, skyscraper-sized aliens.</p>

 <p><span>We perceive all of this through Radford’s computer, and it really should be fun that Ice Cube uses a huge array of familiar programs and applications, from a large range of companies. It’s a Windows operating system, but he uses both Teams and Zoom, messages and calls his kids with WhatsApp and FaceTime, loads live news feeds from CNN, Fox News, and the BBC via Chrome…That sort of real-world inclusion usually gives disaster movies a grounding in our own reality, showing us outrageous fiction through the framing by which we understand our own world. But here, it’s so crass, so obviously phony, that it all looks like commercials. It probably is.</span></p> <p><span>And god damn, the plot holes. We learn from news reports that </span><i><span>all</span></i><span> satellites were out for two days before the attack, but we see Radford use a live CIA satellite feed of Earth, seen from space. Radford, a man whose job appears to be spying on individuals, is somehow suddenly the person advising the actual president on the military response to the attack. A hacked Tesla he remotely controls to save his injured daughter needs to go on a one-mile journey, but only has battery for, um, two miles, so there’s a panicked sequence to set it to a super-low-battery mode. And, desperate to help his daughter, Ice Cube shrieks that he’s coming to save her, runs to the door of his office, gives it a gentle pull and declares, “Dammit! Locked in!” And just goes sit down again. It was a glass door. I mean, I’m not claiming to be father of the year, but I’d maybe give it a slightly more energetic wobble.</span></p>

 <p><span>It’s a constant treat to see how time functions in this movie. Radford advises the president on his military response, after which the world’s governments unite to fight back, then we see footage of this new strategy, troop deployment, and their new tactics taking down tripods all around the world—and then we cut back to the Tesla. Yup, all that happened during the car’s one mile drive. .</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000616281" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616281"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616281">© Amazon Prime / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>The script is so adorably abysmal. There’s no room for nuance, nothing left for subtext. When Radford can’t get out of the office, his daughter literally says out loud, “The irony. You wouldn’t leave your office when you could, and now you can’t leave…” At another point his son says, “You know, for someone who spends their life watching, you sure do miss a lot.” A revoltingly mawkish plot about Radford’s dead wife is told via the medium of writing it on a baseball bat and repeatedly smashing it into your face, but in case you couldn’t understand that a man might be sad about losing his kids’ mother, people make sure to say it out loud too.</span></p> <p><span>But that’s all as nothing compared to the movie’s twist on </span><i><span>War of the Worlds’</span></i><span> themes. Look, I need to pause to be positive for a moment, because as awful as this film looks in almost every scene, the alien tripods are </span><i><span>amazing</span></i><span>. The CG is great, they have that ideal mix of robotic and organic, and they look truly menacing as they stomp through the streets in the various news clips. Like in the book they kill indiscriminately, adding to their malevolence, and somewhere out there there’s an SFX team who got </span><i><span>screwed </span></i><span>by having their fine work put into this garbled drivel. But to ensure it’s more woefully wasted, the big original concept here is that the aliens aren’t after our water, but instead our </span><i><span>new</span></i><span> most precious resource (I know it’s our most precious resource because at least two different voices describe it as our most precious resource), data. Yes, they eat data. Because…because they </span><i><span>do</span></i><span>!</span></p>

 <p><span>This is demonstrated by Ice Cube looking at his dead wife’s Facebook page, only to see a message declaring that his “memories” are being deleted, and then watching as the jpegs disappear from the screen one by one. The last voice note she left him, the banal message about the garbage, corrupts and vanishes. You know, because of the way websites are live feeds of images being endlessly beamed from a server, such that when the server is drained, the pictures go away. That’s how it works! The alien invaders are desperate for our Facebook jpegs, all their killing just a distraction from their true goal of draining data centers, because of all that yummy binary code. And so Goliath?! That </span><i><span>extra</span></i><span> bad surveillance tool? That’s gotta be the tastiest data ever!</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000616282" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616282"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616282">© Amazon Prime / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>It’s tempting to really lay into Ice Cube’s acting, because it is quite spectacularly terrible. His faux-horrified reactions play out like a Lonely Island sketch, that under-performed awkwardness making everything sound completely insincere. At one point he says, “DNA? Oh my God,” and it could absolutely be </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt2OVAgkHBc"><span>Just 2 Guyz</span></a><span>. Except, you know, he’s trying his best. But at the same time, </span><i><span>everyone’s</span></i><span> terrible in this. Andrea Savage, who was utterly perfect in the incredible </span><i><span>I’m Sorry</span></i><span>, flounders like she’s never seen a camera before. Iman Benson, whose performance in </span><i><span>Midnight Club</span></i><span> was breathtaking, just seems bored. And Clark Gregg, who is Hollywood’s most reliable government man in a suit, sounds like he’s reading out loud for the first time.</span></p> <p><span>A lot of this might be because everyone is mostly alone when filming, speaking into the camera, obviously not having any real dialogue with the other actors. The result is stitched together, and badly. No one comes off looking good, not even stalwarts like Michael O’Neill.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000616284" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616284"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616284">© Amazon Prime / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>And yes, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/war-of-the-worlds-amazon-ad-drone-scene-horrible-bad-review-2000614752"><span>there’s that Amazon drone commercial</span></a><span>. Radford’s daughter’s boyfriend is an Amazon delivery driver, see, and we frequently see him in his van, with his Amazon shirt. Right at the crucial moment, when all is lost unless Radford can get a thumb drive, he whips out an Amazon Air drone from his bag and declares, “It’s the future of delivery.” Then, beyond all credibility, adds, “I need you to place an official order on Amazon to activate the drone.” Apparently, despite all the rest of the internet having been eaten by aliens, Amazon’s website is still fine, jpegs and all. It does seem something of a self-own to suggest that Amazon is so gross that not even data-hungry alien invaders would want to touch it.</span></p>

 <p><span>Nothing in the entire film makes a lick of sense. It’s sewn together from plot holes, something established in one scene is entirely forgotten in the next, and it has the most outstanding fairy tale ending imaginable. Look, spoilers, but during this film nearly all of human data is deleted (apart from Amazon), the global stock market and all of banking is erased, millions upon millions are killed, all power is wiped out around the world (apart from when it isn’t), and entire cities are leveled, but after our friends successfully upload a virus (because it didn’t have a better idea than copying </span><i><span>Independence Day</span></i><span>), that’s all better! Seriously, everyone’s happy and sharing photos online again and life’s immediately back to normal! </span><i><span>Incredible</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>This is truly one of the most terrible films I’ve ever seen. Even awful low-budget amateur horror flicks try to have some sort of central conceit that’s consistent from scene to scene. But this is gibberish from start to finish, despite a solid team of B-list actors and Amazon money behind it.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>I swear, I’ve typed out and deleted so many other glaring plot issues, because I needed to get them out of my system more than I needed for you to read them. It seems fully credible that this disaster of a movie might genuinely only exist to contain the Amazon adverts within, despite also heavily featuring products by Microsoft, Google and others, and everything else that happens in the other 80 minutes of a mercifully short film is an aside.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000616283" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616283"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616283">© Amazon Prime / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>What upsets me here isn’t that someone made a shitty movie—that happens all the time! What is so bothersome is that the ingredients and the money were there for something far better. A film that portrays a terrifying alien invasion through the lenses and applications with which we currently interpret our world could offer an uncanny and chilling vision. Found footage, live-streamed video, news broadcasts, all of it, that’s a great medium for this story. But perhaps to deliver that, someone involved would have had to actually want to say </span><i><span>something</span></i><span>. Instead, this is incoherent hypocrisy, a film about how wildly invasive surveillance is good but also bad, and how we should think twice about how we share our data, but also we should order from Amazon and be grateful that our data can save us from aliens.</span></p> <p><span>This isn’t “so bad it’s good,” but it is “so bad it’s </span><i><span>fascinating</span></i><span>.” It’s hard to wrap my head around how anything can be this dreadful. I cannot wait until enough time has passed that the inside stories come out, and we can learn how something so awful came to be. In the meantime, maybe read the book. It’s available on Amazon!</span></p>

                <p>We live in an era of unmitigated excess and constant suppression. The wide proliferation of machine learning image generation means that anyone can make <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/718975/xai-grok-imagine-taylor-swifty-deepfake-nudes" rel="nofollow ">creepy porn of their celebrity of choice</a>. Expressions like "gooning" are widespread slang. Games like Marvel Rivals and Street Fighter 6 sell themselves on their pin-up characters. Meanwhile, books for children and teens like Genderqueer and All Boys Aren't Blue are <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-life-and-style/author-gender-queer-one-banned-books-us-addresses-controversy-rcna8991" rel="nofollow ">banned for being "pornographic</a>." In July, the UK introduced an <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/uk-online-safety-act-age-verification-social-adult-sites-how-it-works" rel="nofollow ">age-verification requirement for internet access</a>, ostensibly protecting kids, but mostly violating the privacy of adults. All these things, though disparate, represent a siloing of acceptable eroticism and thereby a siloing of life and art.</p><p dir="ltr">Independent video games are the latest front of this suppression. In July 2025, anti-porn non-profit Collective Shout pushed multiple payment processors to stop facilitating payments for some "adult titles" from Steam and Itch.io. In an attempt to halt the immediate loss of business,<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/itch-io-joins-steam-in-recent-push-to-ban-adult-games/1100-6533423/"> Steam removed Itch de-indexed thousands of not-safe-for-work games from the storefront</a>. To be clear, this means removed from search results--the games in-question are still available if you can find them. On August 1, Itch <a href="https://itch.io/t/5149036/reindexing-adult-nsfw-content" rel="nofollow ">re-indexed free NSFW games</a>, sidestepping the participation of payment processors altogether. The quick changes have led to no shortage of confusion.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mastercard-responds-to-censorship-allegations-after-forcing-storefronts-to-remove-adult-games/1100-6533641/">Mastercard has since denied its direct involvement</a> in <a href="http://itch.io/" rel="nofollow ">Itch</a>'s mass de-listing, stating, "Mastercard has not evaluated any game or required restrictions of any activity on game creator sites and platforms, contrary to media reports and allegations." The statement did claim that Mastercard “require[s] merchants to have appropriate controls to ensure Mastercard cards cannot be used for unlawful purchases, including illegal adult content.” Mastercard did not clarify whether any of the games removed from Steam were illegal. Additionally, Valve contradicted its account,<a href="https://kotaku.com/mastercard-denies-pressuring-steam-to-censor-nsfw-games-2000614393" rel="nofollow "> stating that Mastercard communicated through payment processors and acquiring banks</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Whatever exactly happened, and however big a role Collective Shout played in it, the consequences are clear: Indie developers are considering moving their work off of itch or supplementing it with their own storefronts; the International Game Developers Association (IGDA)<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/international-game-developers-association-seriously-alarmed-by-recent-delisting-of-games/1100-6533536/"> is now pleading with payment processors</a> for "transparency;"<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gog-launches-nsfw-game-giveaway-to-raise-awareness-on-censorship-in-gaming/1100-6533652/"> GOG launched a NSFW giveaway</a> to "[take] a stand against the quiet erasure of creative works from digital shelves;"<a href="https://aftermath.site/steam-itch-porn-censorship-collective-shout-visa-mastercard-paypal" rel="nofollow "> Developers and artists have started a mass calling campaign</a> to pressure payment processors into changing their position. The mass delisting and removals on both Steam and itch have spurred both fear and action.</p><p dir="ltr">Mass de-indexing has caused such a fervor because it is tied to broader cultural conflicts. There is no question that this silencing resembles the book bans in libraries and public schools across the US. The Trump administration uses feminist language to boost anti-trans policies in the name of protecting children and women, even as it suppresses information about the president's well-documented ties to sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. An abstract concern for "the children" or "women" drives a suppression of even the most inoffensive and benign explorations of gender, sex, and identity, all while the most extreme offenders go free.</p><p dir="ltr">The members of Collective Shout might argue that this is not their intention. Their campaign's <a href="https://www.collectiveshout.org/steam_campaign_history" rel="nofollow ">explicit target</a> is "rape and incest games," extreme examples of taboo sexual material, and a category that most of the games de-indexed from Itch do not fall into. On one hand, games like No Mercy, a game in which players specifically commit rape and incest and the initial subject of Collective Shout's campaign, are misogynistic. But it is also a niche product, and one that most people have only ever heard of because of Collective Shout's campaign against it. Furthermore, <a href="https://www.collectiveshout.org/win-itch-pulls-abuse-games" rel="nofollow ">Collective Shout’s statement on Itch’s mass deindexing</a> states that, “thousands of games glorifying rape, torture, and sexual violence against women and girls were delisted from gaming platform itch.” The statement equates every deindexed game to No Mercy, regardless of whether they resemble it or not.</p><p dir="ltr">It is easier than ever to find upsetting material and to extrapolate that upset to a fundamental societal ill. When the personal is political, everything is public. In her essay,<a href="https://internetprincess.substack.com/p/west-elm-caleb-and-the-feminist-panopticon" rel="nofollow "> "west elm caleb and the feminist panopticon,"</a> Rayne Fisher-Quann discusses the urge to hold ordinary individuals uniquely responsible for societal woes. She writes, "the crucifixion of these individuals is ultimately a system of smoke and mirrors that obfuscates true systemic change while providing us with enough satisfaction to stop aiming higher." Though the work of Collective Shout takes place in a different context, it is driven by a similar impulse. Most generously, Collective Shout chases the cultural and consumptive symptoms of patriarchal violence while doing little to stop its material harms or to aid victims. Founder Melinda Tankard-Reist's own<a href="https://mimidoshima.neocities.org/main/posts/2025/collectiveshout/" rel="nofollow "> ties to religious, right-wing politics</a> bear this out. When you cannot address causes, you are left fighting battles that don't matter.</p><p dir="ltr">Although Collective Shout targets titans of softcore porn like Playboy and obscure pornography in equal measure, its campaign has more directly harmed the obscure. This is a dynamic that has played out over and over again. The work of Robert Yang--full of a playful, artistic eroticism--is still banned on Twitch. Meanwhile, big-budget games like Cyberpunk 2077--which include sex just as explicit--can be broadcast with a change or two in the settings to remove nudity and copyrighted music. The difference in scale between Steam and Itch illustrates this. Valve took down specific games that represent a fraction of the overall business on the storefront. Itch de-indexed every NSFW game on the site. The force this kind of puritanism has on smaller games is far greater than it will have on multi-million companies. And it has far more effect than just “rape and incest games” or even just pornographic games. Vile: Exhumed, a narrative game about sexual assault, <a href="https://dreadxp.com/vile-is-banned/" rel="nofollow ">was among the games which Valve removed from Steam</a>. Even if you accept Collective Shout's logic as a given, a game like Grand Theft Auto 6 shapes culture in a far more direct way than even the most vile niche game ever could. Yet, for the moment anyway, it remains untouched.</p><p dir="ltr">But the deeper problem is that anti-porn crusades are terrible at actually protecting and helping victims of abuse. Campaigns like Collective Shout treat rape and sexual abuse as deviant and abnormal, the product of twisted media distorting ordinary minds. But sexual violence is not horrifying because porn-addled monsters do it. It is horrifying because there is no category of person immune from involvement. Because these are broad, societal-level issues, it is outside of the scope of an article like this to articulate causes. But I can tell you this: I have lived in a culture where “thought leaders” policed porn consumption and sexual behavior. It did not protect women, but instead made men better able to hide, less accountable to the women they hurt, and more capable of blaming victims. If prudishness was an effective way of combating abuse, churches would be bastions of safety for women and children. They are not.</p><p dir="ltr">If art and video games can have any real role in combating structural misogyny, they must get stranger and more frank. The consequences of Collective Shout's campaign is already that games will struggle to address the things that really matter, that thoughtful examinations of complex and taboo issues will be equivocated with purulent misogyny, and that marginalized demographics will struggle to find platforms while powerful men can say whatever they want. This censorship has already made the world of games worse.</p>

But according to dataminers, that grind is going to be a little bit slower this season, with Epic reportedly making it so players now learn less passive XP, which is XP that you periodically receive just by playing.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/SpushFNBR/status/1953447404377657430" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">NEW XP VALUES (They nerfed all lol)<br>Creative: 3350 XP -&gt; 2300 XP <br>Lego Odyssey: 3475 XP -&gt; 2250 XP <br>Reload: 2350 XP -&gt; 1200 XP <br>OG: 650 XP -&gt; REMOVED <br>Ballistic: 2950 XP -&gt; 1750 XP <br>Lego Brick Life: 3475 XP -&gt; 2250 XP <br>BR: Still REMOVED <br>Jam Stage: 3850 XP -&gt; 2300 XP <br>Lego… <a href="https://t.co/6cPDm5bCXb" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/6cPDm5bCXb</a></p>  — SpushFNBR (@SpushFNBR) <a href="https://twitter.com/SpushFNBR/status/1953447404377657430?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 7, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>The amounts listed in the tweet are XP per minute for each mode, with most modes losing 30-50% of the passive XP rates they offered in Season 3, while OG has had its passive XP removed entirely. Standard Battle Royale had its passive XP removed last week, with someone apparently jumping the gun on that one.</p><p>This change may not look or feel great at first, but there are a couple reasons why this change isn't as impactful as you might initially think. First is that other sources of XP, like completing quests and defeating enemies, are still intact, so there's still plenty of XP to be had.</p><p>Second is that Season 4 is going to run until November 1, making it a month longer than last season was. Since the number of levels you need to gain to complete the pass, and the amount of XP required per level, have both remained the same in the new season, it's not particularly surprising that Epic would try to slow down player progress a bit. For folks who play regularly, it's doubtful the change will have much of an impact.</p><p>There's a lot of new stuff happening with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-in-fortnite-chapter-6-season-4-shock-n-awesome/2900-6853/" data-ref-id="2900-6853">the launch of Chapter 6 Season 4</a>, including a full refresh of the main Battle Royale mode and a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-palm-paradise-lego-pass-all-builds-skins-and-other-rewards/2900-6864/" data-ref-id="2900-6864">Lego pass</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-og-pass-season-5-all-skins-and-rewards/2900-6862/" data-ref-id="2900-6862">OG Pass</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-chapter-6-season-4-battle-pass-all-skins-and-rewards/2900-6856/" data-ref-id="2900-6856">battle pass</a> full of cosmetics to unlock.</p>

<p>Exploring <i>Monster Hunter Wilds</i> can feel pretty on-rails at first. It’s hard not to spend your time traveling directly from objective to objective when you have the convenient option of letting your Seikret automatically run towards the monster you’re hunting or any known resources. Although it’s easy to assume that various maps of the game are barren, each one has a fair selection of hidden areas.</p> <p>Some of these secret areas are easily missed pop-up camps for you to fast travel to or <a href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-rest-plenty-fallow-inclemency-1851776094">rest in</a>, while others are caves that are only accessible if you crawl or swim. Either way, these locations are surrounded by good loot to farm and incredible views to enjoy.</p> <h2><span id="windward-plains%e2%80%99-area-three-platform"></span>Windward Plains’ Area Three Platform<span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000616330" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616330"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616330">© Screenshot: Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>You’re told early on that some places will only be accessible with your Seikret. You can find a great example of this early on in the Windward Plains. Located right above the Area Three South Pop-up Camp is a spot with Mining Outcrops, Fulgurite Shards, and the very rare Nightflower Pollen-granting Ephemeral Blossom. The quickest way here is to fast travel to the campsite and then ride your Seikret next to its food trough behind the tent. Jump off the mount and your hunter will climb up the ledge.</p>

 <h2><span id="windward-plain%e2%80%99s-best-mining-outcrop-farm"></span>Windward Plain’s Best Mining Outcrop Farm<span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000616331" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616331"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616331">© Screenshot: Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>This next spot requires you to leave your Seikret behind. Located near the entrance to Rey Dau’s nest in Area 17 is a Mining Outcrop. Directly next to it is a small opening that your hunter can crawl under. On the other side are three ascending platforms accessible by climbing long sets of vines or using multiple Wedge Beetles. All together, you’ll be able to gather from four to eight additional Mining Outcrops.</p> <h2><span id="scarlet-forest%e2%80%99s-area-six-camp"></span>Scarlet Forest’s Area Six Camp<span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000616332" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616332"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616332">© Screenshot: Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>One of the best missable spots in the Scarlet Forest is the Area Six Flowering Rocks Pop-up Camp. Situated between Areas Two and Three, it’s only accessible by going through some tree roots on the south side of Area Six. Aside from being a safe camp in a convenient part of the map, there is also a nice fishing area with Glass Algae to gather and potentially two Ancient Wyvern Coins to find.</p> <h2><span id="scarlet-forest%e2%80%99s-underwater-area"></span>Scarlet Forest’s Underwater Area<span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000616335" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616335"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616335">© Screenshot: Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Every video game should have hidden caves behind waterfalls. Finding the <a href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-giant-downy-crake-location-item-1851784123">Grand Hub’s Gigacrake</a> is a fun secret in itself, but the Scarlet Forest takes it even further with two waterfall caves. What is arguably the coolest lies just north of the Area 12 Northeast camp. If you’ve already encountered Lagiacrus after Title Update Two, you want to go towards the monster’s nest in the unlocked Area 19.</p>

 <p>This spot doesn’t seem like much besides an aesthetically pleasing fishing spot at first glance. The trick is approaching the end of the mound and pressing Circle/B to dive into the water. Your hunter’s swimming path is on rails, but you can use your Slinger to gather numerous Weathered Treasures and Glass Algae. Even more Weathered Treasures await you in the small stone structure at the end.</p> <h2><span id="oilwell-basin%e2%80%99s-crimson-rivulet-camp"></span>Oilwell Basin’s Crimson Rivulet Camp<span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000616336" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616336"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616336">© Screenshot: Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I rode past this location many times before I discovered its existence in the Oilwell Basin. When traveling to Area 16 from Area 12, there is a small path on the right side with a steep drop. At the bottom of this trail is the Area 12: Crimson Rivulet Pop-up Camp. On top of being situated in a convenient location, it’s also near a relaxing pool of water where you can fish.</p>

 <h2><span id="iceshard-cliffs%e2%80%99-watchtower"></span>Iceshard Cliffs’ Watchtower<span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000616337" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616337"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616337">© Screenshot: Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Your Seikret is a must for this one. Connecting Areas Seven and Eight is a slope between two ledges. Climbing in from the former’s direction, ride your Seikret left to find a small gap next to an Adamant Seed pick-up. Jumping across and climbing up the vines leads to the Area Seven Watchtower Pop-up Camp.</p> <p>There are a couple of Mining Outcrops and occasionally a crab holding an Ancient Wyvern Coin, but the real joy is the view to the left. You can see all across the Forbidden Lands from up here.</p>

 <h2><span id="iceshard-cliff%e2%80%99s-sinkhole"></span>Iceshard Cliff’s Sinkhole<span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000616338" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616338"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616338">© Screenshot: Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Within the hallway between Areas Eight and 16 is a small hole in the wall. Inside is a massive sinkhole leading down to the Area 18 Sinkhole camp. Not only is this a safe camp in a great spot, but there is a nice variety of gatherables here and in the tiny cave right behind the camp.</p> <h2><span id="ruins-of-wyveria%e2%80%99s-secluded-ruins"></span>Ruins of Wyveria’s Secluded Ruins<span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000616339" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616339"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616339">© Screenshot: Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>The Ruins of Wyveria can feel like the tiniest map due to its vertical orientation, which makes Area Six feel ostensibly large in comparison. There are three campsites in this area, however, the most interesting is on the north side near two Vespoids. Along the wall will be a thin stretch of vines leading up to a pipe. On the other side is the Secluded Ruins Pop-up Camp and a lovely view of the Lost Path of Wyveria that connects to the Iceshard Cliffs.</p> <h2><span id="ruins-of-wyveria%e2%80%99s-gap-in-rubble"></span>Ruins of Wyveria’s Gap in Rubble<span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000616340" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616340"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616340">© Screenshot: Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>It wouldn’t feel right if there wasn’t another random hole in the wall. You can find just that on the West side of Area Eight, literally next to the number “8” when viewing the map. This hole leads to the appropriately named Gap in Rubble Campsite where you can find some Blackened Fossils and a handy fishing spot.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Helldivers 2 - Control Group Warbond Gameplay Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Xbox players (and even PlayStation fans) heavily<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-published-game-helldivers-2-is-coming-to-xbox-in-august/1100-6532942/" data-ref-id="1100-6532942"> advocated for a version of Helldivers 2</a> on Xbox since the game's launch, but the prospect appeared unlikely at the time. While Microsoft-owned games such as Sea of Thieves and Forza Horizon 5 were making it to PlayStation 5, the inverse wasn't happening. Finally bringing Helldivers 2 on Xbox should increase the game's player count and grow its existing community, a prospect that excites the game's fanbase.</p><p>The decision also makes sense when considering that Helldivers 2 is one of Sony's few successful online multiplayer titles, with Concord being a very public failure. Expanding the Helldivers player base can only strengthen the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-admits-its-live-service-games-have-been-rocky-acknowledges-negative-news-about-marathon/1100-6533758/" data-ref-id="1100-6533758">company's shaky live-service efforts</a>. Putting popular PlayStation-published single-player games like The Last of Us and Marvel's Spider-Man, however, still might be a far-fetched scenario.</p><p>Xbox players can join the fight for Super Earth when Helldivers 2 lands on Xbox Series X|S on August 26.The Xbox-published <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-reloaded-remaster-coming-this-august-to-xbox-playstation-and-pc/1100-6531314/" data-ref-id="1100-6531314">Gears of War: Reloaded releases on PlayStation 5</a>, along with Xbox and PC, on the same day.</p>

		<p>Fortnite is becoming a bug-riddled mess these days… but not in a bad way. No, Fortnite Battle Royale Chapter 6 Season 4: Shock ‘N Awesome has littered the Battle Royale Island with bugs as part of The Hive, and is tasking you with joining the O.X.R. (Onimorph eXtermination Rangers) to blast them all away.</p>
<p>And who better to blow up some bugs than UNSC Spartans from the Halo franchise, and the Power Rangers?</p>
<p><iframe title="Fortnite Battle Royale Chapter 6 Season 4: Shock 'N Awesome | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yGqbypEMcVA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>New for the Battle Royale Island are some locations themed after this battle, with the OXR HQ there to dish out orders and sell you weapons, while the Ranger’s Ruin is a former OXR weapons lab that has now been overrun. You’ll face off against Swarmers, Bombers, and burrowing Queens, grabbing new weapons like the Leadspitter 3000 minigun, Sweeper Shotgun, O.X.R. Rifle, Wrecker Revolver and a&nbsp;Bug Cannon, and getting to the Hammerhead Choppa to rain fire down from above.</p>
<p>It’s all tied together by the new Battle Pass. Purchasing the pass auto-unlocks the UNSC Spartain, while progression will get you the Green Ranger and, from 16th September, you’ll be able to complete quests to unlock a&nbsp;Dino Megazord Outfit.</p>

<p>Also in the Battle Pass are <span>Yoo-mi, </span><span>Agent Patch, </span>Battle Gamer Mae, Lt. Ripp Slade, and the totally not just a panda version of Nick Fury, Onyx Winter</p>
<p>The rest of the Power Rangers will be kept for a Mighty Morphin Bundle that will hit the Shop in August and includes Red Ranger, Black Ranger, Pink Ranger, Yellow Ranger and Blue Ranger Outfits.</p>

		<p>Jackbox Games has revealed the fifth and final game that will be included with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-jackbox-party-pack-11">Jackbox Party Pack 11</a> later this year, with Cookie Haus a drawing game that will be sure to be a hit with sweet-toothed artists out there.</p>
<p>Cookie Haus is a cozy drawing game where you decorate cookies to match the prompts, adding layers of icing and sprinkles to match prompts like “a cookie who’s <em>seen</em> some things.” Once cookies have been created, you can then name them and the group you’re playing with with then vote on their favourites &nbsp;for each prompt.</p>
<p><iframe title="The final game in Party Pack 11 is..." width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Kb0p6mUjApM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>“The core thing that sets Cookie Haus apart from our other drawing games is that the drawing interface is built from the ground up to feel very physical,” said Director Chase McClure. “There is something about placing icing and sprinkles on a cookie that makes it more familiar to someone who doesn’t consider themselves an ‘artist.’ But, it also gives this whole new challenge to the Drawful veterans of the group.”</p>

<p>Also included in Jackbox Party Pack 11 are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Suspectives</strong> – There’s been a crime, one player secretly did it, and the evidence comes from your own survey answers! Study the clues, defend your innocence (even if you’re lying), and put your friends on trial.</li>
<li><strong>Doominate</strong> – Take all that is perfectly lovely and destroy it in a head-to-head joke game where the funniest answer is exalted.</li>
<li><strong>Legends of Trivia</strong> – Are you looking for a fantasy trivia game with RPG-inspired elements? Oh boy, do I have some good news for you!</li>
<li><strong>Hear Say</strong> – In Hear Say, you’ll be putting your pipes to work to create hilarious soundscapes. Use your phone as a controller, just like all Jackbox party pack games. But in this one, you get to use the microphone on your phone to get real sound effects that work in the game!</li>
</ul>
