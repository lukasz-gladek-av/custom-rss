            <p>Supergiant have released their third big update for slashy dashy roguelike <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a>, and it adds familiar murdergod Ares to the roster of deities helping you out. Like other immortals he'll offer boons 'n' blessings while smarming at you from afar. The update also adds a new animal familiar - a polecat named Gale who will please defensive players by boosting your dodge chance and movement speed. Which you might need if you travel the surface route towards mount Olympus - because the game now has a "final confrontation" that way. </p>

<p>For players deep into Greek mythology and Supergiant's retelling, the gurgling and scaly appendage teased at the end of the above trailer will be enough to guess the final final (final?) boss. For simpletons such as I, who haven't even defeated vanilla boss Chronos, you might have to look it up. I did, and yes, this foe is definitely large and perhaps even in charge. </p>
<p>Other highlights of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/503942841152569349">the update detailed on Steam</a> include a bunch more story events, dialogue, and character interactions, such as a sing-song with leafy hunter Artemis. There's new tarot card artwork at the Altar of Ashes (the place you prep passive skills and such before a run). And there are two new enemy types to stab - a jellyfish foe in Oceanus and a hulkin' big lad in the Rift of Thessaly.</p>
<p>As usual with the game's major updates, there is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/503942841152569404">a lengthy scroll of patchnotes</a> that details the new stuff and all changes big and small. "Various forms of wildlife now may appear throughout the Crossroads," it teases. "Melinoë will sometimes cover up the family portrait in her tent after brooding too much," we are told. And my personal favourite of the notes: "Fixed Icarus missing his targets unexpectedly (unless you're his father and expect disappointment)."</p>
<p>Supergiant are already working on the next big update, which'll look at mixing up boss battles to give repeat runs more variation, along with plans to expand on "various character relationships". But this won't arrive until "some months from now". They're giving no clues as to when a 1.0 release is coming but seem happy to have given some sense of a finale to players who dash off towards Olympus.</p>
<p>"With the core structure of both the Underworld and Surface routes now fully intact, we're excited to turn our attention to filling out more of the game's content categories, finishing more and more of what we started... until we're done!"</p>
<p>The first Hades was in early access for just under two years. Whereas this sequel hasn't been out even a year yet. So if you're waiting around for the final release, um, just wait longer?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

At a glance, the footage seems to focus on a pre-Hulk Bruce Banner suspended in midair in what appears to be a testing room – but it’s more than that. Marvel fans will recognize this eight-armed version of the gamma-infused doctor as an unpolished, Marvel Rivals-inspired take on classic Spider-Man villain Doctor Octopus.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's stiff and a touch goofy, but the likeness is unmistakable. Squint and you’ll see a well-thought-out concept of what Doc Ock could potentially look and move like should NetEase ever decide to send Otto Octavius crawling into Marvel Rivals. With his arms able to magnetize the player up and around obstacles, WickedCube’s idea come-to-life essentially allows the character to fly so long as he’s close enough to a stable structure – an important note in a game with destructible environments. This rough Doc Ock concept even comes with named abilities, including Havoc Claw for the standard melee attack and a ranged move called Wrecking Grip. At 16,000 upvotes at the time of publication, it’s impressive, playable, and made entirely by one person.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Doc Ock has always been one of the coolest villains in Spider-Man, and his tentacles would be a challenge to implement,” WickedCube tell us, describing where his inspiration stemmed from. “As far as I know, they haven't been fully implemented with playable 3D movement in a game before.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I thought, ‘Since I can't play right now, why not make it myself?’</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The India-based indie game developer previously worked with Space Engineers studio Keen Software House before resigning <a href="https://wickedcube.itch.io/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to focus on his own project</a> in January 2024. He's been looking for contract positions and prototyping mechanics since then, so character work usually isn’t a priority. Creating a controllable version of Doctor Octopus in Unity required clearing a few hurdles, but it’s this exact challenge that helped WickedCube pursue the idea. The rest of the push came from an unlikely source: the recent PSN outage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It all started when PSN was down and I couldn’t play Marvel Rivals,” WickedCube explains. “While browsing Twitter, I came across some <a href="https://x.com/LordDepis/status/1883639630404407479" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>really cool Doc Ock fan art</u></a>. I thought, ‘Since I can't play right now, why not make it myself?’”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Doctor Octopus in the style of Marvel Rivals<br>.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MarvelRivals?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#MarvelRivals</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MarvelRivalsfanart?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#MarvelRivalsfanart</a> <a href="https://t.co/d3XHXMZsCL" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/d3XHXMZsCL</a></p>— CoryHarris.jpg (@LordDepis) <a href="https://twitter.com/LordDepis/status/1883639630404407479?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 26, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The result has seen thousands of players appreciating his ideas for Doc Ock, with some calling for NetEase to bring him onto the team. WickedCube calls the reception “incredibly rewarding,” adding that he’d be more than happy to see the Marvel Rivals studio lift some of his ideas should Doc Ock officially make his way into the game. Although he has no plans to polish the design further, the goal is to release a playable version of the character in the near future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“After seeing the response on Reddit, I want to share this and future concepts as a YouTube tutorial series,” WickedCube added. “I also plan to open-source the code on GitHub and make the playable versions available on Itch.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">NetEase will charge forward with its Marvel Rivals post-launch plans with two new official characters this Friday: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-sets-february-release-date-for-the-thing-and-human-torch">the Human Torch and The Thing</a>. Both heroes follow their Fantastic Four teammates, Mister Fantastic and the Invisible Woman, who launched early last month. It’s a shockingly strong start that outpaces competitors in its field, but comic book fans can’t help but look to Marvel’s catalog of heroes and villains as a universe with limitless potential.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">WickedCube’s post says his viral project was born out of the community’s desire to see more Vanguard, or tank-like characters, added to its roster. Not even the strongest rumor has suggested we’ll see Otto show up in-game any time soon, but the Doc Ock designer says he’s already cooking up more ideas for other potential heroes. Two names on his mind are X-Men mainstays Nightcrawler and Professor Xavier.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The character roster at launch is large enough to keep the game enjoyable for a long time, and the rate at which they’ve promised to release new characters is mind-blowing,” he added. “The designers clearly understand how to make a fun game, which, in my opinion, is the hardest thing to get right.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Marvel Rivals is primed to deliver its Season 1 mid-season update tomorrow, February 21. In addition to those aforementioned character releases, the content update will add balance changes, gameplay tweaks, and more.

			<p>Earlier this year, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/koei-tecmo">Koei</a> and developer <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/omega-force">Omega Force</a> achieved a landmark success with their reboot of the long-running <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/dynasty-warriors">Dynasty Warriors</a> franchise. As we concluded in our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/13/dynasty-warriors-origins-review-the-best-musuo-game-ever/">Dynasty Warriors: Origins review</a>, there’s no going back for the series now that it has established a strong new gameplay formula – then along comes Warriors: Abyss.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warriors: Abyss - Launch Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jn238X1UXoU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This wonderfully experimental spin on the Musou template offers up a Roguelite remix that apes the action-packed lunacy of <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/vampire-survivors">Vampire Survivors</a>. From a top-down perspective, you’ll descend into an underworld overrun by demonic nasties, playing as one of the many characters from the combined Dynasty Warriors and <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/samurai-warriors">Samurai Warriors</a> rosters.</p>


<p>Despite the shift in perspective, Warriors: Abyss will feel instantly familiar to Koei fans. Each of the 100+ heroes have had their own unique movesets lifted from past games in the Warriors series to give them all a distinct flavour. You’ll be met with little resistance against the waves of rank and file grunts who may occasionally try and get a swing in as you clobber them by the dozen. However, as you advance between waves, these enemies will be flanked by an increasingly diverse menagerie of monsters – each run of Warriors: Abyss will inevitably climax with hundreds of foes writhing on-screen beneath a chaotic purple lattice of telegraphed attack indicators.</p>
<p>To help cleave through the madness, players have plenty of loadout options at their disposal. Between phases (in which you’re usually required to KO a set number of enemies or complete a specific mission) you’ll have the option to recruit other heroes into your Formation, each offering stat bonuses and abilities. For your first few runs you’ll likely ignore the finer details of these mechanics, but you’ll quickly find there’s plenty of options to tweak your playstyle, collecting specific heroes to find synergies and unlock powerful upgrades whether that’s an increased attack range/speed or imbuing your weapon with one of several element types.</p>


<p>Recruited heroes can also be assigned to the six attack combos each character comes equipped with. Once you pull off a combo you can hit the special attack button again to summon that designated hero and have them pull off their own flashy move. Naturally, Warriors Abyss also brings back Musou attacks with an additional gauge allowing you to assemble the heroes in your formation and have them wreak havoc on-screen until it depletes.</p>
<p>At its peak, Warriors Abyss conjures a whirlwind of total destruction that can barely be contained from both a gameplay and technical perspective with the PS5 version occasionally dropping frames. Even for seasoned Musou fans whose virtual body counts climb into the millions, this chaotic display will prove overwhelming yet it’s true to the genre. To help master the chaos, you can spend the in-game currency you acquire to unlock and upgrade heroes between each run while also tracking down each of their unique weapons while exploring the underworld.</p>

<p>Your end goal is to make it as far as you can through Gouma’s gauntlet, eventually going toe-to-toe with the game’s main antagonist. Instead of chucking ending waves of enemies in your path, you’ll advance between stages with each area/biome culminating in a boss fight. These are pretty damn tough with punishing attacks that will force you to think carefully, dodging with precise timing and planning your hero summons.</p>
<p>Due to the near unreadable number of effects popping off on-screen at any one time, visual artistry isn’t a primary focus. Each of the Warriors character models are excellently designed (with plenty of costume DLC up for grabs) yet you see very little of them amidst the swarm of demons and a never-ending onslaught of screen-filling attack animations. There’s very little appealing about the enemy or environment designs and though some fans will take an interest in the narrative that weaves together playthroughs, I opted to skip most of the dialogue.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dying-light-2%E2%80%99s-tower-raid-mode-is-now-permanently-in-the-game.1114101/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-2-tower-raid-mode-permanent-feature/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Dying Light 2: Stay Human has a new permanent game mode, but it’s one you’ve probably played before. The team at Techland has pushed ‘Tower Raid’ into the game permanently, bolstering the intense roguelite mode with fresh challenges and mechanics.</p>



<p>As a live-service title, Dying Light 2 is regularly updated with new content drops, bounties, limited-time events, and skin packs. Out of all those deliverables, Tower Raid is one of the most positively received add-ons since the game emerged in 2022, and fans are happy to see it made into a permanent fixture in the open-world, zombie-slaying title.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-fail-get-tougher-repeat">‘Fail, Get Tougher, Repeat’</h2>



<p>Tower Raid is what it sounds like. Players – either solo or with friends – are tasked with ascending a tower packed with enemies that get increasingly difficult to defeat the higher you go. There are three difficulty tiers, with the topmost level, ‘Elite’, being nothing short of punishing – but it yields incredible rewards.</p>



<p>Players are invited to pick from four classes, each boasting a unique skill set and loadout. The inherent roguelite nature of the mode means that you can mix and match your playstyles to see what works best, as every time you enter the tower, you’ll never really know what to expect.</p>



<p>To welcome the permanent mode, Techland has added new rewards to the ‘Raid Hub’, fronted by a trader called Sola. If you play Tower Raid, you can unlock:</p>



<ul>
<li>Office Day Outfit</li>



<li>Kuai Dagger</li>



<li>Silenced Pistol</li>
</ul>



<p>Amongst other things, of course.</p>



<p>It doesn’t end here, though. Techland has stressed that, after a few weeks on the market, a survey will be posted for players to give their feedback about the upgraded Tower Raid mode. That means that things could get even better.</p>



<p>Recently, Techland laid out a roadmap of content in celebration of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/techland-dying-light-next-era-10th-anniversary/">10th anniversary of Dying Light</a>. I caught up with the team to learn about what happened to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-happened-dying-light-my-apocalypse-edition/">$386,000 collector’s edition</a>, and at Gamescom, I <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/interview-roger-craig-smith-dying-light/">spoke to Roger Craig Smith</a> about the upcoming release of Dying Light: The Beast.</p>



<p>Are you still playing Dying Light 2: Stay Human? Let us know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <p>
The Pokémon Company's annual Pokémon Presents broadcast has now been confirmed to air next week, on Thursday 27th February at 2pm UK time. That's 6am Pacific Time, or 9am Eastern.
</p>
<p>
Every year, Pokémon holds a presentation on this date to mark the anniversary of the original Pokémon Red and Green titles launching in Japan for Game Boy. This year is no different. 
</p>
<p>
So, what do we expect to see?

<p>
This year's biggest Pokémon launch will undoubtedly be Pokémon Legends Z-A, which was announced last year in a brief teaser that curiously did not show any gameplay. The title is a Switch 1 game, but will we see a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a> version confirmed - or the game running on Nintendo's newly-announced hardware?
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-everything-we-know">Legends Z-A is set to take players back to the Kalos region</a>, the setting of Pokémon X and Y, and looks like it will once again feature the popular Mega Evolution mechanic.
</p>
<p>
As another Legends game, it will likely have more of an action-RPG focus, similar to the previous Pokémon Legends Arceus. But where that game was set in the distant past, Z-A appears to be set in the modern day or near future.
</p>
<p>
Alongside a big focus on Z-A, Presents will likely feature a look at the franchise's other various ongoing games - such as Pokémon Unite, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a>.
</p>
<p>
This week, it was reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-developer-close-to-selling-games-for-35bn-to-saudi-owned-monopoly-go-maker-report">Pokémon Go is in talks to be sold to the Saudi-backed Savvy Games Group</a>, in a deal worth  $3.5bn. But don't expect to hear an update on that next week.
</p>
<p>
As ever, Eurogamer will be covering all the announcements from Pokémon Presents - join us then for more.

            <p>The second major update for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a> is now available, adding a new Olympian: the god of war.</p>
<p>Appropriately named the Warsong Update, Ares has now been added (but redesigned) along with all of his boons, which look to be similar to those in the first game.</p>
<p>Also added is The Final Confrontation, with a new discovery to make atop Mount Olympus. Say no more.</p>

<figcaption>Hades II - The Warsong Update Trailer<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrpGYTlCjNQ" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>The update also includes a new animal familiar to aid in battle, new arcana arts, new enemies, new music, and new ways to relax in the Crossroads, all as per the trailer above.</p>
<p>And of course, the story expands with new events too.</p>
<p>Over on Steam, developer Supergiant Games has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/503942841152569404">detailed all the additions</a> - along with quality of life tweaks and bug fixes, there are reworked boons and blessings, new upgrades and keepsakes, changes to level designs and more.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-gets-new-region-weapon-familiars-and-more-in-first-major-early-access-update">first major update for Hades 2</a> (the Olympic Update) was back in October last year, which the Warsong Update follows along with other smaller patches.</p>
<p>The game remains in early access for now and, as noted in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350?emclan=103582791472836561&amp;emgid=503942841152569349">separate Steam blog</a>, a third major update is planned. There's still no release date for version 1.0.</p>
<p>"We're excited to have launched this Major Update, since it includes numerous ideas we've been eager to implement since we started working on Hades 2 years ago!" the post reads.</p>
<p>"But we're not finished yet, and have already made plans for our third Major Update, which we intend to deliver some months from now. Note it's still too early to share our plans beyond that, including when our v1.0 launch will be."</p>
<p>Last year creative director Greg Kasavin said the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-in-early-access-at-least-through-the-end-of-this-year-says-creative-director">game would be in early access "at least through the end of this year"</a>. It seems that's set to extend for a while yet.</p>
<p>"Supergiant's first ever sequel may feel very comfortable and familiar, but Hades' best weapon remains the power of surprise," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-early-access-review">Hades 2 early access review</a>. Clearly there are still plenty more surprises to come.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/gamescom-asia-joins-forces-thailand-game-show/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Gamescom team has revealed a monumental partnership between Gamescom Asia and the Thailand Game Show, the fruits of which will be witnessed later this year. Gamescom is the leading name in gaming events and over the last four years, the Asian representation of that label has gone from strength to strength.</p>



<p>Now, Gamescom Asia will be relocated from Singapore to Bangkok, linking up with the Thailand Game Show to welcome more visitors than ever before.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-historic-collaboration">‘Historic Collaboration’</h2>



<p>In a press release published by the Gamescom PR team, the new partnership was celebrated:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This partnership is a game-changer for the region’s games industry. gamescom asia’s success has been built on a solid foundation in Singapore, where it has flourished since its inception in 2021, positioning Southeast Asia as a hub for gaming innovation. </p>



<p>By joining forces with Thailand Game Show, we are unlocking unprecedented opportunities to connect global video game players with one of the world’s most vibrant and passionate gaming communities. With its rich culture and expanding gaming ecosystem, Bangkok is the ideal stage for this exciting next chapter.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The President of Thailand’s Digital Economy Promotion Agency echoed that sentiment:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The collaboration between gamescom asia and Thailand Game Show marks a significant milestone for Thailand’s growing role in the global gaming industry. This partnership strengthens our commitment to advancing digital innovation and creativity. </p>



<p>DEPA and the local gaming industry are excited to be part of this unified event, creating new opportunities for global collaboration, investment, and talent development, and reinforcing Thailand’s position as a leading destination in the digital entertainment sector.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The 2024 edition of Gamescom Asia attracted more than 40,000 attendees from 78 countries, the press release explained. It’s not as gargantuan as the core version of Gamescom, which takes place annually in Cologne, Germany, but it’s growing – and that’s all that matters.</p>



<p>This kind of ‘combination activity’ isn’t a new concept. Last year in the United Kingdom, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/egx-mcm-comic-con-same-event/">MCM and EGX</a>, two of the biggest pop culture and gaming events in the nation, joined forces to produce one mega event.</p>

			<p>Netflix has recently laid off a number of employees at Oxenfree developer Night School Studio. The news was <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/netflix-has-laid-off-staff-at-oxenfree-developer-night-school-studio" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> by website Game Developer, with Netflix declining to comment on the story. Reportedly, the studio's upcoming projects lineup hasn't been impacted, so it might be a relatively small number. Still, it's yet another instance of game industry layoffs. Just over the last handful of months, we've had to cover layoffs at <a href="https://wccftech.com/smite-developer-hi-rez-lays-off-employees-focusing-on-smite-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hi-Rez</a> (<a href="https://wccftech.com/hi-rez-studios-lays-off-developers-from-smite-team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">twice</a>, actually), <a href="https://wccftech.com/rocksteady-reportedly-hit-by-layoffs-following-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-flop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rocksteady</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-blizzard-lay-off-hundreds-of-california-workers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Activision Blizzard</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-shuts-down-firewalk-studios-maker-of-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sony</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tequila-works-cancels-game-and-lays-off-a-few-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tequila Works</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/riot-games-lays-off-more-staff-making-it-the-second-round-of-layoffs-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Riot Games</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wb-games-montreal-lays-off-99-staff-members-majority-were-subcontractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warner Bros.

<p>Netflix <a href="https://wccftech.com/night-school-studio-is-the-first-game-developer-purchased-by-netflix/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired</a> Night School Studio in September 2021 for an undisclosed sum to bolster its gaming output. Almost two years later, the California-based developer launched Oxenfree II: Lost Signals. On Wccftech, the game earned an 8 out of 10 score <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/oxenfree-2-lost-signals-familiar-yet-distant/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from reviewer Ule Lopez</a>:</p>
<p><em>Oxenfree 2 feels like it relies on its dialogue system a bit too much as its more exciting elements take a backseat. While the dialogue is still incredible, the appearance of these more unique sequences left me often asking where I would be able to find more of the unique time-altering puzzles and surreal visuals that also made it stand out over other games. The character writing is still as good as the first game, but it feels like more could have been done to make it stand above the first game.</em></p>
<p>Netflix made the news around three months ago because Mike Verdu, VP at GenAI for Netflix Games, <a href="https://wccftech.com/netflix-investing-in-generative-ai-for-games-after-closing-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talked</a> about a big push to use AI technologies:</p>
<p><em>I am working on driving a "once in a generation" inflection point for game development and player experiences using generative AI. This transformational technology will accelerate the velocity of development and unlock truly novel game experiences that will surprise, delight, and inspire players.</em></p>
<p><em>I am focused on a creator-first vision for AI, one that puts creative talent at the center, with AI being a catalyst and an accelerant. AI will enable big game teams to move much faster, and will also put an almost unimaginable collection of new capabilities in the hands of developers in smaller game teams.</em></p>
<p>The controversy was that Netflix had just <a href="https://wccftech.com/netflix-closes-down-aaa-game-studio-that-was-working-on-a-third-person-arpg-for-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closed down its only triple-A game studio</a>, which was working on a third-person action role-playing game for PC. This made it seem like the company was interested in 'replacing' workers with AI tech. Time will tell if that's truly the direction they are set on.</p>

And they would probably just ask themselves, why am I working all the time? I don’t do literally anything else.”</p><p>Making it harder for him to work, beyond the human need to sleep, is the fact that at age 15, MrBeast was diagnosed with Crohn’s Disease, he says. </p><p>“I just get sick all the time, like random rashes and things like that,” said the creator. “So it’s pretty, pretty brutal, to be honest, and then it randomly clears up sometimes and just makes you very sick, very tired.

Which, yeah, that’s less than I expected, though there are some really big numbers between 1 and 999,999. But while it’s clear that MrBeast has money and a lot of it, if you ask him about it, it seems like he doesn’t like being rich. </p><p>“It was like so much easier when you’re broke, if you don’t travel constantly,” said MrBeast. “Life is so easy when you just wake up in your own bed and work 15 hours compared with all this fucking bullshit where I’m like, ‘I don’t know the time zone I’m in, I don’t know what place on it’...some days I’m going to 10am, other days I’m going to 5pm.”</p><p>I’m not sure life is easier when you are poor. It really just sounds like maybe MrBeast needs to take a vacation and travel a bit less.</p><p>Speaking of money, the famous YouTuber says he lost <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mrbeast-amazon-prime-tv-show-100-million-youtube-1851186509?_gl=1*relckg*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MDAwMTMzMi40OTMuMS4xNzQwMDAzMjc5LjU0LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mrbeast-amazon-prime-tv-show-100-million-youtube-1851186509?_gl=1*relckg*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MDAwMTMzMi40OTMuMS4xNzQwMDAzMjc5LjU0LjAuMA..">“tens of millions of dollars”</a></span> producing his <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mrbeast-beast-games-amazon-prime-youtube-1851725771&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mrbeast-beast-games-amazon-prime-youtube-1851725771">reality game show with Amazon.</a></span> Yet, he has “no regrets” about doing it, adding: “I can’t let the YouTube community down—if I fail it is over, or no streaming platforms will ever touch a creator again.”</p><p>Finally, I leave you with a statistic that seems wild and hard to believe, however also totally within the realm of possibility.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/duet-night-abyss-preview-all-the-boobs-in-the-world-cant-hide-its-shallow-grind<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Duet Night Abyss is a fantasy multiplayer game that’s hotly anticipated in the gacha gaming community. It’s all about cool-looking combat, grinding, and oh yeah – boobs. And based on what I’ve played so far, the busty barmaids and endless slog for incrementally better gear aren’t likely to capture your attention for very long.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I played an early PC build of Duet Night Abyss ahead of its closed beta test, with the caveat that I wasn’t able to experience multiplayer functionality, so consider this preview to be more about Duet Night’s mechanics, world, and the grand narrative that underpins it all. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Your player character, a beautiful waif in bandages, awakens in a swirling snowfield. Mysterious voices speak to you. You are helpless and breathy. But out of the snow, someone reaches for you.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s Berry, a major character who’ll see you through the basics of movement in this world: most notably, the Helix Jump – a slick way of vaulting yourself through the air. There’s no cooldown on that jump, and you’ll find quickly that it’s a fun and efficient way of getting around – and powerful in combat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once separated from Berry, you’ll really begin to come into your own – both gameplay-wise and narratively speaking. Broke in a strange new city run by the ominously named Empire, you must become a “Phoxhunter,” picking up “commissions” at a rough-and-tumble tavern owned by the world’s least believable barmaaid. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But wait. That’s only half the story. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Double Take</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a second protagonist, a male version who looks strikingly similar to the girl you just met. The idea is that these two show different sides of the same narrative. In the city, the girl sees townsfolk experiencing discrimination, violence, and cruelty at the hands of the Empire. Meanwhile, the boy is a part of the Empire, commanding the same brutish soldiers who are now wounded and pitiful after battle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Much has been made of these dual protagonists and plotlines, but frankly, I don’t think they’re as revolutionary as the developer seems to think they are. There were no surprises, no events in one character’s story that might make the other’s revelatory. Of course, this is early on, and I hope to be proven wrong as more story content becomes available.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyway, solid story or not, this game’s art is beautiful. I loved the linework, the colours, the fluid animation. I tend to approach the anime aesthetic with skepticism, so trust that my praise says something about how polished and breathtaking the aesthetic was. Unfortunately, I began to feel less enthusiastic the boobier Duet Night became (more on that later).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The English voiceover is absolutely fantastic, one of Duet Night’s highlights. As I progressed and met more characters, I found each one’s voice and dialogue distinct and full of individual personality. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once you’re through the initial story quests, you’ll be participating in a lot of combat. It’ll be familiar to anyone who has ever played any kind of hack-and-slash, but it’s fun for a while. All the shiny sword slashes and oversized guns look epic, especially paired with the Helix Jump ability.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Switching between melee and ranged weapons is seamless. And to really hone your killing skills, you can equip the ridiculously named Demon Wedges: equippable supplements to your weapons that bump up various stats. You can mix-and-match a few of these at any time, playing around with combinations to find synergies that could take your combat to the next level.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">The Daily Grind</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">I still have an unclear sense of Duet Night’s intended monetization model. There are hints, of course, such as multiple currencies – I was overwhelmed trying to understand where to obtain each one, and what each one could buy. Though there didn’t yet appear to be an interface to spend IRL money, you can bet that’s coming.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m not going to mince words: Duet Night Abyss is a grindfest. Take the “Retrace” system, which is a dice roll to win a bunch of random new weapons to pick from. It’s literally “click a button and see what you get.” Your rewards may be epic, but are mostly not. Provided you have enough of the “Hourglass” currency, you can just hammer that Retrace button like a slot machine. It’s one of the least engaging things I have ever seen in my time as a gamer.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I’m not going to mince words: Duet Night Abyss is a grindfest.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">You can also pick up “commissions” from the aforementioned tavern, which are instances where you’ll do most of your flashy combat. They may have different themes (a church overgrown with grass, for example, or a mine), but they all follow the same formula: a bunch of rooms that look exactly the same, where you can defeat increasingly difficult – and boring – waves of monsters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can grind for weapons to craft into better weapons. Grind for coins to buy cosmetic items, like a chicken for your head. Grind to obtain new playable avatars (most of them busty women). Or you can enter “Sandrealm Meditation,” which is a euphemism for practicing your combat skills via – you guessed it – grinding.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But all the flashy abilities, gear, and flower hats you’re grinding for mean nothing without an audience to impress.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, I did not experience any of Duet Night's social aspects. The instances can match you up with three other players – friends or randoms – but given that I was playing before the closed beta began, there was no one for me to match up with. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps Duet Night will feel like less of a grind as it opens up to players and a community grows, though I’m not sure at this stage what that would look like.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Alone in a Crowd</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">I recognize that grindy games do have an audience, but as a game reviewer, I feel icky recommending them when there are so many more engaging, delightful, and dare I say interactive games out there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the beginning, I thought I might like Duet Night Abyss. In those first moments I felt like I was watching a beautifully animated film, and intrigued where the waif’s story might lead me – even if I did have to grind my way there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But then the, uh, curvaceous women began appearing. This isn’t uncommon in anime – but it immediately narrows the audience down to one of… specific tastes. I personally felt isolated: as slick as Duet Night Abyss was, I could never fully appreciate the better parts of it, such as the art or cute side quests, knowing that this game wasn’t looking for players like me.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s an audience out there for Duet Night Abyss. But it isn’t me. Maybe it’ll be you.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Strengthen the Main Character’s Abilities with Power-Up Items Called “Artifacts”</strong></p><p>By positioning the main character and supporting characters within a Magic Circle, the supporting characters’ power, known as “<a title="Series > Mana [17 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/mana">Mana</a>,” flows toward the main character. The main character’s abilities are enhanced by placing and activating magical items called “Artifacts,” which provide various enhancement effects on the spaces where Mana flows.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><em>—Use Artifacts to power-up the main character.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_001.jpg"></a></figure><p><em>—By placing the Artifact “Stone Guard” on green space, the main character’s DEF will increase.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_002.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_003.jpg"></a></figure><p>Among the Artifacts are “Anywhere Artifacts,” which can be placed on any space, regardless of its type. They are useful as they can be conveniently placed anywhere.</p><p><em>—“Mana Plus” is a useful Artifact that can be placed on any space, regardless of type. It restores Mana when your Mana reaches zero.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_004.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Some Spaces Activate an Effect Even without Placing an Artifact</strong></p><p>Some spaces in a Magic Circle activate effects by simply having Mana following through them. These are called “Fixed Spaces.”</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_005.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_006.jpg"></a></figure><p>Fixed Spaces have various effects, such as always reviving dead supporting characters when passing through a dungeon gate, or switching the equipped weapon to the one placed on a space while active.</p><p><strong>Customize Skills and Magic with Magic Circles</strong></p><p>Magic Circles can also enhance the skills and magic assigned to the main character.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_007.jpg"></a></figure><p>By placing an Artifact on a space marked “Skill Magic 1” in a Magic Circle, you can enhance the skill or magic assigned to that slot.</p><p>Not only can you expand the range and increase the power of your skills, you can also increase their level.</p><p><em>—Double a skill’s level to increase its power and expand its range!</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_008.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_009.jpg"></a></figure><p>High-level skills and magic consume a lot of SP, so they can’t be used frequently. In such cases, you can use Artifacts to “lower their level” or “increase their power,” combining them to create various effects. Explore and find the combination that best suits your gameplay style and the dungeon you’re trying to clear.</p><p><strong>“Titles” Further Enhance Artifacts</strong></p><p>Some Artifacts have special effects called “Titles.” These Titles enhance Artifacts further.</p><p><em>—The effects of Titles can be checked by pressing the “<a title="Platforms > Switch [16,675 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a>” button on Artifacts list.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_010.jpg"></a></figure><p>One notable Title is “Union.” When you place Artifacts with the same “Union” Title next to each other, they will “unite” and share each other’s effects. For example, if you place an Artifact that increases ATK by 1 next to one that increases DEF by 1, both ATK and DEF will increase by 2. “Union” is a powerful Title, as its effects stack with the number of connected “Union” Titles.</p><p><em>—The enhancement effects of “Union” Artifacts can be easily checked.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_011.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Many New Artifacts Appear, Including “Wide,” “Twin,” and “Zero”</strong></p><p>“Wide” is a powerful Artifact that doubles the effects of all spaces beyond where it is placed. If “Wide” is placed on a skill or magic space, it will turn the skill or magic into a wide-range (wide) version.</p><p><em>—Here is a look at the same magic before and after the placement of a “Wide” Artifact. After placement, the wall of flames effect has a wider range.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_012.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_013.jpg"></a></figure><p>“Twin” transforms into the Artifact placed on the next space, granting you twice the power. Additionally, Mana consumption is halved, allowing you to double the strength of powerful Artifacts at half the cost.</p><p><em>—After the placement of a “Twin” artifact next to an Artifact that requires 11 Mana and increases ATK by 3, Mana cost decreases to 5 while ATK now increases by 6.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_014.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_015.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_016.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_017.jpg"></a></figure><p>“Zero” is an Artifact that enables the Artifact placed on the next space to activate with zero Mana. If the next space is a Fixed Space, its effect will be nullified.</p><p><em>—With “Zero,” you can use Artifacts that consume a lot of Mana or activate Fixed Spaces with debuff effects without having to worry about the drawbacks.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_018.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_019.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>■ Enhancement 2. Power-Up By Placing Supporting Characters in Your <a title="Genres > Party [86 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/party">Party</a>! They Will Shoulder the Main Character’s Burden!</strong></p><p>Supporting characters placed in a Magic Circle act as a shield for the main character, taking damage in their place when attacked. The main character will not take any damage unless the HP of all supporting characters reaches zero.</p><p><em>—Simply place three supporting characters to boost your HP by three characters’ worth and significantly power you up!</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_020.jpg"></a></figure><p>However, if a supporting character’s HP drops to zero and they are defeated, the Artifact buffs provided by that supporting character will disappear, causing the main character to lose power. To prevent this, consider placing supporting characters with high HP, or position supporting characters with low HP inside a Magic Circle where they are less likely to be attacked.</p><p><em>—When all the supporting characters’ HP reaches zero, the main character can be directly attacked.

            <p>
Sony has responded to former <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> and Marathon reboot director Christopher Barrett's $200m USD wrongful dismissal lawsuit, detailing Barrett's alleged 'disturbing communications' with female subordinates - including "sexually charged games of 'Truth or Dare'".
</p>
<p>
Barrett's departure from Bungie was first reported last March, amid <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-marathon-reboot-gets-new-director-as-part-of-creative-leadership-shakeup">word of a leadership shakeup</a> at the studio. However, it was later claimed Barrett was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-former-marathon-reboot-director-chris-barrett-reportedly-ousted-following-inappropriate-behaviour">fired from his role following an internal investigation</a> into accusation of inappropriate behaviour filed by "at least eight" female employees. Things took further turn in December, when Barrett <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-marathon-reboot-director-sues-sony-and-bungie-for-200m-claiming-wrongful-dismissal">filed a lawsuit against Bungie and Sony</a>, claiming the companies had "deliberately destroyed [his] reputation by falsely, and publicly, insinuating...he had engaged in sexual misconduct."
</p>
<p>
Barrett's list of accusations was long, but core to his argument was the claim his firing was a "premeditated scheme" concocted so Bungie and Sony could avoid paying him "nearly $50m... owed under his employment agreement". He additionally claimed he "did not do anything remotely resembling gross misconduct or 'Cause' as defined in the Retention Agreements... and there could not have been any credible allegation he did because [he] had a spotless twenty-five year track record at Bungie."
</p>
<p>
And now (via <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/sony-bungie-christopher-barrett-lawsuit-response">Game File's Stephen Totilo</a>), Sony has <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/830250465/Christopher-Barrett-v-Sony-Interactive-Entertainment-LLC-and-Bungie-Inc-2024-1285-No-97653544-97653546-Del-Ch-Feb-12-2025-1">filed its first substantive response</a>, denying Barret's claims and detailing the events allegedly leading to his dismissal. "Multiple female, subordinate employees individually reported to Human Resources that Barrett engaged in inappropriate behaviour and disturbing written and verbal communications," it wrote, "which made them uncomfortable and fearful of retaliation if they failed to engage or reported Barrett."
</p>
<p>
"The investigation revealed that Barrett's misconduct with each employee was consistent: he targeted a lower-level, female employee he wasn't working with directly, initially engaged in friendly conversation, and progressively pushed boundaries with the employee by making subtle references to her physical appearance or expressing his interest romantically.
</p>
<p>
"Barrett attempted to create an unprofessional level of intimacy with his victims," Sony continued in its court submission. "He requested to follow personal Instagram accounts and would express anger to the women if they failed to respond to his messages. He would bring up inappropriate topics like their body, their relationships, his marriage, or his desire to date them. He would demand that they participate in sexually charged games of 'Truth or Dare' and 'Ask Me Anything'. He texted them at all hours of the day and night. He offered to buy them gifts. He often referenced his wealth and his ability to advance their careers."
</p>
<p>
Sony's filing also includes several examples of Barrett's alleged misconduct, including an incident where it's claimed he FaceTimed one female employee late at night while drunk despite requests to "recognise 'boundaries'", eventually moving to his bedroom and telling her, "I can't believe I am lying in bed while talking to [VICTIM 1]".
</p>
<p>
Barrett also allegedly contacted a second employee via Instagram direct message, telling her, "You are the holy grail. I hope you find a person worthy of your attention." After the employee responded saying she had a boyfriend who treated her very well, Barrett is said to have told her, "He better[.] Cuz I would hit on you if he wasn't." It's claimed he later made further contact, writing, "You want to be worshipped, I think? Why are you against that actually happening?".
</p>
<p>
Other incidents detailed in Sony's filing includes a "virtual game of 'Truth or Dare' initiated by Barrett", and a Microsoft Teams exchange in which he allegedly asked a female member of staff, "Are you still in PJs? [Is] it like a button down top and bottoms? Sweat pants? Lulu lemons?".
</p>
<p>
Sony adds, "Barrett’s predatory behaviour caused victims to seek guidance from other Bungie employees on how to manage Barrett’s constant boundary-pushing given that he was a long-standing, senior member of the company. Multiple victims reported to Human Resources during the investigation that they were afraid for their jobs during these encounters."
</p>
<p>
In response, Barrett's lawyers told Game File, "Sony continues to disingenuously cherry pick text messages and alleged conversations and make unsupported and conclusory statements to defame Christopher and justify terminating him to avoid paying him what he was owed under his employment agreements. It is telling that Sony does not include the full text messages as exhibits, or the full content of these conversations, and nothing in Sony’s response provides a legitimate legal or factual basis to terminate Christopher for cause.
</p>
<p>
"Christopher is confident that when all the evidence is presented, it will be clear that Sony engaged in a scheme to strip him of his role and the equity awards he earned for his 25 years of loyal service to the company."
</p>
<p>
As well as denying inappropriate behaviour during his time at Bungie, Barrett's original filing argued his former employers' actions had "irreparably harmed [him] financially, physically, and emotionally". As such, he is seeking $200m in damages - including $46K (plus interest) owed under his employment terms - and is requesting to be reinstated as game director on Marathon.

An old magazine with a single screenshot of a cancelled project is video game preservation. A dusty Sega Mega Drive sitting in storage alongside a copy of <em>Sonic 2</em> and <em>Jungle Strike</em> is video game preservation. A dodgy arcade cabinet with 1000 classic arcade games on it, all of them running their original code via emulation, is video game preservation.</p><p>A Frankenstein's monster of AI-generated slop, guessing and filling in holes to try to run a game without its "original engine", is <em>not </em>games preservation, and I'm frankly astonished to see such an important figure in the video games industry go on record saying it is.</p><p>But it simply wouldn't be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c15vxDHJ2lU&amp;t=16s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an AI hype exercise</a> if it wasn't built entirely on speculative horseshit and the vaguest of assertions, all in the service of trying to find <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/xbox-muse-generative-ai-developers-say-nobody-will-want-this/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">someone, <em>anyone </em>out there</a> beyond investors and tech company executives who will think any of this is worth what it's costing, both in dollar terms and its environmental impact.</p><p>If you're reading this and are interested in supporting actual video game preservation, <a href="https://gamehistory.org/donate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">please donate to the Video Game History Foundation</a>. </p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/you-are-error-podcast-twitch-stream-big-book"><h3>Contrary To Popular Belief, Streaming On Twitch Is Work</h3></a><p>"Streaming is more enjoyable in some ways, but work is work no matter what the job is that you’re doing"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/humane-ai-sad-trombone"><h3>How’s That AI Future Looking?</h3></a><p>The Humane AI pin died on the way back to its home planet</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Sony’s lawyers say that these messages show a “pattern of misconduct.” The document was filed last week, according to <em>Game File. </em></p><p>In one message  Barrett asks a female Bungie employee, “Are you still in PJs?” and “[I]s it like a button down top and bottoms? Sweatpants? Lulu lemons?”</p><p>In another message, Barrett called a woman the “Holy Grail” and added:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>I’m not hitting on you. I hope it doesn’t feel like that. I’m married. But I can be honest. You are the .000001 and better be treated like that forever.</p></blockquote><p>The woman replied that her boyfriend treats her “very well” and the former Bungie director replied: “He better cuz I would hit on you if he wasn’t.”</p><p>A different woman working at Bungie claims Barrett called her while drunk late at night and spent hours with her on FaceTime, despite the female employee asking him to respect her boundaries. At one point he allegedly took his phone into his bedroom and said, “I can’t believe I am lying in bed talking to [VICTIM 1].” She abruptly hung up. </p><p>Barrett’s lawyer sent this statement over to <em>Game File: </em></p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Sony continues to disingenuously cherry pick text messages and alleged conversations and make unsupported and conclusory statements to defame Christopher and justify terminating him to avoid paying him what he was owed under his employment agreements. It is telling that Sony does not include the full text messages as exhibits, or the full content of these conversations, and nothing in Sony’s response provides a legitimate legal or factual basis to terminate Christopher for cause.</p></blockquote><p>“Christopher is confident that when all the evidence is presented, it will be clear that Sony engaged in a scheme to strip him of his role and the equity awards he earned for his 25 years of loyal service to the company,” said Barrett’s lawyer. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-and-pc-single-player-action-game-lost-soul-aside-the-big-interview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">After roughly a decade in development, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/lost-soul-aside">Lost Soul Aside</a> is finally scheduled for a launch. Originally the passion project of solo developer Yang Bing, Lost Soul Aside has grown to become a major Sony-published title under the company's 'China Hero Project,' with Bing now the founder and CEO of Shanghai-based studio Ultizero Games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With a release date of May 30 on PlayStation 5 and PC closing in, IGN had the opportunity to sit down with Yang Bing to discuss the long road to launch. So many years of development went into this single-player action game, escalating from a solo creator's vision to a trailer reveal at Sony's State of Play. Through it all the hype has grown, with some calling Lost Soul Aside an exciting mix of Final Fantasy characters and Devil May Cry combat — even from the moment Yang Bing's initial reveal video went viral in 2016.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the help of a translator, IGN asked Yang Bing about the early origins of Lost Soul Aside, its inspirations, what challenges the team has faced over the years, and much more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>It's been almost nine years since the first glimpse of Lost Soul Aside, on </strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5El-yYNUwU" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><strong>your YouTube channel</strong></u></a><strong>. How did you get started on this project, and how old were you at the time?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yang Bing:</strong> So I remember our first promotional video was released in 2016. I was born in 1990, so when the video was released, I was about 26 years old, so that was actually when the project started. I remember [Lost Soul Aside] probably started around, at the end of 2014, the beginning of 2015.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/19/lsa-1739990523109.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Expect massive set-piece battles in Lost Soul Aside. Image credit: Sony Interactive Entertainment.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>What were the original inspirations behind Lost Soul Aside? Has that ever shifted over the course of development?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yang Bing:</strong> So personally, I have loved playing games since I was young. And of course, back at that time, I had some personal favorite genres. Later on, [my] passion towards games wasn't changed, didn't change a lot. So I wanted to develop something that I really like. And then the tools and game engines were relatively mature. So that was the beginning of [Lost Soul Aside].</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The overall style and then, the inspiration, has not changed that much. From the beginning, the beginning of 2016 until now, about like nine years or 10 years, it continues to feature a blend of fantasy elements with some realistic visuals, characterized by this real-life aesthetic. So this style has not changed. The combat style has also consistently leaned towards high speed and flashy action. So this is something that we have been sticking to for all these years. During this development process, we, of course, continued to see some new and excellent works, which maybe we got some influence through, [on] our thought along the way. So from the beginning, this personal trailer gradually evolved into a more mature and well-run version, I should say.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>How did the Sony collaboration come around? Can you describe what that first meeting was like, and how the partnership has been since?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yang Bing:</strong> Well, actually, back to 2016, I had some contact [with a] PlayStation colleague. That was, for me, a turning point, which I think is quite remarkable. So when I released this promotional video, I got a message from a colleague at PlayStation, who said that they wanted to discuss the project in detail and explore a potential collaboration. Back at that time, I was still in South Korea, and I felt really grateful for this opportunity. At the end of 2016, I went back to China and then immediately, I went to PlayStation, Sony in Shanghai, visited them, and met with them in person. And so from that time, we kind of started our collaboration. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In recent years, the collaboration has been continuously deepening. Initially, it started with the Sony <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-investing-further-in-chinese-development-program-genshin-impact"><u>China Hero Project</u></a>. And then, later on, we kind of joined this collaboration with Sony, and then Sony officially announced that it's going to be published by PlayStation.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>What would you say makes Lost Soul Aside stand out from other games in its genre?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yang Bing:</strong> So the play will be very smooth, because we think that when the players play, they will likely be impressed by the overall operability of the game, including the combat experience and the interaction with the environment. It will be very smooth. And in order to achieve this kind of smooth feeling, we actually try our best, utmost, to ensure that the player's input receives immediate feedback. For example, all the weapons can be switched seamlessly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, the combat for this kind of skill combination can be combined seamlessly as well. All the skills can be canceled as well. We have spent a significant amount of time ensuring that everything flows as smoothly as possible. So, this is something that I think will impress players the most. And then, furthermore, the intent, our intention, is to shape the two main characters, the combination, Kaser and Arena. So we can provide players with the option like turning Arena into a weapon and other elements, to help Kaser fight in battle. [He] can provide some help during his journey. So I think that all these elements combining together can become a very outstanding and recognizable aspect for our game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Where did the concept for Arena, the transforming dragon companion Kazer has, come from?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yang Bing:</strong> So that kind of idea and thought actually started at a very, very, very early stage, even before this project started back to 2016. So, I remember I watched some YouTube video... there's a special effects creator who makes a segment featuring a crystal that can [transform] into various weapons, a shade, and many other things. Combined with my idea, I always thought about this idea, about a dragon [that] can transform, all kinds of shapes. Even before this game project has started, I had the idea about something like this.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other than this dragon, I was thinking that the protagonist has a companion, which at that time is somewhat similar to a dragon-like creature that can transform into a weapon, [to help] the character, assisting in the battle. So I always had this kind of idea from the beginning, I had the idea to incorporate [it] into this project. This idea that the protagonist has a dragon partner that can become a weapon, this idea actually, I had it since 2014.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/19/lsa-again-1739990287639.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">In Lost Soul Aside you play Kaser, who has help from a transforming dragon. Image credit: Sony Interactive Entertainment.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>What ideas and themes does Lost Soul Aside center on, that you want players to take away from this game?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yang Bing:</strong> So, the core theme primarily just revolves around Kaser, the protagonist, and his companion Arena, and they embark on various adventures together. And of course, during that process they face numerous challenges, including traps and a variety of formidable enemies. So the focus is on Kaser, who starts off as an ordinary individual, an ordinary person. And then after he meets Arena, and then later, they continuously establish some kind of relationship with other characters. So in this adventure, we want the players to experience the growth of the characters, transforming from ordinary people, or him from an ordinary person at the beginning, to a hero who can save the world by the end. Of course, saving the world was not his initial intention, but players can gradually and consciously embrace the idea of saving the world and defeating villains throughout the process.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>What's been the biggest challenge you've faced, working on this one game for so long?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yang Bing:</strong> So, well, it started from the idea, [my] personal idea, and then it's a promotion video, it's a conceptual idea. And then we have to accumulate experience and to enhance the development experience during all this process and all these years. So, I think this is very essential, for developing this kind of skill and type of project, this is one thing. And then the other challenge for me, I should say this because for me, I started from my personal ideas. I work. I used to work just by myself. And later on, I continuously [accumulated] knowledge on how to collaborate with other members as a team, with the help of Sony PlayStation, and now because we have established a team. So it requires everyone to come together to make the idea happen. So for me, this is constantly a learning process, and I need to overcome this challenge to make the project a successful one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>You're planning to launch day one for both PC and PS5? What was the reasoning behind targeting both for the launch, over just PlayStation?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yang Bing:</strong> So, launch for PC as well. I think it's a very new experience for players and it would be quite intriguing for them, I think. So this is the final stage, and the final decision was made during the communication process between me and Sony. So I feel that everyone cooperated in a very good manner and harmoniously throughout all the process.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>After working on Lost Soul Aside for so long, are you excited for whatever comes next for yourself and Ultizero Games?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yang Bing:</strong> Well, so at this stage, and then both my team, and myself, and the PlayStation team, we're continuously communicating with each other about the follow-up plans. I'm sorry, I cannot provide a very clear answer at this moment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>But you're excited to get Lost Soul Aside out there?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yang Bing:</strong> Yes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Lost Soul Aside launches on PS5 and PC on May 30, 2025.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Across from the boots, you can find another cave, which can be opened using fire, and the chest can be accessed after using Yatzli's disillusion spell, but this loot is unrelated to the treasure map.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4446716-avowed2025-02-1913-31-19large.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4446716" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4446716-avowed2025-02-1913-31-19large.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4446716"></a><figcaption>Loot the Wavebinder Boots to complete the quest.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4446716-avowed2025-02-1913-31-19large.jpeg"></figure><p>The Wavefinder Boots offer two passive bonuses.

            <p>
Almost two years after the acclaimed first season of HBO's live-action The Last of Us adaptation drew to a close, its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-we-know-about-the-last-of-us-season-2">long-awaited second season</a> finally has a release date - with episode one set to air in the US on Sunday, 13th April.
</p>
<p>
Season two of The Last of Us picks up some five years after the events of season one, and will at least partially cover <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s second game. Showrunner Craig Mazin <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-will-be-shorter-so-every-episode-feels-like-a-blockbuster">previously confirmed</a> the team would need more than one season to cover The Last of Us Part 2's narrative.
</p>
<p>
"The story that we're telling is much bigger than the story of season one," Mazin explained at the time. "There's just a lot more going on, it's a lot harder to produce but we want every episode to feel like its own blockbuster to be honest with you."

<p>
Season two of The Last of Us is set to span seven episodes - including one that's "quite big" in length - and will usher in a new cast of characters alongside returning favourites. Joel and Ellie are inevitably back (once again played by	Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey) and will this time be joined by the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-casts-kaitlyn-dever-as-abby-for-season-two">Kaitlyn Dever as Abby</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-tv-series-casts-beef-actor-young-mazino-as-jesse">Young Mazino as Jesse</a>, and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-adds-schitts-creek-star-catherine-ohara-to-its-cast">legendary Catherine O'Hara in an undisclosed guest role</a>.
</p>
<p>
The Last of Us' second season - part two of an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hbo-expects-the-last-of-us-to-run-for-four-seasons">expected four-season run</a> - airs on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/hbo-max">HBO Max</a> in the US beginning 13th April. There's no word on international airdates just yet, but Sky Atlantic's ongoing partnership with HBO suggests it'll continue to be the series' home in the UK - possibly again airing simultaneously with the US for those that like to remain unsullied by social media.
</p>
<p>
Season one of The Last of Us was a smash hit for HBO, garnering significant critical acclaim and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-averaging-32m-viewers-per-episode-in-us-most-watched-hbo-max-show-in-europe">averaging over 32m viewers</a> an episode in the US. And with eight Emmy nominations under its belt - including an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hbos-the-last-of-us-wins-eight-emmys-including-outstanding-guest-actor-for-nick-offermans-bill">outstanding guest actor gong for Nick Offerman</a> in the role of Bill - expectations are invariably high for season two.

            <title><![CDATA[Contrary To Popular Belief, Streaming On Twitch Is Work]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/you-are-error-podcast-twitch-stream-big-book</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/contrary-to-popular-belief-streaming-on-twitch-is-work.1113882/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/you-are-error-podcast-twitch-stream-big-book<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For the uninitiated, Twitch is a hotbed of potential misconceptions. Conversely, if you’re deep in it, Twitch is exceedingly fertile soil for <em>different </em>misconceptions. There’s a lot to misconcept, is what I’m saying, whether we’re talking regular people who think streamers are all millionaires with the world’s cushiest job or megafans who harbor <a href="https://aftermath.site/stream-big-book-excerpt-twitch-dream-face-reveal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the parasocial delusion</a> that they know their favorite streamer better than anybody else on Earth. This sounds like a job for <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/you-are-error" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">You Are Error</a>, Aftermath’s podcast about gaming’s greatest misconceptions.</p><p>Just a heads up that this episode is a little different. As those of you who follow me probably know – because I will not shut up about it – I wrote a book! It’s called <a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Stream-Big/Nathan-Grayson/9781982156763" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Stream Big: The Triumphs And Turmoils Of Twitch And The Stars Behind The Screen</em></a>, and it’s out now! You can find it online and wherever books are sold.</p><p>Each chapter is about a different streamer as a lens through which to view Twitch and the way platforms shape people and vice versa. Some of the featured creators, like Amouranth, Dream, and Hasan Piker, are big – household names in certain corners of the internet. Others are smaller and more susceptible to stumbling as the ground beneath them shifts, often as a result of platforms’ money-hungry whims. There are rises and falls, stories of unlikely success as well as uglier topics like abuse, harassment, grooming, stalking, and swatting. It’s a lot, but I’m very proud of how it turned out.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><em>Stream Big</em> was partially born of a desire to clear up misconceptions surrounding Twitch, livestreaming, and content creators, so a discussion of the book seemed like a natural fit for this show. Then I realized it was also a golden opportunity for one of my favorite things, <em>inter-Aftermath brand synergy</em>, which prompted a eureka moment: I could bring on other members of the staff to ask me questions about a subject I’ve spent the past more-than-half-a-decade investigating.&nbsp;</p><p>I decided on Riley and Luke, neither of whom consider themselves all that well-versed in Twitch or the world of content creation, because I figured they’d be best-equipped to present their own misconceptions in an honest and curious way. Also, Luke is a self-proclaimed Twitch hater, and haters always ask the best questions.</p><p>So if you’ve always wondered what the deal is with Twitch and the creators on it – why and how they’ve managed to amass so much influence within the world of video games, especially as the more traditional press fades into an, at best, secondary role – this is the episode for you. Also, fair warning, this conversation’s a little less structured than usual, but hopefully you’ll still enjoy it. I know I did.&nbsp;</p><p>You can listen to the show on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7w7V296dt8HCoDryWiofI4?si=f79446b5647c44bc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/you-are-error/id1782231480" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, please consider leaving a review so that thousands of people can form a parasocial relationship with You Are Error, and I can tell all of them to cut it out.</p><p>Here are excerpts from our conversation, deftly edited to make a coherent point much more quickly than we did during the actual conversation:</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> A thing that I was very intentional about with this book was doing all of the main interviews in person. Generally, I sought to conduct them in that person’s home, to actually go behind the scenes of their lives. Because a thing about Twitch that I think a lot of people believe – and hey, we’re back to misconceptions, the topic of this show – is that as a result of watching somebody on camera for eight or even just a few hours per day, they feel like they know everything about that person and, as an extension of that, everything about their career. What could they possibly be missing?</p><p>I wanted to reveal all of the other stuff that goes into somebody being a professional Twitch streamer, making enough money to have a family and a house and all of that stuff. And so I was like “It’s gotta be in person. I’ve gotta see this world with my own two eyes to be able to reveal the things that are actually happening here that don’t make it onto the broadcast.” Because if I was only talking to streamers on the phone, why not just write some articles? If I was gonna make a book out of this, it needed to go an extra step.</p><p>And it was really useful. For example, the chapter I wrote about Cohh Carnage is very much centered on his home. His ambition is to keep streaming for his whole life – for this to always be his job. And so he bought a house that has an elevator in it, specifically because he’s like “Yeah, when I’m 75, and I need to get downstairs, I can’t take the stairs. So I’ll take this elevator and show up like I do every day.” He was showing me all these parts of his house, too. He has a generator so that if the power goes out while he’s streaming, he won’t miss a beat. He and his family are in kind of an isolated area, so he had all these things installed to make sure his internet is of the highest possible quality. He’s all in on streaming, which makes sense; he’s been doing this for more than a decade already.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> That dovetails into a misconception I had because I’m old: I think I still think about it as like “You’re gonna be a Twitch streamer, and you’re gonna make millions of dollars, and that’s your job.” But I think your book points out that everybody doesn’t become a millionaire, and that’s not the end for a lot of people. What is “You can make millions playing video games” for 2025?</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> First off, there is this conception for a lot of people that Twitch streamers hit it big and get rich, when the reality is that well under one percent of streamers on Twitch even make minimum wage from streaming. Under 0.1% [as of 2021]. If you look at the top 10,000 streamers in terms of the money they’re making, you drop out of minimum wage before you hit the end of the list. So those are the people making a proper living on Twitch. That’s not many people out of the millions who stream.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>One of the main things that I wanted to express in this book and clear up as a misconception is that streaming is work. It is absolutely work. It is absolutely skilled labor. To maintain an audience – especially a big audience – just by being present and being yourself and talking for many hours per day, often with only chat to play off of, most people can’t do that. 99.9 percent of people can’t do that.&nbsp;</p><p>Even sometimes when we’re doing the Aftermath Hours stream, I’ll wonder how successful streamers keep their chats moving consistently on a daily basis. Because ours will just stop, and that’ll be it. When a chat loses momentum, it’s just kinda over. The fact that there are people who can, through sheer magnetism and ability to understand how this organism works, command that, it’s crazy to me. And it takes a lot of energy. There’s a reason why it’s the main thing these people do. They stream all day, manage their business by night, and they don’t have tremendously active lives outside of that.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s been this ongoing debate about whether or not streaming is a real job. Any time a streamer brings up this notion that they’re working, people are like “Yeah, but you’re not working in the service industry. You’re not doing construction. So you have no right to complain, and actually you should shut up forever.” </p><p>And it’s like, yeah, streaming is more enjoyable in some ways, but work is work no matter what the job is that you’re doing. And something I wanted the book to convey is that this is how capitalism is structured and how it seeks to divide us. We’re all in thrall to some larger force, and there are a lot of times where no matter what we’re doing, even if it seems appealing from the outside looking in, we’re not having a great time. We’re being pressured into overworking or burning out. And if we don’t, the whole thing falls apart.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/humane-ai-sad-trombone"><h3>How’s That AI Future Looking?</h3></a><p>The Humane AI pin died on the way back to its home planet</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
