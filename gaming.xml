              <p><span>No Games For Genocide, a collective of video game workers and union organizers, just announced a pledge to boycott Xbox. It calls on journalists, developers, streamers, and consumers to participate in the Palestinian-led BDS (boycott, divest, sanction) movement against Microsoft, which it’s accused of being complicit in Israeli war crimes. The tech giant recently cut off cloud services to an Israel Defense Forces intelligence unit that </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/06/microsoft-israeli-military-palestinian-phone-calls-cloud"><span>used them for mass surveillance of Palestinians</span></a><span>, but continues supplying them to the rest of the military.</span></p> <p><span>After years of acquisitions, Microsoft has become a gaming industry monolith, and avoiding it entirely may prove difficult for many, especially considering how dire the industry’s job crisis has been over the last few years. But </span><a href="https://nogamesforgenocide.com/"><span>No Games For Genocide</span></a><span> believes that the more people who take part in their movement’s proposed collective actions, the better chance the tech giant will take notice.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“The games industry in particular is at the intersection of entertainment and tech, and there are a lot of material links—when we’re looking at the tech aspect of hardware and software—there are a lot of connections between the games industry and the genocide that Israel is committing against the Palestinian people,” Sara Khan, a content creator, </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/gameassist"><span>cofounder of Game Assist</span></a><span>, and one of No Games For Genocide’s organizers, told me over a video call. “A few of us really wanted to organize around that, and organize people within the industry to say ‘we don’t want these ties’ and find a way to move past them.”&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Khan and IWGB Game Workers Union founder, Austin Kelmore, worked with other industry members to organize No Games For Genocide and determine where to focus its attention. The IWGB recently unionized Disco Elysium maker ZA/UM and has been fighting Rockstar Games over the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-union-rockstar-court-legal-developers-2000643478"><span>firing of 34 </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto 6</span></i><span> developers</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“Sort of serendipitously, the </span><a href="https://bdsmovement.net/microsoft"><span>Palestinian-led BDS movement</span></a><span> announced earlier this year that Xbox was going to be one of their new consumer targets,” Khan explained.” It made sense for it to be a priority campaign for us.”</span></p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:dkxt4ihy3a4lnunqu3g5xhyn/app.bsky.feed.post/3m6zcsllmoc2k" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreielby3tqjwmmgrdbdifrubaewzhyln7onkchbyj6t7wx4skskvbtm"> <p lang="en">SIGN OUR BOYCOTT XBOX PLEDGE: We are asking gamers, game workers, streamers &amp; journalists to join us in boycotting &amp; divesting from Xbox, to force Microsoft to end its complicity in the genocide of Palestinians.</p> <p>We’ve provided concrete actions everyone can take. Sign here: nogamesforgenocide.com</p> <p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:dkxt4ihy3a4lnunqu3g5xhyn?ref_src=embed">No Games For Genocide (@nogamesforgenocide.com)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:dkxt4ihy3a4lnunqu3g5xhyn/post/3m6zcsllmoc2k?ref_src=embed">2025-12-02T16:00:16.473Z</a></p></blockquote></div>  <p><span>No Games For Genocide has been working with the BDS National Committee to organize its campaign, which doesn’t just include signing the pledge, but offers a variety of other ways people can participate. </span></p>

 <p><span>It argues that consumers should avoid purchasing Microsoft or Xbox products, streamers shouldn’t play Xbox-published games on stream (or accept sponsorships from any Xbox game studio), journalists should “halt all coverage of Xbox-published games,” and developers should “demand [their] publisher not publish [their] game on the Xbox and Microsoft Stores,” among other things.</span></p>

 <p><span>Khan and their fellow organizers know these are some pretty tall orders. “People understandably are facing hurdles and have to consider the potential risks to their job security, their livelihood, which is completely understandable,” they said. “This is definitely more long-term work. How do we build that collective power? How do we make sure we’re protecting people’s jobs and accounting for that risk? […] As individuals, these things are scary; the risks that they carry are very real, so it’s important for us to build that collective power.”&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Perhaps with that risk in mind, many of the pledge’s signatories (which include the investigative YouTube channel People Make Games and worker-owned game studio Soft, Not Weak) are at the consumer level. “That’s immediately more accessible to folks,” Khan explained. “Hopefully, over time, we’d love to be able to get more studios or media outlets in a position to commit to the pledge.”</span></p> <p><span>The term “collective power” comes up a lot; the notion that organizing behind a common goal can create cover and/or protection for individuals who want to publicly take a political position that may result in retaliation. Khan likened it to union organizing and how workers feel empowered to stand up for fair wages and labor protections together as a unit: “How can we build towards you being in a position—not just you as an individual in your workplace, but hopefully multiple individuals, perhaps the entire workplace—to get you into a position where this would be doable? […] There is only so much we can do as individuals. There’s so much more we can do as a collective.”</span></p> <p><span>But didn’t Israel and Palestine just agree on a ceasefire? And what about the <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2025/09/25/update-on-ongoing-microsoft-review/">September 2025 “update” from Microsoft</a> that confirmed the company “ceased and disabled a set of services to a unit within the Israel Ministry of Defense?” When asked, Khan pointed back to the</span><a href="https://bdsmovement.net/news/microsoft-blocks-israel%E2%80%99s-use-its-technology-mass-surveillance-palestinians"><span> official BDS statement</span></a><span> after </span><span>Microsoft announced it was terminating Israel’s access to AI and Azure cloud tech</span><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>“</span><span>Microsoft remains a key technological pillar in Israel’s apartheid regime and its genocide in Gaza,” the BDS news post read. “It continues to equip the Israeli military, government, and prisons with the technology used to commit war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide.”</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Khan also emphasized that Microsoft and other video game companies are complicit in the genocide and imperialism taking place in the global south, and that No Games For Genocide’s goal is to help the industry rethink its role in these systems. (In 2023, a</span><a href="https://google.com/search?q=future+class+kotkau&amp;rlz=1C1RXQR_enUS1119US1119&amp;oq=future+class+kotkau&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIJCAEQIRgKGKABMgkIAhAhGAoYoAEyCQgDECEYChigATIJCAQQIRgKGKABMgkIBRAhGAoYoAEyBggGECEYCtIBCDQ1OTVqMGo0qAIAsAIB&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8"><span> petition created by the Game Awards Future Class calling on The Game Awards host Geoff Keighley to acknowledge the humanitarian crisis in Gaza</span></a><span> was reportedly ignored.)&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“The violence that Palestinian people have been experiencing is, plain and simple, settler colonial violence,” Khan said. “It’s an occupation, not just apartheid and not just genocide…so a ceasefire is not enough. We have to question the very existence of a settler colonial state, and we have to ask: What does decolonization look like for the Palestinian people?”</span></p> <p><span>No Games For Genocide’s long-term goals are aligned with BDS: “We keep mounting up the pressure until we see Microsoft divesting.”&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Kotaku has reached out to Xbox for comment.&nbsp;</span></p>

		<p>KING Art and Deep Silver have announced that a second closed alpha playtest for Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War IV will be taking place next week, with the confirmed dates being December 12th to December 15th. Those who took part in the November closed playtest will automatically be enrolled and emails will be sent on how to join. Those who did not take part in the Novmber closed playtest for Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War IV need to subscribe to the <a href="https://www.deepsilver.com/gb/games/dawn-of-war-iv#newsletter">Dawn of War IV newsletter</a> as information on how to take part will be sent through that.</p>

<p>In a statement the developers said, <em>“While this next round of testing will remain relatively small in size, we’re looking to bring on some new testers alongside our existing group of Closed Alpha Testers to provide feedback on the game as we work to shape the future of Dawn of War IV together. <wbr>As a reminder, these tests utilize an early Alpha Build of the game, with selected testers being required to sign an NDA, as well as agree not to share, discuss, screenshot, or record any part of the test. Additionally, if you don’t already have one, you’ll need to create a free Discord account if selected.”</em></p>
<p>Only a select few new closed alpha playtesters will be selected for this round of Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War IV playtest, as it will remain small in scale. Future playtests will expand the content available and allow more players to join. When it releases, the game will have over 70 campaign missions which can be played solo or in co-op, and the four factions will include the Space Marines, Orks, Necrons, and the Adeptus Mechanicus. A release date is yet to be confirmed.</p>

		<p>Tribute Games has released the first big patch for Marvel Cosmic Invasion, with the main focus by the team being removing bugs from the game. Some of the fixes in this patch for Marvel Cosmic Invasion include addressing an issue causing the game to crash when joining multiplayer sessions, an issue where Super Heroes stats would not upgrade, and also making sure Master Mold is no longer invulnerable. You can read the full list of fixes below.</p>
<p><iframe title="MARVEL Cosmic Invasion | Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/itVLfmX3Ts8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>



<p><b>Fixes!</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Heteropteron Blocker&nbsp;</b>– We’ve fixed an issue where having camera shake effects OFF would stop the cinematic from triggering, keeping Super Heroes trapped in Stage 13<wbr></li>
<li><b>Multiplayer Crashing</b>&nbsp;– We’ve fixed an issue where joining a multi-player game session and resetting story progress would trigger a crash<wbr></li>
<li><b>Enemy Cheating!&nbsp;</b>– We’ve fixed an issue where Master Mold would become invulnerable and non-targetable, which if anything was just rude<wbr></li>
<li><b>Venom Issues</b>&nbsp;– We’ve fixed issues where Venom could become frozen after being parried during Symbiote Pounce or immediately lose armor during Venom Bite<wbr></li>
<li><b>Upgrade Blocking&nbsp;</b>– We’ve fixed an issue that would mean Super Heroes’ stats did not upgrade after levelling up unless players returned to the main menu.<wbr></li>
<li><b>Enemy Superpowers</b>&nbsp;– We’ve fixed an issue where enemies would deal abnormally high damage on their first hit during a grab<wbr></li>
<li><b>Annihilus Invulnerability&nbsp;</b>– We’ve fixed an issue (and related issues) where Annihilus wouldn’t re-enter the staggered/vulnerable state and players couldn’t deal damage<wbr></li>
<li><b>Where’s Hela?!&nbsp;</b>– Fixed an issue where Hela could de-synchronise while teleporting<wbr></li>
<li><b>Annihilus Forever!&nbsp;</b>– We fixed an issue where Annihilus wouldn’t stop attacking after his shield breaks<wbr></li>
<li><b>Multiplayer Connections</b>&nbsp;– Fixed an issue which could cause problems when the host disconnects while Super Heroes are joining a lobby (this should now simply return you to the multiplayer menu)<wbr></li>
<li><b>Reigning in She-Hulk</b>&nbsp;– Option now added to have controller shake only for players controlling the character (meaning that She-Hulk’s controller vibration only happens for the player controlling her)<wbr></li>
<li><b>Cosmic Hold On What?!</b>&nbsp;– We’ve fixed an issue where Super Heroes would sometimes be swapped when respawning<wbr></li>
<li><b>At Least Credit Me&nbsp;</b>– The character who threw the enemy will now be considered the instigator when determining who gets credit for knocking down an assembly line bomb<wbr></li>
<li><b>Cosmic Stability</b>&nbsp;– We’ve deployed some additional protection for lobby stability when players reach Game Over in Arcade Mode<wbr></li>
<li><b>Interrogating the Vampire</b>&nbsp;– We’ve fixed an issue which prevented Super Heroes from using the Vampire modifier in Arcade Mode<wbr></li>
<li><b>Choose your character!</b>&nbsp;– We’ve fixed the issue with the characters’ order in character select for Steam Deck and Linux. That should fix the online desync/crashs between Steam Deck and other versions<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Smaller Fixes</b><wbr></p>

<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where intro music was used instead of main stage music where players joined later in Stage 2 (Genosha)<wbr></li>

<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/01/marvel-cosmic-invasion-review/">Marvel Cosmic Invasion Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Marvel Cosmic Invasion review, Ade said,<em> “Having found Tribute Games’ previous release, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge, to be one of the best scrolling beat ‘em ups I’d ever played, I had high expectations for Marvel Cosmic Invasion. How could Shredder’s Revenge with Marvel characters go wrong? Sadly, Marvel Cosmic Invasion is entirely OK but fails to be anything more than that.”</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Everything You Need To Know About Elden Ring Nightreign‘s DLC]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/nightreigh-forsaken-hollows-dlc-launch-time-patch-notes-2000650150</link>
            <guid>1371958</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Elden Ring Nightreig</em>n’s first paid DLC, <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-dlc-forsaken-hollows-artorias-dark-souls-2000643101"><em>The Forsaken Hollow</em></a>, is finally here. If it does it’s job, the new mini-expansion will bring fans back and give them new reasons to obsess over the surprisingly excellent multiplayer roguelike.</p> <p>I’ve cleared my schedule and shamed my friends into joining me for whatever fresh surprises from FromSoftware await us. Here’s everything you need to know about the new content, including what’s in it, when it goes live, and the accompanying patch notes.</p>

 <h2 id="what-time-does-elden-ring-nightreign-the-forsaken-hollows-launch-in-your-time-zone">What time does <em>Elden Ring Nightreign: The Forsaken Hollows</em> go live?</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The official release schedule of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ELDENRING?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ELDENRING</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NIGHTREIGN?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NIGHTREIGN</a> The Forsaken Hollows is now available.</p> <p>Learn how to access the content of The Forsaken Hollows here: <a href="https://t.co/YKcgUiynX1">https://t.co/YKcgUiynX1</a> <a href="https://t.co/RJafPEq0dV">pic.twitter.com/RJafPEq0dV</a></p> <p>— ELDEN RING (@ELDENRING) <a href="https://twitter.com/ELDENRING/status/1995858043746275502?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>This is the part that sucks. The global release times are staggered and consoles get the short end of the stick. <em>The Forsaken Hollow</em> launches December 3 at 6:00 p.m. ET on PC and December 4 at 12:00 a.m. ET. If you’re on Xbox Series X/S, you can pull the time zone trick to get in early, but it seems like everyone on PlayStation 5 and PS4 are out of luck.</p>

 <p>I’m still holding out some small ray of hope that the DLC will magically unlock around 9:00 p.m. ET like most of <em>Nightreign</em>‘s free updates and weekly content rotations. That doesn’t seem to be the care this time around, however.</p>

 <h2>How do you access <em>The Forsaken Hollows</em>?</h2> <p>Just because you bought the $15 DLC doesn’t mean the content will automatically be active in your version of <em>Nightreign</em>. To actually access the two additional Nightfarer characters you’ll need to have first defeated Tricephalos, the game’s three-headed wolf Nightlord. After that, head to the Roundtable Hold, talk to the Iron Menial, and get the message from the Small Jar Merchant to unlock the new Scholar and Undertaker classes.</p>

 <p>What about the new Shifting Earth event? To access that and the new Balancers boss fight, you’ll need to have completed the above steps and defeated a second Nightlord. With those conditions met you’ll head to a chapel that appears behind the Small Jar Merchant where you can activate the&nbsp;cataclysmic Shifting Earth event ‘The Great Hollows.’</p>

 <h2>What’s <em>The Forsaken Hollows</em> DLC adding to <em>Nightreign</em>?</h2> <p>There’s the Scholar, a new support class whose Character Skill is called Analyze and lets him debuff enemies by keeping them within a scoped view. His passive skill is Bagcraft which lets him hold more items. His Ultimate Art is called Communion and it links enemies so damaging one damages them all, while also doing the same for allies letting them share heals.</p>

 <p>Then there’s Undertaker, a more aggressive melee class whose Character Skill is called Trance and gives her free stamina and bonus speed. Her Ultimate Art is Loathsome Hex which unleashes a flurry of attacks at whatever’s targeted. Her passive, Confluence, briefly gives her another free Ultimate Art any time an ally uses theirs.</p> <p><em>The&nbsp;Forsaken Hollows</em> DLC also adds the aforementioned Great Hollows Shifting Earth event, which isn’t just a repurposed section of the existing map but an entirely new area players will have to fly to with its own points of interest, ruins, and underground mazes. In addition to the new Balancers Nightlord, the DLC is bringing poison swamps to Limveld, fresh field bosses, and also entirely new weapons.</p> <p>Most importantly, it should feel hard. “Whenever people who have played the main game extensively go into the DLC content, they’ll be able to have a bit of that feeling like they had when they first played <em>Nightreign</em>, where there’s still a bit that they’re trying to figure out,” <a href="https://kotaku.com/nightreign-forsaken-hollows-dlc-map-swamp-field-bosses-2000649718">director Junya Ishizaki promised</a>. “[<em>The Forsaken Hollows</em> is] definitely a little bit harder, but it’s not ridiculous or anything like that, but that’s still within what we would consider to be a fair challenge.”</p> <h2>A new patch with no Nightfarer balance changes</h2> <p>Finally, the DLC arrives alongside the latest free update which is already live. It includes some small quality-of-life tweaks and a bunch of bug fixes, including for Raider’s Retaliate skill where it wouldn’t work properly and an ongoing issue where some Sites of Grace or Churches wouldn’t activate. Notably, however, there are no actual buffs or nerfs to the existing cast of characters. Maybe FromSoftware wants to see how Scholar and Undertaker compare before decided to rescale them.</p> <p>Here are the full patch notes for <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-notes-version-103"><em>Nightreign</em> version 1.03</a>:</p> <blockquote> <h2>New features</h2> <ul> <li>Added support for The Forsaken Hollows. <ul> <li>If you own the DLC The Forsaken Hollows, it will be displayed in the lower right corner of the title screen.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Added a display of the currently equipped relics in the Character Selection menu. <ul> <li>You can check the effects of equipped relics by toggling the display.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Added a feature to set names when registering Relics presets in the Relic Rites menu.</li> <li>Set names can be changed in the All Presets section.</li> <li>The order of presets for each character can now be changed in the All Presets section of the Relic Rites menu. <ul> <li>In the Relic Rites menu, you can change the order of presets (but not the order of the character themselves) in the All Relics section.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Added Deep Large Scenic Flatstone to the Collector Signboard shop.</li> <li>The map’s layer display can now be toggled in the Results menu.</li> <li>The relics equipped by each player can now be displayed in the Results menu. <ul> <li>Relics can only be displayed for sessions played in version 1.02 or later.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Players with a Personal Objective that requires defeating a specific target while Reliving a Remembrance can now embark on Expeditions with players whose Personal Objective does not require defeating a specific target. <ul> <li>Personal Objectives that do not require destroying the target will only appear for one player per Expedition.</li> </ul> </li> <li>The flask count will now be highlighted in the following situations:</li> <li>When the flask count is at the maximum capacity,</li> <li>When an enemy-induced effect that influences the flask is triggered.</li> <li>The vertical position of the compass’ rune icon will now be displayed if the runes dropped upon death are significantly above or below the player character.</li> <li>You can now highlight specific events that occur on a map layer that is on a different level from the character’s location in the map menu.</li> <li>Adjusted the Dormant Power selection screen so that the HP gauge and other UI elements remain visible while the screen is displayed.</li> <li>Adjusted the weapon lineup in Limveld’s shops.</li> <li>Added Fire Pots to the shop inventory inside the Spirit Shetler.</li> <li>The target-lock on enemies that are behind when the tombstone summoned by Raider’s Ultimate Art appears no longer gets released.</li> </ul> <h2>Balance Adjustments</h2> <p>In general, the trigger conditions of Relic effects that trigger with low HP, equipment passive effects, and special effects have been broadened.</p> <h3>Changes to Passive Effects and Special Effects</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Added new Passive Effects:</strong> <ul> <li>Improved Melee Attack Power</li> <li>Improved Dash Attacks</li> <li>Improved Rolling Attacks</li> <li>Increased the effect of the Passive Effect Improved Attack Power when Two-Handing.</li> <li>Increased the effect of the Passive Effect Attack Up when Wielding Two Armaments.</li> <li>Increased the effect of the Passive Effect Improved Chain Attack Finishers.</li> <li>Increased the effect of the Passive Effect Improved Charge Attacks.</li> <li>Increased the effect of the Passive Effect Improved Jump Attacks.</li> <li>Increased the effect of the Passive Effect Improved Guard Counters.</li> <li>Increased the effect of the Passive Effect Improved Skill Attack Power.</li> <li>Increased the effect of the Passive Effect Physical Attack Up.</li> <li>Broadened the trigger conditions and decreased the effectiveness of the Passive Effect Improved Damage Negation at Low HP.</li> <li>Broadened the trigger conditions and decreased the effectiveness of the Talisman Blue-Feathered Branchsword.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h3>Changes to Relic Effects</h3> <ul> <li>Increased the effect of Physical Attack Up.</li> <li>Increased the effect of Improved Initial Standard Attack.</li> <li>Increased the effect of Improved Critical Hits.</li> <li>Increased the effect of Improved Guard Counters.</li> <li>Increased the effect of Improved XXX Damage (excluding bow weapon types).</li> <li>Increased the effect of Improved Attack Power with 3+ XX Equipped (excluding bow weapon types).</li> <li>Broadened the trigger conditions and decreased the effectiveness of Improved Damage Negation at Low HP.</li> </ul> <h3>Other Changes</h3> <ul> <li>Reduced the FP consumption and increased the power of the Wrath of Gold Incantation.</li> </ul> <h2>Bug Fixes &amp;

              <p><span>Every now and then, I remember when </span><i><span>BioShock </span></i><span>lead Ken Levine </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stop-making-porn-with-my-characters-bioshock-creator-p-1442945516"><span>asked fans to stop sending him porn of Elizabeth from </span><i><span>BioShock Infinite</span></i></a> <span>because it felt like seeing NSFW pictures of a daughter. Smut artists have only gotten bolder in the years since, because they’re sending this art directly to creators on various social media platforms. While some are down for it, Briana White, who voices </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-does-aerith-die-live-sephiroth-1851287690"><span>Aerith</span></a><span> in the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-ps5-1851276129"><i><span>Final Fantasy VII Remake </span></i><span>trilogy</span></a><span>, is not.</span></p> <p><span>White responded to a video on </span><a href="https://x.com/ItsBrianaWhite/status/1995571225926795588"><span>X</span></a><span> of Rei Ami, one of the vocalists from </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i></a><span> (and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-fortnite-rei-ami-stream-zoey-rumi-2000632536"><span>unabashed </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>fan</span></a><span>), talking about how much smut she’d been exposed to of the titular demon-hunting trio. The voice of Zoey said it can be shocking but admitted to seeking some of it out herself.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>White responded, saying she doesn’t want people to “normalize” tagging actors in pornographic art of their characters, and that those who do this have “forgotten the meaning of the word ‘inappropriate’.”</span></p> <p><span>“It’s really a shame when [voice actors] want to interact with the people who love the characters on social media, but just a few creeps ruin it for everyone,” White wrote.</span></p> <p><span>“It is a matter of consent,” she continued elsewhere in the thread. “And it can be almost impossible to know what exactly is acceptable or not to an individual just from knowing their social media persona.”</span></p> <p><span>I love smut as much as the next guy, but sending porn to actors unprompted is just harassment. It’s gotta be especially tough when these folks want to be part of the community and get face time with fans, but are met with this weirdo behavior. Draw your porn, write it, and post it on Archive of Our Own, but respect boundaries, folks. Everybody wins.</span></p>

                <p>Prediction markets have been popular for years, and now Roblox's top boss has said he wants to see them integrated into the hugely popular game someday.</p><p>CEO Dave Baszucki told <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/21/podcasts/hardfork-roblox-child-safety.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The New York Times</a>, "We would. I think we would have to do that."</p><p>It's not so easy, though, as Baszucki said every country has different legislation surrounding "loot boxes and kid gambling," so there are regulatory hurdles that would need be sorted out.</p><p>Baszucki is bullish on the idea, even if it might take time to come to fruition. For what it's worth, the interviewer and host laughed at the idea of prediction markets in Roblox.</p><p>"I actually think it's a brilliant idea if it can be done in an educational way that's legal. And so, imagine no free Robux, no free prizes, just a game called the Dress to Impress Predictor, where it's not like trying to get kids' money or anything like that. I would be a big fan of it," he explained.</p><p>Prediction market platforms like Polymarket and Kalshi are peer-to-peer platforms where people can buy and sell contracts tied to any number of events, including professional sports and culture events like which movie will win Best Picture. They are different from traditional sports betting platforms because there is no "house" setting the odds.</p><p>Prediction markets in the US are regulated by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, an agency of the US government that recently granted approval to Polymarket to function in the US. Its main rival, Kalshi, was approved by the CFTC years ago.</p><p><a href="https://news.kalshi.com/p/kalshi-cnn-prediction-market-partnership" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kalshi recently reached a deal with CNN</a> to feature its markets in the CNN newsroom, a decision that drew much debate and discussion online. Prediction markets, like traditional sports gambling, have been a hot-button issue, with many saying it's bad and dangerous for many different reasons.</p><p>Currently, Kalshi has a number of open markets for gaming, including a <a href="https://kalshi.com/markets/kxgameawards/game-awards/kxgameawards-2025" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">market for Game of the Year at The Game Awards</a>. More than $2.3 million has been exchanged so far on this market, with Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 far and away the leading choice to win.</p><p>Baszucki made headlines recently when he was asked in this same interview about child predator concerns in Roblox. His response was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/roblox-ceo-responds-to-child-predator-concerns-poorly/1100-6536445/" data-ref-id="1100-6536445">not what many people wanted to hear.</a></p><p><em>Thumbnail image from <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/13529953420/Money-Race" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Money Race game</a>.</em></p>

<p>Soak in the Viewros</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Nintendo's biggest release of the month (the <em>year</em>?) arrives tomorrow, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> finally Morph Ball rolling onto Switch 1 and 2. But with the new hardware still comparatively fresh on store shelves and the holiday season right around the corner, you might be wondering which system is <em>the</em> place to play Samus's latest adventure on.</p>
<p>Here to shed some light on how each version holds up is the above comparison video from the sublime Mr. Alex Olney. As you'll see, the footage shows a direct comparison between the Switch 1 and 2 releases, and the latter's beefed-up specs are immediately obvious.</p>
<p>The side-by-side gameplay showcases Samus in a whole range of environments, demonstrating how the game holds up whatever you throw at it. While fps is no issue for the older console, there's something about the 4K resolution bump on Switch 2 that really sings when put in direct comparison.</p>
<p>Of course, this isn't to say that the Switch 1 version provides a 'bad' experience in any way. We had the following to say about the S1 release in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/metroid-prime-4-beyond">our 8/10 review</a>: "It plays very well at a very solid 60fps in both docked and handheld, but after getting used to seeing Viewros in stunning 4K (or an internal resolution approaching it), it’s surprising how much the art direction seems to have been built with this in mind".</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/io-interactive-debuts-new-beyond-the-light-bts-007-first-light-series/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>IO Interactive is quickly approaching the launch date for what has been described as the peanut butter and chocolate of video games: IO Interactive behind a new James Bond game. 007 First Light will <a href="https://wccftech.com/007-first-light-release-date-march-2026-james-bond/">arrive on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on March 27, 2026</a>, and leading up to that launch, IO Interactive has kicked off a new series of videos on the game's YouTube channel called Beyond the Light, going behind the scenes of the game's development.</p>



<p>The first episode of the series includes reactions and insights from the developers regarding gameplay, with IO Interactive's gameplay director on 007 First Light, Andreas Krogh, and senior level designer Thomas Pulluello featured in the episode.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Beyond the Light Episode 1 - Gameplay Dev Reacts &amp; Insights #earnthenumber" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rL2hzHtdW38?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>A little over a week ago, as part of <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-announces-xbox-partner-preview-thursday/">Xbox's Partner Preview event</a>, IO Interactive confirmed that 007 First Light will <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-007-first-light-trailer-shows-off-bonds-stylish-wheels/">feature Bond with his iconic silver Aston Martin Valhalla</a>, decked out to the nines with spy gear, courtesy of Q. </p>



<p>Now with the release of this first Beyond the Light series, it's clear that the studio is ramping up towards the launch of its first brand-new major release since 2021, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hitman-3-steady-hand-trigger/">when Hitman 3 first launched</a>. As far as what comes after 007 First Light, just yesterday, <a href="https://wccftech.com/hitman-devleoper-confirms-new-game-is-coming-007-only-external-ip-studio-would-work-on/">the studio confirmed that it does have another new game in the works</a>.</p>



<p>Not an external IP, but a new internal property it's working on. This is another new title in addition <a href="https://wccftech.com/io-interactive-confirms-long-rumored-online-fantasy-rpg/">to the fantasy role-playing game</a> that the studio is working on, for which we don't yet have a title. There will also be more Hitman coming, which means that, including 007 First Light, the studio currently has three projects in the works.</p>



<p>Hopefully, by this time next year, we'll start to hear more about what the studio is working on, since by that point it'll have First Light out the door and can start looking towards what's next.</p>

Spotify Wrapped 2025 has added an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/837127/spotify-wrapped-party-2025-music-competition">interactive Wrapped Party feature</a> that makes a game out of comparing your listening habits against your friends, for example, while YouTube has launched a separate <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/836173/youtube-recap-videos-eoy-review-wrapped">Recap review for video insights</a>, alongside its usual Music Recap.</p><p>This is also the time of year when companies drop their “best of” rankings charts for the year, charting the most downloaded apps across Apple and Google’s app stores, the most streamed music, movies, and TV shows, and more.</p><p>We’re rounding up all the biggest or most intriguing recaps for 2025 below as they’re announced, so check back to see how the services you’re using will be breaking down your data this year.</p></section><section id="updates-section"><ul><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6ODM3MTc3" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/837177/google-photos-2025-recap-selfie-count">Google Photos Recap will tell you how many selfies you took this year</a></h2><div><p>Google has added some new features to its end-of-year Photos app throwback experience, including a selfie count, CapCut integration, and photo curation capabilities.

You also get your 2025 Wrapped playlist, which now shows how many times you listened to each of your top 100 tracks this year. But, as usual, Spotify is also adding a ton of new stuff to its annual tradition, including <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2025-12-03/wrapped-party-how-to/">Wrapped Party</a>, which pits you against your friends to see who is the bigger (or weirder) music fan.</p><p>Wrapped Party is an interactive feature that you “play” with friends. Granted, there isn’t much to actually do, since it’s mostly about what you’ve already listened to.

              <p>McDonald’s released its new holiday meal, and there’s some good (and tasty) news for fans of the fast-food chain’s French fries. Thanks to the Grinch, McShaker fries are finally going to be available in the United States</p> <p>On December 2, <a href="https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/corpmcd/our-stories/article/the-grinch-meal-coming-to-mcdonalds.html">McDonald’s new limited-time-only Grinch Meal became available around the country</a>. The Christmas-themed meal, which comes with a pair of limited-time festive holiday socks, is packaged in special bags featuring the Grinch and contains a medium drink, 10 McNuggets or a Big Mac, and some Dill Pickle “Grinch Salt” McShaker Fries. It’s that last item that has some fast-food lovers excited.</p> <p><a href="https://mcdonalds.fandom.com/wiki/Shake_Shake_Fries">McShaker Fries appear to be a US version of Shake Shake Fries,</a> a concept that has been around for many, many years in places like Hong Kong, the Philippines, and Taiwan. The fries have also popped up for limited runs in Canada, the United Kingdom, as well as India. Shake Shake Fries come packaged with a seasoning packet and a bag. You dump the fries and seasoning into the bag, close the top, and, well, as the name implies, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Hj_6TvmsEwI">shake it a few times</a> to cover the fries in tasty dust. The concept has never made its way to the United States until now.</p>

 <p>Early reactions to the Grinch’s dill pickle McShaker Fries are pretty positive, with people hoping McDonald’s keeps the concept around past Christmas and maybe even expands on it with some of the flavors found in other parts of the world. Personally, I’m not a pickle guy at all, so these fries sound awful, but I’m excited to see Shake Shake Fries brought over to the US, even if it is part of a Grinch-themed bundle.</p> <p>Meanwhile, as you are already here and reading about limited-time fast-food meals, <a href="https://news.bk.com/blog-posts/burger-king-r-invites-guests-to-dive-into-a-sea-of-flavor-with-all-new-spongebob-tm-movie-menu">Burger King announced a new <em>SpongeBob</em> movie menu</a>. This menu includes a slice of pie and a real Krabby Patty. It also comes in some delightful-looking SpongeBob-themed packaging that will no doubt be sold for $50 or more on eBay by the end of this week.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-switch-2-comparison-graphics-2000650153</link>
            <guid>1371907</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’ve ever worn glasses, then you know this feeling well: Pop on your lenses and, bam, the world is in HD. That’s not a bad way to describe the difference between <i>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</i> running on the original Switch vs. the new Switch 2.</p> <p>Having shipped on both consoles, <i>Metroid Prime 4</i> is a <i>prime</i> opportunity to get a sense of the clear technical differences between Nintendo’s newest console and its last-gen hardware. Sure, we know the Switch 2 is powerful, flexing its GPU muscles with <i>Cyberpunk 2077</i> and some <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-switch-2-port-gameplay-comparison-ps5-xbox-fps-ubisoft-2000649204">excellent ports of demanding open-world Ubisoft games</a>. But <i>Metroid</i> is a first-party exclusive, so it’s a great opportunity to see the differences when <i>just</i> Nintendo’s hardware is the target.</p>

 <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-switch-2-port-gameplay-comparison-ps5-xbox-fps-ubisoft-2000649204">Ubisoft’s Becoming The King Of Switch 2 Ports</a></p> <p>The result? The Switch 2 damn sure renders a pretty picture for our gal Samus’ latest adventure. That said, the OG Switch, while it has a softer image, still looks and runs well enough. The load times though…yeesh. <a href="https://youtu.be/mMc1oik78Vc">This comparison video</a> from ElAnalistaDeBits shows the differences in motion:</p>

  <h2>Switch 2 has a crisper image, and performance mode looks slick</h2> <p>Switch 2 on both quality and performance modes shows a clear advantage when it comes to a higher resolution and clearer images. The performance mode is a touch softer, but you’re trading a bit of fidelity for 120 frames per second. And if you don’t think a framerate that high is worth it, as a former skeptic of anything higher than 60 FPS being worthwhile, I must tell you that you’re wrong.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000650159" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000650159"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000650159">© Screenshot: Nintendo / ElAnalistaDeBits / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>Switch 1 ain’t nothin’ to sneeze at…but you’re gonna wanna grab a coffee while it loads</h2> <p>If you’re like me and all you have laying around is an original Switch, <i>Metroid Prime 4</i> doesn’t look too terrible. And it runs at 60 FPS, which is swell. But perhaps the worst part of running the game on a classic Switch is you’ll be waiting a long time for it to load. The comparison video above shows a loading sequence that only takes the Switch 2 a mere 24 seconds, while the OG console loads in at over a minute and four seconds. Reminds me of playing <i>The Witcher 3</i> on PS4 (still had a great time! But man did I do a lotta waiting).</p>

 <h2>If you’re looking for an excuse to upgrade, <i>Metroid</i> might just be it</h2> <p>Sometimes ya gotta make due with the hardware you have. But if you’ve got some cash burning a hole in your pocket and you’re ready to step into Nintendo’s next generation, and you love <i>Metroid</i>, it seems like the Switch 2 version might make the upgrade worth it. As <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/metroid-prime-4-beyond"><i>Nintendo Life</i> puts it in their review of <i>Beyond</i></a>, once you see the “next-gen” version in motion, it’s hard to go back:</p> <blockquote><p>Playing this on Switch 1 when docked feels fine enough, but that crispness, that pop, that ludicrously intricate, high-contrast detail, it’s just a bit fuzzy and pixelly by comparison. I personally feel it’s almost the direct antithesis to <i>Pokémon Legends Z-A</i>, which actually felt as though the art style was more cohesive on the weaker platform. Textures have taken an understandable hit, and models that are further away can look quite smeary, but overall the game still looks good. I just can’t help but compare it unfavourably to Switch 2.</p></blockquote> <p>Again, given that the original console runs the game at 60 frames per second, I’d wager the experience of playing the game will still feel good enough, even if it’s a little soft compared to what the latest hardware can deliver. But what are upgrades for if we’re not getting prettier pixels? If you do snag&nbsp;<em>Metroid</em> for the OG Switch and end up acquiring a Switch 2 down the line, you can also upgrade the Switch 1 version to the prettier Switch 2 version for an extra 10 bucks.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-winter-offensive-update-details-revealed/</link>
            <guid>1371904</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6 developers have revealed new details for the Winter Offensive update ahead of its arrival. </p>



<p>Developers of Battlefield 6 have been hard at work figuring out all the issues players have been facing in the title. The developers recently addressed their <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-in-game-audio-issues-addressed-by-devs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in-game audio issues</a>, stating that they should be fixed with the next update. Now, the intel on the next major update has dropped.</p>







<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-winter-offensive-update-drops-on-december-9">Battlefield 6 Winter Offensive Update Drops on December 9</h2>



<h3 id="h-audio-improvements">Audio Improvements </h3>



<p>A new post on the BattlefieldComms account on <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1996248184381641171" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) dives deeper into Battlefield 6’s Winter Offensive Update. The first thing confirmed is the previously mentioned audio issues, which will be fixed. The devs are prioritizing important combat and vehicle sounds and performing a comprehensive pass on footsteps to improve clarity, distance definition, and positional awareness across the game. At the same time, they are working on performance and memory issues that could cause sounds not to play as intended. </p>



<h3 id="h-mode-adjustments">Mode Adjustments</h3>



<p>Next up is mode adjustments, both Rush and Breakthrough are getting significant updates after Battlefield 6 Winter Offensive arrives, focusing on improving attacker flow, reducing defender oversaturation, and tightening clarity around objectives. Breakthrough will see capture volumes and vehicle availability updated across several maps, and these changes have been guided by “feedback and internal data to help bring win rates closer together for both teams.”</p>



<p>Rush, on the other hand, will see adjustments to M-COM locations on the Manhattan Bridge and Liberation Peak to give attackers more reliable access and to smooth out the flow between sectors. Moreover, both modes will see multiple capture zones reshaped or clarified to help players understand where to contest or defend. Vehicle spawns have also been adjusted to reduce bottlenecks and remove frustration points. </p>



<p>Moreover, the developers have also made a range of quality-of-life improvements across UI clarity, minimap behavior, controller aiming responsiveness, and more. They will also be looking into the recent performance issues reported by players. </p>



<h3 id="h-combat-system">Combat System</h3>



<p>Some significant changes will be made to the combat system with Battlefield 6’s Winter Offensive update. Starting with hit registration and netcode, the new update will improve how bullet trajectories are aligned in fast-paced situations, including when shots are fired while transitioning into a zoom. The improvements will also correct inconsistencies that could affect hit registration and readability. </p>



<p>They have also made updates to handle high-density combat scenarios more reliably, ensuring bullets register more consistently when multiple players are fighting in close proximity. The issue where clients could briefly display specific pieces of geometry as intact even though they have been destroyed has been fixed. </p>



<p>Next, we come to soldier visibility: the upcoming Battlefield 6 Winter Offensive update has refined how visibility effects activate at close range, so that soldiers stand out more clearly in darker or low-contrast areas. Prone animations have been updated to include more subtle movement, improving the player’s visibility. They are also looking at improvements to lighting and exposure, especially in indoor-to-outdoor transitions and how characters read against complex environments.</p>



<p>Last but not least is weapon adjustments, and the new BF6 update will bring a wide range of improvements to weapon handling, including fixes towards first-shot accuracy, attachment behavior, and tuning across various recoil patterns and weapon categories. The new changes intend to deliver more predictable, consistent weapon performance in active combat.</p>







<p>In other news, Battlefield 6’s anti-cheat has blocked <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-anti-cheat-million-attempts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 2.4 million cheat attempts</a>.

            <title><![CDATA[Marvel Rivals Unveils New Gacha System]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-unveils-new-gacha-system/</link>
            <guid>1371901</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new Gacha system is set to arrive in Marvel Rivals, giving players the opportunity to pick up a range of fresh rewards at a reduced cost—provided luck is on your side.</p>



<p>For those unfamiliar, a Gacha system is a mechanic where players spend in-game currency to receive a random item from a predetermined pool. It’s a gamble, essentially: you might hit the jackpot, or you might walk away with something far less exciting. In <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/envy-is-the-third-major-team-pulling-out-of-marvel-rivals-esports/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a>, this new system appears to center  around a brand-new Psylocke skin, which seems to be the headline reward in the draw.</p>







<h2 id="h-new-gacha-system-revealed-for-marvel-rivals">New Gacha System Revealed For Marvel Rivals</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Better hope you pop the right balloon! Credit to NetEase.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Marvel Rivals is rolling out its first-ever Gacha bundle as part of Phase 2 of its First Anniversary Live Event, introducing a new way for players to chase cosmetics. This time, fans can spend in-game Units for a shot at unlocking a full set of new Psylocke cosmetics, but how much they’ll ultimately pay depends entirely on luck.</p>



<p>The system works on an escalating cost model: each pull increases in price. The first attempt is 100 Units, followed by 200, until all balloons in the Gacha are popped. The key twist, however, is that if a player hits the anniversary Psylocke skin early, every remaining reward is granted automatically. That means the entire bundle could cost as little as 100 Units—or, if fortune doesn’t cooperate, the full 2,400.</p>







<p>It marks a noticeable shift from Marvel Rivals’ usual cosmetic distribution methods. Traditionally, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-plus-players-can-grab-free-marvel-rivals-winter-soldier-cosmetics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">skins and bundles</a> could be purchased directly from the store or earned through Season Pass progression. This new Gacha system offers a potentially cheaper but inherently riskier alternative, likely appealing to players who enjoy the thrill of chance. For others, the predictability of buying a skin outright may still be preferable.</p>



<p>Still, the ceiling is reassuringly familiar. With 2,400 Units matching standard store pricing for a full skin bundle, players can’t overspend—and there’s always the tempting prospect of paying far less than usual.</p>



<p>How do you feel about Marvel Rivals integrating Gacha mechanics into its store? Share your thoughts in the official <a href="https://discord.gg/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The highly-acclaimed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> just added yet another accolade to its name — as it's now the biggest new third-party game launch on Xbox Game Pass in 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/12/03/clair-obscur-expedition-33-game-pass-biggest-launch/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced</a> the news today after examining data from every day one Xbox Game Pass launch this year, and ranking every third-party game by the number of unique users during its first 30 days of availability.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a hugely impressive achievement for Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, the debut game from French studio Sandfall Interactive, for several different reasons. Firstly, because the game arrived just two days after Bethesda's The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered (which itself also launched via Game Pass). And secondly, because we already know that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sells-33-million-in-33-days-not-bad-for-a-game-some-thought-was-going-to-get-crushed-by-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered">Clair Obscur went on to sell very well too</a> (5 million copies in five months) — something its launch via Game Pass does not appear to have dented.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"From being there to announce our game back in Summer 2024, to coming to the studio for the Developer_Direct video in January, Xbox helped us get the word out there and reach a lot of players," Sandfall creative director Guillaume Broche said in a statement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Xbox Game Pass let "a lot of people try our game when maybe they might not have before," Broche continued. "The turn-based RPG genre has a lot of fans but sometimes it might put people who prefer more real-time action games off, but Game Pass lowered that barrier of entry. They could just try it and see how it feels. So a lot of curious players could start the game, explore Lumière and the early game, and realize there's a lot to enjoy here, even if they weren’t expecting it at first."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Review - Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So, what was Clair Obscur's Xbox Game Pass competition? It's been a long year, so it's worth reminding ourselves of everything the turn-based RPG has beaten to become this year's biggest third-party Xbox Game Pass release. (And remember, this is separate to Microsoft's own first-party output, which will include Avowed and South by Midnight, as well as Bethesda games such as The Outer Worlds 2, and Activision fare like Call of Duty: Black Ops 7.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other third-party games that arrived day one via Microsoft's subscription service notably included the highly-anticipated Hollow Knight: Silksong, as well as the post-apocalyptic survival game Atomfall. The highly-acclaimed indie puzzle favorite Blue Prince also arrived this year, as did Ninja Gaiden 2 Black, Wuchang: Fallen Feathers, Ball X Pit, and PowerWash Simulator 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Congratulations, then, to Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 — something we may well be hearing a few more times this month, considering its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-collects-12-the-game-awards-nominations-the-most-in-the-awards-history">record-breaking number of nominations at The Game Awards</a>.

    <p><span>ANTONBLAST's final content update.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Summitsphere [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/summitsphere">Summitsphere</a> has <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/ogg/1887400/announcements/detail/633446162470273309" target="_blank">announced</a> <em><a title="Games > ANTONBLAST [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/antonblast">ANTONBLAST</a></em> update “THE END”—the <a title="Genres > Side-Scrolling [1,171 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/side-scrolling">side-scrolling</a> <a title="Genres > Action [3,248 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a> <a title="Genres > Platformer [787 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/platformer">platformer</a>‘s final content update. It will launch on December 18. <span id="more-1010963"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via Summitsphere:</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>The Demon Corp</strong> – This band of bastards has been rehearsing each day for the Big Tournament, and now it’s their time to shine. That’s right, FOUR new (smaller-scale!) boss fights against each member of the Demon Corp. Claim your Prize Star by defeating each of them and be granted early access into their big show!</li><li><strong>The Big Tournament: The Boss Rush</strong> – Danton has been laboring over day and night and has at last fulfilled his contract to bring the Big Tournament to life! Earn your Battle Pass and prepare to face <em>ANTONBLAST</em>‘s most grueling challenge: Face against the game’s nine major boss fights without facing a knock-out and claim your title of Tournament Champion! There is a big cash prize in it for the winner, too.</li><li><strong>The Lime Trials</strong> – The mysterious Lime Trials make their appearance. Defeat the big baddie of each wing of Brulo’s Casino, and you will be granted access to a new kind of timed challenge: Collect all Limes in the room before time runs out to recover the Souvenir Lime! And, if you feel like showing off after already collecting the Souvenir Lime, claim cash prizes especially if you beat your best time!</li><li><strong>New Game Modes</strong> – As promised to our supporters, our Hard Mode and Stage Rush Mode will finally make their appearance. In Hard Mode, face the challenges of <em>ANTONBLAST</em> with little extra help and stricter, harder stages and bosses. Satan’s troops are a little more prepared this time! In Stage Rush, blast through the twelve stages and eight bosses of the <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,741 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">Adventure</a> campaign as fast as you can! Hard Mode will automatically unlock for any players who have already cleared the first stage in game; Stage Rush will automatically unlock for any players who have defeated the Final Boss. But, could there be more…?</li><li><strong>Danton</strong> – Now that Danton’s work around the Casino is mostly finished, you will find him perusing the area. Feel free to talk to him, he’s really happy about it!</li><li><strong>New Soundtrack and Sound Work</strong> – Our updated <em>ANTONBLAST</em> soundtrack will be wholly replacing the existing tracks in the game. Furthermore, we have extensively touched up our sound design and have totally rebalanced and adjusted the soundscape of the game to prevent audio clipping and other nasty artifacts. The result is the game won’t be as ear-piercingly loud, meaning you can get a much cleaner view (hearing?) of what is actually going on at any given moment in the game and don’t need to turn the audio down so low. It is a much more pleasing experience on everyone’s ears. We have also shifted some sounds around, but you’ll have to play the game to hear the difference!</li><li><strong>New Trinkets</strong> – Brulo’s Shop has been restocked with various new items, such as the Virtual Visor, Game Brick and Pet Paint (harmless, non-toxic). <a title="Companies > Experience [212 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a> Anton and Annie’s Adventure under… a different light.</li><li><strong>New Spray Cans</strong> – Sixteen new Spray Cans have been added, bringing the total to 110. Most will be hidden, strewn around Brulo’s Casino and Peanut Park, so be sure to be look around carefully!</li><li><strong>New Achievements</strong> – Four new achievements for you to figure out and, well, achieve! Discover the secrets of Peanut Park and engage with the new stages and boss fights and (re-)claim your Perfect title on <em>ANTONBLAST</em>!</li><li><strong>New Language Support</strong> – That’s right, you will be able to experience the glorious text and interface of <em>ANTONBLAST</em> in a total of eight languages: English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Latin-American Spanish and Brazillian Portuguese. We hope our more international Blasters appreciate and enjoy the work our community localizers have put into the game!</li><li><strong>Lots of Bug Fixes</strong> – I mean, I hope you’re not surprised about it! The team has put TREMENDOUS work into polishing up <em>ANTONBLAST</em> into being the best game ever. We hope it reached that standard now!</li><li><strong>And More!</strong> – There is a lot more that you will see that we have not talked about here. It will all be made clear… in THE END.</li></ul></blockquote><p><em>ANTONBLAST</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > Switch [18,041 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a> and <a title="Platforms > PC [24,926 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1887400/ANTONBLAST/" target="_blank">Steam</a>, and is <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/antonblast-coming-to-ps5-ps4-in-2026">coming to PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4</a> in 2026.</p><!-- AD: content -->

While accepting his wins, the game's leading boss Ryozo Tsujimoto shared his conviction that Monster Hunter is still popular among players and he doesn't see any need for the franchise to stop.</p><p>"Of course, we don’t intend to stop the series here," Tsujimoto told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/of-course-were-not-going-to-stop-here-monster-hunter-developers-talk-about-the-future-of-the-series-at-playstation-awards" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>. "We plan to continue, and we want to let more people play. In addition, I would like to think about things beyond the games so that we can further expand the potential of the Monster Hunter IPs.'"</p><p>There was a live-action Monster Hunter movie in 2020 from director Paul W. S. Anderson and actress Milla Jovovich, the husband-and-wife team behind the first six Resident Evil films. However, Monster Hunter's dismal $47.9 million worldwide box office has seemingly killed any prospect of a sequel.</p><p> Tsujimoto didn't offer any specific updates regarding new Monster Hunter titles, but he reiterated that Monster Hunter Wilds will still be getting updates.</p><p>"Monster Hunter has the characteristics of a title that gets regular updates, but player opinions were very helpful during the update process," wrote Tsujimoto. "And in order to make Monster Hunter Wilds better, the fans’ voices gave us power. There are still updates left to come, so we will continue to do our best."</p><p>During an earnings call for investors in April, Capcom claimed that Monster Hunter Wild's sharp fall-off in sales be address after the first month may have been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5s-high-price-is-impacting-monster-hunter-wilds-sales-capcom-exec-says/1100-6534430/" data-ref-id="1100-6534430">due to the high price of a PS5</a>.

            <title><![CDATA[Skyblivion Is Officially Delayed to 2026; It Will Be a ‘Living Project’ with Features Like Spellcrafting Possibly Coming Post-Launch]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-officially-delayed-2026-will-be-living-project-features-coming-post-launch/</link>
            <guid>1371868</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It was January 2023 when the Skyblivion team originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-total-conversion-mod-officially-set-for-2025-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> its targeted 2025 launch window. Throughout the past couple of years, the modders have <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-team-now-on-its-final-stretch-release-still-planned-for-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stuck to their schedule</a>, maintaining that they would be able to bring the ambitious total conversion project to fruition by the end of 2025.</p>



<p>Today, though, Project Lead Rebelzize <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC6W0htYBOc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared a video update</a> to confirm that won't happen, as there are simply too many things left to do. The complete fan-made recreation of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion in the engine of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim will, therefore, be released at some point in 2026.</p>



<p>The good news is that the game is in a great state, and many aspects are complete or nearly complete. The world map, for example, was troublesome to implement but is now 100% finished, including all unique regions, realms, and the Oblivion Deadlands. Skyblivion fans can now get a glimpse of it through an interactive satellite-style map, <a href="https://skyblivion.com/map/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">now live on the project's website</a>.</p>



<p>All quest dungeons are also complete, rebuilt with new layouts, bespoke boss encounters, and unique quest rewards; only a handful of random dungeons remain unfinished. Most interiors, such as houses, shops, castles, stables, chapels, and inns, are ready. However, many Imperial City interiors are blocked until the city's 3D asset set is finalized, with the expectation to complete all locations by the end of 2025.</p>



<p>Indeed, the Skyblivion team outlines the Imperial City as the single largest remaining content challenge. Quest implementation is progressing somewhat smoothly, but is still partially blocked by the remaining work needed in the Imperial City. The goal is to finish quests by Q1 2026, leaving time for playtesting and iteration before launch. Once the Imperial City, navmesh, quests, and core systems like alchemy, spells, perks, and crafting (which should be feature complete by the end of 2025) are wrapped and polished, the modders believe the project will finally be ready for its targeted 2026 release. All other major cities, like Anvil, Bravil, Bruma, Cheydinhal, Chorrol, Leyawiin, Skingrad, and the ruined Kvatch, have been implemented.</p>



<p>The User Interface (UI) is still under development. The team has moved toward a more Skyrim-like interface, with function and consistency taking precedence over aesthetics, although a custom reskin may be implemented later. Core UI work is expected to be done by the first quarter of 2026.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Skyblivion Delay to 2026 | A Commitment to Release" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yC6W0htYBOc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The Skyblivion team is even developing a large final fight cinematic between Akatosh and Mehrunes Dagon, handled by professional animators, but production is bottlenecked by manpower in rendering, set dressing, VFX, and destruction simulation. Rebelzize calls out for volunteer specialists in those areas to apply so the cinematic can reach the desired quality. If you have such expertise and are willing to help, contact the team <a href="https://skyblivion.com/volunteer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">through this form</a>.</p>



<p>Not all features will be included in version 1.0. For example, underwater combat has been cut due to major conflicts with animation mods, although it may be reintroduced at a later date. Indeed, Rebelzize described this as a living project, which will continue to be refined with bug fixes, but also expanded with the original Oblivion DLC (Shivering Isles, Knights of the Nine), and with additional features like spell crafting, dynamic dungeons, grave-robbing, more creature variety, followers, weapons, armor sets, and more. </p>



<p>Overall, it's sad news for those who still wished to play Skyblivion during the Holidays. However, even professional games are always prone to delays, let alone volunteer projects like this one. Moreover, Bethesda <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">did release the official Oblivion Remastered earlier this year</a>, so those who really want to explore a modern version of the classic roleplaying game already have a way to do so.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders was Reportedly the Best-Selling Game on Steam For November 2025, Over 7.7M Copies Sold Overall]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-reportedly-best-selling-game-on-steam-november-2025/</link>
            <guid>1371865</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>A new report from <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/novembers-best-selling-steam-games">Alinea Analytics</a> has ARC Raiders listed as the number-one best-selling game on Steam for November 2025 by copies sold, and has now reached 7.7 million copies sold across all platforms. It's the latest sign of how Embrak Studios' third-person extraction shooter continues to be one of the biggest games of the year.</p>



<p>This comes after Alinea Analytics reported that ARC Raiders <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-reportedly-closing-in-on-7m-copies-sold/">had sold nearly 750K copies in the week of November 16-22</a>, and that it had sold at least half of all its copies sold on Steam, with the other half coming from PS5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles.</p>



<p>It's far and away a bigger game than Embark Studios' free-to-play title, The Finals, particularly on Steam, where ARC Raiders is surpassing <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2073850/charts/">The Finals' peak concurrent player count</a> as <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1808500/charts/">part of its daily player numbers</a>. Its continued success is also interesting to follow <a href="https://wccftech.com/nexon-ceo-claims-we-should-assume-every-game-company-now-using-ai-game-devs-say-no/">as the conversation around generative AI in game development builds and evolves</a>.</p>

<p>That said, we're still in what you'd call 'the early days' for a multiplayer game. It's up to Embark to keep this momentum going now, and we'll know by next year if ARC Raiders has truly carved itself a piece of the multiplayer shooter pie, depending on where it stands at the one-year mark.</p>



<p>Elsewhere on the Steam charts, November was dominated by indie games. RV There Yet? reportedly came second behind ARC Raiders for copies sold in November 2025, with 1.9 million. Peak followed it with 1.4 million copies sold, which was then followed by Dispatch at 1.1 million, and rounding out the top five was <a href="https://wccftech.com/escape-from-duckov-enjoys-spec-quackular-launch-with-1-million-units-sold-in-five-days/">Escape from Duckov, the Escape from Tarkov parody</a>.</p>

<p>While it's still to be determined if ARC Raiders will maintain its current spot as the multiplayer game to beat, Embark Studios can enjoy the game receiving its commercial flowers, especially since it doesn't look like it'll get its critical ones this year.</p>



<p>It missed out on Game of the Year nominations for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/golden-joysticks-awards-2025-winners-full-list/">Golden Joysticks</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-nominees-full-list/">The Game Awards</a>, and in the latter it only carries one nomination for best multiplayer game. The conversation around 2025's best game is engulfed by the likes of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Hollow Knight Silksong and Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2. We'll know which game comes out on top in just a few days from the time of this writing, with The Game Awards kicking off on December 11, 2025.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/news/837278/horses-banned-steam-epic-games-store</link>
            <guid>1371862</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Horses</em>, a first-person narrative horror game, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/santaragione.com/post/3m6zgqun5us2f">was banned from the Epic Games Store</a> just hours before it was set to launch on December 2nd. Then, a day after launch, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horses-the-upsetting-horror-game-previously-banned-on-steam-gets-last-minute-ban-from-epic-games-store-too">the Humble store banned it as well</a>. The decision shocked the developers at Santa Ragione, makers of the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/reviews/saturnalia-review/">critically respected <em>Saturnalia</em></a>, as these storefronts were the homes they’d found for their game two years before it was preemptively banned from Steam.</p><p>Valve and Epic say <em>Horses</em> violates their sexual content policies. Humble hasn’t yet said why it banned the game after hosting it for several hours post-launch. However, Santa Ragione claims neither Epic nor Valve has clearly explained what exactly in the game is objectionable, and that these decisions have put the studio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-extremely-frustrating-and-also-fcked-up-one-of-the-worlds-best-indie-studios-is-facing-shock-closure-following-confounding-steam-ban">in peril of shutting down</a>. The back-and-forth has catapulted <em>Horses</em> from a little-known prestige indie title to the next battleground in the fight between game storefronts, indie developers, content policies, and creative expression.</p><p>Though all the action kicked off late last month, <em>Horses</em>’ story officially began two years ago. In <a href="https://www.horses.wtf/BannedFromSteam/index.html">a lengthy FAQ</a>, the developers explained that in 2023, <em>Horses</em> was rejected during Steam’s review process without explanation. “Steam’s policy grants broad discretion to refuse titles without providing detailed explanations. In our case, they simply stated they could not legally distribute <em>Horses</em> without clarifying why,” the FAQ reads.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/unsettling-horror-game-horses-banned-from-steam-leaving-studio-with-high-risk-of-closure">In an interview with <em>IGN</em></a>, Pietro Righi Riva, one half of the team at Santa Ragione, said that the ban might have been caused by a scene involving a man and his daughter visiting a ranch where the titular “horses” are humans wearing horse masks. The daughter wants to ride one of the horses, which the player facilitates. “What followed was an interactive dialogue sequence where the player is leading, by a lead as if they were a horse, a naked adult woman with a young girl on her shoulders,” Riva said.</p><p>He said that scene was part of a rough demo sent to Steam to satisfy the platform’s request for a playable build so <em>Horses</em> could get a “Coming Soon” page. Riva said that, ultimately, the character was changed in the final build. “We have since changed the character in the scene to be a twenty-something woman, both to avoid the juxtaposition and more importantly because the dialogue delivered in that scene, which deals with the societal structure in the world of <em>Horses</em>, works much better when delivered by an older character.”</p><div><p>“Our requests for review and appeal were denied over and over.”</p></div><p>The studio stresses that Steam never explicitly explained why <em>Horses</em> was banned nor responded to any of Santa Regione’s follow-up appeals and communications. “For two years we asked for clarifications and a path to compliance, but we were directed to Steam’s general guidelines and our requests for review and appeal were denied over and over,” the FAQ reads.</p><div><p>In November, after Santa Ragione <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/santaragione.com/post/3m6ht5yj3ss23">shared <em>Horses</em>’ release date</a> and the reason why it wouldn’t be sold on Steam, Valve finally responded. A <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-it-is-scary-humiliating-and-patronising-santa-ragione-facing-closure-after-horses-barred-from-steam">statement to <em>gamedeveloper.com</em> read</a>:</p></div><p>“After our team played through the build and reviewed the content, we gave the developer feedback about why we couldn’t ship the game on Steam, consistent with <a href="https://url.us.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/tmWlCn5YzpcKpL21nF9fACJhfDX?domain=partner.steamgames.com">our onboarding rules and guidelines</a>. A short while later the developer asked us to reconsider the review, and our internal content review team discussed that extensively and communicated to the developer our final decision that we were not going to ship the game on Steam.”</p><p>The studio says the Steam ban put the company in financial peril, as it “completely erased our ability to find an external supporting publisher or partner to fund the rest of the game as no one in the industry considers an indie game that cannot be released on Steam to be viable.” Though the developers were able to continue work on <em>Horses</em> through investments from friends, unless the game’s a hit, they say the studio will shut down.</p><p>In the two years since <em>Horses</em>’ ban from Steam, Santa Ragione found several new homes for the game, including Itch.io, GOG, Humble, and the Epic Games Store. <a href="https://x.com/GOGcom/status/1994406374273318952?s=20">In a post on X</a>, DRM-free storefront GOG said, “We’re proud to give Horses a home on GOG, giving players another way to enjoy the game. We’ve always believed that players should be able to choose the experiences that speak to them.” Humble, however, banned the game shortly after its launch there and has not responded to a request for comment.</p><p>None of those stores has near the market share of Steam, but among them, Epic’s has the most name recognition — making its last-minute ban a major blow.</p><p>As with Steam, Epic didn’t explain what in <em>Horses </em>triggered the ban, only referring to the policy on inappropriate and hateful / abusive content and the fact that games rated AO, or Adults Only, could not be distributed on EGS. (<a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/docs/epic-games-store/requirements-guidelines/content-ratings/content-guidelines">Unless it’s an NFT / blockchain game, of course.</a>)</p><p>“We immediately appealed their decision through all suggested channels,” the developers’ FAQ reads, adding that when <em>Horses </em>was submitted to the ESRB for rating, it received an Mature rating (ages 17 and up), which is, as of this writing, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/horses-004d87">still prominently displayed on the game’s EGS page</a>. Epic did not respond to a request to clarify the age rating discrepancy or the timing of the ban, referring instead to the statements Santa Ragione shared in its FAQ.</p><p>Santa Ragione is very clear about the kind of content <em>Horses </em>contains. The lengthy content warning <a href="https://www.horses.wtf/index.html">on the game’s website</a> lists “physical violence, psychological abuse, gory imagery (mutilation, blood), depictions of slavery, physical and psychological torture, domestic abuse, sexual assault, suicide, and misogyny.” It also makes sense that, out of an abundance of caution, Steam would ban the version of the game it saw with the father-and-daughter scene.</p><p>“The scene is not sexual in any way, but it is possible that the juxtaposition is what triggered the flag,” Riva told <em>IGN</em>. But what makes less sense is the platform’s refusal to reevaluate the game or at least explain its reasoning. “We believe Steam intentionally keeps its policy opaque so it does not have to stand by clear rules and can adjust decisions to whatever best serves the platform at a given moment,” reads the FAQ.</p><p>According to Santa Ragione, Epic’s ban is even more confusing. It said EGS had a more complete version of the game for two months, “with the final achievements-ready build being approved for release 18 days prior to launch.” Epic’s decision to ban<em> Horses</em> reads like decision-makers getting scared in light of all the attention on the game.</p><p>In spite of all this, <em>Horses</em> still is available, and the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horses-review">smattering</a> of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/horses-review">reviews</a> have been mostly positive. But with large storefronts having significant power over games and studios, the reception may not be enough to keep Santa Ragione alive. The studio says that the combination of the Steam ban and the money it owes investors “puts us in a completely unsustainable financial situation unless the game somehow recoups its development costs.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/837278/horses-banned-steam-epic-games-store]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/wd-5tb-my-passport-falls-to-0-02-per-gb-as-amazon-goes-no-margin-on-storage-deals-post-cyber-monday-2000649736</link>
            <guid>1371853</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’ve been banging the drum for deals on reliable, large-capacity portable HDDs for a long time now. Honestly, going without one is really like doing a high-wire act without a net, because having only the one copy of your most sensitive and essential files that lives on your laptop or desktop leaves you one mishap away from losing them forever.</p>
<p>Cyber Week’s one of the best opportunities to get protection for your irreplaceable data, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6185/">one of the best deals still on the board is this one at Amazon on the 5TB version of the WD My Passport external hard drive, which is just $121</a>. That’s a 16% drop from the regular $145, and it’s a stellar price for an external drive with this sort of capacity and reliability from a trusted brand like Western Digital — in fact, it’s the world’s first 5TB 2.5-inch portable hard drive. Be sure to click the black model of this palm-sized drive — inexplicably, the blue and red ones are still running at full price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6185/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Ransomware Protection</h2>
<p>External HDDs tend to be fairly static devices, aside from shrinking in physical size and growing in capacity. Beyond that, the features have remained mostly the same. Except now, WD has added software to the My Passport HDD that includes robust protection against the ever-growing and constantly evolving threat of ransomware.</p>
<p>A virus or malware can get into not only your laptop or desktop but also into its peripheral devices, including your portable hard drive. Once there it can install ransomware, which locks you out of your files until you pay a ransom to the hacker. The Acronis True Image for Western Digital software preloaded on the My Passport HDD not only helps you schedule automatic backups, it helps protect your entire system from ransomware, and also allows you to password-protect and give your files 256-bit AES encryption.</p>



<h2>Smaller and Faster</h2>
<p>The WD My Passport HDD comes preformatted for Windows, but can easily be reformatted for use with Macs without losing any of its protective features. WD’s given it a slimming-down from its previous models too – this streamlined version of the My Passport is just 3.21 by 4.33 inches, and exceedingly slim, so you can fit up to 5TB of your most essential files in your pocket to take with you anywhere, and its footprint at your desktop or work station is virtually nil.</p>
<p>It connects via USB-A 3.0, but it’s also compatible with USB-A 2.0 devices, and the 5Gbps data transfer speed allows you to move files to or from your PC or Mac laptop or desktop computers quickly and easily. It can be set up for automatic backups, and is also drag-and-drop ready from the time you connect it.</p>
<p>Those digital photos and videos on your computer need protection in the form of a large-capacity, fast, ultra-reliable backup drive that fits in your pocket and comes with advanced protection. So do your financial records and other sensitive personal information. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6185/">The WD My Passport 5TB portable external hard drive — the world’s first 5TB 2.5-inch drive — checks all those boxes, and it’s a great Cyber Week find at just $121 at Amazon.</a></p>

            <p>
Back in October, three weeks out from its release date, Yacht Club Games' first completely new game since the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shovel-knight">Shovel Knight</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mina-the-hollower">Mina the Hollower</a>, was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mina-the-hollower-catches-a-delay-nebulously-beyond-its-previously-seasonally-appropriate-release-date">indefinitely delayed</a>. It still doesn't have a release date, and now in a new report and interview with the studio, it's sounding like the success of Mina is a "make-or-break" moment for Yacht Club Games.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-02/creator-of-hit-game-shovel-knight-is-at-make-or-break-moment">Bloomberg</a>, noting how pivotal it is that Mina does well, studio head Sean Velasco explained that "If we sold 500,000 copies, then we would be golden. If we sold even 200,000, that would be really, really great. If we sold, like, 100,000, that’s not so good." Right now the big thing Yacht Club Games want to avoid is having a repeat of working on Shovel Knight, which in 2014 saw the founder working for months without paychecks.
</p>
<p>
Velsaco did say that "If Mina flops, we'll still be around," so it's not complete doom and gloom, but did note that they would certainly "need more money." Money is kind of the big, obvious issue in the games industry at the moment. Even very notable names like Ron Gilbert are struggling to get funding, with his unnamed Zelda and Diablo inspired RPG having been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/that-zelda-ish-diablo-ish-rpg-monkey-island-designer-ron-gilbert-was-working-on-has-unfortunately-been-canned">canned due to publisher disinterest</a>.
</p>
<p>
The indie scene isn't quite what it was like in 2014 when Shovel Knight first launched. These days it's all <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-are-there-so-many-bloody-roguelikes-or-roguelites-and-what-really-makes-a-game-roguish">roguelikes out the wazoo</a>, very replayable genres that keep people invested for lengthy periods of time, and safer bets than retro throwbacks like Mina the Hollower. Not to mention just how many games come out on Steam every day now. It's a rough time to get someone to tune in in this attention economy.
</p><p>
This report also lined up another potential casualty in this whole affair: that 3D Shovel Knight game that has thus far only been teased. Yacht Club Games had been split into two teams, one for Mina the Hollower, the other this new Shovel Knight. But by 2024 the studio laid off some employees, pausing development on the 3D take on Shovel Knight to focus on Mina. It does sound like at least the studio founders are looking at the game again, but for now, things are a little uncertain for Yacht Club Games.
</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skyblivion">Skyblivion</a>, the massive mod remake of Oblivion in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>'s engine, won't be making its previously announced 2025 release goal, the team behind it have confirmed. Instead, the mod'll be coming out at some point in 2026, giving the team behind it extra time to overcome the final few hurdles and get it polished up.</p>
<p>This news comes a few months after ex-Skyblivion level and world designer Dee Keyes called the 2025 release goal the mod's team set in 2023 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/Kyle%20'Rebelzize'%20Rebel">"pointless and unachievable"</a>. Keyes also accused Skyblivion project lead Kyle 'Rebelzize' Rebel and implementation lead Heavy Burns of rushing the project out the door and mismanaging communication within the team, subsequently sharing more of his perspective on the project in a <a href="https://lynn.gamer-network.net/content/rockpapershotgun/content-article/edit/news/2384155?tab=overview">video interview with RPS sister site Eurogamer</a>. In a response to Keyes' original claims, Heavy Burns asserted that "many of the statements in his post are either misrepresented or just untrue".</p>

<p>That brings us to now and the above video, in which project lead Rebel announces the delay and offers some info on the mod's current state. "Despite the game being in the best state it's ever been, we still have some last challenges to overcome that are going to require a little bit more time," the modder said. "This is something we have known for a while, but we did not want to announce a delay without also sharing our current plans and ambitions for the release of the project.</p><p>So, how's it doing? Well, first of all the creation of its world map is "100% finished", with the team having just released an <a href="https://skyblivion.com/map/">interactive satellite version</a> on their website, so you can scroll around and see what their version of Cyrodiil looks like. Most of the dungeons are done, as are most of the building interiors, though the latter's with the exception of the Imperial City, with that being the last bit of the province which the modders need to pull together. </p>
<p>Their current aim's to have it done by the end of 2025, so quests can be finalised and remaining bits of navmeshing done early in 2026. Navmeshing, for the uninitiated, is the setting up of frameworks which allow NPCs to roam around places without bumping into everything. The modders also have playtesting of mechanics planned for early next year.</p>
<p>"As we move closer to the release date, the goal will be to spend as much time as possible polishing, balancing, and fixing our game for you guys to finally play," Rebel added. "There's no real deadline for this, as I expect we will be working on this until the day of release." Once the mod is out of the door, the lead also mentioned plans to add in some features which haven't made it into the current version, including spellcrafting, dynamic dungeons, and grave robbing. Underwater combat's had to be cut for now, but the modders also hope to potentially add that in down the line.</p>
<p>Hopefully the extra time makes delivering Skyblivion a bit more comfortable for the group, given Keyes' accusations. I'll still be interested in giving it a go whenever it emerges from the Imperial sewers, given the in-depth approach the modders look to have taken in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skyblivion-project-lead-says-release-date-reveals-finally-getting-closer-as-oblivion-remake-mod-shows-off-revamped-intro">reimagining The Elder Scrolls 4</a> with a lot more tweaks and additions than Bethesda's Oblivion Remastered.</p>
