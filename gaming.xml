			<p>Archetype Entertainment has finally shared the first gameplay trailer for its debut title, <a href="https://wccftech.com/exodus-is-an-epic-sci-fi-rpg-from-bioware-vet-james-ohlen-features-matthew-mcconaughey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EXODUS</a>, and it's fair to say it's very reminiscent of Mass Effect. Not that we were expecting anything much different from a studio founded by key BioWare veterans like Creative Director James Ohlen and Lead Writer Drew Karpyshyn.</p>
<p>In the trailer, we saw several brief dialogues between protagonist Juno and some of their companions, not to mention shooting, a grappling hook used in a fight with an armored bear, and even stealth (which was largely absent from Mass Effect). The trailer debuted on a stream hosted by CohhCarnage, where Ohlen and Archetype General Manager Chad Robertson answered several questions about the game.</p>
<p>EXODUS won't be an open world game, focusing on curated missions like in Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic or Mass Effect instead. That said, there'll be room for exploration and optional content.</p>
<p>Described as an action roleplaying game, it will feature a lot of choices for players, the main twist being that they will get to see them impact their own homeworld over the decades and even centuries. The central theme of the game is that Travelers like Juno embark on perilous journeys to distant planets in a desperate effort to recover long-lost technology that could help humanity fight off the Celestials.</p>
<p>In that regard, Ohlen described Juno (who can be a male or female depending on the player's preference) as a blend of Indiana Jones and Dune's Paul Atreides. On one hand, they are explorers who venture into forgotten crypts and lost worlds to uncover precious artifacts; on the other hand, they are also leaders of their civilization, making pivotal choices for the development of humankind.</p>
<p>The aforementioned journeys are conducted at near-lightspeed. As a result, while the trips may take days or weeks for Juno and their team (by the way, they can only take two with them at a time, like in Mass Effect), years or even decades may have passed for those back on the home planet, which should result in some interesting plot progression.</p>
<p><iframe title="EXODUS Gameplay Trailer: 'The Traveler's Creed'" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DmJxSKn47EE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As you would expect in a game made by BioWare vets, EXODUS will feature deep relationships with the player character's companions, some of which will be romanceable. There may well be infighting between them, too, and it will be up to Juno to deal with the potential fallout.</p>
<p>We also got some info on the so-called lifestone, a blend of mineral and live vegetation that Juno can take advantage of while in combat and in exploration. It certainly sounds like this game's version of magic-like powers.</p>
<p>EXODUS is being <a href="https://wccftech.com/exodus-sci-fi-aaa-rpg-will-be-co-developed-by-certain-affinity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">co-developed</a> with the help of Certain Affinity and will be released on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. No date was provided, but the developers teased that it won't be long before we get to see more gameplay. Meanwhile, you can either read the novel <a href="https://amzn.to/4gixKn9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> earlier this year or watch the dedicated 15-minute episode of Blur Studio's Secret Level that just became available for streaming on Amazon Prime Video.</p>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is projected to sell between 15 and 17 million units next year and more than 80 million units by 2028, solidifying its position as the console market leader, while Sony and Microsoft will struggle to gain significant market share with their next-generation systems.</p>
<p>Today, <a href="https://www.dfcint.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DFC Intelligence</a>, the longest-standing research and advisory firm focused exclusively on the video game industry, published its 20245 market report and forecast, projecting major revenue growth for the video game industry for the second half of the decade. Following two years of revenue drop, the market will grow from this year's US$72 billion to US$83 billion in 2028, reaching nearly a third of a trillion dollars by then factoring in PC and console hardware and mobile game revenues. The video game audience is also expected to grow considerably, and nearly half the world is expected to be playing video games by 2027.</p>

<p>In the midst of this projected growth, Nintendo is expected to emerge as the absolute winner of the next console generation with the Nintendo Switch 2 in terms of hardware sales. According to DFC Intelligence, the system will be the most popular next-generation console, thanks to a combination of earlier availability and limited competition. As such, Nintendo's next system is expected to sell between 15 and 17 million units next year and over 80 million units by 2028. The PlayStation 6 and Xbox Next, on the other hand, are expected to fail to significantly increase Sony and Microsoft's market share, and one of the two companies will struggle in a distant third place, depending on which of the two can gain early momentum.</p>

<p>Given how much the Nintendo Switch 2 is being talked about despite the system still having to be officially revealed, these sales projections should surprise no one. The excitement surrounding the system could reach new heights as the new year begins, as Nintendo is reportedly planning not to wait <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-revealed/">much longer</a> to finally provide the first proper look at its next-generation system.</p>

<p>Shift Up has revealed an upcoming holiday update for Stellar Blade, the electrifying action title released by the South Korean studio in April this year. The title competed for trophies in a couple of categories at The Game Awards, and it has been turning heads since it launched on account of the game’s protagonist, Eve.</p>



<p>As you could expect, Eve is the central focus of the holiday update, with Shift Up adding a stack of accessories, a new hairstyle, and a fresh outfit for Eve to equip.</p>



<p>Read on to check out what’s coming in the Stellar Blade holiday update.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-stellar-blade-goes-seasonal">Stellar Blade Goes Seasonal</h2>



<p>In the latest update for Stellar Blade, a slew of holiday-themed assets have been added.</p>



<p>Players can unlock the ‘Santa Dress’, an exclusive outfit for Adam, and other new accessories, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Santa Girl hairstyle</li>



<li>Snow Crystal glasses</li>



<li>Wreath Earrings</li>



<li>Sleigh Earcuff</li>



<li>Rudolf Drone Skin</li>
</ul>



<p>Shift Up has added new BGM to celebrate the Christmas period, and they’ll be playable both in the camp and in certain areas around Zion – in the small plaza and The Last Gulp. Players can also marvel at the seasonal decorations spread around Zion, adding a touch of festivity to the post-apocalyptic slasher.</p>



<p>If you look hard enough in Zion, you’ll find that the target shooting minigame has been adorned with a festive theme, but that’s the most interactive element of this update if I’m being honest.</p>



<p>In addition, the team has made various bug fixes as part of the update – but we don’t care about that, we just want the holiday-themed content.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to unlocking the holiday content in Stellar Blade? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

Since 2017, new Chapter releases (ESO's versions of expansions) have come yearly, including this year's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-online-gold-road-revealed-will-introduce-a-brand-new-daedric-prince-in-june/1100-6520388/" data-ref-id="1100-6520388">Gold Road chapter</a>. That annual model has been "incredibly successful," according to Firor. The massive updates introduced new zones, quests, dungeons, followers, and more. They normally released in June, and much of ESO's schedule was planned around these major content releases, but because of the strict release schedule, didn't allow the team much time for experimentation.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="235108142" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

months. Seasonal updates will include new story content, dungeons, and events. Next year will be a "transition year" for the team, Firor said, and some of the larger updates the team has been working on will still be released alongside the game's new seasonal updates.</p><p dir="ltr">"Freeing up the dev team from needing to adhere to a strict annual cycle means we will be able to have teams launch content when it is ready throughout the year and not work to a date in June--this will let us focus on a greater variety of content spread over the year," Firor said.</p><p dir="ltr">Firor stressed that while the team is moving away from Chapters and its focus will no longer be largely on adding giant new zones, there will still be new story content and, occasionally, new zones. Larger zones will be split across multiple content updates, Firor said, and stories from previous zones will be continued. There will also be new stories focusing on Elder Scrolls factions like the Dark Brotherhood, Fighters Guild, Mages Guild, and Thieves Guild. For those looking forward to a new ESO zone, it sounds like there will still be one coming next year, but Firor said players will have to wait until April to learn more details on how it will work differently from previous zone additions.</p><p dir="ltr">A desire for ZeniMax Online to experiment on new and different types of content is something it's heard from the game's community, Firor said, and 2025 will see some of those experiments come to fruition. They include revamping the Cyrodiil PvP experience to have higher concurrent players by giving classes PvP-specific skills that perform better in the massive-PvP setting, increasing the standard difficulty of combat while out in the open world, more experimental zones, better guild tools, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">Firor additionally said ZeniMax Online will be putting a focus on the game's new and returning player experience moving forward, with visual updates to the game's starting zones, UI improvements, and changes to make it easier for returning players to jump back into the game more quickly.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-online-developers-have-unionized/1100-6528457/" data-ref-id="1100-6528457">ZeniMax Online recently unionized</a>, which parent company Microsoft has voluntarily recognized.

Except you won’t get much holly jolly enjoyment out of most of these “games,” as they are just barely interactive storybooks with AI-generated text or public domain stories included. The ones that aren’t just boring storybooks appear to be bland-looking mobile game ports or hastily developed asset flips. </p><p>And what makes me sad is that as I  dug through all the slop and scams, I saw real games made by small teams trying to break through all the garbage.

<p>Lords of the Fallen 2 is already being eagerly awaited by the community. Today (17), new information about the sequel was revealed by Marek Tyminski, CEO of CI Games, the game’s publisher.</p>



<p>According to Marek, the game has already entered the full production phase with more than 200 developers working on it. </p>



<div><article><p><span>The next game under </span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LordsoftheFallen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#LordsoftheFallen</a><span> has been already under full production for a good part of this year. As of now we have over 200 people full time working on that, both internal team and codev partners.</span></p></article></div>



<p>According to the CEO, the internal forecast is for the game to be released sometime in 2026. The marketing campaign will begin sometime next year. </p>



<p>Hexworks has delivered a very competent Souls-like game that has revitalized the franchise. Surprisingly, as well as making a new game, the studio still manages to find time to support the first game by releasing patches frequently. </p>



<p>The reboot was praised for its unusual realm-crossing mechanics that impacted exploration and direct campaign progression.</p>

<p>Exodus, a new AAA sci-fi RPG from Archetype Entertainment, has been given an electrifying gameplay trailer.</p>



<p>Called “The Traveler’s Creed”, the material shows story scenes, some of the locations we’ll be visiting, breathtaking scenery and, of course, lots of explosions. The game’s budget seems to be quite generous, after all, even a trailer featuring <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exodus-starring-matthew-mcconaughey-gets-new-cinematic-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Matthew McConaughey</a> has been released.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="EXODUS Gameplay Trailer: 'The Traveler's Creed'" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DmJxSKn47EE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In one part of the trailer, we can see a gigantic bear wearing space armor. Crazy, right? The protagonist will also be able to use a grappling hook to move around the environment faster.</p>



<p>Comparisons with Mass Effect are and will be inevitable, after all, part of the Exodus team are veterans who worked on the BioWare franchise. And, well, judging by this initial trailer, fans of Shepard are going to be very happy with Exodus.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, no release date has been announced. The synopsis reads as follows:</p>



<p>“<em>Join the Travelers, as they sacrifice their lives to travel through the Centauri Universe on a dangerous mission to save an isolated Awakened civilization from enslavement by Celestials. Our service – our sacrifice – discovers worlds, seeds hope, breaks empires</em>.”</p>

Earlier this year, Ziff Davis, <em>IGN</em>’s parent company, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/21/24161718/ign-gamer-network-acquisition">acquired a handful of media sites</a> including <em>Eurogamer;</em> <em>Rock, Paper, Shotgun;</em> and <em>VG247</em>. In the time since, there have been staff departures and layoffs <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/gamesindusty-biz-ign-and-humble-losing-talent-due-to-soft-layoffs">including buyouts offered to employees earlier this month</a>. According to <a href="https://aftermath.site/ziff-davis-ign-gamesindustrybiz-humble-buyouts">a report in <em>Aftermath</em></a>, this latest round of buyouts has apparently left <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em>, a site that’s been around for over 20 years, with only one full-time employee.</p><p><em>Restart</em>’s business model isn’t wholly unique. Before it was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/2/24212016/game-informer-shutting-down-layoffs-gamestop">unceremoniously shut down earlier this year</a>, <em>Game Informer</em> magazine was owned and operated by GameStop, and for decades <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/12/24/3800928/nintendo-powers-final-cover">Nintendo ran its own magazine</a>. Other websites like <em>IGN</em>, <em>Polygon</em>, and <em>The Verge</em> also run sponsored content and include affiliate links in articles. To survive in the current digital media landscape, the support of deep-pocketed individuals or corporations is all but required. In this regard, <em>Restart</em> is just like any other publication.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.restart.run/editorial-mission">its editorial mission</a>, “<em>Restart</em> is sponsored by Walmart, but we operate as an independent site.” The mission statement explains that while its articles will feature affiliate links to Walmart products, the site itself will receive no portion of the sale. “We hope you can see this gives us zero incentive to provide biased review scores or other information about a game.”</p><div><p><em>“Restart</em> is sponsored by Walmart, but we operate as an independent site.”</p></div><p>But <em>Restart</em> is also entering a media landscape where the wall between corporate interests and editorial independence has become perilously thin, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/7/23949269/aftermath-video-games-kotaku-defector">with a few rare exceptions</a>, games media has slowly shifted away from providing readers thoughtful discussion and critique to providing a product that can be monetized to hell and back.  That driving ethos is clearly outlined <a href="https://moonrockbiz.substack.com/p/november-2024-exciting-partnerships">in a post by Moonrock on its Substack</a>. “Restart.run serves as a dynamic hub where gaming content meets retail opportunities, allowing gamers to transition effortlessly from discovering new games to purchasing them on Walmart’s platform.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>One of the most <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/squirrel-with-a-gun-is-the-obnoxious-game-we-needed-it-to-be/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">random yet enjoyable games</a> to release in 2024 has a new update. Developer Dee Dee Creations has released a new update for Squirrel With A Gun.</p>



<p>The new Ratatoskr Update sees a new boss, a new platforming level dubbed the “Super Platforming Challenge”, and new styles to find. </p>



<p>“A new rival has arrived and joins forces with Mother &amp; Father to destroy the neighborhood,” the update description reads. “The fight against Ratatoskr is quite unlike the vehicle-based bosses you’ve faced before. The mythical squirrel moves fast, has a variety of ranged and melee attacks, and is a considerably smaller target! Fortunately, you will be granted a special SMG with a magazine of infinite bullets for the occasion.”</p>



<p>The Ratatoskr Update is just the second — the first added Photo Mode to the game — of at least six planned free updates for the game. The next update is an outfit variety pack in February followed by a new Gravity Gun in March. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/squirrel-with-a-gun-post-launch-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rest of the updates</a> are scheduled to come by August 2025.</p>

<p>In our review of the game, we called Squirrel With A Gun “the exact type of obnoxious game it needed to be” with its mix of platforming, puzzles, and fun cutscenes. The game is available for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-dev-confirms-gwent-talks-about-ciris-new-powers/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following the surprising <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-gets-first-trailer-showing-off-cirilla/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teaser trailer</a> for The Witcher IV, CD Projekt RED has begun sharing a few more tidbits about the already massively anticipated open world roleplaying game. We <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-devs-comment-on-ciri-as-the-new-protagonist-explain-that-player-agency-will-be-at-the-center/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> more about Ciri's new role as the protagonist and who's <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-ivs-ciri-has-a-new-voice-actress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voicing</a> her in the new game.</p>
<p>While in Los Angeles for The Game Awards 2024, CD Projekt RED also joined Easy Allies for a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmbhFPninuw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thirty-minute long videocast</a> entirely dedicated to this reveal. To begin with, in case you had any doubts about the presence of the Gwent card mini-game, they've provided reassurance on that front.</p>
<p><em><strong>Gosia Mitręga (VP and Executive Producer):</strong> We really love the game and we also really carefully always listen to the community, which we love. It's an amazing one. I don't think anyone will be disappointed.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Sebastian Kalemba (Game Director):</strong> Yeah, for sure. You know, it's a part of the experience.</em></p>
<p>The conversation then moved on to some of the elements that were glimpsed in the trailer, such as the magic chain summoned by Ciri and her new powers as a whole. On this topic, Kalemba said:</p>
<p><em>The chain is not only a utility tool that comes from the school of the Lynx, but also it's a pretty cool reference to the very first initial trailer we released 20 years ago for Striga, which was inspired heavily by a short story by Andre sap Koski where Geralt is literally using a silver chain to fight a Striga, so that's kind of a segue. That's one thing. The second thing, for those who don't know, Ciri is a pretty special being. She's a Source. That means that she has this Elder Blood, and she's a pretty powerful human. In this world, there's a magic, a Source that you can control and catalyze to create a spell, like Yennefer, Triss, or other mages in this world. Siri, as a powerful Source, after being mutated, is also able to use this magic, as Geralt could use Signs, which are like simplified magic.</em></p>
<p><em>Ciri is literally using energy. Actually, in The Witcher IV trailer, she's taking it out of the water, which is one of the elements that are part of the Source, so she's kind of extracting the energy out of this particular element and catalyzing it to create a bolt to build this opportunity window and defeat the monster.</em></p>
<p>The hosts from Easy Allies also asked about the game's adherence to the various endings players could unlock in the previous installment. Is the one in which Ciri becomes a Witcher the canon ending? Kalemba was vague on this subject, although it seems likely, given what we saw in the trailer.</p>
<p><em>We cannot tell you more right now, but definitely, we will refer to The Wild Hunt endings for sure, because we pay a lot of respect to the canon. For us, canon is Andrzej Sapkowski's literature and, of course, our games.&nbsp;This is one common world. The Witcher IV happens a few years after The Wild Hunt. Geralt will appear, and who knows who else.</em></p>
<p>In the videocast, the CD Projekt RED developers also teased an enhanced monster hunting experience that will be very much core to The Witcher IV. It was also confirmed that the village featured in the trailer, which is located in the far North, will also be in the game.</p>
<p>Needless to say, there is no release date yet for the game. While we patiently wait, stay tuned to get all the latest rumors and news on the project.</p>

            <p>Toy Box sounds like a very Xmassy game, but then you watch a trailer, and realise that it is not very Xmassy at all. It's a free visual novel with a macabre puzzling element. The setup is that you're a toy inspector working for a jovial Grand Toy Maker, his face hidden above the top of the screen. Your job is to disassemble toys - five in all - according to his eldritch written instructions, and either "salvage" them or "sentence" them to the incinerator.</p><!--more-->
<p>The toys can be "sentenced" because the toys appear to be alive. They talk to you and share their memories as you pull them apart. The obvious thing to do is salvage them all - after all, who'd throw a miniature talking ballerina in the furnace? But the toys are Not Nice. Their talk is of suffering and malice, darkness and blood. Some of them have glowing eyes and teeth. And then there's the enigma of the Grand Toy Maker, who returns periodically to evaluate your choices. "It's of the utmost importance that inspectors upkeep the Maker's image," explains <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3341830/TOY_BOX/">the Steam page</a>, not very reassuringly.</p>

<p>I haven't played all of Toy Box because, frankly, the subject matter is too much for me. I mean, look at the content warnings. There's "no explicit imagery of sexual acts", but there is pretty much everything else, including "visual and written depictions" of "Blood, Body Horror, Gore, Death, Unreality, Child Abuse, Pseudo-Jumpscares, Motion Sickness, Flashing Lights, Religious Themes, Swearing, [and] Violence."</p><p>From what I've played, the ghastliness of Toy Box is partly just the fundamental uncanniness of toys, the grey zone they inhabit between objects and companions, though it's possible the eventual and more straightforward twist is that these manky ornaments are possessed. The game doesn't feel gratuitous or pornographic in its handling of the above themes, but it's certainly disturbing: the worst of Pinocchio with a generous helping of FNAF and Thomas Ligotti.</p>
<p>Developers DEADline Studios are "a small POC and Queer-owned studio" who "seek to relay stories about just what it means to be human and dive deeper into the good, the bad, and the downright ugly". There's plenty of the latter here. Their other projects include <a href="https://deadline-co.itch.io/fools-paradise">Fool's Paradise</a>, a satirical horror visual novel with romantic elements.</p>
<p>I'm writing about Toy Box partly because it's been a while since I last had to stop playing a horror game, and partly because I think the premise of telling stories by dismantling objects is wonderful, and I'd like to see more of it. It doesn't have to involve horror - the closest parallel I can think of right now is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hardspace-shipbreaker">Hardspace: Shipbreaker</a>. Which is, I guess, a pretty horrible game in its portrayal of indentured servitude and self-cloning, but at least those spaceships don't beg for mercy when you disassemble them.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But <em>Rivals</em> uses it differently from what you might expect. The game uses Ace two separate ways. One refers to more of a title or status, while the other refers to a specific gameplay situation. The identical naming has certainly caused some confusion for players. </p><h2 id="h3048"><a id="score"></a>What does ‘Ace’ mean on a scoreboard?</h2><p>The first usage of Ace you’ll likely see is on the scoreboard. Check in midway through a match, and you’ll see one player on each team with the word displayed over their character portrait. <strong>Whichever player has the Ace term is essentially the one performing the best.</strong> If they keep the title throughout the match, they’ll likely be who you see as the MVP or SVP. Those familiar with <em>Overwatch</em> will recognize this as similar to the On Fire system.</p><p>The scoreboard is pretty minimal on details for other players otherwise. If you’re wondering how Ace is determined and why someone with fewer kills than you has the title, it’s likely because they made up for it with better heals, more blocked damage, or more time on the objective.</p><h2 id="h3049"><a id="kill"></a>How to get an ‘Ace Kill’</h2><figure id="" data-id="04a980bef0f12a0147c20037a3a1c5bc" data-recommend-id="image://04a980bef0f12a0147c20037a3a1c5bc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1078" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Psylocke runs toward her team during a match, with “Ace!” displayed at the top of the screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Psylocke runs toward her team during a match, with “Ace!” displayed at the top of the screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="04a980bef0f12a0147c20037a3a1c5bc" data-recommend-id="image://04a980bef0f12a0147c20037a3a1c5bc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1078" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Psylocke runs toward her team during a match, with “Ace!” displayed at the top of the screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You’ll also see the term pop up in the middle of your screen during a match sometimes. <strong>It’s a little awkward, but Ace is also used as the name of <em>Marvel Rival</em>’s version of a team kill.</strong> Don’t worry, it’s not like you have to solo the whole team yourself. You’ll be notified that an Ace occurred even if you’re walking back from the respawn area.</p><p>Of course, actively participating and taking out most of the enemy team does feel pretty great. The best way to do this is to work together with your teammates and coordinate your attacks. That’s easier when <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-crossplay-xbox-pc-playstation-1851715183&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-crossplay-xbox-pc-playstation-1851715183">playing with friends</a></span>, but the Ping system is still useful for relaying information. Having one person immobilize the opponents while someone else picks them off is always a great strategy. Making a move when the other team is all concentrated in one area is also a wonderful opportunity to make use of.</p><p><strong>The easiest way to get an Ace kill is to use ultimate abilities at the right moment.</strong> Most will dish out a lot of damage quickly or over a large area. Be smart with them and you can KO multiple players in one go. The following are ones that I’ve seen lead to an Ace kill the most often:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-jeff-the-land-shark-ultimate-ability-1851716962&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-jeff-the-land-shark-ultimate-ability-1851716962">Jeff The Land Shark</a></span> – It’s Jeff!</li><li>Moon Knight – Hand of Khonshu</li><li>Psylocke – Dance of the Butterfly</li><li>Scarlet Witch – Reality Erasure</li><li>Spider-Man – Spectacular Spin</li><li>Storm – Omega Hurricane</li></ul><p>We don’t know if Ace will remain the name for these two situations in <em>Marvel Rivals </em>as the game continues to receive updates. Gaining the Ace status on the scoreboard after helping to get an unrelated-in-name Ace kill is pretty confusing. Either way, I hope you can come away from this with a better understanding of both.

<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket launched Mythical Island and new Themed Collections to give players fresh objectives and rewards to chase. Each collection is different, and there aren’t too many to worry about. We’ve provided this handy guide telling you all about Mythical Island’s Themed Collections and what you need to do.</p>



<p>Themed Collections are another of Pokémon TCG Pocket’s many features. They are passive challenges rewarding you with amazing goodies, allowing you to open packs faster—a win-win! Genetic Apex has a set of Themed Collections, and Pokémon TCG Pocket’s first mini-set—<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mythical-island-set-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mythical Island</a>—has its own.</p>



<p>I’ve made this nice and easy by letting you know how many Mythical Island collections there are to complete, as well as the rewards for doing each.</p>

<p><strong>Pokémon TCG Pocket’s Mythical Island expansion has 13 Themed Collections for you to complete.</strong></p>



<p>These are an entirely new set of Themed Collections from Genetic Apex or any other set in <a href="https://tcgpocket.pokemon.com/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a>. As usual, they require you to <strong>open booster packs</strong>—in this case, for Mythical Island—and collecting certain cards goes a long way to completing Themed Collections.</p>



<p>The reality is, you can’t manufacture the cards you pull for now. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-wonder-pick-exploit-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wonder Picks</a> provide an extra chance to get a card you might need, and it remains to be seen if <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-trading-coming-to-pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-release-date-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trading</a> makes this task easier.</p>

It kicks off with anniversary concerts in Poland and Boston, Massachusetts in May 2025, before a tour of Europe in the fourth quarter of 2025 and then the U.S. in the first quarter of 2026. CD Projekt’s new U.S. hub is in Boston, which explains why the initial anniversary concert takes place there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tickets go on sale soon, CD Projekt said. The full scale of the concert series — as well as ticket information — will be unveiled over time, with more information to be revealed through the official website and newsletter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the official blurb:</p><blockquote>The experience features select tracks from the game and its expansions, arranged for the occasion by The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt composer Marcin Przybyłowicz, who will also join select stops as a special guest. The live celebration is further bolstered by Polish folk metal band Percival, co-composers of the game’s soundtrack, known for their iconic contributions to the game’s sound. Alongside a skilled orchestra, they will bring to life beloved tracks from Geralt’s journey through the continent.</blockquote><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a busy time for CD Projekt.

In many ways it would make sense, given both Tekken and Pac-Man are owned by Bandai Namco, and The Swordsman is an actual humanoid fighter who wields a sword. But what does Harada himself think?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN put that question to the man himself in a recent interview, and his response suggested such a crossover is certainly possible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Perhaps,” Harada responded when asked, “because the game environment would be a good crossover for Tekken, atmosphere-wise.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It turns out that Harada explored the possibility of adding Pac-Man to Tekken as a guest character long before Shadow Labyrinth was a thing. But designs for the character, which saw Pac-Man as a head on a muscular humanoid body, horrified original Pac-Man creator Tōru Iwatani.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Many years ago, Iwatani-san, the original creator of Pac-Man, was still in the company when we were here. And I thought about maybe using Pac-Man as a guest character,” Harada remembered. “So I had the artist come up with a sketch and it turned out to be that the character had like a Pac-Man head, but the body was this really muscular bodybuilder type.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I showed it to Iwatani-san, and Iwatani-san got so upset and scolded me quite heavily. So I was surprised that, ‘Oh, I can't just be quite liberal with the Pac-Man IP, I have to be more constrained.’ At the time I was a bit surprised, but now because of the atmosphere of this [Shadow Labyrinth], it's something that could be considered.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Iwatani, by the way, is apparently fully on board with Bandai Namco’s plan to take the Pac-Man IP in totally different directions. “Iwatani-san seems to realize that that's something that's needed at this point,” Harada added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">2D action platformer Shadow Labyrinth stars The Swordsman, a character whose only goal is to "eat" as they attempt to escape a maze. It’s a Metroidvania of sorts, and a significant departure for the world famous arcade franchise. Meanwhile, Tekken 8 gets Clive from Final Fantasy 16 as a DLC character.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-best-nintendo-game-of-2024.1063563/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-nintendo-game-of-2024<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">2024 will likely be remembered as a transitional year for Nintendo. Last year saw heavy hitters like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Super Mario Bros. Wonder while next year is all about the Nintendo Switch 2, leaving this year in kind of an awkward middle ground. Even so, Switch owners still had a ton of great games to play during the aging console’s eighth year on the market as Nintendo somehow managed to publish a game every single month, while third-party and indie developers continued to support Switch with awesome series revivals and clever new ideas.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While many fans were begging to turn the page to the next generation, Nintendo proved Switch still had enough in the tank for one more year with a surprise Zelda game where you actually play as Princess Zelda, our favorite Mario Party in years, and a whole lot more. These are the best Nintendo games of 2024, starting off with the honorable mentions.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Nintendo Game of 2024</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Honorable Mentions</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">A couple of titles just barely missed out making our top tier or picks for the year. For years, the concept of a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-review">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door remake</a> felt as mythical and unattainable as opening the titular door itself, but Nintendo finally listened to this RPG’s extremely vocal fanbase and delivered a near perfect retelling of Mario’s iconic GameCube quest. It’s remarkable how well The Thousand-Year Door holds up 20 years later, with its hilarious script, satisfying combat, lovable party members, and memorable locations. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mario literally climbs the ranks of a pro wrestling league set on a floating island in the sky, and that’s just the setting for one chapter of this epic adventure. And, following the last few Paper Mario entries that traded in unique, original characters in favor of hordes upon hordes of samey Toads, it’s a complete delight to see the slimy city of Rogueport and its surrounding areas peppered with fresh personalities. Simply giving The Thousand-Year Door a gorgeous new coat of paint and sprinkling in a few quality-of-life improvements has instantly placed it on the list of the best RPGs on Switch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And then there's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble-review">Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble,</a> a stunning return to form for a series that had completely lost its way for the better part of the last two decades. After several misguided attempts to get the monkey ball rolling again, the pieces finally fell into place in Banana Rumble thanks to the tightest controls, physics, and level design the series has seen since Super Monkey Ball 2 in 2003. Tilting the stage to roll your monkey to the finish feels right again, and the new spin dash ability significantly opens up speedrunning and trick shot techniques without feeling like a betrayal to Monkey Ball’s core mechanics like some past gimmicks did.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It doesn’t hold back by the end either, with devilish late-game obstacles that will throw your monkey off the stage dozens of times before you finally break through that sweet, sweet goal. It’s also a fantastic game to play with others, as you can tackle all of Banana Rumble’s 200+ stages in local or online co-op with up to four players. It may not quite soar to the lofty heights of the GameCube originals, but it’s undeniable that Super Monkey Ball is back after years of fall outs, and I’m both shocked and overjoyed I get to say that in 2024.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Runner-Up: Super Mario Party Jamboree</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/17/smp-jam-blogroll-1728690742214-1734443527122.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Now we move onto the runner-ups – the games that narrowly missed out on the top spot. First is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-party-jamboree-review">Super Mario Party Jamboree,</a> one of Nintendo’s finest efforts of 2024, which simultaneously became a go-to multiplayer game on Switch and a standout entry in the longrunning dice-rolling, backstabbing series. It has pretty much everything you’d want from a great Mario Party: a wonderful set of seven boards each with their own unique wrinkles, an incredibly fun and varied set of minigames you’ll want to return to again and again, and a huge roster of 22 playable characters filled with both fan favorites and deep cuts. Plus, if you’ve been on the wrong end of one too many Chance Times or Bowser Revolutions and just can’t take it anymore, the all-new optional Pro Rules offer an alternative take on Mario Party that lessen the luck-based elements and emphasize skill and strategy. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Jamboree is particularly exciting because it’s easily the best original Mario Party game developed by Nintendo Cube, the studio that’s been in charge of the series since 2012’s Mario Party 9. The developers spent years trying to completely transform the Mario Party formula – from putting all four players into a car, to having everyone take their turn at the same time – and it just never really worked. But the Switch era represents a comeback story for the Mario Party series, beginning with Super Mario Party which was a step in the right direction, but still not entirely there. Then, Nintendo Cube returned to the franchise’s greatest hits in Mario Party Superstars, which was a ton of fun, but it wasn’t original content. Finally, the Mario Party comeback arc is complete with new boards, items, and minigames that stand side-by-side with the greats and cement Jamboree as a modern multiplayer classic. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Runner-Up: Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/17/lorelei-blogroll-1719248226107-1734443527122.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">If you like head-scratching, mind-bending puzzle games like Return of the Obra Dinn and The Witness, then <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-review">Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</a> is a must-play to add to your Switch wishlist. Created by Sayonara Wild Hearts developer Simogo, Lorelei and the Laser Eyes features the same unrivaled presentation and atmosphere with a tantalizing mystery to match. The story begins with Lorelei arriving at a creepy, surreal hotel and within minutes you’ll be enraptured by unraveling its greatest mysteries and discovering why she was summoned there in the first place. Our reviewer Tom Marks called it “the closest thing I’ve played to a modernization of what a point-and-click adventure could be,” saying “Its story is enticingly fresh, its vibes perfectly eerie, and the desire it evokes to uncover every inch of its intricately interwoven mystery is irresistible.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s also not afraid to scare you. While it never treads too far into horror game territory, it effectively keeps you on edge with a handful of frightening moments as you dive deeper down its ever-expanding rabbit hole. As Tom said, “Lorelei and the Laser Eyes does do a fantastic job of unsettling you as you go, using its beautiful black-and-white visual style with pops of neon to create haunting, abstract imagery that can sometimes be as anxiety-inducing as any monster.” This is one of the best examples of a small developer bringing a brilliant set of ideas to Switch in 2024, resulting in an unforgettable journey that’s not quite like anything else on the console.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Runner-Up: Unicorn Overlord</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/17/unicornoverlord-review-blogroll-1709773454638-1734443527121.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s been a phenomenal year for RPGs, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/unicorn-overlord-review">Unicorn Overlord</a> is a big reason why. This is a superb high-fantasy strategy RPG from 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim developer Vanillaware, and the developer’s iconic art style is on full display with Unicorn Overlord’s beautifully animated characters and backgrounds, along with some of the most unnecessarily good-looking food we’ve ever seen in a video game. Our reviewer Eric Zalewski said Unicorn Overlord has one of his favorite strategy RPG combat systems ever, praising its unique blend of real-time strategy and turn-based RPG mechanics that result in something entirely new and delightfully deep. You’ll need to expertly maneuver your squads and fully engage with its complex ability system to succeed on the higher difficulties, and our review praised the scenarios you’re thrust into across Unicorn Overlord’s diverse maps, calling the mechanics and gimmicks presented some of the very best in the genre. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unicorn Overlord’s fairly stereotypical story about a prince fighting to take back his kingdom is immaculately presented across five separate arcs that each add vital context to the tale, with Eric saying, “Rather than lengthy exposition or 30-minute lore dumps, its wonderfully realized world is gradually fleshed out by the people you interact with, providing interesting perspectives as you learn the stories of both your allies and your enemies. Its overarching plot may be rather simple as a result, sticking closely to genre tropes, but when paired with a beautiful presentation, even familiar stories manage to feel fresh.” Unicorn Overlord is a special RPG in a year full of them, and proof that some third-party developers are still bringing the good stuff to Nintendo Switch.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Winner: The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/17/zeldaechoesofwisdom-1731393838923-1734443527121.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">There were a lot of great Switch games this year, but in the end it’s tough to beat The Legend of Zelda, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review">Echoes of Wisdom</a> is IGN’s pick for the best Nintendo game of 2024. Echoes of Wisdom marks a lot of exciting firsts for the series: It’s the first new top-down Zelda game on Switch, the first time a Zelda game is played largely without a sword, and most importantly it’s the first time Princess Zelda is the playable character in a mainline entry. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, this isn’t just a traditional adventure where Zelda simply takes the place of Link. Instead, Echoes of Wisdom carves out its own niche in Hyrule’s history thanks to its central copy-and-paste gameplay mechanic where Zelda can summon Echoes of objects and enemies she encounters to solve puzzles and take down powerful foes in unique ways. From plopping down a bed to restore her health with a quick nap whenever and wherever to finally turning the tables and commanding enemies that have been nuisances for years, there’s no shortage of fun, innovative uses for the dozens of Echoes at Zelda’s disposal. It takes a page from Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom by setting players loose to find their own solutions, where the only wrong answers are the ones that don’t work. It only took hours after Echoes of Wisdom’s launch to see crazy improvisational combinations surfacing on social media, like tornado beds and crows endlessly chasing after a chunk of meat just out of their reach, leading to a pretty reliable form of flight.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Echoes of Wisdom doesn’t entirely return to the classic top-down setup that a lot of longtime fans miss, but it takes several half steps that bridge the gap between the modern formula and the old favorites. Hyrule is littered with Heart Pieces to find, warm orchestral melodies accompany nearly every step of the journey, and many characters, locations, and other references make Echoes of Wisdom feel like a love letter to cherished Zelda games like A Link to the Past, Ocarina of Time, and many others. With Echoes of Wisdom, Nintendo once again took the Zelda series in a bold, unexpected direction, giving Hyrule’s princess her long-awaited starring role with new gameplay concepts we never could have imagined beforehand, and that’s why it’s our pick for the best Nintendo game of the year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Let us know what your pick is for the best Switch game of the year, and be sure to check out all of the other categories for the 2024 IGN Awards.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/ex-starfield-dev-surprised-by-how-much-loading-the-game-launched-with<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the big criticisms <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/starfield">Starfield</a> players have with the game is the over-abundance of loading screens. When Bethesda’s sci-fi epic launched last year, fans were surprised by just how often you’d trigger loading, from on-foot traversal to simply heading into city buildings. Players said Starfield’s loading broke immersion and added frustrating pauses to gameplay, and modders have worked to remove as much of it as possible over the past year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/starfield/Neon_City_Guide">city of Neon</a> was a particular focus of loading complaints. This cyberpunk-style urban area would often trigger a loading screen just for opening doors, some near to each other, which made questing annoying.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But did it have to be this way? In an interview with <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/features/veteran-starfield-developer-surprised-by-sheer-number-loading-screens/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VideoGamer.com</a>, developer Nate Purkeypile, who worked at Bethesda Game Studios from 2007 before leaving in 2021 to found Just Purkey Games, revealed his surprise at the sheer amount of loading the game ended up launching with, particularly in the city of Neon.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/17/starfield-neon-city-core-1734446210120.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Did the city of Neon need to launch with so much loading?</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“It could have existed without those [loading zones],” Purkeypile said. “Like, some of those were not there when I had been working on it and so it was a surprise to me that there was as many as there were.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, why did Starfield launch with so many loading screens? Purkeypile said part of the segmentation of the game has to do with the way the Creation Engine, which Bethesda uses to make its games, works, and that has a lot to do with performance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“A lot of it is gating stuff off for performance in Neon,” Purkeypile confirmed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But what about New Atlantis, Starfield’s main city? It was designed with its train system in mind, but doesn’t let you sit on the train as it takes you from A to B. Instead, you get another loading screen. That decision, Purkeypile suggested, was more about having players not just sit there for the train ride.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Starfield Update Screenshots - gamescom ONL 2024</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Purkeypile was lead lighting artist and senior world artist on Starfield and left Bethesda two years before the game launched, one year before its original release date, and a month before <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/starfield-redfall-delayed-2023">its high-profile delay to 2023 was announced</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ahead of Starfield’s launch, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesdas-todd-howard-confirms-starfield-performance-and-frame-rate-on-xbox-series-x-and-s">Bethesda development chief Todd Howard revealed that the game would release locked at 30 frames per second on both Xbox Series X and S</a> to ensure “consistency” of performance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think it'll come as no surprise, given our previous games, what we go for,” Howard said at the time. “Always these huge, open worlds, fully dynamic, hyper detail where anything can happen. And we do want to do that. It's 4K in the X. It's 1440 on the S. We do lock it at 30, because we want that fidelity, we want all that stuff. We don't want to sacrifice any of it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Fortunately in this one, we've got it running great. It's often running way above that. Sometimes it's 60. But on the consoles, we do lock it because we prefer the consistency, where you're not even thinking about it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And we don't ever want to sacrifice that experience that makes our games feel really, really special. So it feels great. We're really happy with how it feels even in the heat of battle.

                <p dir="ltr">The Nightlord will apparently pluck foes from the past to stop players in Elden Ring: Nightreign.

                <p>Talk to most collectors and they'll tell you that the pandemic almost five years ago changed the way people buy and sell collectibles. Pokemon cards were heavily affected and some big chain retailers like Target had to limit the number of packs they could sell to customers. They've become such a hot commodity that Japan's news media has reported that the mob is using cards to assist in laundering money.</p><p>As Shunkan Gendai online reports (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/nongaming-news/pokemon-cards-are-so-valuable-that-criminals-are-using-them-to-launder-dirty-money-japanese-media-reports/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>), criminals have been turning their dirty money into Pokemon cards. The cards' portable size makes them easy to hide and transport, and then they resell the cards, converting their profits into local currency.</p><p>"Many criminals who commit bank transfer fraud are converting the money they steal into Pokemon cards. Shady money can't be deposited in a bank, and there's a high risk of it being stolen if you hold it in cash," a former high ranked crime family member explained. "Pokemon cards are easy to hide, and if you take them overseas and cash them there, you can't get tracked down."</p><p>Criminals have also gotten smarter with what to look out for and feel for when trying to get the more valuable cards. With the chances of getting sought-after Pokemon-ex cards rare already, criminals are now using metal detectors to get a hit on the foil from the card. They're also implementing highly sensitive weighing devices to determine if an unopened pack contains a rare foil card.</p><p>In 2022, YouTuber and WWE performer Logan Paul bought a graded Pikachu Illustrator card for $5.7 million, making it the most expensive card ever sold. The Pikachu Illustrator was only awarded to the winners of the Original Illustration Contest in Japan, with only 20-39 known copies ever released. Similarly graded cards are priced on <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/362931142416" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">eBay for $2-$4 million</a>.</p>
