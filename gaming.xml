        <p>Who is she? Where did she come from? Is the AI offering her advice an ally or an enemy?</p><p>After surviving life-or-death battles against mechanical weapons, what lies ahead for Willow?</p><p><strong>■ Characters</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Willow Martin</strong> (voiced by Fairouz Ai) – The protagonist who has no memory of her past. Although she can’t remember anything, she gets caught up in battles against mechanical weapons. Her body moves instinctively, and she displays exceptional combat skills. Will she be able to escape her confined space and recover her lost memories?</li><li><strong>AI</strong> (voiced by Junichi Suwabe) – A mysterious entity that suddenly starts speaking to Willow through her intercom. Despite sensing some hidden agenda in the voice calling itself “AI,” Willow ends up hearing it out. Who is this being, and why is it helping Willow?</li></ul></blockquote><div id="carousel_941282"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>■ System</strong></p><p>Escape from the loop of repeated death.</p><p>With a high difficulty that even advanced players will find challenging, death is not the end.</p><p><strong>Willow Awakens in a Mysterious Research Facility and is Attacked by Armed Machines</strong></p><p>When Willow dies, she loses her weapons and must restart the stage from the beginning. Evade the relentless bullet barrage, gather powerful weapons, and launch your counterattack.</p><p>Enemies are armed machines. Fight off the numerous mechanical weapons that attack you.</p><p>Each enemy has its own method of attack, so determine the right strategy to avoid taking hits.</p><p><strong>The Further You Progress, The Stronger the Enemies Become… Including Huge Biological Weapons</strong></p><p>Use actions to gain the upper hand:</p><ul><li><strong>Mirage Shift</strong> – An ability that breaks down the body into data and transports it to a separate space. In addition to passing through attacks, it can be used to quickly move short distances or through the air.</li><li><strong>Striker</strong> – A weapon mounted on your armor’s fist. Upon activation, it charges toward the target, dealing significant damage upon impact. It requires close proximity, making it risky, but the damage dealt is substantial.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer and a set of gameplay videos below.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-growth-indiana-jones-great-circle-call-of-duty-hardware-falls<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle records 4 million players.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">During today's Q2 investors call, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella revealed that Indiana Jones and The Great Circle has reached 4 million players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an otherwise ho-hum earnings report for its gaming division, a bright spot appears to be MachineGames' newest release which has garnered critical acclaim, multiple awards, and now millions of players. While sales numbers are hard to pin down given its availability on Xbox Game Pass, 4 million is still an impressive number of players considering not many people knew exactly what to expect in a modern, AAA Indiana Jones game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We loved it ourselves, calling it an "irrestistable and immersive global treasure hunt," along with nominations for Game of the Year and Best Xbox game. You can read our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">full review here</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere in Xbox land, Microsoft confirmed that Game Pass PC grew 30%  last quarter and set a new quarterly revenue record. On the cloud gaming side, 140 million hours of streaming has been logged. All this helped Xbox content and service revenue grow 2%.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's still work to be done however. While the Game Pass figures were stronger than expected, overall gaming revenue declined 7% and Xbox hardware revenue declined 29%.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What does this all mean? Well, Microsoft still has ground to make up in the console and hardware space, but its continued investment into Game Pass appears to be paying off. Game Pass growth on PC makes sense given Xbox had a slate of big game releases last quarter that includes Indiana Jones but also Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Microsoft Flight Simulator. All of which were available on Game Pass day one for Ultimate subscribers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Andrew joined The Verge in 2012, writing over 4,000 stories.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/12/12454434/no-mans-sky-diaries"><em>No Man’s Sky</em> has always been big</a>, but the game’s newest update sounds like it will expand things considerably. According to developer Hello Games, the update will introduce “billions of new solar systems and trillions of new planets.”</p><p>The update is called <em>Worlds Part II</em>; <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/17/24200072/no-mans-sky-next-update-worlds-part-1">it follows <em>Worlds Part I </em>from last year</a>, which made the game’s planets more detailed and realistic. In addition to increasing the sheer scale of planets and systems available to explore, the new update also adds more biomes and terrain types. Here are some of the highlights, via Hello Games cofounder Sean Murray:</p><div><ul><li><span>“Terrain is more detailed and far more varied with huge mountains and these massive features.”</span></li><li><span>“Gas giants are truly epic, ten times bigger than our biggest planet. It’s truly end-game stuff to explore them with huge storms that rage across the surface.”</span></li><li><span>“New tech allows oceans that can be several kilometers deep. A new lighting system makes them look so different. New caustics, light shafts and the deeper that you explore the darker it gets.”</span></li></ul></div><p>There are also new alien creatures, about which Murray says, “I think we’ve gone probably weirder than ever before.” <em>Worlds Part II</em> sounds like it would be a huge update for any release, let alone one that’s approaching its 10th anniversary. As with all of <em>No Man’s Sky</em>’s many previous updates, it will be free for all players — and you can download it today. Check out the full patch notes <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/worlds-part-ii-update">right here</a>.</p><p>According to Murray, some of these features come from tech that was created for the studio’s next game, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23990841/hello-games-light-no-fire-trailer">the fantasy adventure <em>Light No Fire</em></a>. “The team is extremely busy on <em>Light No Fire</em>,” he explains. “Each time we push our engine to new places though we have this urge to share it with the community, with <em>No Man’s Sky</em>.”</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/does-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-have-early-access/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 having Early Access would go a long way to shortening the seven-year wait for a sequel. The first game was a blockbuster success and has kept fans entertained for years. The time has come for a new title though, but you want to know if you can play it early, and we know.</p>



<p>Warhorse Studios believes in the “bigger is better ideology.” The sequel is bigger, the development team working on the game is bigger, and it has a bigger weapon pool. It’s just <em>bigger</em>. The first game has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold over 8 million units</a>, so it’s obvious the interest is there—hence the Early Access discussion.</p>



<p>Early Access is all the rage. Everyone wants everything now. Let’s see if you can have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-date-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</a>. </p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-early-access">Can You Play Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 Early Access?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We’ll have to pass on that drink for now. Credit to Warhorse Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 doesn’t feature any form of Early Access, meaning the only way to play KC2 is to wait for the worldwide launch.</strong></p>



<p>Warhorse Studios hasn’t commented on Early Access, which isn’t ideal. Worse still, we’ve seen every Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 edition, and while they come with a whole host of luxurious benefits for launch and after KC2’s release, <strong>there’s no Early Access</strong>.</p>



<p>Why is this? I don’t know. There does seem to be a trend of games with close communities and titles geared toward players (and not microtransactions) foregoing modern-day business practices—Early Access being one. The developer has opted not to have Early Access, and potentially use the benefit as a way to flog more expensive editions.</p>



<p>Lots of this is speculation on my part. However, one thing not up for debate is there is no Early Access.  </p>



<h2 id="h-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-editions">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 Editions</h2>



<p><strong>There is a Standard Edition, Gold Edition, and Collector’s Edition for Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 if you want more out of the experience.</strong></p>



<p>Each one ramps up the price, but also the content included. To iterate, none of them have Early Access. But you can check out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-editions-collectors-edition-gold-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">every Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 edition</a> to see if any catch your eye. </p>



<p>Plus, securing your copy early is a surefire way to guarantee the inviting <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-editions-collectors-edition-gold-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pre-order bonus</a> too.</p>



<hr>



<p>I’m sorry if you were hoping for better news. At least it isn’t long now until the February 4 release date, and you can make the Kingdom of Bohemia your own. Let us know the first thing you’re going to do in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 in the comments below.</p>



<p>We’ve answered many other questions about the sequel too including if it’s coming to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-coming-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Game Pass</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-big-is-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-map/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how big the map is</a>, and what the game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-post-launch-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post-launch roadmap</a> plans are looking like.</p>

                <p>There's an ongoing debate as to whether Microsoft's Game Pass hurts or helps sales of titles that are available on the service. But as far as id Software co-founder and Doom co-creator John Romero is concerned, Game Pass is beneficial to the video game industry.</p><p>Via <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/news/doom-creator-loves-xbox-game-pass" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">True Achievements</a>, Romero was recently interviewed by <a href="https://youtu.be/sBOMxyuyQeQ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Expansion Pass</a>, and he was effusive with his praise for Game Pass.</p><p>"I love it," said Romero. "I mean, who doesn't love Game Pass? It's Netflix for games; who doesn't want that? It's great because it's try before you buy... one thing after another thing. Really the barrier for people to play games is just access to those games. Even free-to-play games, it's like, knowing that those games exist, and Game Pass is like 'Here they are!'"</p><p>Romero went on to add that Game Pass "doesn't hurt the game companies that made those games," because players get to experience titles more quickly even if they don't keep them. It's unclear if Romero feels this way even about games that launch on Game Pass at the same time that they hit stores. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-campaign-review/1900-6418306/" data-ref-id="1900-6418306">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> was seemingly unaffected by its availability on Game Pass, and it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2024s-best-selling-games-in-the-us/2900-5106/" data-ref-id="2900-5106">the top-selling game in America for 2024</a>. Conversely, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review-im-making-this-up-as-i-go/1900-6418322/" data-ref-id="1900-6418322">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> only debuted at No. 14 on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/indiana-jones-enters-the-20-best-selling-games-in-the-us-for-december-but-black-ops-6-is-still-no-1/2900-6157/" data-ref-id="2900-6157">December 2024's list of best-selling games</a>. That game may have also been hampered by the fact that its PlayStation 5 port won't arrive until later this spring.</p><p>Although Romero didn't work on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6526483/" data-ref-id="1100-6526483">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>, that title will be a day-one release on Game Pass when it arrives on May 15. And unlike Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, it will also be hitting PlayStation 5 at the same time as its debut on Xbox Series X|S.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/behind-monster-hunter-wilds-new-approach-to-starting-weapons-and-hope-series-gear-ign-first<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The Hope set proves that you're a chosen hunter.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you ask players what gets them excited about the <em>Monster Hunter</em> series, some will surely bring up making new equipment utilizing materials gathered on their hunts. Just about every hunter has felt the joy of completing a head-to-toe armor set with a matching weapon after hunting the same monster again and again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Equipment in the Monster Hunter series has followed a certain concept ever since its earliest games: Beat the monsters and take on their power through equipment crafted from their remains. Players rely on their own strength to slay powerful monsters, then make those monsters' abilities their own to grow even stronger.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with IGN, Monster Hunter Wilds Executive Director and Art Director Kaname Fujioka explains the concept behind Monster Hunter's equipment. "While the range of our designs has now grown broader, we used to be very conscious of the kind of idea that if you're wearing Rathalos' equipment, you'll look like Rathalos." This new title sees new monsters as well, each bringing its own colorful equipment. For example, Rompopolo, a monster whose design is meant to evoke a mad scientist, has a unique piece of head armor that looks like a plague doctor's mask. You can see the armor set in the hunt video below. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But among all of these distinctive sets of monster equipment, the developers say they want players to pay special attention to the various pieces of starting equipment that your hunter begins the game wearing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I designed the starting weapons for all 14 weapon types from scratch,” says Fujioka. “That's the first time I've done this, as far as I can remember. Until now, players would begin the game as a new hunter, and so they would tend to start with truly primitive and simple weapons. But as the protagonist is a chosen hunter in this game, it actually wouldn't feel right for them to be carrying a plain weapon. I wanted to make it feel like you're a bit of a star, even when you're only carrying starting equipment."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/29/artwork-hope-01-1738182813355.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Hope armor and weapon concept art. Courtesy Capcom.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter Wilds Director Yuya Tokuda adds, “Incidentally, weapon designs in Monster Hunter: World generally retained a certain form, but they featured a customized appearance based on which monster materials were used. However, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/in-monster-hunter-wilds-every-weapon-has-its-own-unique-design-ign-first">in Wilds, each weapon has its own unique design.</a>”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These starting weapons are designed in order to reflect the story that you are an experienced hunter, selected to investigate the Forbidden Lands. Tokuda adds that the starting armor is also full of attention to detail on the part of the creators so that it matches the story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The starting armor for this game is called the Hope series,” he says. “The design looks incredibly cool, to the point where I think you could even use it until the very end and it wouldn't feel out of place."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/29/artwork-hope-02-1738182817211.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Hope armor concept art. Courtesy Capcom.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With its deep emerald green base color, the Hope set turns into an outfit with a hooded long coat once completed. Fujioka explains that constructing the set wasn't simple, with each part standing alone while also coming together to create a full ensemble.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We've actually given more attention to the Hope series than any other equipment in this game,” he says. “Previous games in the series have had separate upper-body and lower-body armor, and we couldn't actually depict them coming together to create something like a coat. We just had to make each piece its own part due to gameplay design and how the game managed it, but I wanted to see if we could make a single flowing hooded coat. We made that happen in this game by investing a lot of in-game resources into it. Of course, players will find lots of different pieces of equipment as they proceed through the game, and we do also want them to keep trying out one new weapon after the next. That's why we attempted to make the Hope series one that doesn't stand out too much but still has a sense of elegant coolness."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's quite a luxury to be able to start a game with equipment that creators have put so much effort and thought into. These 14 starting weapons and the Hope series have been carefully made to look like the kind of equipment that an impressive star hunter would wear. We're excited to take a close look at all their detail in the finished game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter Wilds is scheduled for release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and PC on February 28.

Though we’ve seen a handful of weapons from Wilds, we haven’t seen quite enough to make a determinative verdict on our own about their general design philosophy–but now, Monster Hunter Wilds Director Yuya Tokuda has cleared up this question. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">When speaking about the Hope series armor and weapons, Tokuda told us: “Incidentally, weapon designs in Monster Hunter: World generally retained a certain form, but they featured a customized appearance based on which monster materials were used. However, in Wilds, each weapon has its own unique design.” </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The direct comparison to how weapon designs were in Monster Hunter: World answers the question clearly–we don’t have to worry about weapons looking too similar to each other in Monster Hunter Wilds. And though some weapons in Monster Hunter: World eventually upgraded to the point of being entirely unique, many lines weren’t so lucky. You can see in the image below just how similar the final aqua line Sword and Shield is to the final Pukei-Pukei sword and shield, and how similar the final bone line long sword is to the final Jyuratodus long sword, for example. These were the most upgraded versions of these weapons when Monster Hunter: World first released. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/29/monster-hunter-world-weapons-1738181673291.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">From Monster Hunter World, captured on the PS4. </figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Compare those to the designs we’ve seen in Monster Hunter Wilds so far in the slideshow below.

                <p>Dead Space has seen a number of spin-off novels and comics, but most of them have been out of print for years. It was announced in 2024 that reprints would be arriving soon--and we’re quickly approaching their arrival. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1787745384?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dead Space Vol. 1</a> releases on March 11, marking its first reprint since 2013.

You can read more about all the upcoming Dead Space books and graphic novels below, along with links to preorder. Note that reserving preorders through Amazon means you won’t pay until the items ship. If prices drop between now and release, you’ll also only be on the hook for the lower price. </p><div title="6529104 - Dead Space Novels and Graphic Novels Preorders" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3116" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6529104 - Dead Space Novels and Graphic Novels Preorders" data-collection="">                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1787745384?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/1787745384?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1787745384?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Dead Space Vol. 1</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1787745384?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/1787745384?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1787745384?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$18 | Releases March 11</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>The first graphic novel in the series follows P-SEC Sgt.

With just a day to go until <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-2-walkthrough-9356">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a> swings onto PC, Sony has shared details of its platform-enhanced features, as well as the hardware required to run it.
</p>
<p>
Digital Foundry <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-marvels-spider-man-2-on-ps5-pro-upgrading-insomniacs-masterpiece">called</a> Marvel's Spider-Man 2 a "new showcase" for visual detail and ray tracing when it released for PS5 in 2023, and its new PC version - ported by the Sony-owned Nixxes - is looking to build on that with a range of platform-focused additions.
</p>
<p>
In its <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/01/29/marvels-spider-man-2-pc-features-and-ray-tracing-options-detailed-out-tomorrow/">Marvel's Spider-Man 2 PC blog post</a>, for instance, Sony highlights, "new raytracing options with individual quality settings to finetune performance and fidelity across a broad range of hardware configurations". There's also talk of settings for raytraced interiors, shadows, and ambient occlusion - adding what Sony calls "an additional layer of believability with realistic shadows and increased depth to the game".

<p>
Players with beefy enough hardware can additionally take advantage of an increased raytracing geometry detail setting, which enables higher quality meshes for raytracing. There's also an object range slider, enabling users to manually adjust the range at which objects are considered for raytracing, as well support for DLSS Ray Reconstruction, and DLSS 3 and FSR 3.1 for upscaling and frame generation. Additionally, PC players who like their monitors <em>long</em> get ultra-wide support, at ratios including 21:9, 32:9, and 48:9.
</p><p>
All of which brings us to Marvel's Spider-Man 2's PC system requirements, with Sony's minimum specification targeting 720p at 30fps on Very Low settings. Those with considerably more powerful hardware (which is to say, an RTX 4090 and i9-12900K/Ryzen 7 7800X3D) can aim for 60fps at 4K resolutions, using Very High Ray Tracing Ultimate settings. Full recommended PC specs can be found below.
</p>
<p>
Marvel's Spider-Man 2 releases for PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2651280/Marvels_SpiderMan_2/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/marvels-spider-man-2">Epic</a> on Thursday, 30th January - and as we recently learned, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-pulls-controversial-psn-account-requirements-for-marvels-spider-man-2-and-other-games-on-pc">won't require a PSN account to play</a> after all.

            <p>
Amid reports of potential layoffs at BioWare, studio general manager Gary McKay has confirmed "many" employees have now been moved elsewhere in EA following the completion of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> - and that a remaining core team, which includes a number of now-confirmed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> veterans, is fully focused on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect-5">Mass Effect 5</a>.
</p>
<p>
In <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2025/01/29/bioware-studio-update/">statement shared on BioWare's website</a>, McKay said the studio was currently "preparing for [its] next chapter", with a "core team" lead by Mike Gamble, Preston Watamaniuk, Derek Watts, and Parrish Ley now working on the next Mass Effect. However (reflecting <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-5-isnt-ready-to-suddenly-have-a-team-of-250-300-people-working-on-it-now-dragon-age-the-veilguard-is-done">comments made by former studio veteran Mark Darrah</a> last week), McKay said the project is still at a stage that doesn't "require support from the full studio".
</p>
<p>
As a result, BioWare has downsized to what McKay calls a "more agile, focused studio". And while no specific numbers were shared, the move appears to have impacted a substantial number of staff, with McKay saying BioWare has been working to "match many of our colleagues with other teams at EA that had open roles that were a strong fit."

<p>
However, while McKay's statement dances around any mention of layoffs, IGN <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mass-effect-5-bioware-doesnt-require-support-from-the-full-studio-ea-moves-some-staff-to-other-teams">reports</a> a second group of BioWare employees also had their roles terminated but weren't placed in new positions - EA instead giving them time to apply for new jobs within the company if they wanted to. The publisher failed to provide much clarity in a follow-up statement to IGN, saying it would not be "sharing numbers", but that BioWare now "has the right number of people in the right roles to work on Mass Effect at this stage of development."
</p><p>
Today's BioWare studio update comes a week after what <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/looks-like-dragon-age-the-veilguard-just-received-its-final-major-update">appeared to be Dragon Age: The Veilguard's final patch</a>, and follows EA's recent admission the fantasy RPG had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-ea-sports-fc-25-and-dragon-age-the-veilguard-underperformed-as-it-lowers-financial-forecast">generated lower-than-expected interest</a>. Mass Effect 5 (or whatever it's eventually named) was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-says-a-brand-new-mass-effect-game-is-in-development">confirmed to be in the "early stages" of development</a> back in 2020.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/29/bioware-is-downsizing-mass-effect-4/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>BioWare Gnereal Manager Gary McKay has confirmed that the studio has been “downsizing” following the release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/10/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review/">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> last year and prior to spinning up full development of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mass-effect-4">the next Mass Effect game</a>.</p>
<p>Pre-production on a game typically requires a smaller core team, and McKay states that “[BioWare] are taking this opportunity between full development cycles to reimagine how we work at BioWare. […] Given this stage of development, we don’t require support from the full studio.”</p>


<p>That’s seemingly coded phrasing for job losses, though he does assert that “over the past few months to match many of our colleagues with other teams at EA that had open roles”. Hopefully job losses alongside that have actually been minimal, and we hope anyone affected is able to find new work soon.</p>
<p>This is a sign of where the new Mass Effect game is at, and an indication that it will be several years away from release. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/11/08/mass-effect-4-teaser-marks-the-return-of-an-old-enemy/">Having been teased back in 2021</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/11/07/bioware-tease-next-mass-effect-game-with-a-new-image/">and again in 2022</a>, we’ve known for years that a team led by Mike Gamble is in pre-production on the next game. We might have hoped that this would allow for production to scale up following Dragon Age: The Veilguard’s release, but it seems BioWare isn’t quite there yet.</p>
<p>While well received by critics, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/23/ea-cuts-financial-forecasts-as-ea-sports-fc-25-dragon-age-the-veilguard-underperform/">Dragon Age: The Veilguard underperformed EA’s expectations</a>, leading to a cut in financial forecasts – EA Sports FC 25 had a bigger share of the blame, to be fair. Additionally, BioWare released what seems to be <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard/news/patch-5-release-notes">the last major update for Veilguard last week</a>, winding down active support to only bug fixes for game-breaking issues.</p>

<p>Here’s the statement from Gary McKay:</p>
<p>Hello Everyone,</p>
<p>Today, we are turning towards the future and preparing for the next chapter in BioWare’s story. As we announced in <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2023/08/23/an-update-on-the-state-of-bioware/">August 2023</a>, we are changing how we build games to meet the needs of our upcoming projects and hold ourselves to the highest quality standards.</p>
<p>Now that Dragon Age: The Veilguard has been released, a core team at BioWare is developing the next Mass Effect game under the leadership of veterans from the original trilogy, including Mike Gamble, Preston Watamaniuk, Derek Watts, Parrish Ley, and others.</p>
<p>In keeping with our fierce commitment to innovating during the development and delivery of Mass Effect, we have challenged ourselves to think deeply about delivering the best experience to our fans. We are taking this opportunity between full development cycles to reimagine how we work at BioWare.</p>
<p>Given this stage of development, we don’t require support from the full studio. We have incredible talent here at BioWare, and so we have worked diligently over the past few months to match many of our colleagues with other teams at EA that had open roles that were a strong fit.</p>
<p>Today’s news will see BioWare become a more agile, focused studio that produces unforgettable RPGs. We appreciate your support as we build a new future for BioWare.</p>
<p><em>Gary McKay</em></p>

                <p>With its release coming in just one day, Insomniac Games and Nixxes have <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/01/29/marvels-spider-man-2-pc-features-and-ray-tracing-options-detailed-out-tomorrow/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">revealed</a> the PC requirements for Marvel's Spider-Man 2. The specs do not require for a ray-tracing-compatible GPU, as has been the case with some recent and upcoming games such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-pc-specs-revealed-requires-ray-tracing-compatible-gpu/1100-6528993/" data-ref-id="1100-6528993">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-run-on-your-pc-check-out-the-requirements/1100-6528208/" data-ref-id="1100-6528208">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>.</p><p>Insomniac provided six different preset levels, three without ray tracing and three without. Those with beefier PCs can enable ray tracing for more realistic reflections. A slider allows you to adjust the range at which objects are considered for ray tracing reflections. If you're hoping to play on more modest hardware, the low end--which is for Very Low graphics settings and 720p resolution at 30fps--only calls for a GTX 1650 or RX 5500 XT.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/601473/nvidia-rtx-5080-5090-gpu-preorder-buy-price-release-date-availability-founders-edition<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>While Nvidia’s RTX 50-series graphics cards weren’t the zaniest devices at CES 2025, they stole the show with their promised groundbreaking performance breakthroughs. The RTX 5070, in particular, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24338999/nvidia-rtx-5070-vs-rtx4090-performance-price">made headlines as a card that can supposedly rival an RTX 4090 for just $549</a>. We later learned it uses <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337402/nvidia-dlss-4-upscaling-announcement-ces-2025">DLSS 4’s AI-powered multi frame generation</a> to achieve that in supported titles, but that’s a welcome compromise for those who can’t find room in their budget for the beefier 4K-ready GPUs that are going up for sale at 9AM ET on January 30th — including the $999.99 RTX 5080 and the $1,999.99 RTX 5090.</p><p>Those premium cards are capable of greater raw performance, however. In our <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/598045/nvidia-rtx-5080-review-test-benchmark">RTX 5080 review</a>, we found it’s only about 15 percent faster than the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23457556/nvidia-rtx-4080-gpu-graphics-card-benchmark-test-review">RTX 4080</a> it’s replacing. Meanwhile, the benchmarks we ran for our <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24349619/nvidia-rtx-5090-review-test-benchmark">RTX 5090 review</a> averaged 28 percent better frame rates compared to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23398201/nvidia-rtx-4090-review-test-benchmark">RTX 4090</a> for 4K games running at their highest settings with no frame generation help. That’s still impressive given the Founder’s Edition is small enough that it will <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24349976/nvidia-rtx-5090-fe-small-form-factor-sff-hands-on">fit inside a small form factor PC case</a>. No matter which you’re after, you’ll be exceedingly satisfied if you’re upgrading from an RTX 30-series card or older.</p><p>Between resellers and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/598793/nvidia-rtx-5090-5080-low-stock-warning">forewarned scarcity</a> that’s soured past launches, you’ll likely need a good game plan to secure a 50-series GPU early on. If you aren’t already in line at a brick-and-mortar location, it might be a little too late to find day one stock based on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Microcenter/comments/1iaunns/campers_already_appeared/">encampments that have spawned</a> over the past several days, but we’ll show you where to preorder one online when they become available tomorrow morning.</p><div><h2>Tips to increase your chances</h2><section><p>It’s typically faster to use a desktop or a laptop to click around and input whatever information you need. If you can, use a computer with an ethernet connection to ensure nothing interferes with your network. Bonus points if you use an ultrawide or multiple monitors to view several browser windows at once.</p></section><section><p>Some retailers may implement a wait queue. You can use your smartphone, tablet, or another secondary device to try and get a faster queue time. It can also serve as a failsafe between refreshes if one of the sites slows to a crawl on your desktop. That said, your smartphone should only be a last result to using a PC, as you don’t want to waste time juggling multiple tabs and apps or tapping away at tiny input fields.</p></section><section><p>The last thing you’ll want to be doing when the floodgates open on January 30th is fiddling with passwords and a deluge of confirmation emails. Make sure you have an account with each retailer that’s expected to carry the graphics cards, and do so ahead of launch.</p></section><section><p>If possible, you’ll also want to add your shipping and billing details in advance. This way, you’ll only have to worry about adding the GPU to your cart and completing the final checkout steps.</p></section><section><p>Both Best Buy and Nvidia allow you to sign up to be notified when the GPUs become available. B&amp;H Photo actually requires you to sign up in advance if you want to order one. Be sure to sign up for alerts on each variant of the 5080 or 5090 that you’re planning to buy.</p></section><section><p>You don’t want to rely solely on email notifications for stock alerts, as they’re often delayed and you risk missing your chance. Be sure to load up tabs for each retailer shortly before their listings go live, and then practice hitting that refresh button as fast as humanely possible.</p></section></div><div><p id="where-to-preorder-the-nvidia-rtx-5080-and-rtx-5090"><h2>Where to preorder the Nvidia RTX 5080 and RTX 5090</h2></p></div><p>As of writing, we’re only seeing retail listings for the Founders Editions of the RTX 5080 and RTX 5090 at Best Buy, and you can expect Nvidia to sell them, too. That said, there are multiple options from a variety of manufacturers across all retailers, including MSI, Asus, Gigabyte, Zotac, and more. Keep reading for details on each retailer’s current plans.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->1000</span></p><div><p>Nvidia’s RTX 5080 is the successor to the RTX 4080.

Eventually, a range of laptops and pre-built desktop PCs with the GPUs will become available. The retailer currently allows you to sign up to be notified about their arrival, but you’ll want to be proactive and check the site listings early and often on the morning of January 30th.</p><p>Purchasing a 50-series graphics card from Best Buy requires creating an account. If you’re lucky enough to add one to cart, you’ll be added to a queue while the system verifies your account and confirms your unit. If successful, you’ll have 10 minutes to complete the checkout process.</p><div><p id="newegg"><h3>Newegg</h3></p></div><p><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=44583&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2FRTX-50-Series%2FEventSaleStore%2FID-1473" rel="sponsored">Newegg is teasing a comprehensive stock</a> of 50-series graphics cards.

Fans mostly hate it for a host of reasons, not least of which being the fact that it kills off two beloved characters from <em>Aliens</em> off-screen and ends with Ripley’s death. But I’m not here to talk about that  movie. Instead, I want to share with you the first teaser trailer for <em>Alien 3</em> from 1991. </p><p>So that’s a pretty cool teaser and all, but uh, <em>Alien 3</em> doesn’t take place on Earth. And yet that’s what this teaser is promising. Here’s the narration from the trailer: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>In 1979, we discovered, in space, no one can hear you scream. In 1992, we will discover, on Earth, everyone can hear you scream.</p></blockquote><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://filmstories.co.uk/features/the-odd-story-of-alien-3s-misleading-teaser-trailer/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://filmstories.co.uk/features/the-odd-story-of-alien-3s-misleading-teaser-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Keep in mind that according to sources</a></span>, this teaser was released around the same time Fincher started shooting <em>Alien 3</em> and at that point—following many different rejected scripts, including <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://avp.fandom.com/wiki/Alien_III_(William_Gibson)&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://avp.fandom.com/wiki/Alien_III_(William_Gibson)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one by noted cyberpunk author William Gibson</a></span>—Fox and everyone involved knew the movie wasn’t set anywhere near Earth. And yet, they still teased that idea in the trailer above.</p><p>You might be thinking, “Well, I bet fans were really angry about that and there was a massive backlash!” But that didn’t really happen. I mean, I bet you $20 at least one person saw this teaser in a theater, got excited, and then when<em> Alien 3</em> finally arrived, he was disappointed and angry. Back then, however, things were different, and this teaser wasn’t something you could just look up online, nor were there social media platforms in the modern sense where fans could congregate and make their outrage known to filmmakers. Besides, the idea of “franchises” and “teasers” was still relatively novel in Hollywood and audiences weren’t as concerned about that stuff. </p><p>Now, 30 years later, <em>Alien: Earth</em> is doing what that teaser promised back in the 90s and bringing the Xenomorph to our home planet. </p><p>Of course, that’s already happened twice before (at least) in movies as seen in <em>Alien Vs. Predator </em>and its sequel. However, those aren’t really canon in the <em>Alien </em>franchise and break the timeline in ways that drives some fans batty. This is the first proper time the alien creatures will be on Earth, and hopefully it will be worth the 30+ year wait. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Before <strong><em>Fallout 76</em></strong> introduced its Wastelanders update on April 14th, 2020, the massive wasteland of Appalachia felt overwhelmingly bleak and lonesome. It was up to the players and their limited interactions with each other to populate the post-apocalypse with stories and memories. But with Wastelanders, Bethesda introduced countless NPCs to flesh out the game world, along with a few notable allies and romanceable partners.</p>



<h4 id="h-who-wants-to-survive-in-the-wasteland-alone-when-spunky-sofia-daguerre-awaits"><strong>Who wants to survive in the wasteland alone when spunky Sofia Daguerre awaits?</strong></h4>



<figure></figure>



<p>One such ally is Sofia Daguerre, an astronaut with the U.S.S.A. space program. In 2103, she and her ship crashed into Appalachia. Unaware of the recent global nuclear meltdown, Sofia tucked herself away in a Free States bunker until the player discovered her and filled in the details of what went wrong with the world.</p>



<h2 id="h-where-can-you-find-sofia-daguerre-in-fallout-76"><strong>Where Can You Find Sofia Daguerre in Fallout 76</strong></h2>



<p>If you’ve spent any time exploring Appalachia, chances are you’ve unlocked The Mire. You’ll wind up traveling here around level 20 to 25, give or take. Coincidentally, that’s when you’ll receive the quest to recruit Sofia Daguerre.</p>



<p>Once you follow the radio signal included with the quest, you’ll track her last-known position to an Abandoned Bunker just north of a hunter’s shack in the northeast of The Mire. It’s near East Ridge Lookout.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-recruit-sofia-daguerre"><strong>How to Recruit Sofia Daguerre</strong></h2>



<p>Once you’ve located the Abandoned Bunker and worked your way inside, you’ll find Sofia Daguerre injured and sitting on the floor in the final room.</p>



<p>She’ll speak with you momentarily, and then you’ll drop the bomb, explaining how the world came to nuclear war and nothing is left but wasteland and magical pipes.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>If only it were as simple as starting a conversation to recruit Sofia Daguerre, however. Instead, she’ll task you with the first quest in her quest line. Commander Daguerre asks you to track down the crashed ship she was aboard.</p>



<p>Thankfully, it’s close. Simply head southwest until you reach Gulper Lagoon. From there, head west. You’ll see the crashed ship in the distance. Inside is a flight recorder; take that with you because she wants the information stored within.</p>



<p>We hope you’re prepared because upon activating the flight recorder, you’ll have to wait for the download, which takes two minutes to complete. During this time, a few Super Mutants ambush the player. It’s an easy enough fight if you’re stocked with ammunition or rocking a super sledge.</p>



<p>Upon completion, return to Sofia with the data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But that’s not the end of the recruitment quest. Did you think it was that easy? Not quite!</p>



<p>Next, Sofia will ask you to locate an encryption key. It’s on a U.S.S.A. robot south of Gulper Lagoon. It’s a generic retrieval quest with zero surprises.</p>



<p>Upon returning the key, Sofia Daguerre will thank you, and you can recruit her to your C.A.M.P.!</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-get-sofia-daguerre-at-c-a-m-p"><strong>How to Get Sofia Daguerre at C.A.M.P.</strong></h2>



<p>Like other companions in <em>Fallout 76</em>, to activate Sofia Daguerre at your C.A.M.P., you’ll first have to build the appropriate item. In this case, it’s a command console. You should have plenty of resources to make the computer by this level in your journey.</p>



<p>From there, you can continue her quest line and tackle a few radiant objectives.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-the-quests-in-sofia-daguerre-s-quest-chain"><strong>What Are the Quests in Sofia Daguerre’s Quest Chain?</strong></h2>



<ul>
<li>Crash Landing</li>



<li>The Woman Who Fell to Earth</li>



<li>One Small Step</li>



<li>In Case of Emergency</li>



<li>Bring Home the Beacon</li>



<li>The Universe Conspires</li>



<li>Hope Remains</li>



<li>Search and Destroy</li>



<li>Heavy Eyes</li>



<li>Patently False</li>



<li>Privacy Violation</li>



<li>Contractually Obfuscated</li>



<li>Boot Camp</li>



<li>Past Expiration</li>



<li>No Brainer</li>



<li>Calling Long Distance</li>



<li>Who Sat Down Beside Her</li>



<li>Lab Rat</li>



<li>Mission Out-of-Control</li>
</ul>



<p>As you can see, companion Sofia Daguerre includes several quests to complete her story arc. That’s not to mention the various radiant quests, including Data Driven, Faint Signal, and Glitchcraft.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/29/ps-plus-monthly-games-wont-guarantee-ps4-games-from-january-2026/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sony has announced an upcoming change to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PlayStation Plus</a> monthly games. From January 2026, PS4 games will no-longer be a guaranteed part of the PlayStation Plus monthly games lineup.</p>
<p>The current balance of games featured in PS Plus monthly games is for two guaranteed PS4 games and one PS5 game. Of course, with cross-gen releases as they are, we’ve often had months where all three games are playable across both generations.</p>


<p>From January 2026, the focus will be on the PlayStation 5 – which makes sense since it will be over half a decade old by that point – and so PS4 games will no longer be a guaranteed part of each month’s selection. Cross-gen games that have a PS4 version could certainly still be included – and there’s still tons of PS4 games being released – but it’s not going to be a requirement anymore.</p>
<p>Any already redeemed PS4 games will continue to be playable while subscribed to PS Plus, just as you can still access previous consoles.</p>
<p>This will go hand-in-hand with a shift in focus for securing PS5 games for the PS Plus Game Catalogue, more-so than the PS4. PS4 games will still be a huge part of the service, but again, no longer a key focus.</p>

<p>Here’s Sony’s statement from the PS Blog:</p>
<p>As many of our players are currently playing on PS5 and have shifted toward redeeming and accessing PS5 titles from the Monthly Games and Game Catalog benefit, PlayStation Plus is also evolving with this trend and will focus on offering PS5 titles through the Monthly Games and Game Catalog benefit starting January 2026. As we shift to PS5, PS4 games will no longer be a key benefit and will only be occasionally offered for PlayStation Plus Monthly Games and Game Catalog starting January 2026. We may still provide titles that can be playable on both PS4 and PS5 consoles after this date.</p>
<p>Please note, this won’t affect the PS4 Monthly Games that you have already redeemed from PlayStation Plus. You’ll continue to have access to games you’ve already redeemed as long as you remain a member.&nbsp; For Game Catalog, PS4 games will still be available to play until it leaves the catalog as part of our monthly refresh.</p>
<p>We’ll continue to evolve the experience of PlayStation Plus and optimize the benefits you receive, including exclusive discounts, online multiplayer access, online game save storage and more. As we shift our focus to PS5, we look forward to adding new PS5 titles monthly for you to enjoy.</p>

<p>Microsoft’s Q2 2025 (October – December 2024) has revealed Xbox’s gaming revenue declined, but saw slight growth in via game pass.</p>



<h2 id="h-cut-to-the-chase">Cut to the Chase</h2>



<p>Xbox’s key points for Q2 2025 are:</p>



<ul>
<li>Gaming revenue declined 7% (down 8% CC)</li>



<li>Xbox content and services revenue grew 2% driven by growth in Xbox Game Pass</li>



<li>Xbox hardware revenue declined 29%</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-what-does-it-mean">What Does it Mean?</h2>



<p>It’s always hard to judge the long term effects of quarterly financials as they don’t paint a broader picture of the company as a whole. On first impressions, Xbox content and services revenue growth by 2% seems like a good indicator for Xbox Game Pass, but during the months in which the hotly anticipated Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 released, I would have expected a little more movement. However, its growth matches Microsoft’s guidance at 2%</p>



<p>Xbox’s revenue decline is something that we should hopefully see changed in the coming months, as Xbox’s new strategy is to release its games across more platforms and thus, increase revenues. But again, it’s somewhat surprising considering a big quarter with Call of Duty. </p>



<p>Xbox’s hardware revenue decline shows a sharp decrease at 29%, which is frankly a shocking statistic during the holiday period. For context, Xbox hardware grew by 3% during the same quarter last year. That being said, Xbox’s new focus on the cloud will undoubtedly have an negative impact on hardware sales.</p>



<p>Would you this of Xbox’s financial results for Q2 2025? Let us know in the comments below or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>Is there anything like the refreshing taste of an ice-cold Nuka-Cola after finishing an Expedition to Atlantic City? But what if you’re craving something different, like a Nuka-Cola Wild? Here is where to find Nuka Cola Wild in Fallout 76!</p>



<h2 id="h-where-to-find-nuka-cola-wild-in-fallout-76"><strong>Where to Find Nuka Cola Wild in Fallout 76</strong></h2>



<p>You can find <strong>Nuka Cola Wild in Fallout 76</strong> by purchasing one from <strong>Bubbles </strong>at <strong>The Whitespring Resort</strong>. Alternatively, you can find a single bottle at <strong>Eta Psi House</strong> on <strong>Fraternity Row</strong>, just inside the basement, with all of the Nuka-Cola merchandise and theming.</p>



<p>If you intend to visit Bubbles and buy their stock of Nuka-Cold Wild, along with all the other unique flavors, you better bring a fat stack of caps. At almost 40 caps per bottle, Wild will set you back somewhat!</p>



<p>But what makes Nuka-Cold Wild so unique and refreshing? It’s the company’s answer to the ever-popular Sunset Sarsaparilla from out west, toward New Vegas. The soda pop features a distinctive flavor profile meant to compete with Nuka-Cola’s direct competitor, the Sunset Sarsaparilla Company, after the former failed to buy out the latter in a corporate takeover.</p>

<h2 id="h-nuka-cola-wild-stats-in-fallout-76"><strong>Nuka Cola Wild Stats in Fallout 76</strong></h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In addition to its unique flavor and color, Nuka-Cola Wild has distinct effects that make it ideal for anyone traveling alone in Appalachia for extended periods.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Effects</strong></td><td><strong>Water</strong></td><td><strong>Disease</strong></td><td><strong>Weight</strong></td><td><strong>Value</strong></td></tr><tr><td>+5 Rads<br>+40 HP<br>+25 AP</td><td>15%</td><td>0%</td><td>1</td><td>38</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>The massive boost to Hit Points and Action Points makes Nuka-Cold Wild in Fallout 76 the go-to beverage for those running low on Stimpaks or running various perks that boost the effects of food and drink items.</p>



<p>The +5 Rads isn’t too terrible, either. You can deal with a bit of radiation, right?</p>



<p>What flavor of Nuka-Cola do you think would taste best in the real world?

		<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PlayStation Plus</a> monthly games for February 2025 have been announced, and it’s a great one for fans of virtualised heisting with Payday 3 leading the way alongside a zany first person shooter and an arcade classic franchise.</p>

<p>The following three games will be available from the first Tuesday of the month, which will be 4th February.</p>


<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/21/payday-3-review/">Payday 3</a> | PS5&nbsp;</strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/12/17/high-on-life-review-xbox-game-pass/">High on Life</a> | PS4, PS5&nbsp;</strong></li>
<li><strong>Pac-Man World Re-Pac | PS4, PS5&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Payday 3 arrived at the tail end of 2023, and while it made a solid first impression – “a welcome return for the heist ’em up series, and a reminder of why the first two games were so popular,” <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/21/payday-3-review/">I wrote at the time</a> – it faced an uphill battle with its fans. After a year of hefty reworks and patches, and the addition of the classic World First Bank heist in December, could it be worth diving in?</p>
<p>Well, now’s as good a time as any to see how it holds up.</p>


<p>If you’d rather play something solo, then <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/12/17/high-on-life-review-xbox-game-pass/">High on Life</a> might be for you. Coming from Squanch Games. Whipping you away to a bizarre alien world where guns have faces and talk back to you, and who have increasingly odd fire modes, and you encounter dozens of incessantly babbling characters in the vein of Rick and Morty as you become a bounty hunter.</p>
<p>Of course, you may feel conflicted about this game, due to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/01/25/justin-roiland-quits-high-on-life-developer-squanch-games-as-he-faces-domestic-abuse-charges/">the involvement of Justin Roiland</a> in its creation.</p>

<p>Lastly for this month is Pac-Man World Re-Pac, a 2004 remake of the PlayStation platformer with the arcade con now on a quest to rescue his family and friends from Ghosts who saw fit to kidnap them all. And it’s Pac-Man’s birthday to boot!</p>
<p>So, what do you think of this month’s games?</p>
<h2>Can you still get the January 2025 PS Plus games?</h2>
<p>You can still grab January’s titles up until the new set of game’s arrives on 4th February, so make sure to grab them while you can! They are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/05/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-review/"><strong>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</strong></a> (PS5)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/08/need-for-speed-hot-pursuit-remastered-review/"><strong>Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit Remastered</strong></a> (PS4)</li>
<li><strong>The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe</strong> (PS5 | PS4)</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/01/ps-plus-monthly-games-january-2025-suicide-squad-stanley-parable-nfs-hot-pursuit/">Head here for more details.</a></p>

			<p>These rumors came after an awkward accident happened when sending around a marketing email regarding World of Warcraft's latest activities. However, the most surprising part that had people getting their hopes up was a link to join <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-app-to-come-to-select-lg-smart-tvs-ultimate-game-pass-subscribers-to-benefit/">Game Pass</a>, with a subject line that read as the following: "Play Call of Duty, Diablo IV, World of Warcraft, and more of Activision's biggest hits with Game Pass!" Screenshots of this email were posted on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/1ic3q9w/gamepass_and_world_of_warcraft/#lightbox" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox subreddit</a>, where there is no denying World of Warcraft was added to the advertising, and it certainly didn't seem like it was accidentally, either.</p>
<figure><figcaption>Credit to sendcaffeineplz on Reddit.</figcaption></figure>
<p>With this email beginning to circulate, this led to a lot of excitement and buzz about the potential of World of Warcraft being added to Game Pass, and the wishes that the game would also be launching on console. However, hopes were quickly dashed by Microsoft, after they gave an official reply on X.</p>
<p>"This was a mistake on our end. Sorry for the confusion! Blizzard's World of Warcraft was accidentally included in a Game Pass email even though it's not available with the service - a correction email will be sent to those who got the original email soon."</p>
<p>Of course, the replies under this post were quickly filled with people pleading with Microsoft to just add World of Warcraft to Game Pass already, with some even saying that they've already tested the game on the controller and found that it worked just fine.</p>
<p>The images that were added to the promotion in this email were very suspicious, as it didn't appear to just be a case of accidentally mentioning the game. As seen on the Xbox subreddit, it included promo material for the Plunderstorm event, with art from World of Warcraft combined with the classic Xbox and Game Pass theming.</p>
<p>While it may seem that World of Warcraft isn't coming to Game Pass any time soon, the email definitely is suspicious and will most likely continue to cause a stir for a little while, despite Microsoft putting out their official reply.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gloomhaven-second-edition-delayed-due-to-production-issues.1095345/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/gloomhaven-second-edition-delayed-due-to-production-issues<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Fans of <em>Gloomhaven</em> may need to wait longer for the latest edition. Cephalofair Games has announced a Gloomhaven Second Edition delay of several months to address production issues found with the <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/gloomhaven" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Gloomhaven Game Page">Gloomhaven</a> </em>advance copies they received.</p>

<h2>The <em>Gloomhaven Second Edition</em> Delay</h2>

<p>In an update post <a href="https://www.backerkit.com/c/projects/cephalofair/gloomhaven/updates/16229#top" rel="nofollow">on Backerkit</a>, Cephalofair explained the <em>Gloomhaven Second Edition</em> delay. According to them, they had advanced copies of the game ready as part of their first round of shipping via ocean freight. These were copies meant for the design team, some content creators, and different partners.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gloomhaven-second-edition-production-issue-artwork.jpg?itok=zY1sjdSo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gloomhaven-second-edition-production-issue-artwork.jpg?itok=tc04vskV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>These early copies contained significant production errors. They mention warped map boards and scenario trackers alongside poorly injected and assembled miniatures. These issues were not present in samples or pre-preproduction copies received ahead of mass production. Given the price point of <em>Gloomhaven</em>, and how much it relies on a variety of parts, these constituted major issues with the game.</p>

<p>Cephalofair has confirmed that these errors affected a significant amount of product and are in conversation with the production facility to correct these issues. The producer has acknowledged these errors and has committed with providing replacements.</p>

<p>Those replacements will take some time since the workers won't be back until mid-February due to Lunar New Year having everyone off for a while at the production facility. Not to mention the root cause of the mass production issues will need to be identified and addressed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We aren’t sure exactly how long it will end up being, but be assured that we and our production facility are determined to solve this problem quickly and efficiently.</p>

<p>Making this decision was genuinely heartbreaking, but we firmly believe it was ultimately the best call.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Depending on how long <em>Gloomhaven Second Edition</em> is delayed, it may also face another challenge: the potential trade tariffs being proposed by US President Trump. As other developers <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/deep-regrets-developer-voices-potential-impact-of-imposing-us-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Deep Regrets Developer Voices Potential Impact of Imposed US Trade Tariffs">have expressed</a>, the vast majority of board production is done overseas in China, which can mean higher prices for all tabletop products in the United States if these tariffs are implemented. Previously Cephalofair had <a href="https://www.backerkit.com/c/projects/cephalofair/gloomhaven/updates/13908#top" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Project Update: Tariffs and physical proofs of Gloomhaven ">expressed some concerns </a>about them, but were unable to say how it might impact them going forward.</p>

<p>You’re not alone if you’re trying to track down Huntersville. When I first started playing Fallout 76, I aimed to discover every point of interest. This one eluded me for a long time. Here is where to find Huntersville in Fallout 76!</p>

<p>You can find <strong>Huntersville in Fallout 76</strong> by traveling to the <strong>Savage Divide</strong>. It’s just north of <strong>Spruce Knob </strong>and east of <strong>Mountainside Bed &amp; Breakfast</strong>. It’s not too troublesome to track down. That said, Huntersville stands as the birthplace of Super Mutants in Appalachia, and, as such, you’ll find plenty of mutants who have nothing but disdain for humans. They will attack on sight.</p>

<p>I recommend bringing a suit of Power Armor, though you can find one at the nearby Brotherhood of Steel Graveyard, which is southeast of the town.</p>



<p>You’ll note that, along with being overrun by mutants, Huntersville is exceptionally bleak and foggy more often than not. It’s a chaotic battle through the town, with enemies popping up seemingly from nowhere.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-you-ll-find-in-huntersville"><strong>What You’ll Find in Huntersville</strong></h2>



<p>There’s plenty to see and do in Huntersville, especially for those who want to slay mutants and acquire loot. Here are some of the notable items you’ll find:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>The Huntersville Incident</strong> (Holotape)</li>



<li><strong>Vault-Tec Bobbleheads</strong></li>



<li><strong>Magazines</strong></li>



<li><strong>Power Armor</strong></li>



<li><strong>Workshop Plan</strong></li>
