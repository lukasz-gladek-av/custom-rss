<p>Spectre Divide wrapped up a positive closed beta phase just days ago, and now the team at Mountaintop has confirmed that the game will be released worldwide (in early access) on PC on September 3rd. The recent beta might have been closed, but sharing gameplay and talking about the all-new competitive shooter was very much open, allowing potential fans to form early opinions.</p>



<p>This 3-vs-3 competitive shooter has been created with esports in mind, with the likes of Michael ‘shroud’ Grzesiek lending his professional expertise to the game’s development. It’s a unique enough premise, and it’s expected that it’ll do well once it hits the open market on September 3rd.</p>

<h2 id="h-becoming-two">Becoming Two</h2>



<p>Spectre Divide’s unique concept is that players can control two bodies – one tangible, the other a ‘Spectre’. In every mode, players are free to use these bodies as they see fit, and if their ‘fleshy’ character dies, they’re left to control their Spectre. </p>



<p>It’s comparable to Valorant in how it looks and plays, but it leans on traditional ADS gunplay to encourage a little more arcade-like play. With an individual art style inspired by retro cel animation and Japanese anime, Spectre Divide looks phenomenal on-screen, but it’s in the gameplay where this competitive shooter excels.</p>



<p>Spectre Divide will be released with four maps, twenty weapons, and both ranked and casual playlists. It’ll also support weekly competitions. It’s a free-to-play game but it <strong>is </strong>supported by cosmetics-based MTX, which is more or less the standard operating system now.</p>



<p>Are you going to be playing Spectre Divide when it’s released on September 3rd?</p>

                <p dir="ltr">The launch of Echoes Act 3 has added new gear to Destiny 2, including a new Exotic weapon called Chorus of One. To get it, you'll need to complete a new Exotic mission as part of Act 3's story, which will unlock the ability to craft the Void auto rifle and adjust its perks. That'll require multiple completions of the mission, Encore: Overture, over multiple weeks, however.</p><p dir="ltr">The Exotic mission has just launched, and we're working to bring you everything you need to know about Chorus of One: How to get it, where to find the secrets within the Exotic mission that will unlock its best perks, and what to focus on for Chorus of One god rolls.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How To Start Encore: Overture Exotic Mission And Earn Chorus Of One</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1581/15811374/4357935-2024_echoes_act_03_press_kit_gear_compressed_002.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4357935" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1024" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1581/15811374/4357935-2024_echoes_act_03_press_kit_gear_compressed_002.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4357935"></a><figcaption>Chorus of One</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1581/15811374/4357935-2024_echoes_act_03_press_kit_gear_compressed_002.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The good news is that there are no secret prerequisite to unlock the Encore: Overture mission.

When it's over, head to the HELM and talk to Failsafe.</p><p dir="ltr">With new marching orders that are the same as the old marching orders--stop Maya and her plan to take over the entire solar system--your first stop in Act 3's story will be the Exotic mission. You can launch Encore: Overture from the Director map for the HELM.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Stay tuned for additional updates to this guide as we uncover all there is to know about Encore: Overture and Chorus of One.</em></p>

                <p dir="ltr">Echoes Act 3 adds a few new guns to Destiny 2, including Chronophage, a new Void trace rifle that's built for disintegrating enemies. It's a solid alternative to some other, tougher-to-get trace rifles, like the Rise of Nightmare raid's Acasia's Dejection. The Chronophage god roll is especially good in PvE, with a few perks that are great for synergistic Void builds to keep you shielded and happy as you zap your way through hordes of opponents.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#How_To_Get_Chronophage">How To Get Chronophage</a></li><li><a href="#Chronophage_God_Rolls">Chronophage God Rolls</a><ul><li><a href="#Chornopage_PvE_God_Roll">Chornopage PvE God Roll</a></li><li><a href="#Chronophage_PvP_God_Roll">Chronophage PvP God Roll</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_To_Get_Chronophage">How To Get Chronophage</h2><p dir="ltr">The launch of Echoes Act 3 adds Chronophage to the episode's loot pool, meaning you'll start to see it drop from Echoes activities: Breach Executable, Enigma Protocol, and Battlegrounds. The gun can also come from Echoes Engrams you'll earn all over the solar system, but in order to focus those engrams into Chronopage when you visit Failsafe, you'll need to complete new Nessus Specimen quests to unlock its focusing upgrade. Like the other guns from Echoes, Chronophage is craftable, so you can get it with your pick of enhanced perks.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4357880-destiny2chronophage.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4357880" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4357880-destiny2chronophage.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4357880"></a><figcaption>Chronophage</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4357880-destiny2chronophage.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="Chronophage_God_Rolls">Chronophage God Rolls</h2><h3 dir="ltr" id="Chornopage_PvE_God_Roll">Chornopage PvE God Roll</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Barrel</strong>: Smallbore / Fluted Barrel  <ul><li dir="ltr">Smallbore: Stability +7, Range +7</li><li dir="ltr">Fluted Barrel: +5 Stability, +15 Handling</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Magazine</strong>: Tactical Battery  <ul><li dir="ltr">+5 Range, +10 Reload Speed, +5 Stability</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>First Perk</strong>: Repulsor Brace / Shoot To Loot  <ul><li dir="ltr">Repulsor Brace: Defeating a Void-debuffed target grants an overshield.</li><li dir="ltr">Shoot to Loot: Shooting an Orb of Power picks it up.

The combination of Repulsor Brace and Destabilizing Rounds is always great in a weapon for clearing small enemies, particularly if you're running a Void build, since you get to turn enemies Volatile while constantly creating an overshield for yourself as you rack up kills. Chronophage also includes the Echoes origin trait Radiolaria Transposer, which combines well with any set of perks that let you kill a lot of enemies quickly, as multikills cause targets to explode and create pools of radiolaria on the ground.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're not looking for Void synergy, Shoot to Loot can keep your trace rifle firing for longer, and Target Lock takes advantage of the beam's requirement of melting a single target to boost its damage.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Chronophage_PvP_God_Roll">Chronophage PvP God Roll</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Barrel</strong>: Smallbore  <ul><li dir="ltr">Stability +7, Range +7</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Magazine</strong>: Tactical Battery  <ul><li dir="ltr">+5 Range, +10 Reload Speed, +5 Stability</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>First Perk</strong>: Elemental Capacitor  <ul><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">Substantially increases stats based on the currently equipped Super.<br>[Solar] increases your reload speed.<br>[Arc] increases handling.<br>[Void] increases stability.<br>[Stasis] moderately controls recoil and increases movement speed when aiming down sights.<br>[Strand] increases airborne effectiveness.</p></li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Second Perk</strong>: Desperate Measures  <ul><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">Weapon final blows grant bonus damage for an improved duration.

If you must take it into the Crucible, aim for both the range and stability stats to make the gun effective as far away as possible, and to keep your aim on target as much as possible. For perks, Elemental Capacitor gives you solid bonuses based on whatever subclass you're running and is particularly good if you choose Solar, and Desperate Measures can give you a damage bonus without too much difficulty in activating it, which should help you win two-on-one engagements more often.</p>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/splatoon">Splatoon</a>-a-like 4v4 multiplayer shooter is transitioning from a premium title to a free-to-play game on 4th October, just eight months after its initial release.
</p>
<p>
Square announced the news in a <a href="https://support.na.square-enix.com/news.php?id=19278&amp;la=1&amp;n=2&amp;drt=1724734800&amp;tag=87d9005e3aa0690a5e94dc228934fdabf6edcc4a&amp;s=31">brief update on its support website</a>, noting the game - which remains a PlayStation exclusive after its free-to-play transition - will no longer require a PlayStation Plus subscription to play from 4th October.
</p>
<p>
Players that purchase Foamstars prior to its price change in October will receive a Legacy Gift set providing "exclusive" in-game items, including 12 colour-variant Bubble Beastie skins, one Slide Board design, and the "Legacy" title. "Your continued support of Foamstars would be greatly appreciated", Square adds.

<p>
Foamstars initially released for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 back in February this year, sporting a £24.99 price tag - although Square attempted to give its player base an early boost by giving the game away as part of a PlayStation Plus subscription at launch.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, early reviews were a little tepid. Eurogamer contributor Kaan Serin called Foamstars a "serviceable paintballer... lathered with some wild lore and underwhelming hero shooter elements" in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/foamstars-review">review</a>, asking, "What does it say about this shooter if the... character details are more entertaining than the 10-minute shooting galleries that precede them?"

		<p>Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land has been announced today by Koei Tecmo, during the Nintendo Direct. While it was shown on Nintendo’s show, Atelier Yumia is not a Switch exclusive, with Koei Tecmo confirming that the game will be released on PC, PS5, PS4, Switch, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One. The Xbox versions mark the first time the series has been available on Microsoft’s consoles.</p>

<p>Outside of the teaser trailer, nothing has really been detailed about the game. But, the development team at Gust will be hosting a livestream on September 2nd that is going to go into detail about Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land. The stream will be happening at 13:00 BST, and it will be streamed in Japanese only.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/07/12/atelier-marie-remake-the-alchemist-of-salburg-review/">Atelier Marie Remake: The Alchemist of Salburg Review</a></h2>
<p>The last Atelier game we reviewed was Atelier Marie Remake: The Alchemist of Salburg, and in that review Miguel said,<em> “Atelier Marie Remake is simultaneously a return to form and a fresh step forward for the Atelier series. It’s incredible to experience the roots of this series, and as sad as I am about the barebones storytelling, the shifted focus to time-management and calendar events gives the game an addictive farm-simulator vibe that kept me glued to it for hours. I’m excited to see how ideas from this remake come forward to inspire whatever this series has in store for us next.”</em></p>

<p>Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land is set to release in 2025.</p>

Once you switch profiles, your controller will vibrate a specific number of times based on which profile you chose.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dd-direct-2024-highlights-future-of-dd-and-showcases-project-sigil<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Only a few weeks away from the release of the 2024 Player Handbook Wizards of the Coast has put on Dungeons &amp; Dragons Direct 2024. The D&amp;D Direct 2024 offered us a final look on the 2024 PHB before it's release, where D&amp;D is looking to go for the immediate future, and it also provided us with more information on Project Sigil, the 3D VTT offering that is currently taking sign-ups for the Closed Beta period.</p>
<p>D&amp;D Direct began with a sizzle reel of fans and creators highlighting the memories that they've all had playing D&amp;D together whether it be playing the games, building relationships, or watching Actual Plays like <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a9a9913f-42e9-4189-bbde-08061c01a7e8" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/matthew-mercer-interview">Critical Role</a>&nbsp;with footage as recent as Gencon from last month.</p>

<h2>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024 Player Handbook</h2>
<p>Starting off we get to see designers for the Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024 Player Handbook talking about each of the changes that fans can expect when they get their hands on the new Player Handbook. Some highlighted changes are silly like the Cat finally having Darkvision, while others fundamentally reshape the way you build your character like with added Origins.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you're interested in learning what we think of the 2024 Player Handbook then you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-5e-2024-player-handbook-review-mixed-messaging-around-strong">check out our full review</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>D&amp;DBeyond integration was also discussed, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/ddbeyond-details-changes-in-functionality-with-2024-core-rulebook-release-spells">something that recently came under fire before WOTC reversed the decision</a>.</p>
<p>Moving on from that the Dungeon Master Guide was discussed, such as the increased options in the Treasure section, and the Monster Manual with is going to be "packed with the most monsters."</p>
<p>The PHB will also be available in French, German, Italian, and Spanish to make sure globally players can hop into the game with as little barrier of entry needed.</p>

<p>To start off talking about the future of D&amp;D an adventure anthology based on Dragons was announced. Simple titles Dragon Anthology at this time, and releasing in early 2025 this collection will contain 10 adventures "all about dragons, in dungeons."</p>
<p>There will also be a new Starter Set releasing as a new way for groups who haven't played before to get into the game with the new ruleset. Set in the Borderlands players will go to the Keep, the Wilderness, and the Caves of Chaos.&nbsp;</p>

There are Secret Lair x Dungeons &amp; Dragons Magic The Gathering cards that are available now, and in a few short weeks a collection of LEGO Minifigures based on D&amp;D characters will also be released.</p>
<p>2025 will also feature two Setting books for Dungeons &amp; Dragons set in the Forgotten Realms. This will be broken into two books, the Forgotten Realms Player Guide that will go over player options including new sub-classes, Origins, Feats, and more. There will also be information about different known and currently unknown factions that players can join, two that were named were the Harpers and the Red Wizards of Thay.</p>
<p>The Forgotten Realms Dungeon Master Guide will cover the different parts of the realm, highlighting them by there theme. If you want to run an urban adventure or a horror adventure the guide will prompt you with ideas and tools to bring those ideas to life.</p>
<h2>Project Sigil</h2>
<p>For Project Sigil not too much more was revealed about the 3D VTT. This system is still token based, so you and your party will be rolling physics based dice and moving miniatures around a 3D space. You'll be able to build a world, but also fill it with props and even add sound and visual elements.</p>
<p>It was even shown off that a 2D map that you might use in the currently available D&amp;DBeyond map tool can be used in Sigil allowing you to place miniatures on the map like you would with a printed map.</p>

<p>Interestingly it was highlighted that while it's a tool being made by D&amp;D they are also opening it up to any platform as a place to create landscapes, populate it with tokens, and then roll dice. A brief glimpse of gameplay showed Drizzt facing off against Optimus Prime.</p>
<p>With an initial release planned for PC WOTC wants to allow this system to come to mobile and consoles. This will be free to try out, but no further word on what pricing could look like or what microtransactions couple be available other than to say&nbsp;DMs will get more advanced tools. The Closed Beta will be releasing this fall.</p>

Though it’s not a 1:1 recreation of the Dreamcast game, Keanu Reeves’ Shadow the Hedgehog is primed as the main villain this time around, with Jim Carrey’s Doctor Robotnik seemingly teaming up with the blue blur to take down a planet-wide threat. But this trailer has a lot to pick through, so we figured we’d break down the 3-minute video and see what else we can glean. Grab your rings and chili dogs and let’s dive in.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="660d202722a8c1af76ca3412aae8f892" data-recommend-id="image://660d202722a8c1af76ca3412aae8f892" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Tom and Sonic look at a chalk drawing of Longclaw." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Tom and Sonic look at a chalk drawing of Longclaw." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="660d202722a8c1af76ca3412aae8f892" data-recommend-id="image://660d202722a8c1af76ca3412aae8f892" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Tom and Sonic look at a chalk drawing of Longclaw." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In the live-action movies, Sonic has a pretty sad backstory that surprisingly mirrors Shadow’s in the games. In the first film, we saw Sonic being chased away from his home and sent away by Longclaw, his owl caretaker, for his own safety. If <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-movie-shadow-maria-death-actor-1851227374&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-movie-shadow-maria-death-actor-1851227374">follows Shadow’s origin story from the games closely</a></span>, he has a pretty similar moment that turns him towards chaos and destruction. We can already see in the trailer that Sonic is reflecting on his past, including some chalk drawings of him and Longclaw together. James Marsden’s Tom Wachowski is seen talking to Sonic about how he never let that tragedy change him. Later in the trailer,Tom Butler’s Commander Walters makes the comparison between Sonic and Shadow more directly, though he points out that Sonic found friends and family, while Shadow has no one.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d96988d32d8e1e61461fe9fb73827f95" data-recommend-id="image://d96988d32d8e1e61461fe9fb73827f95" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shadow punches through his pod." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Shadow punches through his pod." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d96988d32d8e1e61461fe9fb73827f95" data-recommend-id="image://d96988d32d8e1e61461fe9fb73827f95" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shadow punches through his pod." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Throughout the trailer, we see Shadow breaking out of a stasis pod and fighting his way through squads of G.U.N. agents. This is why Commander Walters asks Sonic and his friends for help. It’s clear conventional weapons aren’t enough to take down an immortal, superpowered hedgehog. This means we also get to watch Shadow beat the shit out of the institution that was likely the cause of his tragic backstory. We see the black-and-red hedgehog teleport around the group and lay them out as they fail to keep up with him. Shadow seems to be doing this right out of his pod, so it’s unclear if he’ll be using a Chaos Emerald to power these abilities as he does in the games.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="107770dc5473e144ead8aba722a042bb" data-recommend-id="image://107770dc5473e144ead8aba722a042bb" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shadow and Maria look at each other through glass." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Shadow and Maria look at each other through glass." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="107770dc5473e144ead8aba722a042bb" data-recommend-id="image://107770dc5473e144ead8aba722a042bb" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shadow and Maria look at each other through glass." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Furiosa </em>actor Alyla Browne is joining the live-action cast as Maria Robotnik, Doctor Robotnik’s cousin and granddaughter of Doctor Gerald Robotnik, Shadow’s creator. In the games, Shadow was the result of an experiment to find the cure for a deadly illness Maria had that prevented her from living on Earth. The two bonded on a space colony that supported Maria’s life and was also home to Robotnik’s experiments searching for a cure. In the games, Maria was tragically killed by a raid on the space station, which imbues Shadow with a vengeful rage and a desire to destroy the world. The trailer paints a pretty explicit picture that this is probably what’s going on in the movie, though it’s unclear now how much of the extended lore the movie will get into beyond Shadow and Maria’s relationship.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9d7ee93741a029490c443de795bc4240" data-recommend-id="image://9d7ee93741a029490c443de795bc4240" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles race." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles race." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9d7ee93741a029490c443de795bc4240" data-recommend-id="image://9d7ee93741a029490c443de795bc4240" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles race." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>To juxtapose the sad shit, we see Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles doing fun things with their human adult parents Tom and Maddie, like racing against one another in the forests of Green Hills, Montana. You see, anthropomorphic hedgehogs are social creatures and are shaped by their environment and connections to others. Shadow needs a loving hand to reach out and show him there’s another way so he, too, can race them in a forest instead of doing terrorism.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="50e0689163e3368f097c6d1f47117dd3" data-recommend-id="image://50e0689163e3368f097c6d1f47117dd3" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Tails flies over Tokyo in a helicopter." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Tails flies over Tokyo in a helicopter." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="50e0689163e3368f097c6d1f47117dd3" data-recommend-id="image://50e0689163e3368f097c6d1f47117dd3" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Tails flies over Tokyo in a helicopter." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Miles “Tails” Prower is a known pilot, and we saw him flying the Tornado plane in <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 2</em>. It looks like his knowledge of human vehicles has expanded since we last saw him, as the trailer shows him flying a whole-ass helicopter over Tokyo as they search for Shadow. Get your certifications, king. You’re like eight years old.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1208996bab9e09932dd55f697c8e3643" data-recommend-id="image://1208996bab9e09932dd55f697c8e3643" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shadow bodies Team Sonic." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Shadow bodies Team Sonic." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1208996bab9e09932dd55f697c8e3643" data-recommend-id="image://1208996bab9e09932dd55f697c8e3643" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shadow bodies Team Sonic." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When Sonic and company show up to face Shadow, they try to reason with him first. Sonic says they don’t want to fight him, and then Knuckles interjects that actually, yes, he would like to fight him. Then as the echinda charges in, Shadow wrecks their shit. He nearly breaks Knuckles’ wrist and kicks him into the air, swats Tails off like a fly, and then slams Sonic down on the ground while choking him out. God, I love him so much.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="64e99ed61114d9bb1272da96c20db90b" data-recommend-id="image://64e99ed61114d9bb1272da96c20db90b" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Tom shouts for Sonic as Shadow punches the screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Tom shouts for Sonic as Shadow punches the screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="64e99ed61114d9bb1272da96c20db90b" data-recommend-id="image://64e99ed61114d9bb1272da96c20db90b" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Tom shouts for Sonic as Shadow punches the screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Tom has been the human lead in all these movies, and given the clear themes of overcoming grief that this third film is toying with, it would be thematically appropriate for Sonic’s emotional center to be in some danger this time around. We see a brief shot of Marsden’s character shouting to Sonic as Shadow is wreaking havoc. Could we see an actual major death in <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</em>?<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="bcdda889052662ba849dc3a8211ab4b5" data-recommend-id="image://bcdda889052662ba849dc3a8211ab4b5" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles are tied to a post as a blackhole sucks the debris around them." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles are tied to a post as a blackhole sucks the debris around them." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bcdda889052662ba849dc3a8211ab4b5" data-recommend-id="image://bcdda889052662ba849dc3a8211ab4b5" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles are tied to a post as a blackhole sucks the debris around them." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>We see a brief shot of Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles all tied up as a black-and-red vortex of some kind forms above them. It draws in some of the loose debris around them, but it’s not clear what’s going on here. Is Shadow creating some kind of black hole to destroy the planet? To be determined.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="148dc0fd8a6853ba9a6ab156d6450427" data-recommend-id="image://148dc0fd8a6853ba9a6ab156d6450427" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Agent Stone greets Sonic with a giant mech behind him." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Agent Stone greets Sonic with a giant mech behind him." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="148dc0fd8a6853ba9a6ab156d6450427" data-recommend-id="image://148dc0fd8a6853ba9a6ab156d6450427" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Agent Stone greets Sonic with a giant mech behind him." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Lee Majdoub returns in <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 </em>as Agent Stone, Doctor Robotnik’s abused (and probably infatuated) assistant. We see our heroes meeting up with Stone in front of what looks like a mobile base for him and his boss. The two seem to have been in hiding after their devastating loss at the hands of Team Sonic in the second movie.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a4c7f628bee4c7074f0ffd28669e95bb" data-recommend-id="image://a4c7f628bee4c7074f0ffd28669e95bb" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Robotnik slaps his belly before realizing Sonic is there." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Robotnik slaps his belly before realizing Sonic is there." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a4c7f628bee4c7074f0ffd28669e95bb" data-recommend-id="image://a4c7f628bee4c7074f0ffd28669e95bb" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Robotnik slaps his belly before realizing Sonic is there." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Jim Carrey has come out of his brief retirement to play Doctor Robotnik again, and it looks like he’s taken his defeat in the past two movies pretty hard. He’s not been taking care of himself. His hair’s grown out, his beard’s unkempt, and he’s gained a bit of weight. The first shot we see of him is his drumming on his gut, though he is mortified when he turns around and sees his archnemesis is there to see him like this.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1c91b57dd2928f4d321043e853494c45" data-recommend-id="image://1c91b57dd2928f4d321043e853494c45" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sonic gives Robotnik a quill, which he licks and gets electrocuted." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sonic gives Robotnik a quill, which he licks and gets electrocuted." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1c91b57dd2928f4d321043e853494c45" data-recommend-id="image://1c91b57dd2928f4d321043e853494c45" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sonic gives Robotnik a quill, which he licks and gets electrocuted." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Shadow is too big a threat for the government, and too powerful for Team Sonic to take on by themselves. So they’re turning to their worst enemy for backup. As Stone lovingly helps Robotnik get back into fighting form by shaving his head and tailoring his suit, he says if he can’t rule the world he might as well save it.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="52cf41c494671f7e387eedac3f8ece5b" data-recommend-id="image://52cf41c494671f7e387eedac3f8ece5b" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shadow says &quot;apagando las luces.&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Shadow says &quot;apagando las luces.&quot;" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Parmount / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="52cf41c494671f7e387eedac3f8ece5b" data-recommend-id="image://52cf41c494671f7e387eedac3f8ece5b" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shadow says &quot;apagando las luces.&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 </em>is called <em>Sonic X Shadow: Tokyo Mission</em> in Japan, and it seems like swaths of the film will take place in Tokyo.

We see Carrey also playing Gerald Robotnik. In the games, Gerald is long gone by the time Shadow reawakens and attempts to destroy the world. Here, we see both grandfather and grandson meet and hug it out. Gerald was the secret villain of <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>, who put things into motion before his death to destroy the world in an act of vengeance for Maria’s death. The whole big emotional turn of that game is that Shadow remembers Maria’s final wish to bring hope to humanity and saves the world rather than destroying it. So if Gerald is still alive, I’m curious to see how <em>Sonic 3 </em>handles this storyline. It’s also not out of the question that Robotnik could be talking to his grandfather through some magical mumbo jumbo, as the <em>Knuckles</em> show established that the dead can speak to the living. I’m not used to Gerald Robotnik being portrayed as anything other than a grieving mad scientist, so we’ll see where this is going.<br></p><hr><p>Sadly, it does look like <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 </em>will be omitting Rouge the Bat and Amy Rose, two key players in the <em>Sonic Adventure 2 </em>story, unless they pull a <em>Spider-Man: No Way Home </em>and keep them out of the marketing. But I also wouldn’t be surprised if they wanted to streamline Shadow’s debut for the film given the shorter runtime, and that might mean that Rouge and the layers she brings to the story may have to be left on the cutting room floor.</p><p><em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 </em>premieres on December 20. </p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-makes-playstation-splatoon-shooter-foamstars-free-to-play-8-months-after-launch<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/foamstars">Foamstars</a>, Square Enix’s take on Nintendo's mega-hit Splatoon series, is set to go free-to-play just eight months after launch.</p><p>The four versus four online party shooter launched across PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 in February 2024 as a premium product (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-picks-up-splatoon-like-foamstars-as-a-month-long-playstation-plus-exclusive-on-ps4-and-ps5">and straight into PS Plus for a month</a>). IGN's <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/foamstars-review">Foamstars review</a> returned a 6/10. We said: "Foamstars' combat mechanics are unexpectedly engaging, but confounding time-gated modes and aggressive monetization make them harder to enjoy." It goes free-to-play starting October 4, 2024.</p><p>Currently, a PlayStation Plus subscription is required to play Foamstars, but after going free to play, all PS4 and PS5 owners can play for free. “Your continued support of Foamstars would be greatly appreciated,” Square Enix said in a post on its support site.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Foamstars Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Square Enix said it plans to give existing Foamstars owners a free “Legacy Gift” that includes these exclusive in-game items:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>12 exclusive color-variant Bubble Beastie skins</li><li>1 exclusive Slide Board design</li><li>1 title: “Legacy”</li></ul><p>Foamstars is <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-final-fantasy-16-and-foamstars-all-failed-to-meet-square-enixs-expectations">one of three recently released Square Enix games to disappoint sales wise</a>. In May, Square Enix admitted <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth"><u>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</u></a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-xvi"><u>Final Fantasy 16</u></a>, and Foamstars all failed to meet its expectations for revenue and profit, resulting in an overall hit to operating income for the business. Square Enix has yet to announce a sales figure for Foamstars.</p><p>It did, however, announce a significant company reboot amid tumbling profits. Final Fantasy 16 and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth both launched as PlayStation 5 exclusives, and Foamstars launched on PS4 and PS5 only, but Square Enix said it will now “aggressively pursue a multiplatform strategy that includes Nintendo platforms, PlayStation, Xbox, and PCs.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Overall, it’s a tough time for Square Enix, with a number of layoffs across its western business amid extensive restructuring. Dawntrail, the expansion for ongoing MMO Final Fantasy 14, launched in late June. Square Enix also has Kingdom Hearts 4, the third game in the Final Fantasy remake trilogy, and Dragon Quest 12 in the works. In January, Final Fantasy 16 producer Naoki Yoshida said it might be time for a younger generation to lead the franchise and helm Final Fantasy 17.</p><p>As for Foamstars, it seems unlikely a sequel will be developed any time soon.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p dir="ltr">The final act of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a>'s first content episode, Echoes, brings a refresh to both its activities and your arsenal. Speleologist is a new Solar machine gun that makes a pretty decent alternative to Fixed Odds from the Duality dungeon, allowing you to dump a lot of damage on tough enemies or take out a lot of little ones very quickly. The rapid-fire frame machine gun offers a 900 RPM fire rate, which mean it'll fire a lot of ammo <em>very</em> fast--and it's great for clearing out enemies in a hurry, especially in high-end content. With some extremely useful Solar-specific perks, the Speleologist god roll can also complement the rest of your Echoes weapons and fit well with your Solar builds.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#How_To_Get_Speleologist">How To Get Speleologist</a></li><li><a href="#Speleologist_God_Rolls">Speleologist God Rolls</a><ul><li><a href="#Speleologist_PvE_God_Roll">Speleologist PvE God Roll</a></li><li><a href="#Speleologist_PvP_God_Roll">Speleologist PvP God Roll</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_To_Get_Speleologist">How To Get Speleologist</h2><p dir="ltr">As with the other Echoes weapons, Speleologist is part of the episode's loot pool, so it's most easily earned as a random drop from completing Echoes activities, including Battlegrounds, Enigma Protocol, and Breach Executable. You're also guaranteed one roll of the weapon for completing the Echoes weekly story missions, adding it to your collections. As with other Echoes guns, if you're looking to visit Failsafe and tune Echoes Engrams to get Speleologist drops, you'll need to first complete Act 3's new Nessus Sample missions to unlock that upgrade. Speleologist is craftable, like the other Echoes guns, so you can eventually build your own version of the gun with enhanced perks.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1581/15811374/4357860-destiny2speleologist.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4357860" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1581/15811374/4357860-destiny2speleologist.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4357860"></a><figcaption>Speleologist</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1581/15811374/4357860-destiny2speleologist.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="Speleologist_God_Rolls">Speleologist God Rolls</h2><h3 dir="ltr" id="Speleologist_PvE_God_Roll">Speleologist PvE God Roll</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Barrel</strong>: Arrowhead Brake / Fluted Barrel  <ul><li dir="ltr">Arrowhead Brake: +30 Recoil, +10 Handling</li><li dir="ltr">Fluted Barrel: +5 Stability, +15 Handling</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Magazine</strong>: Appended Mag / Tactical Mag  <ul><li dir="ltr">Appended Mag: +14 Magazine</li><li dir="ltr">Tactical Mag: +7 Magazine, +5 Stability, +10 Reload Speed</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>First Perk</strong>: Enlightened Action / Envious Assassin  <ul><li dir="ltr">Enlightened Action: Dealing damage significantly improves reload speed and handling.</li><li dir="ltr">Envious Assassin: Defeating targets with other weapons before drawing this one transfers additional ammo to the magazine from reserves.

While it's maybe not the best one you can get, it rolls perks that are reliably useful even if you're not speccing into a build that does a ton to synergize with them. In the barrel and magazine departments, you'll probably want to focus on the stability stat to make sure you can consistently land critical hits as you're dumping ammo. Choices that boost magazine size, handling, and reload speed are also useful so that you can swap to Speleologist quickly, shoot a lot of bullets, and get it back in the fight fast.</p><p dir="ltr">For perks, Enlightened Action is a strong option for boosting reload speed, making up for boosting the stat elsewhere. You can also go with Envious Assassin to get as many bullets into your first magazine as possible. Incandescent is your go-to here, as it's a great add-on to a weapon that's already phenomenal for clearing enemies in dangerous situations, and you don't need to run a Solar build to take advantage of the cascading Scorch explosions. Killing Tally can also be fun, boosting the gun's damage against tougher enemies once you use it to wipe out some smaller ones. Add either to Radiolaria Transposer, which causes enemies to explode into a pool of radiolaria when you get multiple kills, and Speleologist is a great option to wipe out armies.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Speleologist_PvP_God_Roll">Speleologist PvP God Roll</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Barrel</strong>: Polygonal Rifling / Hammer-Forged Rifling  <ul><li dir="ltr">Polygonal Rifling: +10 Stability</li><li dir="ltr">Hammer-Forged Rifling: +10 Range</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Magazine</strong>: Accurized Rounds / Steady Rounds  <ul><li dir="ltr">Accurized Rounds: +10 Range</li><li dir="ltr">Steady Rounds: +15 Stability, -5 Range, +7 Airborne Effectiveness</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>First Perk</strong>: Slideways / Firmly Planted  <ul><li dir="ltr">Slideways: Sliding partially reloads this weapon's magazine and temporarily boosts handling and stability greatly.</li><li dir="ltr">Firmly Planted: Greatly increased accuracy, stability, and handling when firing while crouched.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Second Perk</strong>: Killing Tally  <ul><li dir="ltr">Killing Tally: Final blows increase this weapon's damage until it is stowed or reloaded. Improves magazine size.\</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Masterwork</strong>: Stability</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Speleologist shouldn't be your first choice for a PvP machine gun, but it's serviceable. Range is generally your primary point of focus on Crucible guns, but you'll also want to boost stability to keep your shots on target. Slideways and Firmly Planted will both boost stability and help you make quick kills, so pick the one that best fits your playstyle. For secondary perks, Killing Tally is good if you're able to take Speleologist on a multi-kill rampage, boosting your damage on multiple kills without you having to worry about it.</p>
