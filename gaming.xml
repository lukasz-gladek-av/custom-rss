			<p>If you've played Baldur's Gate 3 and wanted to give it a different twist, there is a mod that makes the game play out as a roguelike instead. This mod is called Trials of Tav and is an incredibly popular mod that you can use in the game. Between Larian and modders, new content is consistently being added to the game, and this mod is no different. Modder Hippo0o has managed to create a full roguelike mode for the game, allowing you to choose your own adventure as you fight off against masses of enemies.</p>
<p>As the updates for the Trials of Tav mode have begun to slow down, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/14430?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trials of Tav - Reloaded</a> has surfaced online from modder Celerev. In this version of the mod, it's overhauled the pre-existing mod and added bug fixes, an overhaul to the monsters, new scaling and new enemies to fight off against that have been adapted from tabletop.</p>
<p>One of these mobs includes a brand-new superboss. It's a level 27 enemy and is the last enemy that you can come across in the scaling. Should you find that you can defeat him, this is where you can say that you've actually won a run in Trials of Tav. It may take you a long time to get to that point, but it's well worth the grind.</p>
<p>In addition to the superboss, Celerev says that they've added over 60 new enemies to the base game, including enemies that you wouldn't typically come across. This includes characters like Nine-Fingers Keene and, more comedically, killer sheep.</p>
<p>To give the players a fighting chance, there has been a slew of bug fixes and changes to the scaling so that players have more of a chance to make the saving throw against their opponent. Shops are also now re-balanced, offering players a fairer opportunity.</p>
<p>Aside from Trials of Tav - Reloaded, this month sees the testing for Patch 8, an official patch released by Larian Studios. This is a pretty major patch, as it adds a bunch of <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-to-get-cross-play-12-new-subclasses-and-photo-mode-next-year/">new subclasses</a> to try out across each main class, as well as the ability to play Baldur's Gate 3 with others on other platforms. This means that you'll finally be able to play the game with friends who are on PlayStation while you're on PC, for example.</p>
<p>It's uncertain when the patch is set to be fully released, but it's likely more information will come out once the first round of testing takes place this month.</p>
<p>Will you be trying out Trials of Tav - Reloaded?</p>

The live-action movie doesn’t recreate the platformer’s story beat for beat, but it introduces Sonic’s revenge-driven rival Shadow, explores villain Doctor Robotnik’s family, and the moon gets blown up at one point, too. Despite keeping a lot of the same story elements, <em>Sonic 3</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-hedgehog-3-adventure-2-differences-maria-shadow-1851729393&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-hedgehog-3-adventure-2-differences-maria-shadow-1851729393">does omit a few key characters</a></span> like the treasure-hunting thief Rouge the Bat, and the Biolizard, <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>’s final boss. However, keen-eyed fans have noticed that the movie does seem to have a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it reference to the giant reptile, and they’re feeling conflicted about it.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

This is a creation by Doctor Gerald Robotnik, who went on to create Shadow as the “true” product of his research into creating an immortal being. Since Gerald doesn’t create Shadow in the movies, as he’s an alien from another planet like all the anthropomorphic animals are, there was no need to include the Biolizard in <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</em>. However, it turns out the movie does feature a brief reference to the creature during Shadow’s flashbacks. 50 years prior to the events of the movie, Shadow lived in a government facility with Maria Robotnik, Gerald’s granddaughter. The two became close like siblings, and are shown playing together while scientists attempt to perform experiments on the speedy hedgehog. One of these moments sees the pair watching a kaiju movie that, at a glance, appears to be an homage to early <em>Godzilla </em>films. But upon further inspection, it’s also a clever reference to the Biolizard. The giant reptile shown terrorizing civilians in the movie bears a striking resemblance to the character, from its slender mechanical eyes to the cables that extend from its jaws down its body. The movie the two watch is in black-and-white, but I imagine if it had been in color more people would have immediately caught onto this reference seeing its orange-brown skin.</p><p>On one hand, it is cool to see the movie pay homage to an important figure in Shadow’s game story, but given the way the live-action <em>Sonic </em>universe has previously treated one of the big monster-like enemies of the games as a comic relief prop, some fans aren’t thrilled with how <em>Sonic 3</em> references the Biolizard, fearing that it’s becoming a pattern for these movies. Iblis, a fiery monster from <em>Sonic ‘06</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/knuckles-paramount-sonic-06-iblis-flames-of-disaster-1851427520&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/knuckles-paramount-sonic-06-iblis-flames-of-disaster-1851427520">is referenced in the <em>Knuckles</em> Paramount+ show</a></span> as a stage puppet in a rock opera episode. So now, having a second of the games’ big kaiju-esque monsters turned into something else has made some fans a bit wary, as they wonder if Sonic and friends will ever face something on that scale in the live-action movies.</p><p>That being said, some fans are fine with the Biolizard’s omission, saying its presence could have <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/redelecbeanz/status/1874178115146309798&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/redelecbeanz/status/1874178115146309798" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">complicated the story</a></span>, which then might not have translated to the screen as gracefully <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/SabdierZ/status/1874316026734862546&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/SabdierZ/status/1874316026734862546" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as the more focused tale did</a></span>.

If not, there’s always Perfect Chaos, the final boss from <em>Sonic Adventure</em>, a water-based monster that floods entire cities. These movies have been playing fast and loose with the timeline, so there’s no harm in going back to a game before <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Marvel Rivals has confirmed that The Fantastic 4 will arrive for the game soon. A trailer will be released on January 6 at 8:00 AM PST / 16:00 UTC.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The official Marvel Rivals <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1874863266318762195" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter) has posted an image of the Fantastic 4, which includes Mr. Fantastic, The Human Torch, The Thing, and Invisible Woman. Interestingly, the image also features H.E.R.B.I.E, the team’s robotic friend, who has many players wondering whether he will be available as a playable character in the title.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Players already had an idea that members of the Fantastic 4 would be arriving for Marvel Rivals soon, with leaks of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-leak-human-torch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Human Torch</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-leaks-reveals-details-about-ultron-and-the-thing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Thing</a> surfacing online recently, detailing their abilities and skills. Now we know for sure that the whole family, including Mr. Fantastic, Invisible Woman, and H.E.R.B.I.E, will be making their way to the hero shooter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-leak-unveils-ultron-as-upcoming-character/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ultron</a>, one of the characters that has leaked much before, hasn’t received an official confirmation yet. A recent leak also claimed that characters like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-leak-claims-deadpool-and-more-are-on-the-way/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deadpool, Emma Frost, Modok</a>, and more will be making their way to the game soon. Additionally, details about Marvel Rivals <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-leak-reveals-data-about-loot-boxes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">loot boxes were uncovered through recent leaks</a>. &nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hell-let-loose-epic-games-store-free<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Epic has revealed the final free game being given away to PC gamers on the Epic Games Store during the 2024-25 holiday season, and it's the multiplayer-focused World War 2 first-person shooter&nbsp;<em>Hell Let Loose</em>.</p>

<p>Over the holiday period, Epic has given away a number of games on its Store, including&nbsp;<em>Control</em>,&nbsp;<em>Ghostrunner 2</em>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sifu-epic-games-store-free" rel="nofollow">martial arts action brawler&nbsp;<em>Sifu</em></a>, among others. Each of the games available over the last couple of weeks has been redeemable for a single day.</p>

<p><em>Hell Let Loose&nbsp;</em>marks the end of that period, however, as it's available until December 9th, which means Epic has gone back to its usual schedule of giving away one free game per week.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Hell Let Loose</em>, it's a hardcore World War 2-set first-person shooter that was originally developed by Australian outfit Black Matter. It was first released on Steam Early Access <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hell-let-loose-hits-steam-early-access-on-july-6" rel="nofollow">back in 2019</a> following a successful Kickstarter campaign two years prior.</p>

<p>In 2022, publisher Team17 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/team17-expands-with-hell-let-loose-and-label-acquisitions" rel="nofollow">took over development</a>, with subsidiary Cover 6 Studios currently handling the bulk of ongoing work on the game in conjunction with British developer Expression Games.</p>

<p>Tragedy then struck&nbsp;<em>Hell Let Loose&nbsp;</em>in July that same year, when producer James Light <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hell-let-loose-producer-james-light-dies-aged-just-28" rel="nofollow">passed away</a> from "complications following cardiac surgery" aged just 28.</p>




<p>As for the game itself, it's a multiplayer-focused shooter that supports up to 100 players in each battle. Players can engage in on-foot battles or take to a number of different vehicles in order to wage war on their opponents.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Hell Let Loose&nbsp;</em>right now for free <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/hell-let-loose-03f036" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on the Epic Games Store</a>. It's also available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/686810/Hell_Let_Loose/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/hell-let-loose/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/hell-let-loose/9n44wk3wv2hj" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.</p>

So, for those who are GeForce NOW members, buckle up. There are a lot of fantastic games released this month that you'll be able to play using a game-ready rig and stream to your device without having to worry about putting your own device under significant pressure.</p>
<p>Starting off this week, there are two games that are currently available to stream, with the rest of the games being released throughout the month of January, giving you plenty of time to prepare for some hefty gaming sessions in the future. Here is what you can expect:</p>

<p>Moving on, there is the GeForce LAN 50 gaming missions that will take place on January 4. Anyone who is a member can participate in the event, which will have 50 hours of gaming, contests, and prizes. You can either join from your own rig or you can take place in the contests at one of the four physical LANs. Some of the games included are Diablo IV, World of Warcraft, The Elder Scrolls Online, Fallout 76, and THE FINALS.</p>
<p>For more information about the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/geforce-lan-50/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GeForce LAN event</a>, you can check out the official website, which has all of the details about where and when the event is taking place, with addresses for each of the four locations.</p>
<p>Then, there is the opening <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/events/ces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA CES Keynote</a> on January 6, where those interested can enter the virtual stadium of the event using the GeForce NOW app on a PC, Mac, or a web browser. To access it, you don't need a GeForce NOW membership to see what will be taking place during the talk. The stadium is hosted by ZENOS, which uses NVIDIA's cloud gaming infrastructure to deliver high-quality streaming experiences via web browsers and make live events such as these more accessible.</p>
<p>That concludes the first GeForce NOW Thursday of the year. What games will you be playing this month?</p>

<p>It’s been over a year since Rockstar revealed Grand Theft Auto (GTA) 6 to the world, and fans are eagerly awaiting any sort of news about the first GTA game in over a decade. Now, in what appears to be a leak from a former employee, there’s a small look at what appears to be GTA 6 running on a development machine.</p>



<p>First shared on Reddit, user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GTA6/comments/1hr9lkk/a_photo_from_mid2021_i_think_its_been_long_enough/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">JustLovett0</a> posted an image of the game that was reportedly taken in 2021. They said that it was taken by someone they are “close to” when they worked at Rockstar.</p>



<p>“I think it’s been long enough I can post this,” they said.</p>



<p>The post was immediately removed from the GTA 6 subreddit. However, it has been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1hratml/reupload_of_the_guys_gta_6_leaked_photo_vids_from/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reuploaded elsewhere</a> for those who want to see it. Overall, it’s nothing much aside from one still image and two short clips showing the inside of Rockstar’s office with numerous dev kits on desks.</p>







<p>GTA 6 is currently scheduled for release in fall 2025. Since the original trailer, however, Rockstar has been silent on when more information will be shown. That’s led to worry and rumors that the game will ultimately miss 2025 and be pushed to 2026.</p>



<p>When it does release, GTA 6 will be available on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. </p>



<p>When do you think we’ll finally get new information on GTA 6? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

                <p>Russia is looking to enter the video game console space by creating its own systems, and the country is reportedly planning on making two different kinds as it continues to feel the economic impact of its illegal invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/106133-russia-admits-domestic-consoles-cant-match-ps5-or.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">TechSpot</a>, one of them is reportedly a traditional console using the Elbrus processor, which is developed by the Moscow Center of SPARC Technologies. This processor is mainly used for applications such as critical infrastructure and defense. It's also reportedly going to use a domestic OS--either Aurora or Alt Linux.</p><p>In a statement on <a href="https://t.me/webstrangler/3937" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Telegram</a>, deputy chairman of the State Duma Committee on information policy Anton Gorelkin confirmed that Elbrus processors aren't as powerful as the ones used in PS5 or Xbox, so Russia will have to take a unique approach to its consoles.</p><p>He also said that it won't be designed to play ports of older games, but serve as a platform to encourage domestic video game development.</p><p>The second console is reportedly a cloud-based one built by the Russian telecommunications firm MTS and will cost $45. It will reportedly utilize MTS' Fog Play--its cloud-based gaming platform that lets owners of high-end PCs to charge an hourly price to those with less powerful machines.</p><p>As Russia has been sanctioned due to its invasion of Ukraine, the government is looking to promote more domestic technology. Last year, Russian President Vladimir Putin initiated the government to <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/102440-putin-orders-creation-russian-game-consoles-cloud-delivery.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">create its own video game consoles</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-says-russia-is-infiltrating-gaming-communities/1100-6513243/" data-ref-id="1100-6513243">Microsoft has said that Russia has been infiltrating the gaming community</a>.</p>

            <p>I think the last time I read an actual, original Garfield comic was in 1998. Since then, my experience of the character has been one long litany of Gar-memes and in particular, <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/creepy-garfield-gorefield">Gorefield memes</a>. For those blissfully unaware, Gorefield is a version of Jim Davis’s otiose, lasagne-loving housecat who has broken his comic strip shackles and become a cosmic abomination. Gorefield's manifestations are many: centipede Gorefields, arachnid Gorefields, Gorefields that extend serpentine necks of unfleshed bone towards a cowering Jon Arbuckle, demanding to be fed in a voice that sounds <em>nothing</em> like Bill Murray, a voice as deep and velvety as the eternal Monday before the Big Bang.</p>
<p>In Gar-Type, a free Gorefield fangame from Youtuber and pixel artist LumpyTouch, Garfield has become a planet. The good news is that, unlike many other Gore-variants, this Gorefield is vulnerable to bullets. It falls to ace pilot Jon Starbuckle and his prototype starfighter, Gar-Type D, to save the Earth from lasagnnihilation.</p><!--more-->

<p>You can help the dashing Starbuckle by moving your mouse around and clicking the buttons while the screen scrolls rightwards. There’s a nifty recharging teleport attack which I seldom manage to aim effectively, despite this being a game so straightforward your actual housecat could probably finish it in one sitting. Be sure to time your collection of power-ups, as well: they’re on shuffle, and there’s nothing worse than bagging a surplus health refill when you badly need some ricocheting spaghetti beams.</p><p>Garfield nostalgia aside, this is quite a posh fan production, with art and sound effects from Lumpy, programming from qkjosh, music from MelonadeM with contributions from stevedoesmusic, and a 3D starfighter model from willkmr. The visuals are Lovecraftian purple and the soundtrack is that particular grade of chiptune that prompts mild synaesthesia and has me imagining the smell of Red Bull.</p>

<p>I do like it when developers throw their heart and soul into the production values of a video game concept spun out from a 6/10 title pun. Not that one should crack wise about Gorefield. He sees all. He is looking at the top of your head right now. He thinks the top of your head looks rather like a plate of lasagne.</p>
<p>You can play Gar-field <a href="https://lumpytouch.itch.io/gar-type">right here in a browser</a>.

So now you can try to belt Cynthia Erivo’s “Defying Gravity” battle cry from the comfort of your own home. The digital version of the movie includes some special features like commentary from Erivo and co-lead Ariana Grande, behind-the-scenes interviews, and a handful of deleted scenes. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/wicked-movie-barbie-porn-site-mattel-1851694637&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/wicked-movie-barbie-porn-site-mattel-1851694637"><em>Wicked</em></a></span><em> </em>is already a long movie, running at two hours and 40 minutes, but after seeing some of the moments that were cut fans are asking if it would really have been so bad if the film had been a few minutes longer.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Some of these deleted scenes were fine to cut. One includes Grande’s character, Glinda the Good Witch, meeting her cronies Pfannee and ShenShen, and while it’s nice to give those characters a little more screen time, they’re mostly bit players in the grand scheme of things. The ones that feel like they would have added a lot of meat to the film include Erivo as Elphaba taking just a few minutes to flesh out her ties to Glinda and her sister’s boyfriend Boq.</p><p>Elphaba and Glinda’s friendship is the lifeblood of both the film and stage versions of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/wicked-mattel-porn-lawsuit-news-1851713647&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/wicked-mattel-porn-lawsuit-news-1851713647"><em>Wicked</em></a></span>, and while there’s a lot of time spent on their enemies-to-friends arc, a few gaps could’ve been filled. The deleted scene “Elphaba’s Promise” is only two minutes long but adds a great deal to the characters’ complicated relationship. This small interaction between the two as they study magic addresses the weird lack of acknowledging the point earlier in the film when Elphaba slips away with Glinda’s boyfriend Fiyero to save a captured lion cub. Here, we see Glinda ask why Elphaba didn’t ask her for help, to which Elphaba apologizes and says she won’t leave her behind again. In the final film, the two never really have a conversation about what happened. This would have also punctuated the moment later when Elphaba brings Glinda along with her to the Emerald City to meet the Wizard. Seeing that this scene was shot and ready to go makes it a puzzling omission. Yes, yes, you’ve gotta cut some things for time, but you’re telling me the duo fucking about with a busted hot air balloon in the last 20 minutes was more valuable than them fleshing out their relationship?</p><p>Another cut interaction that would have added a lot to the movie is one between Elphaba and Ethan Slater’s Boq. The munchkin is the boyfriend of Elphaba’s sister Nessarose, but he secretly harbors feelings for Glinda. Well, it’s a secret to Nessarose, at least. In “Boq &amp; Elphaba talk,” the Witch of the West talks with Boq about their hopes and dreams and how they’re both hopelessly in love with two unavailable people. When Elphaba is unwilling to admit she has feelings for Fiyero, Boq ends the chat with a banger of a line: “I’m sorry, I misunderstood. I thought we were being honest.” Tea clocked.</p><p>Without spoiling anything for those who don’t know anything about <em>Wicked</em>’s second act—which will make up the sequel movie <em>Wicked: For Good </em>on November 21—Boq is a pretty important character in what’s to come. Though the first film rightfully focuses on Elphaba and Glinda, its ensemble cast is about to go through some transformative experiences in the second film, and giving them just a little bit more time could have gone a long way. At least we have these scenes available to view in the special features. Even if they weren’t in the final cut, you can pretty much consider them canon because they slot nicely into the movie we got.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Kojima added that he hopes to resume production in 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">SAG-AFTRA video game voice actors accuse gaming companies of refusing to meet their demands on artificial intelligence. Negotiations over a new contract began in October 2022 and SAG-AFTRA members approved the strike in September 2023. Check out IGN’s feature, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-the-sag-aftra-video-game-actors-strike-means-for-gamers"><u>What the SAG-AFTRA Video Game Actors Strike Means for Gamers</u></a>, for more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What this means for both OD and Physint remains to be seen, with both games without an official release window. Both are video game / movie hybrids, with Nope and Get Out Director Jordan Peele collaborating with Kojima on OD. Physint was announced during a Sony State of Play broadcast, suggesting <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/could-hideo-kojimas-return-to-action-espionage-be-one-of-the-first-ps6-games">it may release on PlayStation 6</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Kojima is working on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2</a>, which is out at some point in 2025, and the live-action <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/death-stranding-movie-coming-from-a24-kojima-productions">Death Stranding film with A24</a>. In his tweet, Kojima teased “other adaptations” are underway, without saying any more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">OD and Physint aren’t the only video games affected by the SAG-AFTRA strike. Last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-confirms-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-character-recast-after-players-expressed-concern-about-new-voices">Activision confirmed it had recast some members of the <u>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</u> cast</a> after fans noticed much-loved Zombies characters with new voices in-game. Activision said at the time: "We respect the personal choice of these performers. Out of respect for all parties, we won’t add new commentary about the ongoing negotiations with SAG-AFTRA. We look forward to a mutually beneficial outcome as soon as possible."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is not subject to the strike because it was in development before July 25, 2024, when the strike began. However, as suggested by Activision's statement, the voice actors may have decided against signing new contracts in solidarity with striking union members. IGN has asked SAG-AFTRA for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Wiktor Szymanowicz/Anadolu via Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p>For the last two decades, players have looked for any sign that Valve is moving forward with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dont-expect-half-life-3-anytime-soon-if-ever-new-report-suggests/1100-6498401/" data-ref-id="1100-6498401">Half-Life 3</a>.

Now, actor Mike Shapiro, who voices the enigmatic G-Man in the Half-Life games, has shared a cryptic New Year's message on X that has some fans speculating that Half-Life 3 could finally arrive this year.</p><p>In the brief recording, Shapiro revisits his unsettling G-Man voice as he says, "May the next quarter century deliver as many unexpected surprises, as did the millennium's first." He then cryptically notes that time is fluid like music, before adding that he'll "see you in the new year."</p><p>This message follows a previous report by Valve leaker <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yP9JgtJPzbI&amp;ab_channel=GabeFollower" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gabe Follower</a>, who claims that Half-Life 3 recently entered play testing for "family and friends of Valve developers."

			<p>The console war between PlayStation and Xbox is as old as time, and it doesn't seem to be slowing down any time soon. While it has been a financially rocky period for both PlayStation and Xbox, Xbox certainly suffered more than its competitor. However, an analyst in the gaming industry has shared that they think that Xbox is actually doing pretty well for themselves and has a bright future ahead of them.</p>
<p>Mat Piscatella, Executive Director of games at Circana, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/platforms/xbox-series-x/despite-a-rocky-couple-of-years-analyst-reckons-xboxs-console-war-is-actually-looking-pretty-bright-if-you-look-at-the-playstation-sales-chart-you-see-a-lot-of-microsoft-on-there/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spoke to GamesRadar+</a> about Xbox's history and what is in store for them in the future. According to Piscatella, if you look at the <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-remains-one-of-top-played-games-across-3-platforms-in-us-sonic-frontiers-gets-resurgence/">overall sales</a> and what is going on in the PlayStation sales chart, you may find that there is a fair amount of Microsoft on their charts. He says that for Xbox to be successful, they need to branch out to embrace other platforms instead of competing against them, which will boost their sales considerably.</p>
<p>"You can look towards the future and some of the things they've talked about; expanding the reach of the Xbox brand well beyond the Xbox console is a key initiative, and they're executing on that."</p>
<p>2024 was their most obvious attempt to date regarding moving away from their console and branching out and funneling money into other money makers. For example, Xbox started to promote Game Pass pretty heavily. While for a lot of companies, subscriptions don't particularly do well, Game Pass has a lot of potential as it allows those on PC and Xbox to access games for a fixed price, giving them access to triple-A titles and indie games.</p>
<p>While Game Pass is important to Xbox, Piscatella believes that they need to balance out their approach to Game Pass and their other services, rather than honing in on it so heavily.</p>
<p>"I think it has a really nice role to fill in a portfolio of products being offered to consumers. But perhaps the previous strategy of going all in on just that, course correcting them seems to have been a good decision."</p>
<p>Their competitor, PlayStation, made obvious efforts last year to work on putting some of their games on other platforms, instead of keeping them as a console exclusive. So far, this has worked tremendously in their favor. Games such as Helldivers 2 have been massively successful across both PC and PlayStation 5. When it comes to exclusives, Xbox doesn't really have that many on offer that players are desperate for, and as a result, they are trying to be more aggressive in getting Xbox titles shipped to other platforms to ensure the most profits.</p>

Nintendo’s first-party releases on the current Switch are infamous for how optimized they are. <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> is the company’s biggest game on the platform and it’s still only 18.2GB.<strong> </strong>Higher resolution textures and other improved assets can all dramatically increase that digital footprint, however.</p><p> The patent outlines an example where native 4K textures might bump a game’s install size up to 60GB, while a 1080 native version that uses upscaling could get away with just 20GB, which is still less than the current 32GB cap on existing Switch cartridge memory sizes. </p><p>News of the patent comes alongside more alleged leaks about the Switch 2 hardware itself. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-images-leaks-ai-fake-reddit-1851729048&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-images-leaks-ai-fake-reddit-1851729048">Following a recent influx of possible first-look images at the upgraded console</a></span>, there are now <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1hqu83a/switch_2_motherboard/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1hqu83a/switch_2_motherboard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">potential photos of the hardware’s actual motherboard</a></span> floating around online. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://famiboards.com/threads/future-nintendo-hardware-technology-speculation-discussion-st-new-staff-post-please-read.55/page-3804#post-1495792&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://famiboards.com/threads/future-nintendo-hardware-technology-speculation-discussion-st-new-staff-post-please-read.55/page-3804#post-1495792" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This has led to some heated debate</a></span> about what semiconductor manufacturing process was used to create the Switch 2's chip and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/dark1x/status/1874534475734073681&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/dark1x/status/1874534475734073681" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">thus how powerful it might be</a></span>. </p><p>Ultimately, however, it’s impossible to know just how powerful the Switch 2 will be compared to the existing, seven-year-old hardware, until we get a sense of the full list of trade-offs Nintendo has decided on once it reveals the official list of specs and features.

<p>Last year was a great year for sports video games. In 2024, we saw the return of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/inside-the-response-to-college-football-25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">college football</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/undisputed-review-redefining-the-boxing-game-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">boxing console games</a>, fantastic new indie titles, and some of the highest-rated games in the history of long-running franchises. But if 2024 was that great, just how much better could 2025 be? If what’s expected to release in any indication, sports fans could be in for another stellar year. So, let’s take a look at the biggest sports video games expected to release in 2025.</p>



<p>Whether you want to hit the links, drive around the track, or get back on the football field, there’s going to be no shortage of options for your this year.</p>

<h2 id="h-biggest-sports-games-of-2025">Biggest Sports Games Of 2025</h2>



<h3 id="h-college-football-26">College Football 26</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>College Football 25 took the world by storm in 2024, and became the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/college-football-25-remains-2024s-best-selling-video-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best-selling sports video game</a> in United States history. What’s more, the game has remained at the top of the 2024 sales charts in the United States, even keeping games like Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 at bay. So, naturally, it’s time to think about just how EA Sports will follow up with this year’s game.</p>



<p>We know it’s coming, but what will College Football 26 do to improve on the first college football game in 11 years? Will Road to Glory see added depth? Will Team Builder allow for custom stadiums? Facility improvements in Dynasty Mode? Will it come to PC? There’s a lot that can be done to keep the momentum going in 2025.</p>

<h3 id="h-pga-tour-2k25">PGA Tour 2K25</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>A game that hasn’t officially been announced yet, PGA Tour 2K25 is currently planned for a release by March 31, 2025. At least, that’s what <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-pga-tour-2k-game-confirmed-for-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Take-Two CFO Laine Goldstein let slip</a> during the company’s Q2 FY2025 earnings call last November. Since then, there has been no mention of the upcoming game in any capacity, seemingly confirming that it wasn’t supposed to be mentioned on the call. However, now that the game’s out there in the open, it seems like it’s only a matter of time before fans find out how it’ll improve upon PGA Tour 2K23.</p>



<h3 id="h-wwe-2k25">WWE 2K25</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>WWE 2K24 was the best-selling and highest-rated game in the WWE 2K franchise since Take-Two acquired the WWE license in 2013. The game wasn’t without it’s issues, however, which makes WWE 2K25 all the more anticipated. Sources have told Insider Gaming that due to the success of 2024, Take-Two is investing more into the game. So, the hope is that it translates into improvements that fans have been hoping for for years, such as updates to the game’s Universe Mode.</p>

<p>It’s been over three years since NASCAR fans have received a proper video game — if you want to call NASCAR 21: Ignition a proper game. That’s what makes this year so exciting. A new NASCAR console game is scheduled for the fall, and it’s the first one coming from iRacing since it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nascar-announces-new-console-game-coming-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">purchased the license</a> from Motorsport Games. </p>



<p>The deal was announced in October 2023, and it’s been pretty quiet on the update front from the team working on the game. We know it’s going to be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-iracing-nascar-console-game-monster-games-in-unreal-engine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">built in Unreal Engine with Monster Games</a> leading the way as well as it being available on PS5, Xbox Series, PC, and, as of today, Nintendo Switch. With the 2025 NASCAR season right around the corner, we should start getting more information on what to expect sooner rather than later.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Tango Gameworks is dead; long live Tango Gameworks Inc. That's the new "reborn" name of the Hi-Fi Rush studio, which is now officially a part of PUBG publisher Krafton Inc. Tango began last year under the Xbox Game Studios umbrella before a tumultuous few months saw the developer almost shuttered permanently before Krafton stepped in.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://x.com/tangogameworks/status/1874259495783981205?s=46" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">On X</a>, Tango announced the studio's "new start" earlier this week and said it's "excited to continue crafting games that bring joy to players around the world." This is the first post from the official Tango account since May 7, 2024, when <a href="https://x.com/TangoGameworks/status/1787837929332601189" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the developer stated that it would "close."</a> That message was a result of Tango being <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-is-shutting-down-four-studios-including-arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks/1100-6523227/" data-ref-id="1100-6523227">one of four studios that Microsoft shut down at the time</a>, which also included Redfall's Arkane Austin.</p><p dir="ltr">However, in August, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tango-gameworks-saved-by-pubg-publisher-krafton-hi-fi-rush-rights-also-acquired/1100-6525702/" data-ref-id="1100-6525702">Tango was saved by Krafton</a>, with Hi-Fi Rush rights being acquired as well. The studio was started in 2010 and known for the survival-horror series The Evil Within, which will apparently stay with Microsoft. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tango-gameworks-started-work-on-hi-fi-rush-2-before-microsoft-closure/1100-6526814/" data-ref-id="1100-6526814">Hi-Fi Rush 2 was being worked on before Microsoft closed down Tango</a>, though the sequel isn't officially on the way. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hi-fi-rush-2-probably-wont-make-krafton-any-cash-but-but-thats-ok/1100-6526573/" data-ref-id="1100-6526573">Krafton realizes Hi-Fi Rush 2 might not make any money, and that's okay</a> for the company--if Tango decides to move forward with that project.</p><p dir="ltr">Krafton CEO Changhan Kim stated last year that giving Tango the support to continue being creative and developing new experiences was key.

                <p>Game designer Hideo Kojima <a href="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1873951232764895628" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">provided an update</a> on his in-development games, including Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, OD, and Physint. Starting with the latter two, both were impacted by the SAG-AFTRA strike for video game actors, which began in July 2024 and remains ongoing.</p><p>For OD, which is in the works alongside Microsoft and Xbox, Kojima said his teams "developed the game" and did scanning efforts for environments and the actors themselves. Scanning and filming for OD was suspended due to the strike, however. For Physint, which is being published by Sony, Kojima said casting was suspended due to the strike. "We hope to resume [in 2025]," Kojima said.</p><p>As for Death Stranding 2, Kojima said, "We started to play and build up the game." He added that his teams conducted music production and recording, along with ADR for the actors.</p><p>Games that went into development prior to September 2023 are understood to be exempt from the strike, along ongoing with live-service games. This likely explains why OD and Physint were impacted but Death Stranding 2 was not.</p><p>OD will feature the actors Sophia Lillis, Hunter Schafer, and Udo Kier, with Oscar-winning director Jordan Peele contributing to the script. The cast for Physint, meanwhile, is unknown at this point. Death Stranding 2, meanwhile, features Norman Reedus, Lea Seydoux, Troy Baker, Elle Fanning, and other celebrities.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-members-who-work-video-games-go-strike" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">strike began July 26, at 12:01 AM</a>. It's the first time SAG-AFTRA video game actors have gone on strike since 2016, when the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-video-game-voice-actor-strike-is-ending/1100-6453577/" data-ref-id="1100-6453577">work stoppage lasted for about one year.</a></p><p>SAG-AFTRA and game publishers like Warner Bros., Activision, Disney, and others, negotiated for about two years prior to the strike being called. The key sticking point appears to be regulation of generative AI technology.</p><p>Beyond games, Kojima said preparations and planning are underway for the Death Stranding movie and "other adaptations" of Kojima's games. When Physint was announced, Kojima also confirmed a partnership with Sony's Columbia Pictures, so it seems there could be a Physint film in the works as well.</p><p>Kojima attended The Game Awards in December 2024, but had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kojima-on-lack-of-announcements-at-the-game-awards-sorry-about-that/1100-6528464/" data-ref-id="1100-6528464">no announcements to share.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/2/24334067/samsung-odyssey-g8-g6-3d-smart-monitor-m9-specs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Just a few days after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/29/24331748/lg-ultragear-gx9-bendable-oled-5k2k-monitors-specs">LG announced</a> its CES 2025 lineup of monitors, Samsung is doing the same. The company just introduced several new models, and perhaps the most impressive among them is the Odyssey OLED G81SF. It’s a 27-inch 4K monitor with a maximum refresh rate of 240Hz, 0.03ms response time, a glare-free display, and rear-core lighting with 52 color options. Samsung is also including a number of burn-in protection measures to ensure that the Odyssey G81SF’s screen looks pristine for years to come. The G8 is likely to be using the latest and greatest OLED panel from Samsung Display.</p><p>Next up is the Odyssey OLED G60SF — also a 27-inch OLED monitor — with a QHD resolution and an impressive 500Hz refresh rate that Samsung says effectively “eliminates lag and motion blur for ultra-smooth gameplay during critical moments.”</p><p>In 2025, Samsung is also finally shipping the Odyssey 3D monitor it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/9/24031774/play-vr-games-without-a-vr-headset">first teased at least year’s CES</a>. It lets you experience 3D visuals <em>without</em> any special glasses by using a lenticular lens on the front panel. “Eye tracking monitors the movement of both eyes using a built-in stereo camera, while view mapping continuously adjusts the image to enhance depth perception,” Samsung said in its press release. The Odyssey 3D only comes in a 27-inch 4K size; the larger 37-inch display <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/21/24225133/samsung-odyssey-3d-gaming-monitor-glasses-free-announcement">mentioned last year</a> has apparently been scrapped. The company says it offers “a rapid 1ms gray-to-gray response time, and a 165Hz refresh rate.”</p><div><figcaption><em>Samsung’s Smart Monitor series is making the switch to OLED.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Samsung</cite></p></div><p>That does it for the gaming-focused monitors, but Samsung is also announcing two others that are more focused on everyday productivity. The SmartMonitor series is finally going OLED with the new Smart Monitor M9. And this year, Samsung is throwing in a ton of AI capabilities including AI Picture Optimizer. Like on its TVs, this feature “analyzes input signals to determine the type of content being viewed — such as gaming, video, or productivity applications — and automatically adjust the display settings for the best visual experience.” This also works for gaming and can detect the genre of what you’re playing.</p><p>AI Upscaling Pro can make lower-res content look crisper at the M9’s 4K resolution, and the monitor has a maximum refresh rate of 165Hz. That’s a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23180741/samsung-m8-smart-monitor-review-32-inch-4k-smart-tv-usb-c-hdr">significant upgrade from the M8</a>, which topped out at 60Hz. Samsung says moving to OLED also allows for a new “ultra-slim” design for the Smart Monitor M9 that should take up considerably less desk space.</p><p>The last monitor being announced (at least for today) is the new 37-inch ViewFinity S8. It’s got a 16:9 aspect ratio, built-in KVM switch, 90W USB-C passthrough charging, and covers 99 percent of the sRGB color gamut. Peak brightness for this 4K LCD display tops out at 350 nits, which should be perfectly suitable for anything you’ll be doing at a desk.</p><p>Pricing and release dates are still to come, but <em>The Verge</em> will be in Las Vegas for CES 2025 in a matter of days. So you won’t have to wait much longer for some first-hand impressions of Samsung’s new monitors.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Each of <em>Oblivion</em>’s nine regions of Cyrodiil has unique flora and fauna for the team to recreate, and that’s on top of the enormous landscapes and cities.</p><p>The Gold Coast, for instance, is all but complete, with a new version of main city Anvil, “re-envisioned to realize its original concept art.” It’s the most wildly ambitious project, and as you’ll see in the video below, it looks <em>wonderful</em>.</p><p>Given <em>Skyrim</em> itself is 13 years old, it’s a testament to its engine how stunning <em>Skyblivion</em> is looking (albeit boosted by Bethesda’s own <em>Skyrim: Special Edition</em> upgrades). It does seem a bit galling that Bethesda will be sitting on whatever tech they’re using for <em>The Elder Scrolls VI</em>, but this still looks so, so much better than the 19-year-old <em>Oblivion</em> original.</p><p>The video’s narration makes clear that in order to release <em>Skyblivion</em>, they are legally required to remake every asset, including all the 3D models, which is a task of unimaginable magnitude. (Bethesda had a team of hundreds working for four years at full pay to do this the first time—this is a group of unpaid volunteers working in their spare time.) As such, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://skyblivion.com/volunteer/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://skyblivion.com/volunteer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the team is looking for more volunteers</a></span>—especially for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation_mesh&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation_mesh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">navmeshing</a></span>, UI and 3D modeling—to help them get the game over the line.</p><figure id="" data-id="8550ca352cd14e6cc4e20537a23563d2" data-recommend-id="image://8550ca352cd14e6cc4e20537a23563d2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1074" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image of a sunny, autumnal glen, with Worldspaces progress bars on the left." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An image of a sunny, autumnal glen, with Worldspaces progress bars on the left." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->TES Renewal Project / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8550ca352cd14e6cc4e20537a23563d2" data-recommend-id="image://8550ca352cd14e6cc4e20537a23563d2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1074" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image of a sunny, autumnal glen, with Worldspaces progress bars on the left." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This whole thing blows my mind. The Skyblivion Team has also written new music for each section of the game, and they’re even considering porting across the DLC when this main game is finished. Planned since 2011, prototyped by 2014, and in full development from 2018, they’re confident for a 2025 release, likely years ahead of Bethesda’s own follow-up, <em>The Elder Scrolls VI: Hammerfell</em>.</p><p>Kudos to Bethesda for letting extraordinary projects like these thrive, rather than sending takedown notifications and legal threats. To be able to play <em>Skyblivion</em>, you will be required to own legitimate versions of both <em>Oblivion GOTY Deluxe </em>and <em>Skyrim: Special Edition</em>, although given you can currently pick up <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/900883/The_Elder_Scrolls_IV_Oblivion_Game_of_the_Year_Edition_Deluxe/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/900883/The_Elder_Scrolls_IV_Oblivion_Game_of_the_Year_Edition_Deluxe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the former for $5</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/489830/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim_Special_Edition/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/489830/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim_Special_Edition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the latter for $10</a></span> on Steam, that’s not a big outlay.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

They’ll be available starting January 7:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong><em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em> | PS5 </strong></li><li><strong><em>Need for Speed Hot Pursuit Remastered</em> | PS4</strong></li><li><strong><em>The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe</em> | PS4, PS5</strong></li></ul></blockquote><p>  <em>The Stanley Parable </em>is a critically acclaimed 2013 walking sim meta-narrative about game design and player agency, with the recently released <em>Ultra Deluxe</em> version improving the graphics and enormously expanding on  the content. <em>Need for Speed Hot Pursuit Remastered</em>, meanwhile, is one of the better games in the racing series, developed by Criterion Games, makers of the<em> Burnout</em> franchise. </p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/suicide-squad-justice-league-review-is-it-good-batman-1851222047&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/suicide-squad-justice-league-review-is-it-good-batman-1851222047"><em>Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League</em>: The <em>Kotaku </em>Review</a></span></p><p>But it’s <em>Suicide Squad</em> that’s the most notable to see in the lineup. Rocksteady Studios’ first new game since <em>Batman: Arkham Knight</em>, the open-world looter shooter ended up being a big disappointment for many fans of the Arkhamverse. The cutscenes and character work are still top-notch, however, and there are some neat things to see and discover in its sprawling Metropolis sandbox. </p><p>Unfortunately, it’s also chock full of live-service filler, with repetitive missions and boring enemy encounters. Hence why a year into its post-launch roadmap, the studio hasn’t announced any additional updates to conclude the game’s multiverse narrative saga. Deathstroke arrived last month as part of season 4, joining Joker, Mrs. Freeze, Lawless, and the rest of the playable roster. </p><p>The final update will go live on January 14, at which point an offline mode will make it possible for players to still experience the main campaign and post-launch story missions, even when <em>Suicide Squad</em>’s multiplayer servers eventually go offline. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
