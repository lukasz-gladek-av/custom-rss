<p>Valve is still dealing with an antitrust lawsuit raised against Steam by Wolfire in 2021, and recently, some documents came to light that were mostly redacted <strong>but </strong>contained enough information for a few juicy tidbits to be revealed. One thing that was noted was Valve’s employee counts and how they were spread around the company. In a staggering revelation, it was shown that fewer than 80 employees worked on Steam in 2021 – and the number isn’t expected to have changed much.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-that-ratio-though">That Ratio, Though</h2>



<p>Steam is maintained by a team of fewer than 80 people, which is pretty insane when you consider the traffic the platform gets. Every year, more than 10,000 games are released on the platform, and every day, millions of people use the popular PC storefront to buy and play games. By market share, it’s the biggest gaming platform on PC, and it’s well known for the regular and immense sales it holds.</p>



<p>In documentation revealed from the Valve vs. Wolfire lawsuit, which <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/lawsuit-paperwork-reveals-valve-employs-around-350-people-and-less-than-100-work-for-steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">was detailed by GamesIndustry.biz</a>, it was revealed that in 2021, Valve employed 336 people, and just 79 of those were working on Steam. It was then noted that in 2021, 10,000 games were released on the platform – which means that the relatively small team must be using some insane operating model to keep on top of it all.</p>



<p>It’s safe to assume that means the 79 employees were (or are) split up between:</p>



<ul>
<li>Technical operations</li>



<li>UI</li>



<li>Networking</li>



<li>Sales and purchasing</li>



<li>Provider management</li>



<li>Security</li>



<li>CX</li>



<li>Onboarding</li>
</ul>



<p>And whatever else you might expect is required to run Steam. That’s a huge undertaking for such a small team, but Steam is number one, so I guess they’re not complaining.</p>

<p>In April, Amazon’s Prime Video service launched Fallout, a live-action adaptation of the post-apocalyptic series that debuted in 1997. It was a monumental success, boosting the profile of Fallout worldwide and bringing millions of players into the games. For me, the Fallout television show is nothing short of a masterpiece and it hit the nail firmly on the head when it came to the authenticity of its representation of the legendary franchise.</p>



<p>It was just revealed that Fallout has landed a whopping 16 Emmy nominations – but how many will it win?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-everyone-liked-that">Everyone Liked That</h2>



<p>Fallout has legs – that’s no big secret. It was recently discussed by the showrunners driving the project that the surface has only just been scratched in terms of the universe and the storytelling that’s up for grabs. </p>



<p>In a beautifully poetic coincidence, Fallout has wound up securing 16 nominations at the 76th Emmy Awards (Fallout 76, right?) and it looks in good shape to bring home plenty of those trophies. Last year, The Last of Us – which is widely considered the best live-action adaptation ever made – picked up 24 nominations and then won eight of those awards. Can Fallout beat The Last of Us’ record?</p>



<p> Here’s the full list of awards with my predictions against them:</p>



<ul>
<li>Outstanding Fantasy/Sci-Fi Costumes – <strong>Lose</strong></li>



<li>Outstanding Stunt Coordination for Drama Programming <strong>– Lose</strong></li>



<li>Outstanding Production Design For A Narrative Period Or Fantasy Program – <strong>Win</strong></li>



<li>Outstanding Picture Editing For A Drama Series – <strong>Lose</strong></li>



<li>Outstanding Picture Editing For A Drama Series – <strong>Lose</strong></li>



<li>Outstanding Main Title Design <strong>– Win </strong></li>



<li>Outstanding Period Or Fantasy/Sci-Fi Makeup – <strong>Win</strong></li>



<li>Outstanding Prosthetic Makeup – <strong>Win</strong></li>



<li>Outstanding Lead Actor In A Drama Series – Walton Goggins – <strong>Lose</strong></li>



<li>Outstanding Drama Series – <strong>Lose</strong></li>



<li>Outstanding Sound Editing For A Comedy Or Drama Series <strong>– Lose</strong></li>



<li>Outstanding Sound Mixing For A Comedy Or Drama Series – <strong>Lose</strong></li>



<li>Outstanding Special Visual Effects In A Season Or A Movie – <strong>Win</strong></li>



<li>Outstanding Stunt Performance <strong>– Win</strong></li>



<li>Outstanding Writing For A Drama Series – <strong>Lose</strong></li>



<li>Outstanding Music Supervision – <strong>Win</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Most of the nominations are for ‘The End’, which is the opening episode of the show that pulled in so many viewers. </p>



<p>How do you think Fallout will perform at the Emmy Awards?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/england-euro-2024-harry-kane-ea-sports-fc<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Earlier this year<a href="https://aftermath.site/aston-villa-fifa-pes-pro-evo-efootball-avfc-ecl-champions-league" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> I wrote about singleplayer sports games</a>, and how they're more than just isolated matches and campaigns. They are, for long-suffering fans especially, a kind of Dream Factory. Video game as therapy.</p><p>In May I was writing that while celebrating my beloved Aston Villa returning to the Champions League for the first time since 1983. This week, I am writing under sadder, more pressing circumstances.</p><p>You probably know by now that I'm Australian, but what most people don't know about me and my sporting interests is that, when it comes to football, my heart belongs to England. Between my own English family (who have played for Villa!) and my wife's English family, I've spent more nights watching--and screaming at--England than I probably have my own Socceroos.</p><p>Australians of roughly my age (I was born in 1980) grew up in a world where the Socceroos just weren't players on the world stage. Australia went <em>32 years</em> without appearing at the World Cup, and as part of the terrible Oceania Football Confederation<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRH5u5lpArQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> didn't have a decent local tournament to take part in either</a>. So every two years, every time the Euros and World Cup rolled around and Australian football fans were stuck on the sidelines (to be fair we will <em>always </em>be on the sidelines for the Euros, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_in_the_Eurovision_Song_Contest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unless there's a Eurovision-style intervention</a>), we needed <em>some </em>kind of investment. Being an immigrant nation, the solution here for me, my friends and just about everyone I know from football was simple: just start supporting the place your family originally came from.</p><p>Got Italian grandparents? You'd support Italy. Dad's Greek? You're Greek. And so it went, for Croatians and Spaniards and Scots, Dutch, Germans and Portuguese. In daily life everyone was Australian, most of us born here or at least calling here home, but every two years our hearts would belong to a nation and a team half a world away.</p><p>For most of those guys, the last few decades have been pretty good! Italy, Germany, France and Spain have all won the World Cup and the Euros, while even the Greeks and Portuguese have won the latter. And in all that time, England have won...nothing.</p><p>The nation that invented the sport and gave it to the world, that is home to the Premier League, that has repeatedly fielded star-studded lineups featuring some of the world's best players, has won nothing. Not a fuckin thing. England hasn't won a major international trophy since 1966. Indeed things have been so grim for most of my life--my earliest memories of supporting the team are at Italia 90--that it took until 2021 for them to even <em>reach another final</em>.</p><p>Which they lost. Then they made another one this week! <a href="https://defector.com/spain-was-unstoppable-to-the-very-end" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">And lost it too</a>. The wait goes on.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJqimlFcJsM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Thirty Years Of Hurt is itself about to turn 30</a>. I get that for the rest of the world this is something of a punchline, or at the very least a source of amusement, and I completely understand why that is, but I'm not the rest of the world. I'm just sitting here wondering, as the years and decades roll on, and heartbreak piles atop disappointment atop heartbreak,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRWAQ255qhs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> when does Gil get a lick</a>?</p><p>Maybe never! Maybe this is England's destiny.<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1e42ywh/in_1966_after_england_won_the_world_cup_nelson/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> To wander the wilderness forever cursed</a>, always thirsty and never able to drink, reaching semis and finals only to come up short every single time. If so, then so be it. I've had 44 years of practice, I am hardened to it now, if England go the rest of my life without winning something that will simply be how the biscuit has crumbled.</p><p>Being a fan of a team like this is frustrating because you feel so helpless. Trapped in a room you can't get out of, bound to a set of events that continually upset you but which you can't escape. To support England is to know that every two years, as the World Cup and Euros rotate, you are going to get your heart broken.</p><p>Just because I'm helpless watching the actual team stumble, though, doesn't mean I can't do <em>anything </em>about it. There's always the Dream Factory. So this week I've been playing the shit out of the Euro 2024 expansion for <em>EA Sports FC 24</em>, giving me a window into an alternate timeline where instead of lumbering around for seven games and<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/euro-2024-golden-boot-standings-top-scorers-kane-b2579696.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> winning the most embarrassing Golden Boot of all time</a>, Harry Kane looked sharp as a thistle and scored seven goals leading England through the tournament, culminating in a crushing 3-0 win over Germany in the final in which he scored a brace. The real Harry Kane may have drudged off the field on Sunday night still somehow without a major trophy to his name, but <em>my </em>Harry Kane, the one inside my Dream Factory, lifted the Henri Delaunay Trophy without breaking a sweat.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="FC 24 | Official UEFA EURO 2024 Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IpTyOJL59N0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Did this make me feel&nbsp;<em>better</em>? No. Only the slow passage of time--and maybe some day an actual victory in a major tournament--will achieve that. But for a few moments this week it has made me feel&nbsp;<em>slightly&nbsp;</em>better, in the way that the Dream Factory has always (and hopefully will always) be able to. I know that the victorious Harry Kane, the jubilant captain breaking a&nbsp;<em>58-year trophy drought</em>, is not real. The fact EA's player models haven't been significantly updated in over a decade sees to that.</p><p>But it's something. A temporary indulgence, a flight of fancy that's fun in the same way any other kind of daydream can be. It's not real, it will never be real, but for the moment I allow myself to pretend it is and could be, it's close. Closer than England have got over the last 58 years, anyway.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="UEFA Euro 2024 - England Win The Euros Celebration - EA Sports FC 24 (PS5)" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iivkf9sIg48?start=11&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legendary-metal-slug-returns-with-metal-slug-awakening<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Classic arcade gameplay with stylized graphics and innovative new features</h2></div><section><p>For those who spent their youth in the captive grip of arcade games, the name Metal Slug needs no introduction. The action-filled side scroller was a mainstay in arcades across the globe, and it's making a comeback with Metal Slug: Awakening, now accessible on PC and mobile.</p><p>Unfamiliar with the franchise? It all started in 1996, when Metal Slug first appeared as an arcade machine. Almost every laundry shop or pizza joint had a Metal Slug machine. For just 25 cents, you could enjoy top-tier fun. There’s something nostalgic about that wild yet joyful arcade era of the ’90s, when you’d get so hooked on a game that you’d forget what time you were supposed to go back home.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/11/new-contents-far-beyond-classic-4-1720740295130.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The story of Metal Slug was set in a dystopian 2028. You took on the role of a soldier, fighting a coup that threatened to shatter the peace and impose a new world order. You bombarded enemies with relentless gunfire and melee attacks, all the way to the boss showdowns in each level.</p><p>On the way through each level, you could find prisoners of war who would give you rewards when you freed them. You always started with a simple handgun, but as you progressed through levels, you picked up special weapons — like machine guns, rocket launchers, and shotguns. You could also jump in tanks called Metal Slugs (the series’ namesake, of course). As the series progressed, it added more heroes and more special weapons.</p><p>Awakening is built on the same foundation as its predecessors. It still features side-scrolling action, special weapons, and Slugs. Even the iconic “mission start” and “mission complete” announcements from the original game are still present. But it's not all old-school — graphical updates breathe new life into characters, weapons, and vehicles; fresh characters with unique abilities debut; and innovative features and game modes offer a refreshing twist to the gameplay.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/11/metal-slug-mission-start-1-1720740354067.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Speaking of characters, that’s an area where Metal Slug: Awakening has expanded. While previous games had a maximum of six characters, Awakening has more than 20 — with more still on the way. You can unlock characters in the Treasure Dig mode, and each character has unique skills and an ultimate ability that can range from slowing down time to summoning a battleship.</p><p>Awakening introduces a mix of classic weapon types as well as unique, new-to-the-series armaments like sniper rifles, saw launchers, and a boxing gun (a literal firearm with a spring-loaded punching glove attachment). Additionally, all weapons come in different varieties, some of which can apply distinct status effects, such as freezing or burning enemies.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/11/diverse-missions-showcase-exquisite-skill-3-1720740384291.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Joint Operation is another one of the major innovations in Metal Slug: Awakening. In contrast to traditional arcade games where you might face bosses alone, you can now join forces with two additional players for those epic showdowns. You can do this by getting together with your friends or teaming up with strangers the game pairs you with. You’ll each choose your own character and pack your most potent weapons before hitting the battlefield to claim victory.</p><p>Looking for a change of pace? You can dive into the PvP mode for a different experience. Face off against real players, controlling three characters and switching them in and out to demonstrate your unique combat style. With three characters and three weapons at your disposal, the combinations you can come up with offer countless possibilities.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/11/team-up-fight-with-friends-2-1720740405635.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Now, time for play! Metal Slug: Awakening is available to download for free right now on PC, iOS, and Android, and you can play it with a controller. Your progress is linked to an account that can be used across all platforms, so you’ll never have to start over from scratch. Enjoy your time revisiting a classic series.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/college-football-25-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>About a week before College Football 25’s play-early-if-you-give-EA-more-money release, I found myself at a friend’s wedding in Texas, overhearing someone with plans to buy a brand new console <em>just</em> to be able to get this game. I knew the long-awaited return of an NCAA video game was going to be popular, but I didn’t realize it was going to be system-selling levels of enticing. I’ve thought about that guy a lot as I’ve played College Football 25 over the last week, and about how excited he was – I wonder if he’s bought it yet, and if he’s having a good time, because so far my own experience as a longtime Madden player has been… mixed. The on-field action and visuals are generally stellar, but the barebones modes, awful UI, lack of tutorials, and slew of other annoyances and poor design choices have made everything else about it a pretty joyless slog so far. </p><p>Let’s get the good stuff out of the way first: College Football 25’s presentation is light-years beyond what developer EA Orlando has been doing with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/madden-nfl-24-review">Madden</a>. You can see sweat on individual players, the lighting is exceptional, and everything pops visually in a way that Madden just doesn’t. There’s also just a lot more stuff to enjoy, from the unique intros for each team as they take the field to mascots dancing around when their school pulls off a big play. There’s even performances from cheerleaders, school-specific cheers, and live cuts to the crowd reacting to what’s happening in real time. College Football 25 captures a lot of the pageantry and tradition that makes college football unique, and that makes it feel unique, too. I hope some of this added focus on presentation will make it over to Madden in the next few years.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>College Football 25 Sights and Sounds Deep Dive</h3></div></output><p>The other major difference is that it just feels <em>faster</em> and a whole lot more fluid. Plays happen more quickly, there’s less delay between them, and players feel like they’re moving more nimbly, too. When real-life players make the transition from college to the NFL, you’ll often hear them talk about having to adapt to the faster speed of the NFL game – here, though, it’s the other way around, and it makes College Football 25 feel dynamic in a way that Madden doesn’t.</p><p>There are also a lot of nice little touches throughout. I like how selecting your favorite team (which you do by choosing their helmet, not a name from a list) decorates the main menu with photos of their mascot, stadium, and other cool, team-specific things like ticket stubs, or how the loading screens and on-field play art looks like they’ve been drawn by hand. College Football 25 has <em>personality</em>. Oh, and unlike Madden 24, there’s no menu lag. It’s the little things.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>As far as modes go, things are a little barebones. </p></div><p>As far as modes go, though, things are a little barebones. You’ve got your standard Play Now feature for jumping into a quick game; Road to the College Football playoffs, which is an online ranked mode where you’ll pick a team and try to guide them to a National Championship; Road to Glory, which lets you create your own player and pilot them through their college career; Dynasty, where you’ll helm one of College Football 25’s 134 (!) teams as either a head coach or an offensive or defensive coordinator; Practice and Mini-Games modes; and finally, College Ultimate Team (CUT), the college version of Madden Ultimate Team, which is still a slot machine masquerading as a trading card game that will almost assuredly make EA hundreds of millions of dollars and eventually earn the ire of the player base as it gets more updates on a yearly basis than every other mode combined. Cynical? Maybe, but we’ve seen this movie before.</p><p>EA’s servers have been something of a mess since launch, so I haven’t really gotten to play much Dynasty yet – whenever I try to make a Dynasty league, it always fails to download the latest rosters from EA’s servers or sign my coach’s contract) – but I have messed around with the other modes, and so far, I’m pretty whelmed. I’ve spent the most time in Road to Glory, so let’s start there.</p><p>Disappointingly, there are no high school games to play in Road to Glory as there were in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/05/ncaa-football-14-review">NCAA Football 14</a>. Instead, you spawn your player from the ether, choose a position (you can play as a QB, HB, WR, MLB, or CB), and determine whether you want to start as a 5-star, 4-star, 3-star, or 2-star recruit. The better you are as a prospect, the sooner you’ll see the field, and the better you’ll play when you do, but starting off as a less desirable recruit is more challenging, and ultimately, more rewarding if you manage to make it to a starting position. (After all, everyone loves an underdog story.) I started as a 5-star QB named Joe Throw who got picked up by 5-star Michigan because I already work hard enough at my day job, thank you very much, and it’s been… not great.</p><p>Each week, you’ll allocate Rest Points to stats like Academics, Health, Training, Leadership, Brand, and so on. You only have so many, and sometimes you’ll get a text from a sponsor offering you an endorsement deal or from your academic advisor offering some extra study time, which will take up a good chunk of your weekly allotment. Spending points the right way is important because you have to maintain a certain GPA and don’t want to be so tired you open yourself up to injury. So far, however, it’s pretty basic resource management and the lack of any cutscenes means you’re mostly just navigating menus. Think of a somehow more barebones version of Madden’s already barebones Superstar mode, and you’re on the right track.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>My Road to Glory player is undefeated, but I’m not having much fun winning.</p></div><p>What’s really frustrating, though, is the on-field Road to Glory experience. As a quarterback, you’re only given one play call option each down, and you’’ll have to run that play unless you spend limited Play Change points to unlock two other choices. Earn more of your coach’s trust by playing well and spend your Rest Points wisely throughout the week, and you’ll get more plays to choose from. Makes sense, right? The issue is that even with maximum trust, you seemingly can’t audible, so if the plays you are given look like a bad fit against what the defense is showing you, there’s nothing you can do besides hot route your receivers on passing plays and hope it works out. On running plays? You’re out of luck, Jack. </p><p>And even if you spent the Play Change points, you’re still limited in what you can call, and sometimes it barely makes a difference anyway. If you don’t want a running play and spend a Play Change point, there’s no guarantee you won’t get two more running plays. Spending a point and getting what are essentially two more versions of the same play feels <em>bad</em> because you don’t earn more points as a game goes on. I get that this restriction is meant to simulate building your coach’s trust, and that’s all well and good, but at least let me have one or two pre-approved audibles. Give me <em>something</em>. Don’t get me wrong: Michigan is, as of now, undefeated; Joe Throw is almighty. But I’m not having that much fun winning.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>College Ultimate Team is… Ultimate Team. The Challenges you have to do to progress are boring, and it’s designed to take annoyingly long so that even decent players start to think opening their wallets isn’t a bad idea. College Football 25’s real sin, however, is locking all of the tutorial content inside Ultimate Team. Madden’s excellent Skills Trainer, which will walk you through everything from basic gameplay to identifying and beating certain defensive coverages? Not here. Instead, it’s been replaced with Ultimate Team Challenges, and the change is as bad as it sounds. One early one put me inside the red zone and tasked me with throwing a lob pass. You know, the kind you throw on deep balls after your receiver beats their corner and is running free down the field. And because it’s Ultimate Team and not the Skills Trainer, you have to choose the right play from your playbook, and make the pass in a single try. Otherwise, you’re staring at the “Challenge Failed” message over and over and over again. Remember, this is meant to be a tutorial.</p><p>It’s hard not to be deeply cynical about this design choice. Surely EA Orlando could have taken the Skills Trainer, which has existed in Madden for several years, and put another version of it into College Football 25. The only reason to do it this way is to encourage new players to go into CUT – of course, they’d have to realize that the tutorials are in CUT in the first place, which is something College Football 25 doesn’t advertise at all. As someone who doesn’t play Ultimate Team beyond the review period for obvious reasons, I just assumed that there were no tutorials at all and EA simply wanted college football-loving folk who don’t regularly play Madden to suffer. In actuality, however, they want them to get hooked on CUT and spend lots and lots of money. I’m not sure which is worse.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>While the visuals generally look wonderful, the UI is atrocious.</p></div><p>And then there are things that just don’t make sense. Every CPU team I’ve played so far loves to run a no-huddle offense, but College Football 25 does not simulate the time between plays unless you turn on the accelerated clock option in the menus. Teams otherwise come to the line instantaneously, which, aside from being annoying and making everyone on your defense very tired very quickly, means games last far longer than they should. The mini-games, which are generally more fun and varied than Madden’s (though some, like WR Battle, are one-to-one recreations), have a scoring system so strict they are impossible to get gold medals on unless you play perfectly. Bafflingly, there’s also no option to restart a mini-game if you finish it and don’t like your score, as there is in Madden, so I’ve found myself picking easy ones like Option Attack and just running them over and over again to spend as little time with them as possible. If you want to restart a mini-game to try and hit a higher score after you’ve completed it, you have to close and reopen the entire game.</p><p>And while College Football 25’s visuals are generally wonderful, the UI is, to put it kindly, atrocious. Madden has an automated hat count, which will show you how many defenders are lined up in both sides of the box on running plays and whether or not you have an advantage in blockers on either side. It’s not there in College Football, so you’d better know how to do that yourself. (I hope you like playing the CUT tutorials!) The “previous play” arts showing you the last play the offense and defense ran are hidden unless you flick the right stick to bring up that menu, which isn’t immediately obvious. It’s hard to see how much stamina defensive linemen have because, unlike the bar used in Madden, stamina in College Football 25 is represented by small blue circles over their heads that are hard to see, especially if you’re zoomed out. There are no on-screen notifications telling you what type of pass you just threw, whether you landed a hit stick, whether that pick you just got was perfectly timed, or anything else. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3>Will's Favorite Football Games</h3></p></div><p>God help you if you’d like to actually see what abilities your players have mid-match because the icons were made for ants. And while play arts look great on the field, the ones in your playbook are a step down from what recent Maddens have offered. Oh, and then there’s the genuinely embarrassing things, like certain schools having outdated logos – EA has publicly admitted to Stanford, Western Michigan, and Jacksonville State already – and certain player likenesses being inaccurate. I understand that College Football 25 is a massive undertaking, and EA hasn’t made a game like this in a long time, but the whole thing feels rushed, incomplete, and in a lot of ways, not up to par with Madden, much less <em>the other sports games</em> <em>that Madden already wasn’t up to par with</em>, which is basically all of them.</p><p>I still find myself thinking a lot about that guy I overheard at my friend’s wedding, a person who is buying a $500 console just to play this game. I wonder if he, as someone who doesn’t play a lot of video games, is having fun – because despite the NCAA’s wider appeal, so far it feels like anyone who doesn’t already know how to play EA’s football games is going to have a <em>really</em> bad time with College Football 25. Even as someone who plays way too much Madden, the stuff that’s not here is both baffling and infuriating. It’s barebones, sports poor UI design, has tutorials that range from “bad” to “non-existent,” and features a number of other frustrations that simply shouldn’t be here. Oh, and I really don’t appreciate seeing an Ultimate Team pop-up every time I exit every other game mode. I know it’s there, EA. We all do. I just don’t want to play it.</p><p>Maybe Dynasty will change things once the servers get sorted out and I can finally play it. Maybe that’s what makes everything click. I have a lot more to see and a lot more to play. The on-field game is fun! The presentation is excellent! But everything, and I do mean <em>everything</em>, surrounding those things makes me want to go lie down in a dark room for a few hours and think about the choices I’ve made to reach this moment. Maybe, by the time I have my final thoughts ready sometime next week, everything will click. But right now, EA College Football 25 feels like a college quarterback who left school for the NFL too soon, got drafted way higher than he should have because a team was desperate, started under intense scrutiny from a fanbase and an owner who are tired of losing all the time, and then flamed out of the league  because he just wasn’t ready for prime time. You always wonder what might have been with a player like that. Sometimes, it’s better not to rush, and instead spend an extra year honing your skills. You’d think the publisher behind Madden, of all things, would understand that.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

EA was ordered to stop creating college football games after a lawsuit between the company and former college football players arose over name, image, and likeness (NIL). This prevented any new games until 2021, when the NCAA created rules to compensate players based on NIL. Three years later, College Football 25 is here, with player names available in game for the very first time.<output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>College Football 25 Official Reveal Trailer Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Many of the older modes have returned to College Football 25, including Dynasty, Team Builder, and Road to Glory. Of course, dozens of new features have been added, including Stadium Pulse, which creates challenging road environments in college football's biggest stadiums. Over 10,000 athletes have opted into the NIL program for the game, with roster updates periodically planned as more players transfer or opt into the game.</p><p>While this Best Buy deal is great for console owners, <strong>Amazon has an ongoing promotion where you can save $30 off a new PlayStation 5</strong> by purchasing the College Football 25 game.

                <p>There have been numerous layoffs and studio closures in 2024, but one of the most-surprising was Microsoft's decision to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-is-shutting-down-four-studios-including-arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks/1100-6523227/" data-ref-id="1100-6523227">shut down Tango Gameworks</a>, the studio behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hi-fi-rush-review-good-vibes-only/1900-6418023/" data-ref-id="1900-6418023">Hi-Fi Rush</a>, The Evil Within, and more. Now, Silent Hill creator and Bokeh Game Studio founder Keiichiro Toyama has shared his thoughts about why Tango Gameworks didn't survive.</p><p>Tango Gameworks was founded Shinji Mikami, who made his name in the survival horror genre with Resident Evil just as Toyama established himself with Silent Hill. Mikami stayed true to his survival horror roots with Tango's first two games, The Evil Within and The Evil Within 2. According to Toyama, the decision to branch out from that genre may have harmed Tango's long-term prospects.</p><p>"I don't feel it's my place to give them advice, but I think going back to what I said earlier about the balance of routine and preserving the style of your games is relevant," said Toyama while speaking with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/slitterhead-how-silent-hills-creator-is-building-2024s-craziest-horror-game/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>. "<span>You look at an example like From Software: They keep making different games but certain styles and aspects of their games stay the same. That's an obvious example of how a studio is successful. Not changing everything every time might be the key to life and surviving."</span></p><p><span>Mikami actually explained Tango's shift from survival horror <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tango-gameworks-wants-to-be-known-for-more-than-just-survival-horror-games/1100-6501856/" data-ref-id="1100-6501856">in a 2022 interview</a> where he expressed his desire to expand beyond that familiar genre. "Of course, it's nice to have fans think of us as a studio with a reputation for developing survival-horror games," said Mikami. "But we also want to be viewed as a studio that can create a wider variety of games."</span></p><p><span>Toyama's comments didn't take into account the way that Xbox Game Pass has also taken away the incentive for many players to buy when they can sample instead. Microsoft <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-exclusive-hi-fi-rush-hits-2-million-players" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">touted Hi-Fi Rush as a success</a> when it netted 2 million players, and that still wasn't enough save the studio. </span>Mikami <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tango-gameworks-founder-shinji-mikami-finally-speaks-out-about-his-departure/1100-6522985/" data-ref-id="1100-6522985">left Tango Gameworks in 2023</a>, months before the decision to shut down the studio was made by Microsoft.</p><p>While Tango Gameworks has been shuttered, fans of Hi-Fi Rush can still look forward to Limited Run's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hi-fi-rush-is-still-getting-a-physical-edition-by-limited-run/1100-6523334/" data-ref-id="1100-6523334">upcoming physical edition of the game</a>.</p>

The integration will allow you to pick between either Xbox Cloud Gaming or Nvidia’s GeForce Now service when you view a game listing on the web.</p><p>Currently, Microsoft only lists its own Xbox Cloud Gaming service under “play with cloud gaming” on game listings, so it’s surprising to see the company add Nvidia’s GeForce Now service. At the time of publication, the new “play with cloud” button isn’t available just yet, so it’s not clear whether this is simply a link to the main homepage of GeForce Now or whether this deep links and launches the game directly on Nvidia’s cloud gaming service. </p><p>Nvidia’s GeForce Now RTX 4080 tier is the most impressive cloud gaming service available right now, with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/3/23537161/nvidia-geforce-now-rtx-4080-tier-pricing-release-date">Nvidia even claiming</a> the end-to-end latency beats an Xbox Series X running locally on a 60Hz TV. </p><p>Microsoft and Nvidia are no strangers when it comes to cloud gaming partnerships, though.   Both companies signed a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/21/23608930/microsoft-nvidia-geforce-now-xbox-games-announcement">10-year deal</a> to allow Nvidia to license Xbox PC games for GeForce Now, including Activision Blizzard titles. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/16/23963718/nvidia-geforce-now-pc-game-pass-xbox-account-sync">Nvidia also rolled out an update</a> to GeForce Now earlier this year that allows members to sync their Xbox accounts and Microsoft Store purchases to the cloud gaming service. You can even stream Xbox PC games through PC Game Pass on GeForce Now.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<!-- cache hit 8:single/related:fdd2dc749b7f53a39be294fc9de89cd2 --><!-- empty -->
<p>If you've ever seen <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/01/how-to-play-and-broadcast-video-games-non-stop-for-a-week-straight/">a record-breaking video game speedrun</a> or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/01/how-to-play-and-broadcast-video-games-non-stop-for-a-week-straight/">watched a Games Done Quick marathon</a>, you may have entertained fantasies that you, too, could put up some decent times on your favorite old games. Sure, it would probably take a bit of practice, but what these speedrunners are doing doesn't look <em>that difficult</em>, does it? How hard can it be to press a few buttons with good timing for a few minutes?
</p><p>After spending a few weeks with <em>Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition</em>, I no longer think that way. The game's bite-size chunks of classic Nintendo games highlight the level of precision needed for even a few minutes of speedrunning perfection, not to mention the tedium of practicing the same in-game motions dozens of times to build up the needed muscle memory. In the process, I gained a newfound respect for the skill displayed by the best speedrunners and found a fresh way to experience some classic NES games that I felt I knew backward and forward.</p>
<h2>Gotta go fast</h2>
<p>While <em>Nintendo World Championships</em> draws its name from a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/01/after-100000-bid-3-more-ultra-rare-nintendo-world-championship-carts-appear/">series</a> of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/05/nintendo-brings-back-its-world-championships-competition-25-years-later/">competitions</a> dating back to 1990, it draws its inspiration much more directly from the more recent rise of <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/">the online speedrunning community</a>. Thus, the game's main single-player mode is named "Speedrun," tasking players with putting up the fastest times in 150 mini-challenges spread across 13 different Nintendo-developed NES titles.
</p><figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/nwc1.png" data-height="928" data-width="1650" alt="Really? Get the Morph Ball? That's all you want me to do here?"></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/nwc1.png" data-height="928" data-width="1650">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> Really? Get the Morph Ball? That's all you want me to do here?</p><p>Nintendo</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>The earliest of these many unlockable challenges seem almost insultingly easy on their face—collecting the first Super Mushroom in <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> or collecting the sword in <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>, for instance. When you first dive in, you may be more than a little bemused to find yourself showered with in-game rewards for spending just a few seconds completing such basic tasks.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                

<p>But then you look at how much time that challenge took you—which is thrown up in huge numbers on the screen—alongside an even bigger letter grade. The "A" you got for collecting that Mushroom might seem pretty good, at first, but you know you could do better if you didn't miss the item box with your first few jumps. So you quickly restart the challenge (and breathe deep through a helpful three-second countdown) and trim off half a second on your second attempt, earning an "A+" for your efforts.</p>
<p>If you are a certain type of player, you might say, "Alright, that's good enough," rather than repeating this cycle yet again (if so, I'd argue this game is not for you). But if you're a different type of gamer, the mere knowledge that you <em>could</em> achieve an S rank with some combination of strategy and execution will propel you through entire minutes of repeated attempts, looking to optimize the perfect few seconds of button presses.</p>
<p>The fact that Nintendo doesn't reveal the specific timing cutoffs for the different letter grades is equal parts frustrating and subtly encouraging, here. There were plenty of challenges where I felt I played as optimally as I could only to be greeted with a mere "A++" rank next to my new best time. The S rank's mere existence often inspired me to redouble my efforts and look for new ways to trim even more time off my personal best.</p>

                <p>Time Crisis is one of the most iconic arcade games of the '90s, and now you can bring it home with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Arcade1Up-Machine-Stand-up-Cabinet-Classic/dp/B0CCQG91SL?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Arcade1Up Time Crisis Cabinet</a>.

While Wizards of the Coast's promotional drops have featured crossovers with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/summer-magic-gathering-secret-lair-x-hatsune-miku-revealed" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Hatsune Miku</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/mtg-secret-lair-summer-superdrop-2024-brings-assassins-creed-and-hatsune-miku" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Assassins Creed</em></a>, the new Brain Dead Secret Lair will showcase the work of the Los Angeles-based artist collective.</p>
<h2>The Brain Dead Secret Lair Announcement</h2>
<p>According to an official press release, the Brain Dead Secret Lair was announced as part of their upcoming Inside and Elevator Superdrop. The Secret Lair is comprised of three different drops, <em>Brain Dead: Creatures</em>, <em>Brain Dead: Lands</em>, and <em>Brain Dead: Staples</em>.</p>

Their brand takes cues from postpunk music, underground comic books, skateboards, and general subculture.</p>
<p>That alternative style will bring new life to several cards in the Brain Dead Secret Lair drops. <em>Brain Dead: Creatures</em> will showcase artists Gage Lindstein, Ema Gaspar, Gomzé, JRZ251, and Kagan. The cards in that drop are as follows:</p>
<ul><li><em>Consecrated Sphinx</em></li>
<li><em>Chaotic Goo</em></li>
<li><em>Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker</em></li>
<li><em>Meteor Golem</em></li>
<li><em>Wurmcoil Engine</em></li>

As the name implies, the drop will contain two copies of all five basic land cards. One will feature art by Lindstein; the other by Reavis.</p>
<p>Lastly, <em>Brain Dead: Staples</em> will contain cards every player needs in Commander. These titular staple cards will get treatments by Bardo Bread and Jackson Epstein. Those cards are as follows:</p>
<ul><li><em>Lightning Greaves</em></li>
<li><em>Skullclamp</em></li>
<li><em>Sol Ring</em></li>
<li><em>Thought Vessel</em></li>
<li><em>Command Tower</em></li>

In addition, Brain Dead will launch a collection of Secret Lair-themed merchandise Tuesday, July 30.</p>
<h2>The <em>Magic: Online</em> Vintage Cube Live Tournament</h2>
<p>In addition to the Brain Dead Secret Lair, Wizards of the Coast announced a massive Vintage Cube tournament for <em>Magic: The Gathering Online</em>. The twist is that finalists in this Vintage Cube Live tournament will attend a physical event at MagicCon: Las Vegas and draft cards from an actual Vintage prize cube valued at $65,000.</p>
<p>On top of that, all eight finalists will get to keep the decks they drafted. The press release even confirms the Power Nine, including the iconic Black Lotus, will be present in these packs.</p>
<p>If you want to secure your place in the Vintage Cube Live tournament, just complete the following steps. Sweep a MagicCon Draft League to earn a 64-Player Draft Entry Token. Win a MagicCon 64-Player Draft, which will earn you a Vegas Qualifier. Finally, go 3-0 in the Vegas Qualifier. Good luck.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/orcs-must-die-new-game-announced/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Robot Entertainment, the developers behind <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/orcs-must-die-3-reinforcing-the-genre/">Orcs Must Die</a>, has announced a new game for the franchise. The latest game is titled Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap will feature a multiplayer game mode for the first time. For those attending Gamescom, this will be the first time that people will be able to get a hands-on experience with the new game and provide feedback for the developers on their game.</p>
<p>For those who aren't going to Gamescom, you'll have to wait until 2025 to get your hands on this new Orcs Must Die game. It will come to Xbox Series X|S, Steam, and the Epic Games Store in early 2025.</p>
<p>This game features War Mages with unique weaponry, abilities, traps, and personalities that make them all lovable (or hateable.) Each hero in Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap has its play style to ensure that there is something for everyone to enjoy. This means that they can either work well on their own or have synergies in a team through the multiplayer game mode.</p>
<p>Whether you're someone who likes to play the game by themselves or you want to team up with friends, you can now do it in multiplayer game mode with up to four players. Adding more players comes with challenges and unique rewards to help you progress as a team throughout the game.</p>
<p>To keep the game fresh and replayable, no two runs will ever be the same. Each new run will have you facing off against new beasts and enemies with randomized buffs and debuffs that can stack. These debuffs can affect your hero's weapons, abilities, stats, and overall levels. The more debuffs and enemy buffs you pick up, the more complex the boss fight will be at the end when you think you've nearly succeeded.</p>
<p><iframe title="Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap - Official Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/i2PNXZ_Ea7Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The game comes with third-person shooter and melee combat, making it an intense experience but leaving you feeling victorious when you are successful in battle. Alongside the combat are the hectic physics-based interactions you can have with the enemies and hilarious ragdoll effects that can send your enemies wobbling through the air. You can watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2PNXZ_Ea7Y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official reveal trailer</a> above and see if it deserves a place on your <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2273980" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam wishlist</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/zenless-zone-zero-best-agents-tier-list/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>If you're getting stuck into Zenless Zone Zero and feeling overwhelmed by the number of options for creating a team, don't panic. Some characters are objectively better than others, while others may choose to play simply because you like them. There are no rules to playing Zenless Zone Zero. However, if you need guidance, keep reading for our <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/en-us/main" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zenless Zone Zero</a> best agents tier list.</p>
<p>The higher-tier characters are great if you want to take on some of the more challenging parts of the game, such as Hollow Zero, Notorious Hunt, and Shiyu Defense. While you could probably make it through with the base characters you're given, there are characters on this Zenless Zone Zero tier list that will make your journey significantly easier.</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Tier</td>
<td>Character</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>S- Tier</td>
<td>Ellen, Lycaon, Rina</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>A- Tier</td>
<td>Grace, Lucy, Soukaku, Soldier 11</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>B- Tier</td>
<td>Anby, Ben, Koleda, Nekomata, Nicole, Piper</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>C- Tier</td>
<td>Anton, Corin</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D- Tier</td>
<td>Billy</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h2>S Tier Characters</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p>Ellen is a powerhouse that uses Slash damage combined with Ice attacks. Even when not leveled up, her damage is significantly better than everyone else's. When she is teamed up with other S-tiers, the damage is immense. When paired with Lycaon and Soukaku, she has a great synergy with them. Using her Roaming state, she can quickly build up Flash Freeze charges, which can help stop an enemy in their tracks.</p>
<p>Lycaon has Ice Stun attacks as well as Strike damage. Not only is Lycaon great as a support character due to their increased Stun duration and Ice Resistance Shredding. Lycaon is a real asset, along with some of the other powerhouses that were in attack. Even if you aren't quite sure how to use this character, you can still output some beefy damage. Learn how to charge correctly and combo his attacks. Lycaon is one of the best characters you can put on your team.</p>
<p>Rina is an Electric support with Strike damage. While she can be challenging to get used to at first due to her slow attack speed, the overall group damage output can be boosted by utilizing her. Using her special attacks and then swapping to another character in the party can boost your damage numbers, and even when swapped, she will continue to do damage to the enemies. While in a support role, she's excellent at adding chip damage to the overall output.</p>
<h2>A Tier Characters</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p>Grace is an Electric Anomaly with Pierce damage. Compared to some of the other characters on this list, Grace can be really demanding in learning to play correctly. To be able to play her, you need to be mindful of how many stacks you have built up, as well as how often you are swapping in and out. While she is not a proper DPS, she can have some excellent damage output if she is adequately utilized and works well with other Electric-type characters.</p>
<p>Lucy is a Fire Support that deals Strike damage. Lucy can be a great asset to the team, as she has phenomenal support capabilities and great DPS. When paired with other Fire users, she has some great benefits. You'll have a great time utilizing Lucy on your team with minimal struggle by summoning her guard boars and pulling off successful EX special attacks. The small boars are a great asset as they scale off Lucy's critical strike and damage.</p>
<p>Soldier 11 is a Fire Attack using Slash damage. Soldier 11 is the only Fire attacker in the game, making her the perfect DPS to take into a fight where the enemies are susceptible to Fire. To make the most of Soldier 11, you need to get your timing down for her basic attacks so that she can perform combos that make the most of her Fire buff. While this may sound scary, it's very easy to perform; it just takes a little while to get into the flow.</p>
<p>Soukaku is an Ice Support with Slash damage. Soukaku is probably the trickiest character to learn to play out of the Zenless Zone Zero A-tiers, but she is still a solid pick. You must know how to time her basic attacks to pull off her combos and maximize her support capabilities. After successfully performing her combo, she gives buffs to her fellow agents' next attack, allowing the buffed agent to do much damage. Due to her being an Ice Support, she is best paired with other Ice agents.</p>
<h2>B Tier Characters</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p>Anby uses an Electric Stun with Strike damage. She is one of the free characters you get at the start of the game and is incredibly beneficial to have and level up. When paired with either more Electric squad members or members from the Cunning Hares, she has some great synergy with them. Her kit is far from complicated, and her combo is effortless. By utilizing it properly, she has powerful damage and a Daze boost after the third hit of her basic attack.</p>
<p>Ben is a Fire Defense that uses Strike damage. Ben is an excellent asset to the team purely because of the shield he can grant his entire squad after using a follow-up attack during his EX Special Attack. By using this, it also increases the Crit Strike for the team. The biggest downside to having Ben on your team is how slow they are on the battlefield, with other support characters doing a better job than them.</p>
<p>Koleda is a Fire Stun with Strike damage. Koleda comes as one of the most unique characters in the game, as her full potential isn't unleashed unless she is paired with Ben, which then boosts Ben in return. However, they are both incredibly slow attackers, which can make brutal fights extremely long, whereas in Zenless Zone Zero, speed is vital.</p>
<p>Nekomata is a Physical Attacker with Slash damage. If you like fast-paced action, Nekomata is the perfect pick for you. Compared to other agents in the game, Nekomata is top of the tier list for her physical damage output. However, she is very difficult to put on a team, as Piper is the only person she benefits from having on a team with her. To utilize Nekomata, you must have your timing on dodging and attacking down to a T.</p>
<p>Nicole is an Ether Support with Strike damage. Nicole would probably be a great asset if you're curating Ether teams. However, there are no other Ether agents, so it's unsure whether she would excel. While she gains and gives buffs to the other Cunning Hares if you pair them up, they aren't as good as some other team buffs. Once Zhu Yuan is released, Nicole may stand a chance at being helpful, especially with her Energy Fields.</p>
<p>Piper is a Physical Anomaly with Slash damage. Piper is a huge asset to the team as she can quickly build up and apply her Physical Anomaly using her EX Special Attack and boost the rest of the team's damage output. If you also need some stuns, Piper has great stun potential, especially if you're good at swapping out your characters on time.</p>
<h2>C Tier Characters</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p>Anton is an Electric Attack with Pierce damage. As it stands, Anton is the only Electric Attacker in the game. On top of that, his kit can be a bit difficult to utilize correctly, as it's hard to get his full damage potential out. He needs to be in Burst Mode to pump the damage consistently. However, as he is in Burst Mode, he loses energy, making tackling challenging.</p>
<p>Corin is a Physical Attack with Slash damage. Corin is most likely one of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/how-to-claim-all-180-free-pulls-in-zenless-zone-zero/">first agents you'll unlock</a> outside of the free agents given to you. Despite this, they can be beneficial. When dealing with crowd control situations, Corin is the perfect agent for the job. While her damage output is slightly lower than some of the other Zenless Zone Zero agents on this tier list, she can apply Daze with her assistance and does increased damage to stunned enemies.</p>
<h2>D Tier Characters</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p>Billy is the only D-tier character on this Zenless Zone Zero tier list. He uses Physical Attacks with Pierce damage. While Billy excels in crowd control, his overall damage is lacking, and you'd be better off building any other attacker. The further an enemy is away from Billy, the less damage he deals. This is difficult to handle, as he is a ranged attacker, but you must be as close as possible to get any good damage numbers out.</p>
<p>That concludes our Zenless Zone Zero tier list. It'll be updated as soon as new characters are released so you can stay on top of the trends and build the most powerful team possible.</p>

To get one of those you’ll need some gunpowder. And for <em>Once Human</em>’s gunpowder, you’ll need to acquire acid.

By then, you’ll have unlocked various technologies that will allow you to sift acid from contaminated water, but more on that later.</p><p><strong>Early on, the best way to acquire acid in the early game is by slaying enemies</strong>. Multiple enemy types in low-level zones drop acid, including:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Gnawer</li><li>Charred Maniac</li><li>Light</li></ul><p>You’re most likely to encounter a Gnawer or Charred Maniac, the former of which will always drop a handful of acid on death.</p><figure id="" data-id="6ead116a62014efd4aab90b6e84894c6" data-recommend-id="image://6ead116a62014efd4aab90b6e84894c6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A gnawer stands outside of a construction site." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A gnawer stands outside of a construction site." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Starry Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6ead116a62014efd4aab90b6e84894c6" data-recommend-id="image://6ead116a62014efd4aab90b6e84894c6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A gnawer stands outside of a construction site." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Alternatively, you will acquire junk items from crates, waste bins, and enemies you can bring back to the base.

A few potential spots can be found near:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Greywater Camp</li><li>Lone Wolf Wastes</li><li>Blackfell</li></ul><p><strong>You’ll typically need to be approximately level 20 before it’s wise to venture into a polluted zone.</strong> Most of the technology you require to farm polluted zones for acid requires tier four and five Memetics.</p><p>[Once-Human-Reverse-Osmosis-Purifiers.jpg]</p><p>To get started farming acid passively, you must unlock the following items:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Water Pump</li><li>Reverse Osmosis Purifiers</li><li>Fermentation (Brewing) Barrels</li></ul><p>First, place your Water Pump in polluted water, then power up the unit to ensure it can feed into the Reverse Osmosis Purifiers. As this process proceeds, impure acid is produced.</p><p>Unfortunately, <strong>impure acid isn’t good enough to craft gunpowder and ammunition</strong>. You must refine the impure acid using the fermentation (brewing) barrels and purified water.</p><p>Once all is said and done, you’ll have a semi-automatic process to farm acid in <em>Once Human</em>. It requires a bit of setup—crafting and grinding—but proves more than worthwhile as you push end-game content with enough ammunition to stave off the apocalypse!</p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Mini PCs are solid options for frugal shoppers, offering surprising power and portability without an inflated price tag. A handful are more enticing than usual during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/amazon-prime-day-deals/" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/amazon-prime-day-deals/">Prime Day</a>, as models from Beelink, GMKtec, and Ace Magician are seeing <strong>discounts up to $300</strong>.

That's the lowest price ever for the mini PC--and since it gets you 12GB RAM, a Celeron CPU, and 256GB SSD, it's better equipped than you'd expect for such a cheap PC. It's not powerful enough to run modern games, but that's a good amount of power for a rig under $150.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4335999-618-xoegtl._ac_sl1500.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4335999" data-ratio="0.56356356356356" data-width="999" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4335999-618-xoegtl._ac_sl1500.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4335999"></a><figcaption>Kamrui AK1 Pro Mini PC</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4335999-618-xoegtl._ac_sl1500.jpg"></figure><p>If you don't mind spending an extra $20, the <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beelink-Desktop-Computer-Support-Ethernet/dp/B0BVLS7ZHP?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://www.amazon.com/Beelink-Desktop-Computer-Support-Ethernet/dp/B0BVLS7ZHP?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Beelink S12 Pro</a></strong> gets you a bit more juice, thanks to its 12th Gen N100 CPU, 16GB RAM, and 500GB SSD.

                <p>Recent changes to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft's</a> Classic Era servers are being reverted "immediately," Blizzard has announced, after the developer apologized for failing to discuss "shortsighted" quality-of-life updates to the old-school version of Blizzard's long-running MMORPG.</p><p dir="ltr">The update, released last week, was originally designed for WoW Classic's more experimental <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-classic-season-of-discovery-looks-to-make-a-20-year-old-game-surprising-again/1100-6519561/" data-ref-id="1100-6519561">Season of Discovery servers</a>. However, Blizzard intentionally opted to bring some of the changes to the game's non-seasonal Classic Era servers too. Those changes allowed Druids to wield polearms, granted Alliance players a powerful new world buff on par with the Horde's existing Warchief's Blessing buff, and updated the game's guild interface to match that of the modern game.</p><p dir="ltr">Those changes took the Classic Era community, which generally doesn't enjoy major changes to the (for the most part) 2006 version of WoW, by surprise. Players were so surprised, in fact, that many on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/1e0azwg/new_classic_era_patch_notes/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> believed the changes had simply been a mistake on Blizzard's part, only to later learn that the changes were indeed intended. Now, Blizzard said those changes (minus the guild UI) are being removed, citing a "lack of communication" that "was not in line with our values."</p><p dir="ltr">"For everything it does perfectly, Classic Era is also beloved for its wonderful imperfections," Blizzard community manager Kaivax said in an <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/classic-era-patch-updates/1894672" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official post</a> on the Classic Era forums. "These 'perfectly imperfect' elements make up the texture of the overall experience, and we recognize that making changes to these, even with the intent of adding 'quality-of-life' updates--and particularly without discussing them with the community first--was shortsighted. Thank you, again, for your feedback."</p><p dir="ltr">As for the new guild UI, Blizzard said it recognizes the change is "jarring," even though feedback it received from guild leaders so far indicates the updated UI does help improve guild management. Blizzard said it's discussing "additional options" for the guild UI internally and will be looking to the community for feedback on what should be done next.</p><p dir="ltr">"As it stands now, the Classic team philosophically has very little desire to bring gameplay-impacting changes to Classic Era," Blizzard said. "Moving forward, we will endeavor to discuss any potential community-led desire for changes with the community, well in advance of actually implementing any updates."</p><p dir="ltr">WoW Classic's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-wow-most-iconic-legendary-weapons-is-getting-an-overhaul-in-season-of-discovery/1100-6524252/" data-ref-id="1100-6524252">Season of Discovery servers recently entered its endgame phase</a>, featuring revamps of existing raids as well as new items, abilities, and even a new dungeon. Meanwhile, Blizzard is gearing up for the release of the 10th expansion for the modern version of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-the-war-within-release-date-announced-during-xbox-showcase/1100-6524083/" data-ref-id="1100-6524083">WoW, The War Within, on August 26</a>.</p>

It’s not a <em>Call of Duty</em>, a <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>, or even a big RPG or sci-fi action game. Nope. It’s <em>EA Sports’ NCAA Football 2005.</em> It’s been a <em>long time</em> since that has happened<em>, </em>but the recent college football game from EA—the first in over a decade—is exploding and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ea-college-football-25-ncaa-14-biggest-game-playercount-1851595253&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ea-college-football-25-ncaa-14-biggest-game-playercount-1851595253">might end up at the top of July 2024's best-selling games list</a></span>. </p><p>Meanwhile, <em>Shrek 2</em>—a licensed action-adventure game based on the animated movie—is in the top ten, beating out titles like <em>Red Dead Revolver, Need for Speed: Underground, </em>and <em>Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow</em>. I can’t remember the last time a movie tie-in game cracked the top charts. And hey, look at that! <em>Mega-Man, Driver, </em>and <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> are in the top 20, t00. It was truly a different era back then, huh? </p><p>And comparing this old list to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/MatPiscatella/status/1810378175215710648/photo/1&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/MatPiscatella/status/1810378175215710648/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 2024's best-selling games</a></span>, it’s clear that while a lot has changed, some things stay the same.
