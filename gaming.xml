His fight for freedom against a literally iron-fisted despot represented a braver, weirder time for Ubisoft, and today Francisco looks back on a classic...</em></p>
<hr>
<p>For many of us, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">Super Mario 64</a> changed platforming forever by introducing the boundless possibilities of the third dimension. I wasn’t one of them. As a latecomer, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/rayman_2_the_great_escape">Rayman 2: The Great Escape</a> was my Mario 64, the game which opened my eyes to all the strangeness, spectacle, and drama the revamped 3D genre could offer.</p>
<p>It happened by pure chance. I couldn’t afford Mario 64 after becoming the proud owner of my baby blue Pikachu Nintendo 64 in 2000. However, my local game store had Rayman 2 on a special deal, sat on the shelf unloved since coming out in 1999. And the oppressive world, sinister tone, and unique brand of heroics I discovered have been seared into my memory ever since the first time I wandered into the fantasy dystopia of the Glade of Dreams.</p>
<p>The Glade is a fairytale land, whose whimsy gave way to perpetual gloom under the literally iron-fisted rule of Admiral Razorbeard and his clanking robo-pirate minions. Their slave count grows by the second. The Teensie Kings, their citizens, and the fairy-like Lums are all helplessly locked up. Rayman himself starts the game imprisoned in the brig, hopeless and alone. When his powers are smuggled in (thanks, Globox!) to finally allow a dramatic prison break, he becomes a freedom fighter unlike any platforming hero before him.</p>
<p>If Paul Thomas Anderson’s flick <strong>One Battle After Another</strong> was an N64 platformer where Leo could actually pull off a long jump, its cover art would likely be a lot like Rayman 2: a member of the resistance speeding away from a well-placed detonation.</p>
<figure data-uuid="9b4974fbec06b"><a title="Rayman 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9b4974fbec06b/rayman-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Ubisoft</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I’ll be the first to admit there are N64 platformers with more expansive level design, but Rayman had other goals. Rayman 2’s linear levels make the most of his polished moveset of “hairlicopter” gliding and lobbing energy projectiles, while giving his eight-hour adventure a breakneck sense of dramatic momentum.</p>
<p>He may look ‘armless, but he has the unruly toolkit to beat the most committed anarchist, even Donkey Kong! Rayman is shattering cages to free vulnerable Teensies and Lums. He’s raiding the robo-pirates' very own gunpowder kegs to blow up every barred door in his way. He’s taming walking rockets bronco-style for high-stakes pursuit, even commandeering their own ships to blast his way to Admiral Razorbeard.</p>
<p>A one-man counterattack from France’s favourite platforming hero draws a painfully obvious comparison to the spirit of the French Resistance; no coincidence when the game shares its name with the famous Steve McQueen film about Allied POWs in World War II. From the moody opening cinematic — which rivals the dramatic stakesetting of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/metal_gear_solid">Metal Gear Solid</a> if you ask me — the game’s sky-high stakes represent Rayman’s darkest hour.</p>

<p>It’s a world away from the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gbc/rayman">Rayman</a>, which was an accomplished but straightforward jaunt through platforms creatively constructed from sticky nougat before battling giant saxophones. Rayman 2 went so much darker. The series, always inspired by <strong>The Dark Crystal</strong>, came closest to Jim Henson and Frank Oz’s creepy cult classic with Rayman 2’s palette of ominous green shades and environments layered with deep shadows.</p>
<p>When you come to the unnerving Cave of Bad Dreams, you find a Tim Burton-esque nightmare. You’re running down giant skeletal spinal columns, leaping from skull to skull as they sink into forboding depths, then climbing up rows of ribcages like you’re bouldering in the Parisian catacombs. With other levels introducing putrid waterlogged bayous and frightening pirate-infested cave docks, the vibe’s often closer to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/shadow_man">Shadow Man</a> than <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/banjo-kazooie">Banjo-Kazooie</a>’s pantomime nasties – despite <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/opinion-banjo-tooie-is-pure-nightmare-fuel-and-i-wouldnt-have-it-any-other-way">Banjo Tooie’s imaginatively creepy efforts</a>.</p>
<p>With its dystopian setting and firm sense of justice, the similarities between Rayman 2 and director Michel Ancel’s next game, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/beyond_good_and_evil_20th_anniversary_edition">Beyond Good &amp; Evil</a>, are impossible to ignore. Just swap out Rayman’s kidnapped Teensie Kings for Jade’s alien-abducted orphans, or Razorbeard’s Buccaneer flying ship for the Dom-Z’s space base. It’s a tragedy that this promisingly ambitious trajectory ended in 2003, as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/soapbox-rayman-legends-blew-my-mind-then-broke-my-heart">much as I love Rayman Legends’ giddy thrills</a>.</p>

<p>Today, both games represent a braver, weirder time for Ubisoft in the mid-2000s. A time before money-printing machines like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin’s Creed</a> and <strong>Far Cry</strong> kicked into gear, and the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_plus_rabbids_kingdom_battle">Rabbids</a> condemned Rayman to a supporting role in his own series. This was when the Ubisoft I loved the most were at the peak of their powers, exploring the outer reaches of the 3D platforming genre.</p>
<p>Decades later, Rayman remains on his interminable hiatus, and the question of which version of Rayman 2 is best remains stubbornly unsolved. The PlayStation and PlayStation 2 versions spoil the game’s rich atmosphere with cloyingly over-enthusiastic English voice acting. Many claim the Dreamcast version is definitive, but no additions could convince me to pick up that Tamagotchi contraption it calls a controller.</p>
<p>For me, and I’ll admit this is a game where my nostalgia-tinged glasses are practically superglued on, the Nintendo 64 version is the best way to play Rayman 2. Its soundtrack is unique to the system; without the CD storage space other formats could use, it relies on catchy and effective MIDI melodies. Its pared-back approach is best seen in its opening cutscene (below), which adds none of the distractions of its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ln9xfh1dmyA">other versions</a>. And the N64’s anti-aliasing haze suited its shadowy vibe magnificently.</p>

<p>Now it’s on Switch Online, Rayman 2’s own Great Escape from its undeserved obscurity gives the N64 version an unbeatable claim to be the best of all: you can play it right now. And you absolutely should.</p>
<p>I’ll never forget Rayman 2. And that’s not just because I replayed its opening stage more times than I could ever count, having missed the fact that the N64 cart needed a memory card to save my game. It’s proven so memorable thanks to its rebellious heroism, oddball creativity, and unusual place in Ubisoft history. It taught me to fight for freedom or die trying. Even if the outcome was usually an explosive end after taking a wrong turn on my untamed rocket steed.</p>

		<p>Splitgate 2 is dead. Long live Splitgate: Arena Reloaded. This is the new iteration of Splitgate, the arena-based shooter with its trademark portals, and it’s launching today in full, leaving beta behind, arriving for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One in one fell swoop.</p>
<p><iframe title="SPLITGATE: Arena Reloaded Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NKUPFtZ4S00?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>SPLITGATE: Arena Reloaded combines the best of the rewarding DNA of the original Splitgate with the innovations of Splitgate 2, delivering the ultimate Splitgate experience. The new era of Splitgate celebrates its roots, eliminating factions and abilities while re-emphasizing the kinetic arena gameplay of classic modes like Team Deathmatch, Domination and King of the Hill.

<li>Added the highly requested Mode Select feature so players can fine-tune their preferred modes across Quickplay and select playlists, plus the ability to queue for multiple modes at once.</li>
<li>Added Free For All (FFA) Deathmatch, Shotty Snipers, Team SWAT, Gun Game and Team Fiesta to Quickplay mode selection.</li>

</ul>
<h3>Streamlined Battle Pass w/ New Ultra Tier</h3>

<li>Added Ultra Pass upgrade option.</li>
<li>Read here for more on all Battle Pass changes, including the Pass Epilogue: https://www.splitgate.com/news/splitgate-arena-reloaded-battle-pass-update</li>
</ul>
<h3>Four New Weapons</h3>

<li>New Primary Weapons – Light Machine Guns (LMGs): Velocity (large-mag), Strata (four-round burst fire) and Barrage (triple barrel chaingun that shoots three at a time).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Refreshed Audio</h3>
<ul>
<li>New in-game music, new music for climactic phase of select modes.</li>

<li>New refer-a-friend feature.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Ability to swap custom materials.</li>
<li>New skybox and lighting options.</li>
<li>New color-picker tool, refreshed gamepad</li>
</ul>
<p>Originally release in June, Splitgate 2 immediately split the Splitgate fanbase, with a host of microtransactions, some of which were eye-wateringly expensive, while adding a new Battle Royale mode despite the team having previously criticising Call of Duty et al.</p>

<p>The story of Splitgate 2 is one of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. The first game was an unexpected indie shooter hit, entering the exceedingly competitive multiplayer shooter arena and staking its claim to a place on the battlefield. It’s heavily Halo-inspired gunplay found a legion of fans, and so it was expected that Splitgate 2 should have been a continuation of that success. The beta period was tough though, with a mixture of unpopular changes to the game’s formula and an odd public appearance from Ian Proulx in a “Make FPS Great Again” cap, that didn’t sit well with a portion of the community.</p>
<p>It looks as though the team have done a lot of work to counter all these issues though, and we hope that they find the success they deserve with the relaunch of the game.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/techland-dying-light-the-beast-update-1-5-nightmare-experience/</link>
            <guid>1386232</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Techland has released a new update for Dying Light: The Beast with Update 1.5, which adds a new difficulty layer called the Nightmare Experience, new survival mechanics, and a new Alpha Volatile. This update quickly follows after <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-update-1-4-adds-ray-tracing-on-pc-new-game-legend-levels-and-many-improvements/">Update 1.4, which Techland said was the game's "<em>biggest update yet</em>,"</a> and rounds out <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-roadmap-ray-tracing-pc-new-game-plus/">the most recent roadmap</a> Techland released for the game.</p>



<p>Update 1.4 added elements like new game plus, support for ray tracing on PC, and over 400 improvements across graphical updates and bug fixes. Update 1.5 lets players experience all of that with even more new gameplay conditions, as elements like the new survival mechanics now mean players have to be worried about their food consumption and how hungry they get. The longer you go without food, the longer your stamina and health take to regenerate. Your flashlight will also drain over time, and as the battery gets low, the light will dim and flicker, so you'll have to find replacement batteries either out in the town or by crafting them. </p>



<p>The new Alpha Volatiles are now the most powerful infected in Castor Woods, not just for their strength but for their intelligence. They'll ignore the UV light, and unlike other Volatiles that may lose your scent if you run and hide fast enough, they'll be able to keep hunting you all across the map until you reach a safe zone.</p>



<p>The Nightmare Experience difficulty is the highest challenge available in Dying Light: The Beast, which, you won't be surprised to learn, Techland only recommends for the most seasoned Dying Light players.</p>



<p>"<em>It makes Human and Infected enemies stronger, smarter, more aggressive, reacting faster to players' actions using their heightened senses</em>," <a href="https://dyinglightgame.com/news/update-15">a blog post from the official website reads</a> on the new update. It goes on to say that when playing on the Nightmare Experience difficulty, some Dark Zones in the game will now feature Volatiles during the day. Also, on top of everything else, as you might expect, resources will be far more scarce on Nightmare compared to other difficulties, so keeping yourself alive is all the more challenging.</p>



<p>When Dying Light: The Beast launched earlier this year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dying-light-the-beast/">I reviewed it for Wccftech</a>, writing, "<em>Dying Light: The Beast's parkour mechanics and crunchy melee combat are the two load-bearing pillars that make it a game worth leaping into, with support from a beautiful world to explore (minus the infected) and a tense day and night cycle that greatly raises the stakes on its survival elements. Beyond that, the mechanical and narrative pacing, inconsistent writing and narrative tone, and world design choices that feel antithetical to the series in the first place all bring it to a fairly uninteresting experience that is only worth it for however long you want to turn your brain off and enjoy watching digital infected brains go </em><em>splat.</em>"</p>

            <title><![CDATA[After a Successful Year, Marvel Rivals Has Big Plans, Teases MCU-Related Content]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/one-year-into-marvel-rivals-team-ups-tasteful-design-and-community-driven-1</link>
            <guid>1386229</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's been a little over a year since NetEase released its hero shooter <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/marvel-rivals" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Marvel Rivals</em></a>. Since then, the game has taken on a life of its own and become one of the most popular games of 2025. During <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-game-awards-2025-recap" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">The Game Awards 2025</a>, TechRaptor sat down with the publishing and marketing lead of NetEase Games, Yachen Bian, and the executive producer of Marvel Games, Danny Koo, to talk about the game's journey and what they plan for the future--including a tease of potential content timed with <em>Avengers: Doomsday</em>.</p><p>One of the things that <em>Marvel Rivals</em> has been doing well is releasing content at a steady rate. Each season usually lasts about two months, and once a month, the team <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-season-5-gambit-rogue" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">releases a new character based on the season's theme</a>. As one might expect, the team already has an internal roadmap and plans out who they want in the game a year in advance. But it's also so much more than that. Koo explained that it also has to make sense narratively for them to join the game, too.&nbsp;</p><p>Team-ups are such a core part of the game. In short, they give players special abilities when two or specific characters are both on the field at the same time. Not only are these team-ups fun to watch, but they can also make or break games depending on how you use them. Koo explained the reason for adding this was because it only seemed natural to have them, and when you look at any comic, you can see all sorts of team-ups, such as Deadpool &amp; Wolverine, or any of the Avengers and X-Men.&nbsp;</p><p>Even though certain team-ups like Venom x Spider-Man seem like a slam dunk, they won't be in the game forever. This is because the team wanted to "encourage fresh new mechanics every season." The fear is that if they keep one team-up in the game for too long, it'll become "stale," so they want to "inject new excitement every season." Although Koo didn't go into much detail, he explained that the team plans to "expand this system" in 2026.&nbsp;</p><p>One thing worth mentioning is that earlier this year, <em>Marvel Rivals</em> announced that they would eventually be working on new original characters not from the comics, to join the game. Shortly after that, the <span>team&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1mtvffc/netease_given_green_light_by_marvel_to_create/" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><span>received</span> pushback</a> from the community on this. When asked if the team has an idea of when they would be implementing new original characters, Koo reassured me that this would be a last resort item they use when they run out of established Marvel Comic characters.</p><p>"At Marvel games, I've worked on several original characters, and that's [only] when we need to do it. With so many characters in the Marvel Universe, we want to make sure each hero feels distinct from each other," Koo explained. "That's why you don't see five similar Spider-Men swinging around. We're going to continue to make sure that the existing batch of heroes [joining the game] will be serving the community. Who knows, in the future, when there is a particular need that existing thousands of other heroes can't serve, then we'll think of something original. But at this point, we are not ready for that."&nbsp;</p><p>It's no secret that the team at Marvel Rivals is known for drawing their characters in very specific ways that complement their bodies. You don't have to look too hard to find examples of this (I'm looking at you, Daredevil and Emma Frost). During our talk, I brought up the famous <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoBestFriendsPlay/comments/1m8hhx8/the_cast_of_fantastic_four_first_steps_react_to/" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Pedro Pascal video where he first saw the Invisible Woman Malice skin. </a>It's clear that the team adopted their own art style that appeals to both the male and female gaze. Koo explained that the idea was to always be tasteful yet realistic.</p><p>"Being a superhero [is very physical], they have a certain body archetype. So, of course, players will gravitate and be shocked by it. But if you look at the history of comics, it's always [shown off various body types]. You always see those physics, and the costumes highlight the physics," Koo explained. "Also, we're not afraid to show that off while not going too far, because this is still a T-rated game. We're not going into uncharted territory; we don't want [our game] to be adult stuff."&nbsp;</p><p>Koo also made it a point to address that some of the skins they have are a lot tamer than their original counterparts. He used Malice as an example and explained how the original costume was more revealing than the one people see in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, so the team wanted to "modernize it." The new Malice look was so popular that Marvel Comics decided to bring it back in a new series that is launching this month.&nbsp;</p><p>As the team looks ahead to 2026, Koo explained that "2025 was a great year, but we have bigger plans for 2026." This includes a steady stream of heroes to join the roster as well as a new PVE (Players Versus Environment) mode.&nbsp;</p><p>"[Our] PVE mode, Marvel Zombies, jived well with players, so we're gonna expand upon that. We're also going to expand upon the hero power fantasy and the team-ups," Koo says. "So you're gonna see more efforts towards that area to fulfill a player's fantasy of playing superheroes in the <em>Marvel Rivals</em> universe. And, of course, next year, we have on the Marvel [Studio] side, two big movies coming out. We're also going to collab on that front in a huge way."&nbsp;</p><p>One thing the <em>Marvel Rivals</em> team has been very vocal about is how successful the PVE Marvel Zombies mode has been. During our interview, Koo alluded that this might be a mode players will see again this time next year, and we aim to look at it more deeply to further expand the gameplay. But the team is also looking to experiment with other non-traditional PVE modes, like what we saw with the Ultron chess mode.&nbsp;</p><p>The team declined to confirm whether an upcoming PVE mode would tie into the upcoming MCU film <em>Avengers: Doomsday</em>, but they assured me they have a release date in mind for the next mode. That said, they did also tease that when <em>Avengers: Doomsday</em> comes out next year, certain story beats would be concluded in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>It's no secret that <em>Marvel Rivals</em> took a lot of inspiration from other games in the space, like <em>Overwatch 2</em>. It wouldn't be far-fetched to compare the two games because they look and play so similarly. Koo went on to say that the team is a massive fan of shooters in general and tends to gravitate toward games like <em>Overwatch</em> and <em>Counter-Strike</em>. Before <em>Marvel Rivals</em> was even greenlit, they often toyed with the idea of making a hero shooter.&nbsp;</p><p>"[NetEase] looked at all the available games out in the market and saw that there was really no superhero shooter. [So we thought] we're going to do it our own way, the Marvel way."&nbsp;</p><p>A large part of why the team has had great success is how it communicates with its fanbase. Whenever changes happen that the majority of players disagree with, they're quick to fix them, and on top of that, the team is super on the nose with the memes and jokes surrounding the game, even leaning into them. Koo attributed a large part of that to the game's Discord server, which is the largest in the world with almost 4.2 million members.&nbsp;</p><p>"We have an army of content creators and moderators who compile feedback and suggestions. It also helps that I'm on social media and I get pinged left and right with people saying, 'Hey, this is interesting.' Or complaints about game features and bugs. So we see all of that stuff, including the dev team," Koo said. "It's not like we're putting up a wall. We literally tore the wall down and said, 'Hey, say whatever you want. We're listening, and we're doing our best to find out what the issue or interest is.'"&nbsp;</p><p>This was something that Bian went on to echo, by explaining that the team doesn't necessarily have a department that surfs the web to see what people are saying. So whenever you see someone like Creative Director Guangyun Chen say something as silly as "Aura Walk" in a community update video, it's them being genuine about it. Koo admitted that sometimes they'll see something the community is asking about online and text Chen to see if it's something they can implement in the game.&nbsp;</p><p>It's clear that the <em>Marvel Rivals</em> team has many ideas in store for 2026. After our long conversation, I'm confident that the team can deliver on another successful year as they enter year two. If you haven't tried it yet, <em>Marvel Rivals</em> is a free-to-play game available on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, PC, and Xbox Series X|S.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <p>The ongoing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/predicting-steam-machine-prices-would-be-a-lot-easier-if-ram-costs-hadnt-gone-horribly-wrong">RAM shortage</a> (and subsequent and pricing explosion) is imposing a wider range of grim effects than even the Great GPU Famine of 2020. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/one-of-pc-gamings-key-ram-manufacturers-arent-selling-to-regular-humans-anymore-so-they-can-peddle-more-kit-to-ai-companies">First came the death</a> of one of gaming hardware’s most reliable memory and SSD makers, and now... uh... <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/divinity-larian">Larian’s new Divinity game</a> is going to be more optimised for PC than it otherwise would have been?</p>
<p>That’s what Larian CEO Swen Vincke (clearly on a media tour – <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-talk-divinity-their-next-rpg-after-baldurs-gate-3-its-almost-as-though-its-the-first-in-the-series">here’s him discussing Divinity with our Edwin</a>) told <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/larian-divinity-development-changed-ram-prices/">TheGamer</a>, anyway. Vincke notes that because the lack of affordable RAM options is making it harder to predict the horsepower of future PCs, "we already need to do a lot of optimization work in early access that we didn't necessarily want to do at that point in time." That doesn’t sound especially horrible to me – higher performance on lower-end rigs ultimately means more players can join in – though nowhere in the <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/larian-studios-swen-vincke-interview-divinity/">full interview</a> does Vincke acknowledge that the shortage is being directly caused and sustained by demand from data centres that power generative AI, a technology that Larian are using in Divinity’s production, and that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-boss-responds-to-criticism-of-generative-ai-use-its-something-we-are-constantly-discussing-internally?event_category=Login+success&amp;event_action=Email">Vincke himself is defending the use of</a>.</p>

<p>This doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll be chugging potions out of six-fingered hands, or leading your party into the homely village of Ecwwhehw. Larian’s boss man is adamant that "We are neither releasing a game with any AI components, nor are we looking at trimming down teams to replace them with AI," with the company supposedly limiting their genAI application to things like placeholder text and references for concept artists.</p>
<p>Without wanting to prosecute yet another argument about it – not this late in the afternoon, at least – I still don’t think that approach addresses the problems with environmental damage, unauthorised scraping, or even really labour replacement that genAI continues to swirl around in. It’s also a fact that <em>any</em> usage of tools like ChatGPT, Midjourney, or Adobe Firefly, however limited, adds demand to those data centres that are hogging all our RAM sticks.</p><p>This effects of this artificial memory shortage, again, extend far beyond how well Divinity will run on 16GB of DDR4. Soaring prices are <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ram/dont-wait-if-youre-planning-to-upgrade-your-ram-or-ssd-kingston-rep-warns-says-prices-will-continue-to-go-up-nand-costs-up-246-percent">expected to last well into 2026</a>, with production costs for laptops, pre-built PCs and possibly games consoles passed onto consumers, while Valve are rumoured to be reconsidering both their pricing and launch date plans for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-announce-a-new-steam-machine-steam-controller-and-the-steam-frame-vr-headset-and-ive-played-them">new Steam Machine</a>.

              <p><span>Defining a role-playing game in 2025 is more complicated than it’s ever been. Pretty much every game has RPG elements these days, so if you squint hard enough, you can make the case for a lot of games being RPGs, even if they don’t follow the same formulas and structures the genre historically has. Because the definition of what makes an RPG has gotten looser over the years, any list of the best ones in any given year is pretty much guaranteed to have a ton of variety, including everything from action-packed open-world sprawls to strategic retro throwbacks. Here are our picks for the best RPGs of 2025.</span></p> <h2><b><i>Assassin’s Creed: Shadows</i></b></h2>  <p><span>So many </span><i><span>Assassin’s Creed </span></i><span>games are set in open worlds that aren’t worth exploring. Everything is marked on your map, and outside of those locations there’s little to find. But more recent entries, like </span><i><span>Valhalla</span></i><span>, have bucked this trend and started featuring maps that were not just vast, but stuffed with details to spot, people to meet, and activities to discover.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Assassin’s Creed Shadows,</span></i><span> which successfully moves the series to feudal Japan, is the next step in this evolution. The world is so satisfying to explore, and as you do so, you find new ways to alter both playable characters and their builds. And yeah, the presence of two playable characters who both feature their own quests and dialogue options as well as combat styles and skill trees means you basically get two different, but similar RPGs for the price of one. That’s an impressive accomplishment, and it means </span><i><span>Shadows</span></i><span> isn’t just one of the best RPGs of 2025, but one of its biggest, too. -Zack Zwiezen</span></p>

 <h2><b><i>Avowed</i></b></h2>  <p><span>My favorite RPGs are the ones in which I can pick a direction and just start hiking, running into interesting encounters and monsters to fight as I go. </span><i><span>Avowed</span></i><span>, while not as big as some other open-world RPGs, let me do just that.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>But even better, I got to do so in a unique fantasy setting filled with characters I’ll remember for years. It’s also an RPG that is so confident in its characters and writing that it essentially forces you to camp between quests and exploration. Standing around the campfire and chatting with my small crew of misfits could have been annoying in another RPG. But in </span><i><span>Avowed</span></i><span>, these are some of the best moments in the game. Any RPG that makes chatting as fun as combat and questing is a winner in my book. – Zack Zwiezen</span></p>

 <h2><b><i>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</i></b></h2>  <p><span>Much has been said about </span><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 </span></i><span>as some kind of “savior” of the turn-based RPG genre, as if those games stopped coming out after </span><i><span>Final Fantasy VII</span></i><span>. I don’t want the nauseating way in which RPG detractors have wielded it to take away from just how good Sandfall Interactive’s debut game is. </span><i><span>Clair Obscur</span></i><span>’s grief-driven tale of a group of expeditioners on a suicide mission, desperately hoping to end an annual culling of their friends and family (called a Gommage), is one of constant misdirection and pain, whether that be in its narrative twists or in the showy way its enemies swing at you to throw off your well-timed parry or dodge. It circumvents the bloat that weighs down the RPG genre in favor of something tight, focused, and reasonably paced, and it packs it with a dense, rewarding turn-based battle system. After the amount of acclaim it has received this year, hopefully other RPG devs learn from its relative restraint and calculated excess. — Kenneth Shepard</span></p>

 <h2><b><i>Deltarune</i></b></h2>  <p><span>Toby Fox’s episodic follow-up to </span><i><span>Undertale </span></i><span>is still ongoing, but four episodes in, </span><i><span>Deltarune </span></i><span>has already provided humor, atmosphere, character, and a banger soundtrack that stands tall next to its predecessor. With the closing chapters still at least a year away, we still have quite some time before we see the end of Kris’ journey, but what we’ve seen thus far has the potential to be just as impactful as </span><i><span>Undertale </span></i><span>was in 2015. — Kenneth Shepard</span></p>

 <h2><b><i>Demonschool&nbsp;</i></b></h2>  <p><span>What if you took the first </span><i><span>Persona </span></i><span>game and made it like </span><i><span>Into the Breach</span></i><span>? You’d have </span><i><span>Demonschool</span></i><span>, a clever, charming RPG that takes turn-based battles and makes each round of combat into a mini-tactical puzzle. The pixel art is great. So is the soundtrack. The characters are endearing but interactions are brisk, keeping the calendar time-management sim aspect of the formula feeling breezy rather than tedious. The writing’s not for everyone but it worked for me. Think of the snappiest people in your group chat playing off their archetypes and trading zingers at breakneck speed. It can feel at times like a case of style over substance. For a game with this much retro swag, I say, “who cares?” — Ethan Gach</span></p> <h2><b><i>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</i></b></h2>  <p><span>The </span><i><span>Digimon </span></i><span>series may have fallen into relative obscurity compared to other ‘90s monster-taming phenomena, but the series has absolutely not been resting on the laurels of its early popularity. </span><i><span>Digimon </span></i><span>games are experimental, darker than you remember the series being, and offer a degree of creativity and freedom in party building you won’t find elsewhere. </span><i><span>Time Stranger </span></i><span>pulls off all of the above with more polish and budget than most of the </span><i><span>Digimon </span></i><span>games have gotten before, and though its turn-based battles are a bit simple, its incredibly modular monster-training mechanics make it a lot more compelling than it appears on the surface. — Kenneth Shepard</span></p> <h2><b><i>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles&nbsp;</i></b></h2>  <p><span>There might never be another strategy RPG this good, in these exact ways, ever again. Mentioning any quibbles I have—cutting bonus content, a new localization that makes Ramza too whiny sometimes—feels like complaining about micro-mistakes in the plating of a Michelin Star three-course banquet. Perfectly paced, beautifully crafted, and heart-stoppingly authentic, </span><i><span>Final Fantasy Tactics</span></i><span> is like a long-lost Shakespeare play turned into the best </span><i><span>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</span></i><span> session you’ve ever had. — Ethan Gach</span></p>

 <h2><b><i>Fretless – The Wrath of Riffson</i></b></h2>  <p><i><span>Fretless</span></i><span>’ marriage of turn-based battles and rhythm mechanics brings clarity to the timing-based attacks of something like </span><i><span>Paper Mario </span></i><span>or </span><i><span>Clair Obscur</span></i><span> by tying every strike, swipe, and sidestep to the beat of its excellent soundtrack. Ritual Studios weaves sheet music into the RPG’s design, from its rhythm-based battles to its musical world, in which brushing up against a plant or stepping on the right stone can add a lovely melody to a world that’s already brimming with song. It is the kind of game that anyone with rhythm can enjoy, but it’s especially delightful if you have a background in music and can hear how sound is integrated into everything you do. — Kenneth Shepard</span></p> <h2><b><i>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</i></b></h2>  <p><span>It’s hard to believe that an old and clunky open-world RPG like Bethesda’s 2006 </span><i><span>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion </span></i><span>could blow up in popularity in 2025. But that’s what happened thanks to the remaster, which mainly improves the game’s looks and adds a few quality-of-life changes. That’s it, though. At its core this is still the original </span><i><span>Oblivion</span></i><span>. And yet, there is something special about it. Walking around the forest in </span><i><span>Oblivion</span></i><span> and stumbling upon some odd ruins that lead to a dark dungeon is still as much fun in 2025 as it was back on the Xbox 360. – Zack Zwiezen</span></p>

 <h2><b><i>Octopath Traveler 0</i></b></h2>  <p><i><span>Octopath Traveler 0 </span></i><span>is proof that Square Enix had no reason to make </span><i><span>Octopath Traveler: Champions of the Continent</span></i><span> a gacha game when it could have easily made it an exceptional RPG without all the gacha elements dragging it down. </span><i><span>Octopath Traveler 0 </span></i><span>is a game saved from obscurity, as Square Enix has stripped </span><i><span>Champions of the Continent </span></i><span>of its live-service trappings and revived it as the proper turn-based RPG fans wanted in the first place. It is a beefy monster of a game that will take up nearly a hundred hours of your time, but that’s the consequence of adapting what was once meant to be a forever game into something that feels complete. </span><i><span>Octopath Traveler 0 </span></i><span>feels like a prodigal son returning after being shut down due to Square Enix’s short-sighted hubris. And it sure is nice to have all the best parts of the game preserved when they were once thought lost. — Kenneth Shepard</span></p> <h2><b><i>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</i></b></h2>  <p><span>The </span><i><span>Legends </span></i><span>subseries has become </span><i><span>Pokémon’s</span></i><span> place to experiment, and </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> takes some of the boldest swings Game Freak’s ever taken. Its real-time battle system includes one of the most interesting spins the studio has ever put on the franchise’s decades-old combat formula, the single-city setting lets the devs stick with one of the most memorable casts in series history, and the plethora of new Mega Evolutions gives a lot of old favorites new life. </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>is almost nothing like </span><i><span>Legends: Arceus,</span></i><span> beyond both games having you manually throw Poké Balls at wild creatures and dodge roll when a powerful attack comes your way. And that’s pretty exciting, because it means that maybe the next </span><i><span>Legends </span></i><span>game can surprise us in a whole new way. After </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, I’m willing to just let Game Freak cook. I have no wish list. — Kenneth Shepard</span></p> <h2><b><i>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</i></b></h2>  <p><span>Too Kyo Games’ magnum opus is the kind of game that is so ambitious and unwieldy it’s hard to recommend without caveats, but it’s also one of the best RPGs this year you probably haven’t heard of. The game is one part visual novel, another part tactical RPG, and another part absolute mindfuck of a branching narrative, with 100 different endings across over 20 routes, and your path through the story entirely defined by your narrative choices. Its puzzle-like tactical battles are more brain teaser than sweaty warzone, but their challenging, </span><i><span>Evangelion</span></i><span> Angel-style boss fights keep things interesting and unpredictable. </span><i><span>The Hundred Line </span></i><span>might not have gotten the awards buzz it deserved, but make no mistake, few games from 2025 even come close to matching its ambition. — Kenneth Shepard</span></p>

 <h2><b><i>The Outer Worlds 2</i></b></h2>  <p><span>It’s clear that we aren’t getting a new </span><i><span>Fallout </span></i><span>game from Bethesda anytime soon. But I can wait, because Obsidian’s </span><i><span>Outer Worlds 2 </span></i><span>is a worthy spiritual successor that even exceeds the franchise that inspired it in some key ways. Every part of </span><i><span>Outer Worlds 2</span></i><span> is bigger than the original, and it’s clear that the people at Obsidian (who also developed </span><i><span>Avowed </span></i><span>this year!) are experts at crafting RPGs that offer players plenty of freedom while still telling a tale that doesn’t feel like a series of random moments, lightly connected. Take note, </span><i><span>Starfield</span></i><span>. This is how you combine space, sci-fi, and the Bethesda RPG formula correctly. The end result: One of the year’s best RPGs. — Zack Zwiezen</span></p> <h2><b><i>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter&nbsp;</i></b></h2>  <p><i><span>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</span></i><span> is the type of remake fans dream about: a complete overhaul that nevertheless stays as true to the spirit of the original as possible. The world is reimagined and the coming-of-age story of peacekeeping warriors Estelle and Joshua retold with new cinematics and voice acting that bring it to life the way you always imagined it. Advances in hybrid real-time combat and menu navigation are deftly folded into the structure of a game that came out back in 2004 in a way that adds both depth and convenience. Finally, the starting point for the long-running </span><i><span>Trails</span></i><span> series has a version you can play that doesn’t just feel like JRPG homework. — Ethan Gach</span></p>

The full game will now include an audio option to play with either “lingua-technis,” the binaric machine code language of the Adeptus Mechanicus that contributed heavily to the first game’s distinct atmosphere, or with the traditional human voiceover as heard in the demo. Movement systems are also being enhanced, with an optional setting to allow the Move action to auto-select when cycling between units, creating a smoother and more efficient tactical flow.</p><p>The team is equally committed to addressing performance concerns raised during the demo period. These optimizations, together with the continued refinement of new systems and campaign content, are central to delivering a sequel that meets the expectations set by both the community and the studio’s own ambitions.</p><p>Alongside the announcement, Kasedo Games have released the first in an ongoing video series which demonstrates customization systems and unique faction mechanics not present in the demo. Each instalment will highlight two deployable leaders, one each for the Adeptus Mechanicus and the Necrons, offering an in-depth look at their playstyles, abilities and strategic roles within the unfolding conflict.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Multiplayer Review - Strong Map Design Makes Multiplayer A Blast</p>
      </div>
<p>It would be just the second time since 2018 that a Call of Duty game would be outsold in the US. The last time it happened was 2023, when Hogwarts Legacy beat Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3. Before that, Red Dead Redemption II came out on top in 2018, with Black Ops 4 at No. 2.</p><p>2024's Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 was the year's best-selling game in the US, and it achieved that despite being the first Call of Duty game to launch into Game Pass. The game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-lost-300-million-in-sales-due-to-game-pass-report/1100-6535256/" data-ref-id="1100-6535256">reportedly lost out on $300 million in revenue due to Game Pass</a>. Circana's lists are ranked by revenue, not unit sales.</p><p>Through November 29, Black Ops 7 is the No. 7 best-selling game of 2025 in the US, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2025-best-selling-games/2900-6281/" data-ref-id="2900-6281">Battlefield 6 holding steady at No. 1</a>. In terms of unit sales, EA confirmed only that Battlefield 6 sold <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-sells-7-million-copies-for-biggest-opening-of-all-time-for-the-series/1100-6535488/" data-ref-id="1100-6535488">7 million copies out of the gate.</a> A subsequent report said the figure <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-reaches-10-million-copies-sold-but-wont-be-enough-to-topple-call-of-duty-analyst-says/1100-6535920/" data-ref-id="1100-6535920">rose to 10 million.</a></p><p>Activision, meanwhile, has not disclosed any specific sales numbers for Black Ops 7. And even these figures were disclosed, it wouldn't tell the whole story due to Game Pass. Another element at play is that Battlefield 6 is only available on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, while Black Ops 7 is on those platforms, along with two more: PS4 and Xbox One.</p><p>Prior to the launches of Battlefield 6 and Black Ops 7, analyst Rhys Elliott <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-looks-great-but-it-wont-beat-call-of-duty-this-year/1100-6534282/" data-ref-id="1100-6534282">said the new Call of Duty game would likely finish 2025 on top due in part to </a>"autopilot purchasing" trends, where people buy new Call of Duty games out of habit, even if they complain about a lack of new features or innovation.</p><p>Elliott is discussing global sales, while Circana's reports only cover North America. Circana will release its report for December 2025 and full-year 2025 North American game sales in January, and if Battlefield 6 comes out on top, that won't necessarily mean it beat Black Ops 7 globally.</p><p>Call of Duty provides more value to Microsoft and Xbox than full-game sales alone, as people may sign up for Game Pass to play the game, thus creating new revenue for Microsoft. With Game Pass recently going up $30/month, Microsoft would need someone to stay subscribed for less than 2.5 months to bring in the cost of Black Ops 7 at full price ($70), assuming people pay full price for the membership and the game.</p><p>In any event, Black Ops 7 is clearly not the sale success that Activision and Microsoft would have wanted based on full-game sales, something that's evident because the game is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-is-trying-really-hard-to-get-you-to-play-black-ops-7-right-now/1100-6537022/" data-ref-id="1100-6537022">already significantly marked down.</a> Additionally, Activision has said it will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-will-no-longer-do-back-to-back-black-ops-or-modern-warfare-games/1100-6536815/" data-ref-id="1100-6536815">no longer release Call of Duty games in the same sub-series, like Modern Warfare or Black Ops, in consecutive years.</a> While Black Ops 7's sales may have been lower this year, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-was-2025s-top-franchise-on-game-pass/1100-6536860/" data-ref-id="1100-6536860">Call of Duty franchise remains the biggest franchise for Xbox Game Pass.</a></p>

            <p>A new 2D competitive platformer has just been announced, and it's coming from the same team behind an indie darling from back in 2016. Almost a decade later, the creators of SpeedRunners are back with another speedy release: Sprint City.</p>
<p>Instead of being split across several different levels like SpeedRunners was, Sprint City takes place in one single shared world that seamlessly connects nearby players. While in a party, you and your gaggle of friends will stay connected as you explore and track down challenges to take on.</p>
<p>Not only that, but if one of your friends owns Sprint City, you can join their game via your internet browser of choice and jump in to play for free. The game itself will be available on Steam in 2026, though no exact release date nor price has been revealed yet.</p>

<p>Game designer and co-owner at Second Stage Studio Casper van Est has stated: "With Sprint City, we wanted to focus on what we love most in games and what we're best at, which is pure movement. It's a shared world multiplayer experience built around how good it can feel just to move around, so we worked really hard on a satisfying game feel and a visual style that never gets in the way of that."</p><p>The original SpeedRunners also took a consumer-friendly approach to onboarding,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/speedrunners-will-be-free-upon-its-final-release"> initially offering the game for free on Steam</a> and only charging a premium price for those who wanted to play the game online. It proved exceptionally popular on Steam Early Access a decade or so ago, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/speedrunners-has-sold-600k-copies-on-steam-early-access">selling 600k copies in short order</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/rumour-a-game-key-card-alternative-nintendo-may-have-smaller-switch-2-carts-in-the-works</link>
            <guid>1386169</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="8c0db7dfabaf5"><a title="Game-Key Card" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8c0db7dfabaf5/game-key-card.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Game-Key Cards have been perhaps the hottest topic of the Switch 2's lifecycle so far. Outside of particularly large releases, the running theory is that many studios are turning to a Game-Key physical release because Nintendo has failed to offer small/cheap options for those who don't want to cough up for the big 64GB cartridges. But that might be about to change.</p>
<p>A rumour making the rounds online today states that Nintendo will soon introduce 16 and 32GB cartridge options, so smaller devs hoping to launch a physical release won't have to turn to Key Cards as the only financially viable way of making it happen.</p>
<p>That is according to both the game preservation community <a href="https://x.com/DoesItPlay1">Does It Play</a> and <a href="https://x.com/SoWhatAboutGame">Physical Paradise</a> on Twitter, the latter of which claims to have been informed of the introduction by two separate sources.</p>


<p><a href="https://x.com/Nintendeal" tabindex="-1">@Nintendeal</a> also claimed to have heard the same information, though it pointed out that increasing material costs and chip shortages mean there's no guarantee that more cart size options will directly affect pricing.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/ubisoft-employee-explains-why-star-wars-outlaws-is-a-game-key-card">Ubisoft employee Rob Bantin explained</a> that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> had launched on Switch 2 as a GKC, not because of a cost issue, but because the S2 carts "simply didn’t give the performance we needed at the quality target we were going for". To be clear, different cart <em>sizes</em> would do nothing to mend this issue, but they would provide an alternative for smaller games that are less reliant on speedy asset streaming.</p>
<p>Of course, it is nothing more than a rumour for the time being, so make sure to take things with a hefty pinch of salt.</p>
<p>Something that isn't rumoured, however, is the physical launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/r-type-dimensions-iii">R-Type Dimensions III</a>, which ININ Games has today announced will be arriving as a Game-Key Card since "switching entirely to cartridges would significantly raise manufacturing costs and increase the retail price by at least 15€".</p>
<p>"To avoid this, we chose to release the game on a key card while continuing to explore alternative solutions for the Special and Collector’s Edition," the publisher wrote in an explanation post on <a href="https://x.com/ININ_Games/status/2001279550135644222">Twitter</a>. "There is still hope for a real cartridge, and we are trying everything."</p>

<p>It remains to be seen whether more cart sizes from Nintendo will actually impact the number of Game-Keys on the market, or whether studios will continue to stick firmly to the download option. We'll be keeping an eye out for more developments in this particular rumour, and will update you should we hear anything.</p>

            <p>As the second series of Amazon's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tv-shows/fallout">Fallout TV show</a> emerges from a hole in the ground with a cog-shaped door, Todd Howard has uttered the word Fallout and stuck a five after it. He's given a verbal thumbs up - or a reminder depending on how you look at it - to the idea of the events which play out in the TV show having an impact on the next mainline entry on the series, at least in terms of being a consideration in worldbuilding.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Asked by the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvgr488vlmmo">Beeb's Newsbeat</a> whether the show will have an impact on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-5">Fallout 5</a>, cleanliness is next to Toddliness replied: "In short, yes." "Fallout 5 will be existing in a world where the stories and events of the show happened or are happening," he expanded. "We are taking that into account."</p>
<p>Based on the phrasing, I'd assume all he's likely talking about here is the need for the likes of terminal entries or other in-game lore whisperings which refer to places in the post-apocalyptic US that the show has touched to mirror what the adaptation says took place. For example, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-season-2-still-sounds-like-it-wont-commit-to-a-new-vegas-ending-but-for-the-love-of-all-thats-housely-i-hope-it-will">everyone's brains getting very foggy</a> following the second battle of Hoover Dam. Or, well, all that bollocks around <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bethesdas-todd-howard-clarifies-the-fate-of-shady-sands-in-the-fallout-tv-show-timeline">the NCR capital going boom</a>, which I honestly just thought was a rather unnecessary can of worms for the show to have opened.</p>
<p>Is any of that, or possible cheeky references to the likes of Lucy and The Ghoul, stuff I'm particularly bothered about the next single-player Fallout containing whenever it finally arrives? Not really, no. Then again, I've been clear in my view that I reckon the show'd likely benefit from its creators not having to dedicate so much time to debates involving the word canon. Is it nice to have all your things' worlds nicely slot together in a way that can serve the wider narrative by layering together a shared history - and also result in them being neatly corporately synergised? Yeah, it is, but at the same time, that wider lore building should ideally serve the key stories being told in the here and now of a game or show first and foremost, not the other way around.</p><p>With both the showrunners and the Todd having already <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-season-3-will-be-filmed-next-summer-if-all-goes-plan-showrunners-as-its-showrunners-want-to-keep-their-big-iron-in-the-fire">kicked off chatter about a third series</a> prior to the latest one even going live, the Howard has also revealed - this time to <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/fallout-season-3-scripts-fallout-76-game-tie-in-1236610167/">Variety</a> - that the two sides are already hard at work deciding how they can do Fallout game stuff to coincide with that next series.</p>
<p>"For us on the game and TV show side, we’re writing season three now," Fairly Todd Parents said. "We’re having those conversations now of, what are we doing in season three for the TV show and what elements can we bring into our games at that time when it comes out that don’t feel forced or fake." So, more crossover like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a>'s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-76s-next-expansion-goes-all-in-on-fallout-tv-show-season-2-bringing-walton-goggins-and-new-vegas-feel-to-ohio">Gogginsy Burning Springs update</a> being lined up ahead of time, which to be fair is vastly superior to people having to shout en-masse 'Where be the new Fallouty bits now you've whetted my appetite?'</p>
<p>Fallout 5, as of writing, is still without a release date.

              <p><span>There were two things I wanted most out of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s</span></a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-review-dlc-raichu-2000653106"><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC</span></a><span>: </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-evolution-raichu-x-2000652246"><span>Mega Raichu</span></a><span> and the return of Latias to my party. The dragon/psychic monster has been a favorite of mine for over 20 years, and she’s been a mainstay of my team in every game she’s featured in. Latias is flying around the Hyperspace Lumiose City featured in </span><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i><span>, but I still haven’t caught her yet. Why? </span><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i><span>’s maddening grind makes catching her and several other Legendary monsters a game of chance, harkening back to some of the more frustrating capture mechanics of </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>’s past that the series</span> <span>has mostly gotten away from.</span></p> <p><span>Latias, along with several other Legendary Pokémon who aren’t tied to the main plot, is gated behind a mechanic called Special Scans. These allow you to find rare pockets of </span><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i><span>’s Hyperspace that include powerful trainers to battle, valuable loot, and, in some cases, Legendary monsters you won’t be able to find anywhere else. All of that is well and good, but the mere act of acquiring a Special Scan is already such a time sink that the randomization of what follows makes the whole process an almost insulting waste of your time.</span></p>

 <p><span>To get a Special Scan, you have to grind through </span><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i><span>’s various mini-quests in Hyperspace. These are typically simple objectives like beating trainers in the Battle Zones, capturing a certain number of Pokémon, or finding loot in the mirrored city. Each of these gives you intel points to contribute to the scan, and it’ll take multiple runs through Hyperspace to reach the appropriate number.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The problem is that the results of Special Scans are randomized. You </span><i><span>might</span></i><span> find a Legendary Pokémon, but you may also find a battle zone full of powerful trainers that can’t give you anything beyond more intel points to do another Scan, or you could stumble into an area of Hyperspace filled with Pokémon you’ve already caught. Sometimes, if you’re lucky, you’ll find a repeat of one of the Rogue Mega Evolution boss fights, which remain one of the best parts of </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, but if you’re trying to find the monsters you need to fill the Pokédex, even those feel like a barrier you can’t get around.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000654219" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000654219"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000654219">© The Pokemon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>There’s no way to game the system and manipulate these scans to lead you where you want to go, and even if they do take you to a Legendary Pokémon’s lair, there’s no guarantee that you’ll go back to Lumiose City with one in a Poké Ball. I’ve put more than 20 hours into </span><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i><span> and have only found two Legendary Pokémon through these methods, and neither of them was Latias. When I happened upon Virizion’s home after hours of grinding and acquiring one of these scans, I searched every square inch of the space for grass/fighting antelope, and couldn’t find it before the time limit ran out. These Special Scan portals close behind you after you leave, willingly or not, so I spent all that time grinding and battling through Special Scan areas with nothing of value in them to get to this point, all for nothing.</span></p>

 <p><span>Gating Legendary monsters behind chance is bad enough, but making it a lengthy grind to even roll the dice artificially inflates an already hefty expansion that relies on the grind to fill out the time between its better moments. If your sole value determination for a video game is how much time it takes up, </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>offers that with reckless abandon. If you want to feel like you’re accomplishing something rather than wasting your time, Special Scans are one of the most annoying things </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>has implemented in years.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>In some of the earlier generations, certain Legendary Pokémon were roaming encounters you had to essentially track and follow throughout a region, hoping that you’d stumble upon them in a random battle. This mechanic was notoriously derided, and the series has largely moved away from it, but Special Scans feel like that design philosophy magnified in a way that kills momentum so thoroughly that I’m not sure if I’ll ever actually complete the </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>Pokédex. I guess I can live with that, but I’m pretty fucking sad that my girl Latias is waiting for me in Hyperspace, and we might not get to reunite until another game.</span></p>

              <p>The chances are you’ll know developers Butterscotch Shenanigans from their&nbsp;<em>Crashlands</em> games—enormous open-world action games in which you fight, loot and craft your way to victory. However, if you’re an indie game developer, it’ll be their <em>Coffee with Butterscotch</em> podcast that’s most familiar, the long-running show dissecting everything indie for years. But today I draw your attention toward them for something far, far sillier:&nbsp;<em>How Many Dudes</em> is a forthcoming…I’m not sure there’s a genre title for this…game that asks, how many dudes does it take to kill 30 toddlers and a duck-sized horse? So yes, I spoke to them to see what on Earth is going on.</p> <p>Butterscotch Shenanigans was created by three brothers—Seth, Sam and Adam Coster—and was originally best known for fun, experimental and superbly animated mobile games, like <a href="https://www.bscotch.net/games/flop-rocket"><em>Flop Rocket</em></a>&nbsp;and <em><a href="https://www.bscotch.net/games/quadropus-rampage">Quadropus Rampage</a></em>. That is, until <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-last-game-i-make-before-i-die-fighting-cancer-by-m-1758326409">Sam Coster was diagnosed with stage 4b lymphoma</a>, and the three decided that was the moment to work on something bigger and more substantial. The result was <em>Crashlands</em>, and it proved successful enough, after creating platform game&nbsp;<em>and</em> engine&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/792710/Levelhead/"><em>Levelhead</em></a>, for the team to move on to <em>Crashlands 2</em>.</p>

 <p>With Sam in remission (and, I’m delighted to report, now officially cancer free!), that sequel was a four-and-a-half-year project, with another six months of updates and new content after launch, leaving the three siblings and their newer colleagues really ready to do something else. Something smaller. Something incredibly dumb. Thus <em>How Many Dudes</em>.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000654200" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000654200"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000654200">© Butterscotch Shenanigans / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>The game plays something like an auto-battler, in which you gather an ever-growing group of dudes who must fight teams of enemies of various bizarre natures. You begin the game with a single dude, tasked with fighting a group of 10 toddlers. Yup, right out of the gate. At this stage you’re essentially an observer, watching the battle play out before you, and you’ll either be relieved or horrified to learn you’ll definitely win. As a result you gain $100 to spend on items you can deploy during battles, and also get to select a new dude to add to your team. In that first choice you can pick between a Knight Dude or a Paladin Dude, and obviously each of the many, many dudes has their own stats and skills. From then on, it’s all about picking the right dudes, deploying the right skills at the correct moments, and trying to save enough money to buy revives for all who fall in battle.</p>

 <p>Having played an early build of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3934270/How_Many_Dudes/">the demo being released today</a>, I chatted with Seth Coster about why I’d just spent so long punching crowds of toddlers to death.</p> <p>“First of all, those toddlers are gonna be fine,” Coster assured me. “I have it on good authority that they’re happily munching on hay in a farm upstate.” So that’s a relief. But I still wondered how they got here. What process brings a creative team to an idea like this? “In the past, when starting a new game, we would start by asking what we wanted to play, and then we would try to bring that into the world. It has always worked for us in terms of quality—we’ve found that we can make whatever game we set ourselves on, and we can make it at a high level of polish and fun.”</p>

  <p>Despite this, and despite routinely high review scores, Butterscotch Shenanigans has found it tough to get much attention. “It has always been very difficult to get players, press and streamers to notice our games and talk about them,” says Seth. “And I don’t blame them; there are a trillion games out there!” As a result, the team decided to try a new approach this time. “What can people not stop talking about?” they asked themselves, eventually landing on the internet debate about “how many dudes it would take to beat up a gorilla.”</p>

 <p>“We didn’t even have an idea of what the game would be,” notes Seth, “we just wanted to make it about that. From there we iterated fast with no real roadmap or plan—we prototyped the game during the Game Maker’s Toolkit Jam, so there wasn’t really time to overthink it.”</p>

 <p>Five days later they’d created something that felt to them like a mix between <em>Balatro</em> and&nbsp;<em>TABS</em>, a “roguelike thing,” and people’s response to the jam entry was really positive. “We thought we might’ve just struck gold. Or at least copper.”</p> <p>As bizarre as it all sounds, from what I’ve played this appears to be true. While the first couple of rounds where you have little role might seem strange, it ramps up quickly as your decisions have more effect on the results. Which types of dudes you choose to recruit strongly changes your experience in any run, along with the upgrades and bonuses you pick, and with each battle lasting less than 30 seconds, it’s a quick and bloody process.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000654202" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000654202"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000654202">© Butterscotch Shenanigans / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>So how do you go about deciding the rules here? Who does the research to identify the correct amount of power and skill necessary to win in a fight with 30 duck-sized horses? “An anchor point in the game is the Regular Dude,” explains Seth Coster. He’s the one you start with, the average dude. “Everything in the game is orientated around him—how hard he can hit, and how many hits he can take. So when we’re designing a new enemy, we just ask, ‘Do we think this thing hits twice as hard as a Regular Dude? Five times as hard? TEN? And how many hits can it take compared to a Regular Dude?'”</p>

 <p>So yes, a horse “can probably take lot of punches.” (I hope my mum doesn’t read this article.) A horse-sized duck is the game’s first boss fight, for instance. “Weight classes exist for a reason, and horses are HUGE,” observes Seth. “Plus you gotta get past its flailing legs. Our sophisticated calculations have shown that a horse has 35 times the HP of a Regular Dude, which equates to about 70 seconds worth of regular punches.” Uh-huh. “Trust me, the math is sound.”</p> <p>I wondered, given the nature of that bar discussion topic of how many people it might take to fight a hundred worm-sized tigers and so on, whether the game might also pitch the enemies against one another to decide other natural questions. Who would win in a fight between a horse-sized duck and 100 toddlers? “The game isn’t about the answer,” says Seth very wisely, “it’s about the question. Because the answer to the question can only be, ‘It depends.’ The reason there’s ever a debate about ‘who could win in a fight’ is that the debate is actually about assumptions. How much prep time do the various parties have? If we’re talking about mythical creatures (like lion-sized ants), what kids of liberties are we taking with their capabilities?”</p>

 <p>He’s not done. “If we’re talking about Dudes versus a gorilla, what kinds of Dudes are we talking about? Olympic gymnasts? MMA fighters? Accountants? Marines? And do the Dudes have prep time, or are they just all thrown into the ring with the gorilla without warning?”</p> <p>I’m regretting the question.</p> <p>“The fun of the debate isn’t in having an answer, it’s about exploring all the possibilities. So that’s really what the game has ended up being about! We have LOTS of different types of Dudes in this game, each with their own unique capabilities and limitations. And then we throw them into the ring with a whole bunch of weird opponents to see what happens.”</p> <p>So <em>will</em> the game let the enemies fight, too? No, I’m not asking again. Moving on, I wondered what motivated this return to a smaller, sillier idea, after the success of the <em>Crashlands</em> games. Was it something Butterscotch had missed?</p>

  <p>“Certainly!” says Seth. “When you work on one thing for longer than it takes to get a college degree, you go a little crazy. But also, that one thing tends to take on an outsized importance. When you’re committing that many resources to something, you start to get in your own head about how everything has to be perfect. Especially if you’re trying to make a game that has a big story and lots of world-building.”</p> <p>But in this case? “<span><em>How Many Dudes </em>exists for one reason only: to be fun and stupid. It’s not trying to say anything important. It’s not trying to be anything other than what it is: a goofy game. So whenever we think of something that makes us chuckle, we just throw it in there. We don’t have to ask about the story implications, or whether it ‘fits’ with the world, or how it’s going to integrate into some larger vision for the game.”</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000654199" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000654199"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000654199">© Butterscotch Shenanigans</figcaption></figure> <p>Butterscotch Shenanigans has always been a very mobile-forward developer, but also one that charges a price for its games instead of littering them with ads and IAPs. Given just how dire things feel in mobile spaces for premium games, I wondered if this is still viable. “I’m not gonna lie…” says Coster. “It’s rough. Over the past nine years, our mobile revenue for new premium launches has declined by about 90 percent. I’m not sure whether others are experiencing the same thing, but that’s one data point for you. On the flipside, Google Play Pass and Apple Arcade do offer much clearer paths to success for a premium game—provided you can get into either of them.”</p> <p>This is why the company has shifted to cross-platform launches. “We plan to launch <em>How Many Dudes</em> on Steam, Google Play and the App Store,” says Seth, “and maybe Xbox if the Game Pass team reads this article and wants to give us a call…”</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000654203" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000654203"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000654203">© Butterscotch Shenanigans / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I highly recommend those&nbsp;<em>Crashlands</em> games, by the way. They feel perfect on a tablet, playable in short bursts, and come with hours and hours of stuff to do. And their daunting scale certainly does suggest a daunting amount of work. Do those games put pressure on the studio to have to match them, or even go bigger, spend more, raise ambitions ever-higher? “There are always expectations and demands,” says the Coster brother, “but that comes with the territory. Players will never stop asking for more sequels and more features and more updates, but that’s just them expressing that they love a thing and want more of it. In a weird way, those player demands don’t create pressure; they just create guidance on possible next steps.”</p> <p>The real pressure, says Coster, comes from within the team. Previous games have been about proving something to themselves, proving they’re capable of making long-lasting “hobby games” (<em>Levelhead</em>) or big and intricate games (<em>Crashlands 2</em>). “But in both cases, those were pressures we put on ourselves.&nbsp;<em>How Many Dudes</em>, on the other hand, feels pretty light by comparison. We’re not out to prove anything about our skills or capabilities. We’re just making something fun.”</p> <p><em>You can get <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3934270/How_Many_Dudes/">the&nbsp;How Many Dudes demo right now from Steam</a>, and go slaughter ducks and toddlers to your heart’s content.</em></p>

                <p dir="ltr">The conventional wisdom is that Kinect was an albatross on Xbox One, making the system more expensive at launch and taking away resource power. But now, over a decade later, the Kinect-like Nex Playground has outsold Xbox hardware for November in the US, according to Circana.</p><p dir="ltr">Nex Playground came in third for hardware units sold last month, outpacing Xbox Series X|S. The only saving grace is that Xbox raked in more dollar sales, as Nex Playground retails for $250 but has been on sale for $200 over the holiday season. Overall, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hardware-sales-in-the-us-just-had-worst-month-in-30-years/1100-6537041/">video game hardware sales were pretty bleak</a>, reaching a low not seen since November 1995.</p><p dir="ltr">This might not be a total shock for those paying attention. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-probably-wont-guess-what-just-outsold-every-ps5-and-xbox-console-model-in-the-us/1100-6536701/">Nex Playground actually outsold every PS5 and Xbox console bundle</a> for a week last month in the US.

Five games are pre-installed, with the option to purchase <a href="https://www.nexplayground.com/play-pass" rel="nofollow ">a subscription Play Pass</a> for a larger library of games.

"There could be a lesson here that more affordable, family-friendly gaming devices carry appeal during holiday gifting season," Piscatella added.</p><p dir="ltr">On the software side, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7s-sales-struggles-come-into-focus/1100-6537040/">the best-selling game last month in the US</a>.

            <guid>1386142</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Developer 34BigThings has posted a new blog giving details on five of the 17 vehicles that will be available in Carmageddon: Rogue Shift. Each of these five cars has different attributes changing how you can handle the track and the weapon load outs. With such varied styles for each one, there will be clear favourites depending on your own playstyle.</p>
<p><iframe title="Chop Shop - Eagle GT" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hxKie2O5ZoQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The first of the cars is the Eagle GT which is considered a good allrounder muscle car, with its best attribute being its handling. It also has armour and is heavier than most of the other vehicles in the game, making it useful for close melee encounters with others. The Eagle GT’s starting weapon is the machine gun which can be lethal against metal and flesh, but its effectiveness drops the further away you are from your target. The starting perk is Boost Refill which lets you start a race with a boost bottle, and refunds it if you get reset.</p>
<p><iframe title="Chop Shop - Clunker" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4d9jXu92N84?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The first unlockable vehicle in Carmageddon: Rogue Shift is the Clunker. The Clunker is one of the tankier options available where its durability and defense is very high, but this comes at the cost of speed so it will not win outright. Instead, players using The Clunker should be more focused on getting close to other players and taking them down by either bashing into them or using the shotgun. The Tank Return perk increases damage output the more you improve the Clunker’s defense.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Chop Shop - Firecracker" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZOJYzOm3olY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Firecracker Turbo is the care for players who value speed over all else. Acceleration is this vehicle’s top stat followed by speed, meaning players can dominate in a straight line but there is the risk of spinning out if control is not maintained. The Firecracker Turbo comes equipped with missiles to take out anyone who passes, while the Magic Number perk gives boost and ammo bonuses but only on every 7th use.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Chop Shop - SQR-NE55" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tmvm6PA_Obs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The SQR-NE55 is the most balanced vehicle of the bunch, an allrounder with no standout stats, with this being a car to choose once you are confident with game. While it has no standout stats, the SQR-NE55 does have a laser gun that can do heavy damage at all ranges. The vehicle comes with the Whale perk which gives upgrade discounts and free restocks so you can shape the SQR-NE55 into your own style.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Chop Shop - Hawk GT" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LsbBYSbkvTU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Hawk GT is a vehicle that as top speed, offense, and acceleration but at the sacrifice of handling, meaning all of that power under the hood is useless if you can’t keep it on the track. The Hawk GT is armed with a high-caliber shotgun which is slow to use but deals high damage to targets, and the vehicle also comes equipped with the Meat Shield perk which increases durability with every undead that is defeated.</p>
<p>A pre-registration event is taking place on the <a href="https://playcarmageddon.com/#unlock-rewards">Carmageddon: Rogue Shift&nbsp;</a>website, where players can unlock rewards for the game. Carmageddon: Rogue Shift is due to release in early 2026 for PC, PS5, Xbox Series XS, and Switch 2.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/with-significant-gpu-and-cpu-performance-improvements-unreal-engine-5-7-is-another-step-in-the-right-direction/</link>
            <guid>1386136</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>While Unreal Engine 5's Lumen and Nanite redefined modern visuals, the engine makes more than a few gamers shudder in fear due to its heavy system requirements and its widely known <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-pc-performance-benchmarks/">performance and stuttering issues</a></strong>, which prevent many from enjoying games powered by the engine properly, especially on PC.</p>



<p>Since the engine's launch, however, Epic has attempted to mitigate these issues, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-7-out-now-with-nanite-foliage-and-megalights-powered-stunning-dynamic-shadow-casting-lights/"><strong>Unreal Engine 5.7</strong></a> seems to be yet another step in the right direction.</p>



<p>A new comparison video put together by MxBenchmarkPC highlights the performance improvements introduced in the latest version of the engine by running the Unreal Engine 5.4 and Unreal Engine 5.7 versions of the <a href="https://scansfactory.gumroad.com/l/DEMO-Venice"><strong>Photorealistic Venice Tech Demo created by Scans Factory</strong></a> running side-by-side.</p>



<p>In terms of performance on an RTX 5080 GPU, <em>"GPU performance is improved by up to 25% in UE 5.7 (depending on a scene), and the 5.7 version is now better utilizing GPU resources, hence the GPU power draw is now higher," </em>writes the YouTuber. </p>



<p>CPU performance on an Intel Core i7-14700F is significantly improved, up to 35%, which leads, according to MxBenchmarkPC, to <em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">"more stable frametimes with less hitches across all scenes."</em> This last improvement is particularly welcome, as the biggest issue in most games powered by Unreal Engine 5 is unstable frametimes that lead to a choppy and very unpleasant experience.</p>



<p>Unreal Engine 5.7 also brings some image quality improvements, as MxBenchmarkPC highlighted in their analysis. <em>"In terms of image quality, UE 5.7 offers more stable and accurate Lumen lighting, and especially higher quality Lumen reflections (with better performance at the same time)."</em> Unfortunately, Lumen denoising quality has only been improved slightly, so tech like NVIDIA DLSS Ray Reconstruction still does a better job than the engine's native solution.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Unreal Engine 5.7 vs Unreal Engine 5.4 Comparison - Significant Performance Improvement | RTX 5080" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S2Yi64DcooY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>While it will be a while to see games built to take advantage of the enhancements introduced in Unreal Engine 5.7, the fact that Epic continues to address some of the engine's most critical flaws is encouraging, and bodes well for the future. Hopefully, it won't take too long to finally see Unreal Engine 5 games running smoothly even on mid-range PC hardware.</p>

            <guid>1386133</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Nacon has revealed that post-apocalyptic survival game <em>Terminator: Survivors </em>has been delayed beyond its initial 2025 release window, and that a key feature has been canceled as well.</p><p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2617340/view/624439505179377725" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">news post</a> on Steam, Nacon says <em>Terminator: Survivors</em>, which was originally due to launch in Early Access sometime this year (having <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/terminator-survivors-early-access-release" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="59cf7b33-22f3-452a-868e-dc0d1af2d92f" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">already been delayed once</a>), "won't be launching in 2025", and that the studio doesn't have a new release date "locked in" yet either.</p><p>However, there is a small (potential) silver lining to this news; Nacon says that it's adjusting its release plans because it no longer wants to launch <em>Terminator: Survivors </em>in Early Access, so when the game does arrive, it'll be a "complete and polished experience", per the studio.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Terminator: Survivors </em>isn't coming out in 2025, unfortunately.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Additionally, Nacon says it's canning the co-op multiplayer aspect of <em>Terminator: Survivors</em>, having come to the conclusion that a single-player title would be better for delivering an "authentic <em>Terminator </em>experience".</p><p>Nacon says that although <em>Terminator: Survivors </em>won't be launching in 2025, the studio will be holding a number of closed playtests under a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) "as the launch window gets closer". If you want to sign up for those tests, you can <a href="https://my.nacongaming.com/en-GB/playtests" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">do so here</a>.</p><p>If you're unfamiliar with <em>Terminator: Survivors</em>, it is, as the name suggests, a survival game based on the <em>Terminator </em>series of movies (and ancillary media, of course).</p><p>Originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/terminator-survivors-and-more-unveiled-at-nacon-connect" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="dc6ce4d7-d291-4d5c-8751-0809354ad4e9" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">revealed last year</a>, <em>Terminator: Survivors </em>takes place four years after Judgment Day, the event that devastated humanity and saw the machines rising up to rule the world. You'll need to battle Skynet's prototypes and help the Resistance claim a new future for mankind.</p>
<p>We no longer know exactly when to expect <em>Terminator: Survivors</em>, but if you want to keep up with Nacon's progress on the game, then you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2617340/Terminator_Survivors/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">wishlist it on PC via Steam right here</a>.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <guid>1386127</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Reports of <em>Call of Duty</em>'s demise are greatly exaggerated, at least if Circana's latest US gaming sales data roundup is to be believed; the latest game in the long-running shooter series still reigns supreme.</p><p>According to the firm's <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3ma6t4njxoc2w" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">ever-reliable Mat Piscatella</a>, <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 </em>still managed to top the all-format premium sales chart for November, beating out rivals like <em>Battlefield 6</em>, <em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em>, and <em>Ghost of Yotei </em>(all of which, admittedly, originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-6-october-best-selling-circana" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="15da8cce-653d-4fe6-aa54-3cae8b3a0758" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">launched in October</a>).</p><p><em>Battlefield 6 </em>is in second place for the month, with annual sports releases <em>NBA 2K26</em>, <em>Madden NFL 26</em>, and <em>EA Sports FC 26 </em>taking up third, fourth, and fifth place respectively. <em>Pokemon </em>and <em>Ghost of Yotei </em>are in sixth and seventh before another sports game, <em>EA Sports College Football 26</em>, snags eighth.</p><figure role="group">

  </article>

<figcaption><em>EA Sports College Football 26 </em>is one of November's best-selling games in the US.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Rounding out the top ten for the month are <em>Minecraft</em>, which can always be seen pretty close to the top few places in the chart, and <em>Kirby Air Riders</em>.</p><p>Despite <em>Black Ops 7</em>'s strong performance in November's chart, it hasn't managed to topple <em>Battlefield 6 </em>in the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3ma6t4pndwc2w" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">year-to-date</a> stakes; in fact, it's currently sitting at a rather measly seventh on that chart, having been beaten out by the likes of <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>and <em>NBA 2K26</em>.</p><p>It's worth saying that <em>Black Ops 7 </em>is at something of a disadvantage here given that all of its rivals have had several months to rack up sales, but given that <em>Call of Duty </em>is usually a sales behemoth, this probably won't be particularly encouraging for Activision.</p><p>Indeed, the publisher recently revealed that back-to-back yearly releases of <em>Modern Warfare </em>and <em>Black Ops </em>games <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-black-ops-modern-warfare-activision" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1b6f0e4f-b66c-47da-8092-f3d497caf8fe" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">will end</a>, presumably paving the way for another sub-series to break up the repetition a little.</p>
<p>It's well worth taking a look at Piscatella's <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3ma6t4juhvs2w" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">full thread</a> for some more nerdy statistical breakdowns of how the gaming industry did sales-wise in November. Stay tuned for December's figures!</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A listing for adventure game-slash-management sim <em>Dispatch </em>has been spotted on the Nintendo eShop, suggesting that the game may be coming to both Switch 2 and Switch next month.</p><p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/dispatch-coming-to-switch-2-switch-on-january-29-2026" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Gematsu</a>, an Australian eShop <a href="https://ec.nintendo.com/AU/en/titles/70010000105332" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">listing</a> for <em>Dispatch </em>appears to point to a release date of January 29th for the game on both of Nintendo's consoles. It'll have an install size of 13.6GB on both machines and will also offer a free Switch 2 upgrade path for original Switch owners.</p><p>It is, of course, possible that the January 29th date is a placeholder, but it's an oddly specific one if so, given that the date in question is only just over a month away. I'd say it's a safe bet AdHoc Studio's game will be arriving on Switch 2 and Switch soon.</p><figure role="group">

<p>If you're not familiar with <em>Dispatch</em>, it's an adventure game created by AdHoc Studio, a developer that boasts <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-telltale-employees-go-on-to-form-adhoc-studio" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ebf6f25a-7f8d-4c5f-bcf6-4525c284b84e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">several ex-Telltale staffers</a> among its ranks.</p><p>As you might expect from folks who worked on Telltale's games, <em>Dispatch </em>is primarily an episodic choice-based adventure in which you'll make a series of decisions that will impact the game's narrative as it progresses.</p><p>However, the game also features a management element in which you must serve as a dispatcher, sending heroes to tackle crimes across the city. The decisions you make during the narrative segments may also end up impacting what you can do while you're dispatching.</p><p>Released earlier this year, <em>Dispatch </em>managed to cross a million sales <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dispatch-sales-1m-10-days" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="fdb19357-4765-4684-bf2c-7f64112fcdbd" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">in just ten days</a>, going on to pass the two million mark <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dispatch-sales-2m" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">less than two weeks later</a>. It's safe to say there's a voracious appetite for this one.</p>
<p><em>Dispatch </em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2592160/Dispatch/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/dispatch/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5</a>, and if this report is correct, then it's due to launch on Switch 2 and Switch in January as well.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-sells-its-tv-soundbar-3-times-cheaper-than-direct-rivals-now-at-record-low-before-christmas-2000654172</link>
            <guid>1386112</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Soundbars don’t have to cost close to $1,000 like the Sonos Arc Ultra to make your TV’s sound much better, especially if your current TV speakers sound weak and thin. Amazon’s <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5862/">Fire TV Soundbar is currently on sale for $99, down from its regular price of $119</a> and this is the kind of aggressive pricing that Amazon uses for all of its hardware brands (including Ring, Blink, and eero). This 2.0 speaker system has two speakers that fit naturally under most TVs without taking over your entertainment center and it makes sound fuller, dialogue clearer, and bass deeper.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5862/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Virtual surround sound that is better than its price</h2>
<p><strong>DTS Virtual:X technology</strong> makes it possible to hear sound in three dimensions from just two speakers, instead of needing several satellite speakers placed around the room. The processing looks at audio signals and makes it seem like sound is coming from different directions and heights and makes movies, shows, and games more immersive without the cost and complexity of real surround systems. <strong>Dolby Audio suppor</strong>t makes this effect even better by keeping detail and dynamic range across all kinds of content, from quiet dialogue scenes to loud action scenes.</p>
<p>The included HDMI cable makes setup quick and easy because it connects directly to your TV’s HDMI eARC or ARC port. This one cable connection sends both audio and control signals, so the soundbar turns on when you turn on your TV and responds to volume changes from your TV remote. You don’t have to mess with optical cables, figure out how to use complicated menu settings, or set up universal remotes to make everything work well together.</p>



<p>The <strong>soundbar is 24 inches long and only 2.5 inches tall</strong> so it will fit comfortably on most TV stands and entertainment consoles without blocking your TV screen or infrared remote sensors. This small profile works best with TVs that are small to medium-sized, since a big soundbar would look out of place and take up too much space. You can put it right in front of your TV stand or mount it on the wall below your TV if you want a cleaner look.</p>
<p><strong>Bluetooth makes the soundbar more useful</strong> than just for TV audio: You can also stream music directly from your phone or tablet. You can play music from Spotify, Apple Music, or any other audio app on your device without having to turn on your TV or switch inputs. The wireless connection pairs quickly and stays stable over normal room distances, so you can control playback from your couch or even another room without losing sound.</p>



<p>If you have a Fire TV device, the integration works perfectly and lets <strong>you control both your TV and audio settings with just one remote</strong>. The soundbar automatically picks up Fire TV commands and changes the volume for different types of content and it works with smart TVs and any TV that is connected to streaming media players from other brands, like Roku, Apple TV, or Chromecast, even if you don’t use Fire TV devices.</p>
<p>You can get a big improvement in sound quality for $99 instead of $119, which is about the same price as a nice dinner out. You can find budget soundbars from generic brands in this price range, but they don’t have DTS Virtual:X processing, Dolby Audio support, or the ability to work with Fire TV like Amazon’s does.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Video Game Console Sales Just Flatlined Ahead Of The Holidays As Prices Soar]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ps5-prices-sales-inflation-economy-2000654196</link>
            <guid>1386109</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A new Nintendo console is on the market <a href="https://kotaku.com/light-up-the-town-cozy-christmas-holiday-lights-simulator-steam-demo-review-2000652213">this Christmas</a> for the first time in eight years, but that apparently wasn’t enough to juice overall hardware sales. According to the latest data, last month was the worst November for new video game hardware sales in the U.S. since 1995, the year the original PlayStation launched here.</p> <p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social">Circana’s Mat Piscatella reports</a> that only 1.6 million new consoles were sold last month, including during Black Friday. That’s just a few hundred thousand more than the 1995 low of 1.4 million. Perhaps just as surprisingly, the Switch 2 wasn’t even the best-selling hardware in November. That honor went to the PS5, a console that’s five years old and ended up not benefiting from the expected <a href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delay-november-gta6-reaction-news-2000641817"><em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em></a> launch hype this year.</p>

 <p>Part of that no doubt came down to a discrepancy in Black Friday deals. Sony was aggressively discounting the all-digital PS5 by $100 while Nintendo actually got rid of its long-standing <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-black-firday-sales-2025-mario-zelda-2000642413"><em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em> bundle</a> for the original Switch. The Switch 2 did end up getting some surprise discounts from retailers by <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-sale-cyber-monday-mario-kart-world-walmart-amazon-2000649232">Cyber Monday</a>, but that ended up falling on December 1 this year, so it doesn’t fall within this period.</p>   <p>Piscatella reports that the average price of a new console “reached an all-time November high of $439, up 11 percent compared to a year ago.” Back in November 2019 the average was just $235. That’s partly the impact from <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-gta-6-price-switch-2-trump-tariff-2000618881">President Trump’s trade war</a> which led Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft to all implement multiple rounds of price increases in 2025. A new Xbox Series X, first released five years ago for $500, now costs $650 at Best Buy.</p>

 <p>Microsoft was also notable for being the only hardware manufacturer not to discount its consoles at all during the holiday season. It’s almost as if the company’s been trying <em>not</em> to sell new hardware, encouraging players instead to play its games in the cloud or on rival platforms. The Xbox ended up coming in third for the month, even as <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-sales-activision-2000652111"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em></a> launched as November’s best-selling game (it will likely still remain behind <em>Battlefield 6</em> for the year, however).</p> <p>Is console gaming <a href="https://kotaku.com/donald-trump-administration-white-house-halo-gamestop-2000639566">just getting too expensive</a>? Is the floor <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/us-economy-flashes-warning-signs-new-data-analysts/story?id=128463726">secretly falling out</a> from under the U.S. economy? Why not both, Piscatella <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3ma6uq52s3c22">suggested</a>. “Correlation does not necessarily imply causation…unless it does,” he wrote when speculating about the drop-off in console sales. With Roblox free and <em>Fortnite</em> back on phones, it’s never been easier for parents to look at the $500 sticker price for a new system and say, “no thanks.”</p>

It's still years away from release, but now Bethesda boss Todd Howard has shared a small update about it.</p><p>He told the <a href="https://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvgr488vlmmo" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">BBC</a> that Fallout 5 will be influenced in part by the popular Prime Video Fallout TV show. "In short, yes," he said. "Fallout 5 will be existing in a world where the stories and events of the show happened or are happening. We are taking that into account."</p><p>Fallout 76 has also been influenced by the TV series, and it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76-expansion-is-adding-the-ghoul-from-prime-videos-fallout-series/1100-6535155/" data-ref-id="1100-6535155">gets new content based on the show, including Walton Goggins' character, The Ghoul. </a>That game is free to play now through December 22, presumably to cash in on the debut of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-season-2-episode-release-date-schedule/1100-6536675/" data-ref-id="1100-6536675">Fallout Season 2.</a></p><p>Bethesda <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-5-is-coming-after-the-elder-scrolls-vi-confirms-todd-howard/1100-6504615/" data-ref-id="1100-6504615">first revealed Fallout 5 back in 2022</a>, saying it would be released after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6492383/" data-ref-id="1100-6492383">The Elder Scrolls VI</a>. There is no word yet on when that game will be released, so fans should get very comfortable for Fallout 5. It's not coming out anytime soon.</p><p>Earlier this month, Bethesda said Fallout was the franchise that the developer was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-is-the-franchise-that-bethesda-is-doing-the-most-in-right-now/1100-6536889/" data-ref-id="1100-6536889">"doing the most in."</a></p><p>"We've had a long-term plan for Fallout, and so I wish I could talk about all those today," Howard told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-chief-todd-howard-says-fallout-is-the-franchise-that-were-doing-the-most-in-right-now-coy-on-potential-return-to-new-vegas-or-a-fallout-3-remaster-while-fans-wait-for-fallout-5?utm_source=bluesky,threads,twitter" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>. "I'll just say this: It's the franchise that we're doing the most in right now."</p><p>In the BBC interview, Howard also discussed how he's happy that the Fallout TV show on Prime Video can help introduce more people to the world of Fallout.</p><p>"There's still so many people that won't play a game--I think that's getting better but there's still people who are intimidated," he said. "They still get to experience Fallout and I think that's really important because they're now equal fans of the world."</p><p>Beyond Fallout 5, it's rumored that Bethesda is working on a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-3-remaster-is-real-another-report-says/1100-6536093/" data-ref-id="1100-6536093">remaster of Fallout 3.</a></p><p>For more on the wider Fallout world, be sure to read <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-season-2-episode-1-kicked-off-with-a-bang-literally/1100-6537031/" data-ref-id="1100-6537031">GameSpot's breakdown of Fallout Season 2, Episode 1</a> and our rundown of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-season-2-episode-1-easter-eggs-include-a-damn-fine-twin-peaks-reference/1100-6537032/" data-ref-id="1100-6537032">all the Easter eggs in Episode 1.</a></p>
