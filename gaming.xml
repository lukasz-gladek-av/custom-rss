                <p>The developer behind the partially community-funded PC game Alzara: Radiant Echoes has announced it's shutting down and the game won't be released after the team raised more than $300,000 to make it.</p><p>Studio Camelia, which successfully raised €294,428 ($339,000 USD) from more than 5,000 people to fund the game via Kickstarter, made the announcement in a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/studiocamelia/seed-a-vibrant-tribute-to-jrpg-classics/posts/4411421" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a>.</p><p>"We can only imagine your disappointment upon reading this," the studio said.</p><p>Studio Camelia will not refund money to people who contributed to the Kickstarter. "Neither the studio nor Kickstarter is able to refund your contribution to the project, and we are truly sorry for that," it said, adding that Kickstarter campaigns are inherently risky and are advertised as such.</p><p><a href="https://help.kickstarter.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005048173-Does-Kickstarter-issue-refunds#:~:text=Kickstarter%20is%20not%20a%20store,go%20along%20for%20the%20ride." data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kickstarter says</a> people who pledge funds to a project should know beforehand that, "Kickstarter is not a store and we do not issue refunds. When you back a project, you're supporting a creator's right to try to make something new--and agreeing to go along for the ride."</p><h2><strong>What happened?</strong></h2><p>The team wrote in a statement that it wanted to build a JRPG with a "fresh perspective," and one that was influenced by games like Final Fantasy X and Golden Sun. The company was funded in part by the Kickstarter campaign, along with money from staffers' own personal savings, along with "business angels, banks, and institutions." The game was also accepted into Microsoft's Developer Acceleration Program.</p><p>However, all of this only covered half of what Studio Camelia said it needed to produce Alzara. So it decided to run a Kickstarter campaign to demonstrate to potential investors that Alzara had legs. The team then sought funding from an "industry partner," but it was ultimately unable to secure one.</p><p>"Investors are now operating in a market where taking risks is discouraged, and they can afford to wait before committing to a project in order to reduce risk," the statement said.</p><p>Studio Camelia attended Tokyo Game Show, DICE, and other industry events to meet with partners about raising funding, but "none of them resulted in a contract."</p><p>"We spared no effort and tried to hold on as long as we could," the developer said. "This is part of the harsh reality of the industry. We are creatives, but we need funding to keep creating. Sometimes, even having a promising game concept with proven market interest and a strong team is not enough. Many say that every released game is a miracle, and that couldn't be more true."</p><p>Alzara is now "on an indefinite pause" as the studio undergoes the liquidation process that requires "various legal procedures" that will run for "some time."</p><p>"There is a slim chance that a third party might one day step in and offer to take over the project. If that happens, the game would inevitably take a different direction than what was presented during the campaign, but hopefully for the better!" the studio said.</p><h2><strong>Pre-production demo footage</strong></h2><p>While Alzara may never be released, Studio Camelia released pre-production demo footage of the game, showing it in its non-finished state. The studio said it cannot release the demo itself due to copyright reasons and issues pertaining to the liquidation process.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLV5dIfrX4k" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FLV5dIfrX4k" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Plenty of games enter development and are never released. The creative process, after all, is a fickle business. Blizzard, for example, says it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-cancels-new-game-in-development-for-two-y/1100-6467418/" data-ref-id="1100-6467418">cancels about half of the games it begins development on.</a> Warner Bros., meanwhile, is reported to have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wonder-woman-game-has-reportedly-cost-warner-bros-100-million/1100-6529315/" data-ref-id="1100-6529315">spent $100 million on a new Wonder Woman game before cancelling it. </a></p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages/" data-ref-id="5000-631964">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> is a great-looking game, leveraging the ray tracing enhancements that the latest iteration of iDTech affords the blood-soaked shooter. But if you're on PC, then you can unlock the true potential of the engine with the awaited path tracing update, at the expense of a lot of performance.</p><p>For those unfamiliar, <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-path-tracing/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">path tracing</a> is an all-encompassing form of ray tracing, which simulates how rays of light bounce off surfaces, that is far more demanding. Objects shoot out more rays and allow those rays to bounce around a scene more than once, leading to far more accurate lighting, better ambient occlusion, and better reflections and surface material approximations. It is, when implemented correctly, a night-and-day difference to standard ray tracing techniques, albeit only afforded by some of the best hardware on the market.</p><p>Path tracing can be transformative in Doom: The Dark Ages, if you find the right scene to do some comparisons, and it's interior spaces seem to benefit the most. Light bounces and illuminates objects in ways that standard ray tracing can't afford, while the contrast between the areas where light is meant to be, and where it definitely shouldn't, are more naturally defined. Digital Foundry has released an extensive look at many of the improvements path tracing affords, which gives you a good idea if the additional visual flair is worth it.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR3c9lyV5as" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BR3c9lyV5as" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>That's because you'll need to give up a lot of performance to take advantage of path tracing, even if you restrict which game objects make use of it. You'll be making heavy use of Nvidia's DLSS or frame generation to keep the action feeling smooth, with <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/gaming/pc-gaming/i-tested-the-doom-the-dark-ages-path-tracing-update-the-difference-is-night-and-day-but-my-gpu-got-hotter-than-hell" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Tom's Guide</a> stating that performance plummeted by 40% on the RTX 5070Ti used for testing. Your mileage may vary depending on what GPU you're using, but just like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/" data-ref-id="5000-525173">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> before it, this isn't a setting you can just turn on and forget about.</p><p>Doom: The Dark Ages is another great entry in the modern reinvention of the series, continuing from the strong foundations established with 2016's Doom and Doom Eternal, while taking the action in a wholly new direction. In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/doom-the-dark-ages-review/1900-6418361/" data-ref-id="1900-6418361">Doom: The Dark Ages review</a>, we praised this new direction saying, "Doom: The Dark Ages shows that there's still so much fertile ground that this series can explore, and that sometimes smart, measured changes can take the series in surprising new directions and yield some of its finest moments."</p>

The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/donkey-kong-bananza-direct-every-announcement-how-would-you-rate-it">spotlight Direct</a> was absolutely jam-packed with DK goodness, revealing some familiar faces, highlighting a bunch of gameplay mechanics and announcing enough collectibles to make even the most tentative completionist break out in a sweat. On top of all that, we've also got a new batch of screenshots — like we said, what a day!</p>
<p>The freshly-baked screens cover a lot of the same ground that you will have seen in the Direct, but it's a nice chance to stop for a minute and <em>really</em> soak up some of the details. Scrolling through them got us feeling sufficiently pumped for the game's <strong>17th July</strong> release date, and we thought it would be only fair to share them all with you lovely lot too.</p>
<p>So, let's check out some of these sweet snaps, shall we? Starting with the surprise reveal that started it all: Pauline!</p>

<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:184093 @ 1750272303 -->
<p>And how about those vistas? Just imagine the punching potential...</p>



<p>Next, let's have a look at the three Bananza Transformations, which will see DK morph into a giant gorilla, a speedy zebra and a flying ostrich, each with its own special abilities:</p>

<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:184091 @ 1750272303 -->
<p>We've got a handful of gameplay screenshots too, so you can see what exploration and Challenge Courses will look like when treated to some HUD magic:</p>


<p>And we haven't forgotten about you menu fans, either. We'll round things out with a closer look at the in-game map, the DK Art mode, and a handful of shop and Skill Point menus:</p>

<hr>
<p>We're imagine we'll hear a little more from Donkey Kong Bananza before it swings its way to Switch 2 on 17th July, but for now, at least, you can consider us sufficiently hyped!</p>

            <p>
Following last year's slam-dunk <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> remake, the beloved survival horror sequel is being reinterpreted yet again, this time in the form of new movie adaptation Return to Silent Hill. And now, three years after its announcement, it's been given a release date of 23rd June 2026.
</p>
<p>
Return to Silent Hill was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-konamis-silent-hill-october-2022-showcase">originally unveiled in 2022</a>, alongside a variety of gaming projects including the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-ascension-fails-to-impress-with-greedy-monetisation-and-cluttered-ui">unloved Silent Hill: Ascension</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-review">masterful Silent Hill 2 remake</a>, the upcoming <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a>, and No Code's still-mysterious Silent Hill Townfall.
</p>
<p>
Amid that flurry of gaming news, Return to Silent Hill was perhaps a little lost in the throng, but the key bit of information was that it would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/return-to-silent-hill-film-detailed">see Christophe Gans take on directing duties once more</a>. Gans, of course, previously helmed 2006's Sean-Bean-starring original Silent Hill movie, which certainly captured the game series' atmosphere - even if it did all start to fall apart in the last stretch, when it suddenly decided it needed to explain itself in a ham-fisted exposition dump that even some high-velocity barbed wire couldn't save.

<p>
Since Return to Silent Hill's initial unveiling, it's been confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/return-to-silent-hill-casts-war-horses-jeremy-irvine-as-james">War Horse's Jeremy Irvine will star as Silent Hill 2 protagonist James</a>, with Hannah Emily Anderson in the role of his "one true love" Mary (an early leak suggested the two won't be married in this version). More recently, Gans <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/return-to-silent-hill-film-will-be-faithful-adaptation-of-silent-hill-2-distributor-promises">insisted his adaptation would be a "faithful" one</a>, although a careful reading of the movie's synopsis does imply some potentially notable changes:
</p>
<p>
"James, a man broken after his relationship with the love of his life, Mary, ends," reads the official synopsis. "When a mysterious letter from her calls him back to Silent Hill, he finds a once-recognisable town transformed by an unknown evil. While James desperately searches for Mary he encounters terrifying creatures and begins to unravel the mystery of what happened to the town. But as he descends deeper into the darkness the secrets he uncovers lead to a horrifying truth, and James finds himself struggling to hold on long enough to save his one true love."
</p>
<p>
We'll know if Return to Silent Hill does its source material justice when it <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/06/silent-night-deadly-night-return-silent-hill-release-dates-1236436030/">hits the big screen</a> on 23rd June next year. However it ends up, Bloober's remake - which has now <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-passes-another-sales-milestone">sold over 2m copies</a> - is a fine way to experience a bonafide gaming classic. And the studio is about to do it all over again, as it embarks on its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-silent-hill-remake-has-been-revealed-during-konami-press-start-showcase">recently announced remake of Silent Hill 1</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-is-a-bigger-evolution-than-borderlands-3-says-gearbox/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>With less than three months until the launch date of Borderlands 4, Gearbox is starting to share a lot more details. Yesterday, the game became <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-wont-cost-80/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available for pre-order</a>, and fans learned the pricing and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-confirms-fairly-tame-pc-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PC system requirements</a>. Now, Executive Producer Chris Brock has been <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/borderlands-4-interview-with-chris-brock-producer-and-taylor-clark-senior-writer-1559773/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewed</a> by Gamereactor. Among other things, he reckons that the new game is more of an evolution for the franchise than its predecessor was when it launched in 2019.</p>
<p><em>The time between Borderlands 2 and Borderlands 3 was about seven years. We had been gone for a while. We wanted to make sure that when we came back it was familiar. When people say it feels like more Borderlands, yeah, that was the goal. We wanted to make more Borderlands. We wanted to evolve, but we didn't want to change the formula so much that it didn't feel familiar.</em></p>
<p><em>But going from Borderlands 3 to Borderlands 4, one of the things we wanted to focus on was the traversal abilities and exploration. And that has led to the series evolving, I would say, more between 3 and 4 than it did between 2 and 3, for sure.</em></p>
<p>In the same interview, Senior Writer Taylor Clark explained why Borderlands 4 will feature a different brand of humor than previous installments.</p>
<p><em>The most important thing for us is to have a tone that feels like it makes sense in the world we're building and in the story we're trying to tell. On Pandora, like the Wild West, the shotgun approach made sense. Because this was a world where anything goes. A world where everything was trying to kill you and corporations were trying to cut each other's throats. And Handsome Jack always looked at you and was talking shit to you. The slightly nastier tone made sense in that world. On a totalitarian, dictatorial planet ruled by this person with an iron fist, it makes less sense.</em></p>
<p><em>It makes less sense to have a tone like that. It wouldn't feel appropriate (like firing jokes from a T-shirt cannon) when we are under a horribly oppressed world. We tried to find the humor. It wouldn't be a Borderlands game without humor.</em></p>
<p>Borderlands 4 is coming on September 12 to PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X, while the Nintendo Switch 2 version will be released at a later date.</p>

                <p>Warner Bros. Games has announced a major organizational change as it looks to focus on four major franchises going forward: Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, Mortal Kombat, and DC.</p><p>Yves Lachance, who was previously the studio head of WB Games Montreal, is now senior vice president of development, with his remit being overseeing the studios working on Harry Potter and Game of Thrones games. Shaun Himmerick, who previously was the boss at NetherRealm, is now senior vice president for development on all new Mortal Kombat and DC games.</p><p>WB Games New York boss Steven Flenory is now senior vice president for central tech and services, a role that sees him overseeing quality assurance, user research, game and publishing technology, and customer service.</p><p>These three executives will report to Warner Bros. Discover boss JB Perrette. In a statement, Perrette said the company is making these changes to "develop long-term franchise roadmaps" for Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, Mortal Kombat, and DC projects.</p><p>"We are very fortunate to have a strong stable of development and technology talent, and Yves, Shaun, and Steven are respected leaders with excellent track records in their areas of expertise. I'm looking forward to working closely with them and the team as we work to make the best games possible for our key franchises," Perrette said.</p><p><a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/warner-bros-games-restructures-game-of-thrones-harry-potter-1236434385/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">According to Variety</a>, this management shakeup did not lead to any layoffs or any executives leaving the company. Former WB Games top boss David Haddad left the company earlier this year, and it remains to be seen if the company is looking for a replacement.</p><p>Earlier this month, WB Discovery said it is breaking apart into two companies: WBD Streaming and Studios and WBD Global Networks. WB Games is part of the Streaming and Studios division, which is run by CEO David Zaslav.</p><p>In terms of upcoming releases, Batman: Arkham Knight developer Rocksteady is said to be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-batman-and-game-of-thrones-games-may-be-in-the-works/1100-6529314/" data-ref-id="1100-6529314">working on a new single-player Batman game</a>. WB Games Montreal is reportedly pitching a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-batman-and-game-of-thrones-games-may-be-in-the-works/1100-6529314/" data-ref-id="1100-6529314">new Game of Thrones title</a>. Avalanche Software is expected to be working on a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/making-a-hogwarts-legacy-sequel-is-one-of-warner-bros-biggest-priorities/1100-6526285/" data-ref-id="1100-6526285">Hogwarts Legacy sequel</a>.</p><p>The Mortal Kombat series, meanwhile, is expected to continue from developer NetherRealm. As for other DC projects, studio boss James Gunn has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/first-dc-universe-game-wont-be-revealed-soon-but-some-really-interesting-projects-are-coming/1100-6529678/" data-ref-id="1100-6529678">some "really interesting" projects are coming</a>, but not soon.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/features/reaction-donkey-kong-bananza-has-instantly-become-my-most-anticipated-game-of-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="DK Bananza 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ac54d4227a89c/dk-bananza-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>I have to admit, before the recent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/donkey-kong-bananza-direct-every-announcement-how-would-you-rate-it"><strong>Donkey Kong Bananza</strong> Direct</a>, I wasn't <em>massively</em> enthusiastic about Nintendo's upcoming Switch 2 platformer.</p>
<p>I played about 20 minutes of it at one of the Switch 2 Experience events back in April, and although I was charmed by the aesthetics and the ability to smash up pieces of the environment, I couldn't help but wonder if there was something more - that Nintendo was holding back a little bit.</p>
<p>It turns out I was wrong. It held back a <em>lot</em>.</p>
<p>This Direct was simply magnificent and my excitement has gone from about 45/100 bananas all the way up to about 98. That's a lot of bananas! Where are the remaining two, you ask? Well, King K. Rool isn't there, but we can't have everything now, can we?</p>

<p>My concern around the playable demo was that the game would amount to little more than smashing through the terrain to find collectibles ('Banandium Gems'). Surely there was more to it, right? Well, yes.</p>
<p>For starters, let's just touch on the wonderful bait and switch regarding Odd Rock and Pauline. We kinda knew something like this was in the works following a rather <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/did-donkey-kong-bananza-key-art-accidentally-leak-a-big-surprise">unfortunate leak</a>, but it's still an incredible move. I honestly couldn't click with Odd Rock from the earlier promotional material, so to learn that DK will instead spend his time with a young Pauline was an absolute delight.</p>
<p>You can keep your depressing father/daughter dynamic, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/last_of_us_part_i">The Last of Us</a> – this is much more up my street.</p>

<p>Pauline's not just there for show, either. With special Bananza Powers, she can burst into song and enable DK to transform into completely new forms. Kong Bananza looks absolutely awesome, but I'm sorry, Zebra Bananza? <em>Ostrich Bananza..?!</em> I'm gonna need plushies of those right now, thank you very much.</p>
<p>The transformations grant you extra strength, speed, and the ability to fly, and just these alone make the gameplay look infinitely more varied and compelling than what I saw in the early demo. I've a feeling there might be a few more transformations Nintendo hasn't revealed just yet too. How about Sloth Bananza? <em>Anyone..?</em></p>
<p>Quick glimpses of other gameplay features — including the Challenge Course Ruins, the skill tree, and collectible costumes — did a lot to boost my excitement too. Side-scrolling levels are back! Rambi is back! And I simply can't wait to experiment with the different clothing and colour options. Who knew that an ice-themed Donkey Kong would look so cool?</p>

<p>And of course, I have to give a shoutout to the new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/donkey-kong-bananza-channels-super-mario-64-energy-with-its-dk-artist-mode">DK Artist mode</a>. As someone who messed around with the 3D menu-screen Mario in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">Super Mario 64</a> longer than I care to admit, being able to chip chunks off DK's face or Bowser's hair and create some truly terrifying monstrosities makes me more excited than DK gobbling up a Banandium Gem. It looks absolutely wonderful.</p>
<p>It wasn't <em>all</em> for me, admittedly. Chances are I won't go into photo mode too much or jump into the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/donkey-kong-bananza-features-two-player-co-op-and-you-can-even-gameshare-to-switch-1">co-op multiplayer</a>, and there's not a hope in hell I'm buying <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/donkey-kong-gets-a-new-amiibo-nintendo-details-how-they-work-in-dk-bananza">another amiibo</a>, but I appreciate their inclusion regardless.</p>
<p>I've got to be honest, though: after the incredibly disappointing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-mario-kart-world-every-announcement-how-would-you-rate-it"><strong>Mario Kart World</strong> Direct</a> in April, which basically just went over everything we already knew and did very little to move my excitement beyond about 70 blue shells out of 100, the DK Direct totally 180-ed me.</p>
<p>I was <em>mildly</em> excited before, but now it's my most anticipated game of the year. Bravo, Nintendo. Just don't tell Samus.</p>

<p><em>What are your thoughts on Donkey Kong Bananza after watching the recent Direct presentation? Has your excitement increased, or is it about the same as before? Give me a banana number!

Not everyone has that sort of time, but it’s an outlook that certainly takes the pressure off of actually feeling like you need to get better or show progress for all those failed attempts.

He’s previously espoused his love of FromSoftware’s uniquely esoteric brand of storytelling, likening it to an “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1kti9si/alex_garland_on_why_he_loves_the_dark_souls_games/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1kti9si/alex_garland_on_why_he_loves_the_dark_souls_games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">existential dream</a></span>.” We’ll see how that translates to the big screen. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

If you fall once, it's only one pip on the bar; but by third death, you've got the whole radius covered in purple, and it can feel quite difficult to chip that much purple bar down while a Nightlord is attacking you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As it turns out, there are some hidden mechanics that may be helping or hindering your efforts to pick your teammates back up. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ZullietheWitch" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTuber Zullie the Witch</a> has been on the Elden Ring Nightreign beat, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HUe7JUs8_M" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently put up new video</a> in which they try to understand how revives work. (Thanks for the spot, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/you-arent-just-imagining-things-elden-ring-nightreign-player-confirms-its-6x-harder-to-revive-someone-at-3-bars-when-compared-to-1-because-fromsoftwares-ui-is-basically-lying-to-you/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PC Gamer</a>.)</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Per Zullie's investigation, the first time a player falls in battle, they get one bar at a total of 40 HP. But as they continue to fall, this escalates at a surprising rate, with 45 per bar at second death and a whopping 80 per bar at three, for a grand total of 240 HP total if you're on three bars.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hitting the player who's downed chips away at those totals, but if they're left alone for 3.5 seconds, the death timer around their dial resumes (unless you're in a Night boss fight) and the gauge starts to refill. The fill time also speeds up as you gain more bars, going from 2-per-second at one bar to 40-per-second at three bars.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's a lot of math to say: the more you fall, the harder it gets (exponentially so) to pick you back up. There is some good news though, as penalties gradually wear off over time or whenever one visits a Site of Grace.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zullie also highlights some hidden math in how weapons work on the revive bars, too. It's about what you'd expect, compared to regular attacks; giant weapons, like Halberds, Reapers, and Greatswords have more impact on the revive bar than Claws, Daggers, Torches, or Fists on a per-swing basis. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In fact, Revenant's Cursed Claws make for uniquely effective revival tools in this regard, as they have the same base numbers as a Greatsword. Revenant mains can effectively play both White Mage and Summoner, I guess?</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN FromSoftware Game Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Zullie's video goes into even more math around the revival numbers, but for the average Elden Ring Nightreign player, the solid takeaways are that higher bars get increasingly harder to clear as Nightfarers fall. Honestly, it makes certain characters like the Revenant even more valuable as teammates, when they have both summons to help out and an ultimate that will pick teammates back up regardless of their bar's status.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Essential_Tips_and_Tricks"><u>Nightreign tips and tricks</u></a> to help you take down <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightlord_Boss_Guides"><u>all the eight Nightlord Bosses</u></a>, and if you’re wondering how to unlock the two locked <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightfarers_-_List_of_Character_Classes"><u>Nightfarer Classes</u></a>, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Revenant"><u>How to Unlock the Revenant</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Duchess"><u>How to Unlock the Duchess</u></a>, plus <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Change_Characters"><u>How to Change Characters</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> History Of Five Nights At Freddy's</p>
      </div>
<p>This current crossover includes a new playable character, Five Nights at Freddy's Springtrap. His character brings over elements from his franchise, including shocking animations, spring doors, and security cameras that impact gameplay. The crossover also includes a new map, Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza.</p><p>“It goes without saying that Five Nights at Freddy’s and Dead by Daylight feature diametrically opposed gameplay,” shared Jay Guzzo, Springtrap’s Killer Designer in a statement to GameSpot. “In the former, you’re mainly sitting in one room and managing a single resource--your battery. Whereas in DbD, it’s much more action oriented, and sitting still will likely get you nowhere fast. Our challenge became finding a way to get those two things to coalesce. It came down to identifying what creates that incredible tension in Five Nights and Freddy’s and adapting it into a dynamic format for our own game.”</p><p>Behavior Interactive has built out an expansive roster of 39 killers and 46 survivors for Dead by Daylight. This includes original characters and a huge variety of other recognizable faces like Nicolas Cage, Hellraiser, the Demogorgon, and many more. It's a dream team of horror icons.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/shuhei-yoshida-says-sony-doesnt-really-consider-nintendo-as-competition<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>

<p>Former PlayStation exec Shuhei Yoshida is at it again, sharing thoughts and feelings about the gaming industry at large, including Nintendo. And this time, he's opened up on Sony's thoughts on Nintendo on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEdedQ9_zBQ&amp;ab_channel=Kit%26Krysta">Kit &amp; Krysta podcast</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking to the duo (thanks, <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2025/06/17/shuhei-yoshida-says-playstation-only-really-views-nintendo-as-competition-in-japan/">My Nintendo News</a>!), Yoshida — who shares that he got "so many inspirations from Nintendo's games — admits that Sony's "perception of the competition" is focused on Xbox. At least, that's the case internationally (from around <a href="https://youtu.be/fEdedQ9_zBQ?si=JlW2oj_Z3J1jsVHi&amp;t=509">08:28</a>).</p>
<p>Yoshida puts this down to the similarities in hardware and performance for Xbox and Sony, and Nintendo focusing on "family-friendly" stuff:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"[Sony] see Microsoft being the competition because Xbox is very similar – performance, hardware. Like a high-end console, mature games and Nintendo is very, very different. Nintendo is family-friendly, games for everyone, and not about technology, it’s more about having fun with friends and family and always have multiple controllers, bundled with the hardware.</p>
<p>Inside Sony, even when they do a business analysis, Nintendo doesn't show up, so there's a competition market share between PlayStation and Xbox, and they don't include Nintendo. Not that they're ignoring Nintendo, but that they do not necessarily feel Nintendo is competition because Nintendo is covering a different audience."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yoshida is full of praise for the Kyoto-based company throughout the podcast, saying that "we all think it's great to have Nintendo continue to be successful so that we can continue to grow the industry together".</p>
<p>But there is one market where, unsurprisingly, Sony <em>does</em> consider Nintendo as fierce competition: Japan. You've seen it on the weekly Japanese Charts where Nintendo Switch games (and now Switch 2 games) <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/japanese-charts-capcom-fighting-collection-2-brawls-its-way-to-the-top">regularly</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/japanese-charts-fantasy-life-i-caps-off-the-switch-1-with-a-big-win">dominate</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/japanese-charts-switch-2-crushes-ps2-to-become-fastest-selling-console-ever">sales numbers</a>, so we're not surprised to hear the now-retired SIE Worldwide Studios president say this.</p>
<p>Yoshida-san talks about the perception in a bit more detail here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In Japan Nintendo is hugely strong, and Xbox almost doesn’t exist... I should be careful I may get hate messages! It's very hard to see where Xbox is, even though PC gaming is becoming a bit more popular in Japan.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>But it’s all about Nintendo versus Sony. So PlayStation people working in Japan see Nintendo clearly as competition, but outside Japan, PlayStation people clearly see Xbox as a primary competition.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So there's nothing <em>too</em> surprising going on here — Nintendo is doing its own thing, absolutely dominating in Japan, while Sony is doing well elsewhere and competing with Xbox for the big powerhouse market share worldwide.</p>
<p>But the Switch 2 seems to be doing pretty darn well in its early days, so maybe Sony will need to reconsider? The new console has sold <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/its-official-switch-2-has-sold-over-3-5-million-units-globally-in-its-first-four-days">3.5 million units in just four days worldwide</a>, and nearly a million of those are from Japan — at least <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/japanese-charts-switch-2-crushes-ps2-to-become-fastest-selling-console-ever">according to Famitsu's figures</a>.</p>
<p><em>You can watch the full interview up top, but let us know what you think of Yoshida's comments down below.</em></p>
