			<p><strong>Peter Molyneux</strong>, the original creator of the <strong>Fable</strong> franchise at <strong>Lionhead Studios</strong>, shared his first impressions on the upcoming reboot after watching the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-launches-autumn-2026-amazingly-faithful/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent presentation at the <strong>Xbox Developer Direct 2026</strong></a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/f-me-this-thing-that-we-created-its-going-to-live-peter-molyneux-cried-watching-xboxs-new-fable-gameplay-reveal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking with IGN</a>, Molyneux revealed that <strong>he got emotional</strong> at the idea that the Fable IP, which he and the rest of Lionhead spent so much time on, would return. He also pointed out that <strong>it was a good idea for Playground to reboot the series</strong>, and added that he agreed with the twist of the protagonist's village inhabitants turning to stone at the beginning of the game.</p>



<p><em>When I was watching the Fable trailer, I just felt myself tearing up. I know that I could probably be slaughtered for saying that, but I am someone who cries frequently, and I felt incredibly emotional, and the reason I felt emotional was: F*** me. This thing that we created, it's going to live, it’s going to carry on. This world, which we loved creating so much, and other people loved, has a life.</em></p>



<p><em>And for me, the saddest thing would be to see it diminish, which is one of the reasons I'm really going back to God games. So that was the overall emotion. I thought it was really smart of them to retell Fable 1 rather than have the burden of continuing the Fable story. I loved seeing some of those references. I thought it was super smart to have the kid’s family turn to stone. I thought that was really smart. And so those were all the plus points.</em></p>



<p><strong>He did have a few nitpicks</strong>, though, specifically directed toward the game's supposed "cleanliness":</p>



<p><em>If I was critical, which I think you want me to be, there was a slight antiseptic feel about it. But I mean, they've got months and months to build in that character and almost that dirtiness that you want in the world. I never thought Fable as being clean and all the angles being sharp and defined. It's more chaotic. It's more what Old England probably used to be, which was not straight lines, the place, it's more crinkling, and all the buckle belts on people are ridiculously large, and the boots and the hands ridiculously large because that is part of the character. So there’s a little bit more of that character, which I would probably foolishly and ridiculously ask for.</em></p>



<p>That said, Molyneux confirmed <strong>he absolutely plans to play the game once it comes out</strong>, which is supposedly this Fall on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>



<p>First, the game designer will have to focus on his own new game, the "God game" <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/masters-of-albion-release-date-22-cans-peter-molyneux/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Masters of Albion</a></strong>, due to launch on Steam Early Access in late April. Molyneux called it <strong>the culmination of his life's work</strong>. The first gameplay trailer was released yesterday; you can find it below.</p>

<p>The <em>Gothic </em>remake was originally announced back in 2019 alongside a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/surprise-thq-nordic-releases-gothic-remake-prototype" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="f554aef5-6d1b-4d62-a48a-cb5b3f360c30" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">surprise release for a teaser version</a> of said remake, which publisher THQ Nordic released in order to gauge interest for a full-length version of the project.</p><p>Suffice it to say that interest was piqued, and development began in earnest <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-thq-nordic-studio-alkimia-interactive-to-develop-gothic-remake" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4a13632a-3f54-4724-af3d-e1887eb5c6c5" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">under developer Alkimia Interactive</a>, which is itself a subsidiary of THQ Nordic.</p><p>Piranha Bytes, the developer of the original <em>Gothic</em>, isn't involved in this project; indeed, the studio isn't involved in any projects at all, since it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/piranha-bytes-shut-down-report" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2b3d24ae-f166-4005-a78e-9753966f948f" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">shut down in mid-2024</a> following the release of its final RPG, <em>Elex 2</em>, in 2022.</p><p>Piranha Bytes' work on the franchise hasn't gone away, though; the original <em>Gothic </em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gothic-switch-port" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9e473693-38ae-482f-bb24-c789f308d39f" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">released for the Switch in 2023</a>, with the appropriately-named followup <em>Gothic 2 </em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gothic-ii-switch-port" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2beaa571-4297-4f94-81f4-79703ef18e30" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">getting a port for itself later that year</a>.</p>
<p>As for <em>Gothic 1 Remake </em>itself, it's more of a reimagined version of the original game than a straight one-to-one remake; this is more of a <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/final-fantasy-vii-remake" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a4e42e5a-dfe6-4ff1-8f4c-038c992edcea" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em></a><em> </em>situation than a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/super-mario-rpg-review-slightly-unbalanced-but-fun-romp" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="dbab7858-34dc-4ed1-a3cf-da929c9ba3b0" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Super Mario RPG </em>setup</a>.</p><p>You'll be able to see for yourself what THQ and Alkimia have done with the original when <em>Gothic 1 Remake </em>arrives on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1297900/Gothic_1_Remake/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/gothic-1-remake/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/gothic-1-remake/9nbrlcpw4zgv" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a> on June 5th.

            <title><![CDATA[You Can Get GTA 6 For Free, But You Need To Tick a HUGE Box First]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-for-free-but-huge-tick-box/</link>
            <guid>1433482</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Everyone is in eager anticipation of the impending release of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/grand-theft-auto-6/" id="36">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>. It will arguably be the biggest single-game release in history, shifting millions of copies in the first few hours alone, and it’s set to break the internet, render countless gamers incapable of working, and dominate social and streaming feeds for weeks to come.</p>



<p>In case you had concerns about <strong>buying </strong>Grand Theft Auto 6 later this year, there is a method you can use to get GTA 6 <strong>for free</strong>, but it involves one hell of a requirement.</p>



<p>You need to have a baby on November 19, 2026.</p>







<h2 id="h-it-s-not-a-joke-says-norwegian-firm">It’s Not a Joke, Says Norwegian Firm</h2>



<p>In Norway, an electronics firm named Komplett has kick-started a marketing campaign built around rewarding budding parents with a free copy of GTA 6.</p>



<p>If you conceive<strong> around now</strong>, you’ll likely be celebrating the birth of your child around the release date of Grand Theft Auto 6, which is set (at the moment) for November 19, 2026. If your baby is born <strong>on that day</strong>, Komplett will help you usher in your bouncing bundle of joy by giving you a free copy of GTA 6, arguably the most anticipated game ever made.</p>



<p>On the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1r20w92/a_norwegian_electronic_store_is_giving_away_gta_6/">‘Gaming’ subreddit</a>, one user posted an image of an advertisement spotted at a railway station in Norway. It was a shot of rose petals on a ruffled bed, with the caption:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>GTA 6 dropping in 9 months 😉</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Then, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DUngTvzDXsD/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an Instagram post</a> surfaced from the company, bearing the caption:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>this is actually not a joke, GTA 6 will be released in 9 months (🤞) and if you have a baby on the release date, you’ll get the game for free from us</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s a marketing stunt that could pay off in dividends for the firm, as every man and their dog wants to secure a copy of Grand Theft Auto 6, and what better way to do that than to get it <strong>for free</strong>? Coincidentally, GTA 6 will be released almost nine months to the day after Valentine’s Day.</p>



<p>What’s ironic is that you’ll most likely be knee-deep in diapers and formula, and will have much bigger concerns than scoping out the jiggle physics or the deepest secrets of Leonida in Grand Theft Auto 6.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">After years of wait and fan expectation, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> players will finally be able to capture Mewtwo once more — in just a few months. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The fan-favorite Legendary Pokémon was last available to battle in Pokémon Go all the way back in July 2022, though its Shadow form was available more recently — over a weekend in March 2024. Still, fans have been clamouring for another chance to add the creature to their Pokédex ever since — and now it's almost time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Further details for this summer's Go Fest celebrations have now been announced at a press event held in Tokyo, which will host one of three in-person meetups, ahead of the game's usual global Go Fest celebration. Artwork shown at the event confirms that Mewtwo will return — and hints at the debut of a Mythical Pokémon species, too.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/12/hofqczmawzig1-1770896578342.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Pokémon Go Fest 2026 artwork.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Artwork for the Tokyo event shows the usual array of Kanto species, as well as popular croc Sandile. Of most note, though, is the Mewtwo floating within the image — confirming its long-awaited return.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I can't say anything specific, but look forward to the Pokémon featured in the key visual," a spokesperson told Japanese Pokémon outlet <a href="https://x.com/rocketnews24go/status/2021811416643383764" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rocketnews24go</a>, via machine translation. "Especially Mewtwo — I think it'll be heart-pounding excitement for people who’ve been participating in GO Fest since the early days."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Will this finally be the moment Mewtwo's Mega Evolutions become available, after years of wait? Mega Mewtwo X and Y remain the only missing evolutions from the franchise's original batch of Mega Pokémon. Meanwhile, the game will soon be moving on to the release of Megas from Pokémon Legends: Z-A, with the arrival of Mega Malamar and Mega Victreebell later this month. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While Mewtwo is only shown here for Pokémon Go Fest's Tokyo event, artwork such as this usually shows species also available (to a greater or lesser extent) at the following global Go Fest — and it seems inconceivable that the creature would only be made available in a local version, when there has been such hype for its return generally. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The same is true of this year's Go Fest logo, which as ever features a subtle hint at the latest upcoming Mythical creature to become available. Looking at the mini blue lightning bolts on the 2026 design, Mythical Pokémon Zeraora seems a safe bet. The creature recently gained a new Mega Evolution, which would also make for a fitting release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This year is, of course, the 30th anniversary of Pokémon and the 10th anniversary of Pokémon Go — a pair of milestones that fans expect to be celebrated fully this summer. Word on what else is coming to the Pokémon franchise this year will follow shortly on Pokémon Day — February 27 — which is when it's expected that the series' 10th generation of games and creatures will be unveiled. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

Using resources and currency earned through exploration, players can expand the camp’s functionality and turn it into an important foothold in the players’ journey.</p><p>Within the camp, players can manage farms and ranch to produce cooking and crafting materials, purchase supplies from a camp vendor, and dispatch reunited companions on missions to acquire resources such as timber, ore, and more. These systems allow players to actively shape the camp’s growth. The preview also highlights character customization options. Players can customize the characters’ appearance using dyes found throughout Pywel or crafted through alchemy, adjusting outfits, hairstyles, and tattoos to match individual preferences.</p><!-- AD: content -->

These NPCs will react to player’s harmful actions, become hostile or issue bounties depending on behavior, bringing another element to interaction with NPCs within the world.

<p>At least 1,200 staff taking part</p>

<figure data-uuid="44d4e35de71ab"><a title="Ubisoft Logo" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/44d4e35de71ab/ubisoft-logo.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Late last month, Ubisoft announced a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/ubisoft-cancels-6-games-in-major-organisation-restructure">major organisational restructure</a> which saw, among many other things, several studio closures and six game cancellations. This week, in response to the changes, at least 1,200 Ubisoft workers have taken to the streets in a three-day international strike.</p>
<p>The strike began on 10th February and runs until today. Ubisoft Paris' Solidaires Informatique union representative, Marc Rutschlé, told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/at-least-1200-ubisoft-workers-strike-in-response-to-recent-restructuring">Gamesindustry.biz</a> that the strike mainly took place in Paris, though there has also been "additional activity" at Ubisoft Milan.</p>
<p>"At this stage, it seems clear to us that [Ubisoft CEO] Yves Guillemot has no knowledge or understanding of his company or its employees," Rutschlé told Gamesindustry, "The company is continuing its cost reduction and layoff plan."</p>
<p>Rutschlé said that the Ubisoft staff are "already working under pressure, often understaffed," with no meaningful pay rises in "several years". On top of this, Ubisoft has issued a return-to-office mandate to "boost the collective performance of AAA," which requires all staff to work five days a week from the Ubisoft offices — a policy that previously saw employees walk out on strike back in 2024.</p>
<p>The Solidaires Informatique union organised a smaller strike on 22nd January, the day after Ubisoft published its restructuring plan.</p>
<p>Today (12th Feb) marks the end of <em>this</em> strike, but it remains to be seen whether any further action will come in the future. Ubisoft itself will be sharing additional information on the restructure today, so we'll keep an eye out for any developments.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Team Vitality has stepped up ahead of the Esports World Cup and secured a crack squad in the Call of Duty: Warzone space. It’s yet another roster the organization is fielding, all with the intention of having the best chances possible of snatching the lion’s share of the Club Championship prize.</p>



<p>The trio signed by Team Vitality features Sage, blazt, and skullface, all of whom have secured accolades aplenty in the Call of Duty: Warzone space and are ready for their next challenge under the Vitality banner.</p>







<h2 id="h-vitality-picks-up-killer-warzone-team-for-ewc">Vitality Picks Up Killer Warzone Team for EWC</h2>



<p>Leading the Team Vitality squad into the fray at the Esports World Cup this summer will be Ethan ‘Ebatez’ Bates, a former 100 Thieves coach with skin in the game. The championship-grade roster should have no issues competing on the grandest stage in esports in Riyadh this summer.</p>



<p>Sage was previously signed with Virtus and finished in <strong>third place </strong>at last year’s Esports World Cup. He also had a close finish at the 2024 Global Finals of the World Series of Warzone, but <strong>won </strong>the 2023 Global Finals, alongside Shifty and Biffle.</p>



<p>Blazt, one of the most recognizable names in Call of Duty, has been around the houses over the last decade. His path has taken him under the banners of compLexity, G2 Esports, the Los Angeles Guerrillas, 100 Thieves, and now, Team Vitality. He’ll be looking to redeem a fourth-place finish at last year’s Esports World Cup.</p>



<p>Skullface is arguably entering the pack with something major to prove. It has been a while since his last big win, but he came <strong>second </strong>at the 2024 World Series of Warzone after clutching up and securing the top spot in 2022’s tournament.</p>



<p>On paper, it’s a pretty good squad, and every player there has <strong>years </strong>of Warzone experience to pull from.</p>

		<p>MercurySteam has revealed that the Blades of Fire Epic Games Store exclusivity on PC will expire in May, with the game coming to Steam on May 14th, approximately a year after the game was released for PS5, Xbox Series XS, and PC via Epic Games Store. Alongside the Steam release, Blades of Fire will also get its 2.0 update which will bring a number of additions and improvements to the game. You can grab the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2091020/Blades_of_Fire/">Blades of Fire demo on Steam</a>, with progress carrying over to the full game.</p>

<p>The Blades of Fire 2.0 update will include:</p>
<p><strong>New Contents</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>New Game Plus</li>

</ul>
<p>There will also be an Adventurer’s pack included with the Steam version, though owners of Blades of Fire who have the game through Epic Game Store or on console will have to pay for that separately. In our Blades of Fire review, I said, <em>“Blades of Fire is a very good game, blending tough action RPG combat with a fun and unique weapon forging. The story is a little by the numbers and exploration does have a lot of back and forth, but the different regions and enemies look great and the narrative is elevated by Aran and Adso’s relationship.”</em></p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/i-hate-this-place</link>
            <guid>1433422</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="I Hate This Place Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161931/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>The way I see it, there are three different versions of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/i_hate_this_place">I Hate This Place</a>. First, there’s the game as promised <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKD83Z1RbR0">in the trailers</a>: a survival horror with some general emphasis on resource management and gunplay, all elevated with some nice-looking cinematic storytelling.</p>
<p>Sweeping cameras slowly reveal the ominous presence of creepily deformed lab creatures. Moody pans pass over entrail-covered woodlands. And emotive close-ups show dramatic angles of the lead character, Elena, as she searches for her friend, Lou, who went missing in the opening. It’s all very appealing. Throw in a high-end voice-over and some occasional '80s synths, and you’d be forgiven for thinking I Hate This Place was going to knock your <strong>Stranger Things</strong> socks off.</p>
<p>But the truth is the trailers are pretty damningly misleading, and not a second of that narrative flair has made it into the game. Instead, the story is told via some fixed-camera early-'00s-era cutscenes that brought back memories of a simpler time in gaming.</p>
<figure><a title="I Hate This Place Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161926/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>I say all of this because I Hate This Place comes with a fairly hefty price tag ($29.99 USD / £26.49), and I feel it’s important to give realistic expectations. If you were to compare the game to the trailer, what you’d see is more of an echo, a ghostly shimmer of what was being promised elsewhere.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t make I Hate This Place <em>bad</em>.</p>
<p>As for versions two and three, well, the difference here belongs to that familiar old story – the late-night campfire tales of underpowered hardware struggling to run contemporary, seemingly demanding games. This here is a Switch ‘1’ game – and more often than not, it shows.</p>
<p>In fact, when I looked at some videos for other systems, I realised just <em>how much</em> I Hate This Place was suffering on the Switch. On more powerful hardware, the game looks pretty great. Elena’s torch casts accurate shadows from the legs of giant spiders. The shine of the spectral underworlds you visit to solve the mysterious origin stories of a number of ghosts looks great and suitably otherworldly and strange.</p>
<figure><a title="I Hate This Place Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161933/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>On Switch, however, I was often distracted by visual ticks during my six-hour playthrough. Elena’s shoes sometimes clipped through textures on the floor. Cutscenes suddenly jumped back to earlier moments in the story – or ended inexplicably short. Often, ghosts disappeared instantly as if someone had forgotten to add an effect.</p>
<p>I could go on complaining, but here’s the twist: despite the lack of finesse, I had a pretty good time. For me, too many of the big releases of the last year have felt as if they were going through the motions – but with I Hate This Place, I at least felt as if developers Rock Square Thunder were reaching for the sky.</p>
<p>The core gameplay — the twin-stick shooting and combat — won me over quickly. Sneaking around, creeping past monsters, and crafting new weapons and bombs to deal with any that got too close was fun. I soon found an enjoyable balance between being cautious and gung-ho. I enjoyed throwing Molotov cocktails at mutated creatures, watching them burn, and then picking them off with a few rounds of my newly crafted rifle.</p>
<figure><a title="I Hate This Place Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161928/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Whether exploring swamps or mines, the challenge felt well judged, and each section lasted just long enough. The story — loosely based on a comic series about a haunted ranch and its surrounding wilderness — does a lot of heavy lifting. It grabbed my attention early on and showed enough creativity to win me over some more.</p>
<p>Less positively, though, in larger areas the performance often fell apart, dropping to a hauntingly low couple of frames per second. Some players will find this unforgivable, but for those like me who spent the best part of the last 10 years playing compromised ports, I coped with these moments well enough. Maybe that’s a testament again to the fun gameplay.</p>
<p>The last misleading element of the trailer concerns the crafting and the building. I’ve read some takes in the last few days that painted these crafting elements as more than they are, because in truth they’re very underdeveloped – seemingly remnants of ideas that had to be canned or simplified for whatever reason. For me, crafting more bullets, upgrading a weapon or two, and keeping bandages stocked was all I ever needed, and as someone not that bothered by exhaustive resource management, I was okay with that.</p>
<figure><a title="I Hate This Place Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161927/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Ultimately, I can’t give I Hate This Place a higher score than the one below. The technical issues and a lack of finesse haunt almost every nook and cranny of its game world. But I also want to stress again that it’s often very fun, too. It’s not one I’d recommend full price on Switch, but if you can tolerate uneven performance and you enjoy scrappy, experimental survival shooters, there’s something here worth playing.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I Hate This Place is a game that oversells itself in the trailer and undershoots on the Switch, but still manages to be very enjoyable. The performance issues, visual compromises, and pared‑back crafting leave their mark on much of the experience, yet the core loop of sneaking, crafting, and blasting through strange supernatural threats has enough bite to carry it.</p>
<p>When the action flows, it’s easy to see what the developers were aiming for. It just depends on whether you’re willing to look past the rough edges to enjoy what <em>does</em> work.</p></section>

            <title><![CDATA[Crisol: Theater of Idols Is A Tremendously Spanish Affair, and A Halfway Decent Survival Horror Game]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/crisol-theater-idols-review-steam-horror-shooter-spanish-2000667876</link>
            <guid>1433419</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Crisol: Theater of Idols</span></i><span>‘ richly illustrated world</span> <span>is deeply familiar to me. Maybe there’s a certain segment of players who’ll play it and note the same parallels I couldn’t help but draw. Though it bears a lot in common with a number of legendary games, like </span><i><span>Resident Evil</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Bioshock</span></i><span>, this survival-horror title, which takes just as many cues from Spanish culture and folklore as it does from those legendary games, feels most in conversation with something entirely different: it reminds me a lot of the telenovelas I grew up watching on Univision.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Latine households have a few common staples. Adobo seasoning in our pantries. Daily variants of </span><i><span>arroz con habichuelas</span></i><span> with your protein of choice. A Bible of some sort, a crucifix, or related Christian imagery on the walls. Maybe a sticker that reads, “</span><i><span>Dios es amor.”</span></i><span> And, of course, a constant rotation of </span><i><span>novellas </span></i><span>in the evenings.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Novellas </span></i><span>are the height of drama and camp. There is a twist around every corner, and you’ll never miss it because these cheaply produced series will reuse the same loud sound effect to denote every dramatic development in the story. Think the </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oc7Cin_87H4"><span>Vine “boom,”</span></a><span> but every 15 minutes (charitably). Like any good soap opera, they’re often packed with too many characters to count, let alone recall at the drop of a hat. Depending on the genre–</span><i><span>novellas</span></i><span> can follow teenagers who </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVagT0B3cos&amp;list=RDvVagT0B3cos&amp;start_radio=1"><span>break into songs</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZc97aIDTUE&amp;list=PLlpTGFsKPu1k2_4mKo6Ou9iP9H6eNjRL-"><span>drug lords rising through the ranks</span></a><span>, and everything in between–these characters are usually tried-and-true archetypes, like the stumbling nerd or the doggedly loyal cadet/soldier/cop. And if there’s one thing these </span><i><span>novella </span></i><span>actors are gonna do, it’s ham things up.&nbsp;</span></p>  <p><span>These programs, which have often enraptured the elders of my life, promised big performances, and it seemed like every other show my mother watched during these primetime slots featured booming voices, grand gestures, and </span><a href="http://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/tv/news/a31651/10-best-novelas-of-all-time/"><span>more lies and betrayals</span></a><span> than one should be able to feasibly fit into a half-hour block. These shows and performances often oscillated between scintillating and corny, never anywhere in between.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>I need you all to understand this, because I couldn’t shake the feeling while playing </span><i><span>Crisol </span></i><span>that I was caught in a fever dream of a </span><i><span>novella</span></i><span>. </span><i><span>Crisol </span></i><span>is a halfway decent survival horror title with some great creature design, but what it really is underneath all that is a good ol’ Spanish soap. One with plenty of dramatic twists, a few too many characters, and some of the most hammed-up performances a game has ever shipped with. I love its deeply Spanish, deeply flawed heart.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Crisol</span></i><span>, from the Madrid-based developer Vermila Studio,</span> <span>is a tragedy told in a handful of chapters. Each of them takes Gabriel, the game’s zealous protagonist and aforementioned loyal soldier archetype, to a corner of Tormentosa, an island and colony caught in a torrential downpour. It is also caught in a religious civil war by the time that Gabriel washes up on its shores. It’s a conflict that calls for Gabriel to battle the forces of the sea god with weapons blessed (maybe even cursed, actually) by the sun god and which use his own blood as ammunition.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000667878" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000667878"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000667878">Vermila Studios</figcaption></figure> <p><span>I enjoyed this aspect of </span><i><span>Crisol</span></i><span>, though I wouldn’t call it my favorite part of the equation. I dig the metaphor, which calls into question the sacrifices that organized religion typically demands, especially of its most ardent followers. How much is Gabriel willing to bleed to see his god back in power? What actions is he willing to take, regardless of his own moral standing, to see his will done? These are questions that are blunted by the kind of game </span><i><span>Crisol </span></i><span>is–you can’t opt out of combat here–and the answer to both proves to be: </span><i><span>a lot</span></i><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>Each of Gabriel’s weapons is, both literally and metaphorically, blood-starved, and he is plenty happy to give them everything for his cause. It is always just a smidge spine-chilling to hear or see the spikes that pierce Gabriel and drain him, as well as literally just see his blood in the cartridge of his weaponry. His opponents are similarly visually arresting. Wooden statues derived from Catholic imagery (the religion is never name-dropped but sure is heavily alluded to) lumber through the streets waiting to be carefully dismembered by precise shots of your pistol or rifle, but I could often fall back on a shotgun to blast these things to splinters and assure they’d stay down. Eventually, these enemies grow to encompass other bits of religious imagery and architecture as you encounter towering golems lined with stone faces and monstrosities born from stained glass.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Regrettably, though, </span><i><span>Crisol</span></i><span>‘s combat is just fine. Shots land with a satisfying heft and it’s awesome to occasionally take out a leg or a knife-wielding arm and buy yourself a few seconds to consider your next move. Beyond this, though, enemies require very little thought, especially after you’ve netted a few upgrades, and the overwhelming amount of healing afforded to you on a normal playthrough chafes against and neuters the sacrificial effect of the central blood mechanic. I quickly became numb to the notion of refilling my weapons and depleting my HP because I was either flush with syringes, or knew that the game was hiding some form of healing right around the corner.&nbsp;</span></p>  <p><span>Here, the game dovetails back into the campy territory of those previously mentioned </span><i><span>novellas. </span></i><span>Remember that Vine boom I referenced earlier, and the repeated deployment of a dramatic audio cue? </span><i><span>Crisol </span></i><span>has its own “haunting” series of sounds it will frequently play, only these sounds are triggered by the act of draining dead carcasses, often of animals, for blood/ammo. Tormentosa’s streets are littered with the cadavers of chickens that can be drained of their blood…only </span><i><span>Crisol </span></i><span>takes this opportunity to then play a hilariously faint cuckoo, which happens </span><i><span>every time </span></i><span>you drain the blood from the poor birds. A dead pig will squeal. A horse-like beast might bray. Though I can’t speak to the intention, it definitely comes across as a comic beat rather than a dramatic one.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Crisol </span></i><span>occasionally blurs this line between corny melodrama and unintentional comedy to mixed results. While Gabriel is straight-laced and bottoned-up, he eventually gains an ally, called Mediodia, who provides exposition and comic relief in equal measure. The performance here (especially in the native Castellano Spanish, which </span><i><span>should </span></i><span>be the default voice track of the game) and her back-and-forth with Gabriel makes her come across as a goblin-like, torturous little sister. It’s disarming hearing them banter moments after a new development in the story or tense encounter against </span><i><span>Crisol</span></i><span>‘s enemies, but such is the dramatic range of a typical </span><i><span>novella </span></i><span>chapter, which might follow up a subplot about infidelity or grief with a recurring sight gag or a detour into a humorous B-plotline. It is about as novel as it is jarring.</span></p> <p><span>Consider, then, how it comes across when these moments of camp and levity, intended or not, smash up against </span><i><span>Crisol</span></i><span>‘s main plotline, in which one religious sect has violently persecuted another and you are attempting to overthrow a god with a blood-tinged armory, all the while unraveling the conflict that has plagued Tormentosa, recounted through flashbacks–which play out as vignettes with faceless, sanguine red silhouettes– illustrating the island’s violent and dramatic implosion.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000667877" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000667877"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000667877">Vermila Studios</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Lest you think I find all of its </span><i><span>novella </span></i><span>qualities grating or otherwise dubious, I do think that </span><i><span>Crisol</span></i><span>‘s penchant for drama brings out the best in its performers. It is rare to hear an entire cast of Spanish speakers in a game where that audio track is not just a haphazardly produced dub. Here are performances built upon the strength of our language, given by actors with the ability to properly enrich the words on the page with texture and specificity. It is even more thrilling to have them unreservedly go for it. The voice actress for Dolores, a particularly menacing foe who stalks Gabriel throughout the game, is a standout “big” performance, but many others fare pretty well here too, including the protagonist’s VA. Arroyo, one of the game’s more obvious baddies, and even the sun god have incredible presences, even if they are heard more than they are seen.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Not every performance is as stunning though, and quite a number of them get lost in the shuffle. </span><i><span>Crisol</span></i><span>‘s acts are dense with their own ensembles, and characters within them are usually working against one another. In the seemingly unending deluge of conflicts on Tormentosa, some more complex than others, it can be a little harder than usual to nail down motivations and characters worth rooting for, or even simply tracking throughout the narrative. I typically felt adrift in </span><i><span>Crisol</span></i><span>‘s smaller stories, only to be reeled back in when the narrative shined a light on one of its grander performers and more dramatic material.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>In a word, </span><i><span>Crisol </span></i><span>is uneven, and that’s the most </span><i><span>novella</span></i><span>-ass thing about it. See, the thing about </span><i><span>novellas </span></i><span>is that though they attempt it all–comedy, melodrama, camp, action, steamy romance, and thrills of all sorts–they also kind of fizzle out by their end. The balancing act is tough to maintain so consistently. </span><i><span>Crisol</span></i><span>‘s ambitions seem to lie all over the place, but despite that, it still brings out top-notch performances. I was hooked on its drama plenty enough to blast through Tormentosa’s clubs, caverns, and cathedrals. And it is a competent enough survival-horror title to thrill and occasionally provide a good scare along the way, even if it feels at times like its action and horror is pulling its punches. But for all its missteps, I couldn’t help but love </span><i><span>Crisol</span></i><span>‘s authentically Spanish heart, and I can’t help but desire more of it. From </span><i><span>Crisol </span></i><span>and from games at large.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2 id="h-about-gothic-1-remake">About Gothic 1 Remake</h2>



<p>In an effort to find magic ore to strengthen their defenses, the king of the Kingdom of Myrtana ordered prisoners to work in the Khorinis mines. To ensure that no one could escape, he erected a magical barrier around the mines. However, something went wrong, trapping everyone inside and turning the mines into a lawless land.</p>



<p>The Gothic 1 Remake is an open-world RPG set in a distinct colony. The developers have rebuilt the game from the ground up while maintaining the original experience’s unique sense of unrestricted exploration and rewarding progression. The remake enhances the original by introducing more detailed questlines, improved NPC routines and interactions, new traversal abilities, and a fully modernized combat system.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Lego's new Pokémon sets are right around the corner, launching on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>, A.K.A. Pokémon Day.</p>
<p>If you're a little unsure as to whether these sets are right for you, Lego reviewer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TiagoCatarino">Tiago Catarino</a> has recently got his hands on every available product, including Eevee, Pikachu, and Charizard/Venusaur/Blastoise.</p>
<p>If that's not enough, we also get a good look at the pre-order bonus Kanto Badge set, and the Lego Insiders Mini Pokémon Center set. There are other videos available online for each individual set, but this is one gives us a glimpse at all of them in one go – nice.</p>
<p>It's a pretty decent showcase of the new sets, overall. For example, we're pretty confident that the <a href="https://redirect.viglink.com/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-gb%2Fproduct%2Fpikachu-and-poke-ball-72152&amp;key=ae68f205e9e6fcdefa7db1ab4f93a912" rel="sponsored noopener">PIkachu</a> set (£179.99 / $199.99) just isn't for us – it just looks a bit weird, don't you think? <a href="https://redirect.viglink.com/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-gb%2Fproduct%2Fvenusaur-charizard-and-blastoise-72153&amp;key=ae68f205e9e6fcdefa7db1ab4f93a912" rel="sponsored noopener">The Starter Evolutions</a> looks pretty incredible, but you'd expect that for the ludicrous price of £579.99 / $649.99, right?</p>
<p><a href="https://redirect.viglink.com/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-gb%2Fproduct%2Feevee-72151&amp;key=ae68f205e9e6fcdefa7db1ab4f93a912" rel="sponsored noopener">Eevee</a> looks okay though, and at £54.99 / $59.99, it's definitely on the more affordable end of the scale. Though to be honest, referring to any Lego set as "affordable" is probably a bit of a stretch these days.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, you can also pre-order the new <a href="https://redirect.viglink.com/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-gb%2Fproduct%2Focarina-of-time-the-final-battle-77093&amp;key=ae68f205e9e6fcdefa7db1ab4f93a912" rel="sponsored noopener">Ocarina of Time - The Final Battle</a> set right now for £99.99. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/video-get-a-closer-look-at-legos-new-zelda-ocarina-of-time-set-in-this-first-review">Tiago Catarino also got his hands on this set recently</a>, and we have to admit, it looks pretty sweet.</p>

			<p>While <strong>CAPCOM's</strong> <strong>RE Engine</strong> gathered a controversial reputation in the past few years due to the spotty performance of <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/"><strong>Monster Hunter Wilds</strong></a></em> and <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragons-dogma-2-review-more-like-one-and-a-half/"><strong>Dragon's Dogma 2</strong></a></em>, the game engine fares significantly better in more linear games. Among the games that does not suffer from any major performance issues caused by the engine itself is the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-4/"><strong><em>Resident Evil 4</em> remake</strong></a>, but a <strong>recent update</strong> to the PC version has essentially put the game in a <strong>worse condition than it was at launch</strong>.</p>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"Updating years old software with new DRM is stupid,"</em> noted <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Digital Foundry’s</strong> Alex Battaglia. The tech expert's analysis confirms that on a Ryzen 5 3600/RTX 4070 Super build, the introduction of the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Enigma Protector DRM</strong> has gutted <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">CPU game throughput by 40%</strong>. While the gap shrinks to 20% in the <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Village</em> fight due to the AI powering the enemies, which introduces a different bottleneck, the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">impact remains constant</strong> in other scenarios.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>This isn't an isolated incident for the Japanese publisher. <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">C</strong>APCOM has recently made similar moves with <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Resident Evil Revelations</em> and <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Resident Evil 5</em>, sparking a wave of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">anti-consumer backlash</strong> across the community. As YouTube user @chemeergency put it: <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"Retroactively implementing new DRM over old DRM is insanely anticonsumer."</em> And it's not doing the publisher any favors, either, as some may be more inclined to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">go with the pirated version</strong> for better performance.</p>



<p>With <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-gamescom-hands-on-preview-turn-on-the-lights/"><strong>Resident Evil Requiem</strong></a></em> on the horizon, some may wonder if the latest entry will be similarly impacted. However, the game is <strong>confirmed to use Denuvo on PC</strong>, complete with the standard five-activation limit. While <strong>Denuvo</strong> has its own issues, its <strong>impact on performance is lighter</strong> than <em>Enigma Protector</em>. Hopefully, <strong>CAPCOM</strong> will realize that protecting three-year-old games at the cost of the player experience is a losing battle by the time the <strong>ninth entry</strong> in the series requires a DRM update.</p>

<p>A new earnings release reveals that ARC Raiders has sold 14 million units and has brought in close to 6 million weekly active users. </p>



<p>We all know ARC Raiders had a sensational launch, becoming one of the most popular extraction shooters of 2025.

            <title><![CDATA[Reanimal Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/12/reanimal-review/</link>
            <guid>1433380</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Let’s address the elephant in the room first: Tarsier Studios created two exceptional <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/little-nightmares">Little Nightmares</a> games, but not the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/08/little-nightmares-3-review/">third instalment</a> in the series, which was handed to Supermassive Games. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/reanimal">Reanimal</a> is, quite clearly, Tarsier’s vision for Little Nightmares 3 and a darker breed of horror.</p>
<p><iframe title="REANIMAL | Pre-Order Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bpi4lx9Lsl4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Little Nightmares games were, true to their name, little nightmares — unsettling, occasionally grotesque, yet reminiscent of Brothers Grimm fairy tales, where children are shoved into ovens. Reanimal, despite its visual similarities, is a different beast entirely. Its atmosphere is far more oppressive, leaning heavily into visceral body horror. Deformed giants convulse and contort into scuttling crab-like creatures that snap the necks of the protagonists. Boneless corpses hang from trees, slithering down trunks and pursuing you like filthy, limp serpents.&nbsp; It is unrelentingly unsettling.</p>


<p>The game follows a brother and sister navigating a nightmarish island they once called home, attempting to rescue their friends from the twisted horrors stalking the shadows. The tone is established immediately: the brother steers a rickety boat through thick fog in search of his sister. Her lifeless body is discovered floating in the sea as distant bells toll ominously. It takes agonising moments to revive her; she splutters seawater and whispers faintly as consciousness slowly returns. It is a bleak and unforgettable opening.</p>


<p>The boat itself becomes integral to the experience, as Reanimal presents a much broader world with light open-world elements. Subtle visual and audio cues gently propel you towards the next objective, yet there are ample opportunities to wander off in search of collectables — though you are arguably more likely to stumble upon something horrific that will end your journey abruptly. This expanded scale allows Tarsier to fully embrace a more cinematic presentation. The camera pans and swoops dynamically as you traverse the island, zooming out to emphasise scale and zooming in for intimate moments. It is, paradoxically, quite beautiful for a game so saturated with decay and death.</p>
<p>Exploration is central to progression. Locked doors require keys and grotesque whale-serpents demand eyeballs, the usual necessities in such a world. Stealth and chase sequences will feel familiar to Little Nightmares veterans, and the puzzles are generally logical, with one notable exception that left me utterly flummoxed. I ultimately brute-forced my way through by attempting nearly all sixty-four possible switch combinations.</p>

<p>Comparisons with Little Nightmares are clearly inevitable, but two other titles came to mind as I wandered through this macabre landscape. Early in the game, you arrive at an abandoned town whose visual storytelling and sound design evoke the oppressive atmosphere of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/silent-hill">Silent Hill</a>. There is a constant sense that something lurks just beyond sight. It is not traditional fear that defines these moments, but suffocating dread — the lingering weight of catastrophe embedded in every building, open book, and broken shopfront.</p>
<p>The second game it brought to mind was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a>, and not merely because of a shoreline strewn with whale carcasses. Reanimal ventures into deeply unexpected territory, both physically and psychologically. It is the first game since Kojima’s masterpiece that compelled me to set down the controller and step away, needing a moment to process what I had just experienced. Let me be absolutely clear: Reanimal is absolutely not for children, some scenes are truly disturbing.</p>
<p>Tarsier also deserves praise for crafting a horror experience that largely sidesteps genre clichés. There are no possessed dolls, no crackling televisions broadcasting cryptic images, and almost no jump scares. Instead, the game offers Lynchian body horror infused with British folk sensibilities and fragments of childhood anxieties. As kids, many of us were warned about strange men offering sweets from a van, and that horrific scenario is played out in Reanimal.</p>

<p>At roughly eight hours in length, the game feels perfectly paced — long enough to tell its story without overstaying its welcome. New gameplay elements, including light combat, are introduced gradually. The game can be played solo with an AI companion, in local co-op, or online. Having experienced both solo and local co-op modes, I can confirm that the AI partner performs admirably, illuminating dark paths when needed and responding reliably to player commands.</p>
<p data-start="4587" data-end="5046">My only minor criticism is structural familiarity. Much like Little Nightmares I and II, the game follows a largely episodic format. Each area introduces a looming antagonist glimpsed fleetingly in the background, followed by escalating encounters and chase sequences before their eventual defeat. While Reanimal introduces new mechanics like driving and scuba diving, the overarching rhythm may feel somewhat predictable to returning players.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Just a fortnight after the launch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/highguard">Highguard</a>, developer Wildlight has laid off the majority of the studio’s employees.</p>
<p>In a statement sent to press, Wildlight confirmed the layoffs:</p>


<p><em>Today we made an incredibly difficult decision to part ways with a number of our team members while keeping a core group of developers to continue innovating on and supporting the game.</em></p>
<p><em>We’re proud of the team, talent, and the product we’ve created together. We’re also grateful for players who gave the game a shot, and those who continue to be a part of our community.</em></p>
<p>Prior to this, Level Designer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/alex-graner-a37262114_alex-graners-resume-activity-7427480816940892161-hmDh">Alex Graner</a> took to LinkedIn to start their search for new employment, saying, “Unfortunately, along with most of the team at Wildlight, I was laid off today.” However, it sounds like there is still content that can still be released through the coming weeks and months. Graner continued, “This one really stings as there was a lot of unreleased content I was really looking forward to that I and others designed for Highguard.”</p>

<p>Tech Artist <a href="https://xcancel.com/Joshiepoo25/status/2021732021127852097">Josh Sobel</a> was also affected, taking to social media to say, “It was the best team I’ve ever worked with, and I’ve never put so much of myself into a project before.” They added, “I don’t think gamers really understand just how special this group of talented devs was. There were stumbles, as any new team would face, but our ability to execute on goals and pivot at a moment’s notice was unmatched. I am devastated that this team as a complete unit can no longer be.”</p>
<p>Highguard seemingly always had a major uphill battle to survive in a brutal gaming environment. Any kind of PvP live service shooter has to compete with the likes of Fortnite, Call of Duty, Apex Legends and beyond, and while something like Arc Raiders has shown that you can still muscle your way into finding an audience, this feels like the exception to the rule at the moment. Riot Games just launched fighting game 2XKO in January and has <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/10/2xko-development-team-reduced-a-few-weeks-after-its-full-launch/">also almost immediately pared back the team and made layoffs</a>.</p>
<p>While Wildlight had the huge opportunity of revealing the game at The Game Awards, this massively backfired for the studio. The game was featured as the final announcement of the show, reportedly as a favour from Geoff Keighley who simply liked the game and the studio (which was founded by former Respawn developers). The game was quickly branded as being a “Concord 2” and clearly had convincing to do, but then pretty much every online game gets that label a moment. Unfortunately, the gameplay reveal trailer and deep dive didn’t really manage to turn perceptions around.</p>
<p>Launching on 26th January, Highguard saw 97,000 players try the game out on Steam, per <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/4128260/charts/">SteamDB</a>, but within days that had dropped to around 10,000 and has now had daily peaks closer to 4,000. Obviously this is just a snapshot of the PC audience and it could be larger on console, but it’s indicative of the game’s slide. Within that time, the studio had tried to quickly react to add things like 5v5 play alongside the 3v3 from launch, and shared <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/highguard-just-launched-but-it-already-has-a-2026-roadmap/1100-6537653/">a 2026 roadmap</a>, but it hasn’t been enough.</p>
<p>For what it’s worth, we enjoyed our first look at Highguard. Dom said, “Highguard’s first steps into the PvP arena are confident and unashamed, despite what the angry voices on the internet might tell you. The slightly odd mix of Apex Legends, Rainbow Six and He-Man actually makes for a good time, and there’s so much room for more to happen here. That will take time, and I hope that it finds the audience it needs to thrive.”</p>

<p>Announce the game, already!</p>

<figure data-uuid="7d3a145cddbe0"><a title="Black Flag" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7d3a145cddbe0/black-flag.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Ubisoft</em></figcaption></figure><p>A curious new listing for an <strong>Assassin's Creed Black Flag Remaster art book</strong> has appeared on <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1835417701?tag=nlife-21&amp;ascsubtag=nlife-21" rel="sponsored noopener">Amazon UK</a> in what may be the clearest indication yet that Ubisoft is gearing up to release an updated version of its swashbuckling classic.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-black-flag-remaster-art-book-appears-at-amazon-now-up-for-preorder">IGN</a>, the listing states that the book is scheduled for launch on <strong>24th March 2026</strong> and is being published by Titan. Its price is currently £29.95, a 25% reduction on its £39.99 RRP. There are few additional details at this stage, and even the use of the word 'Remaster' is seemingly at odds with the '<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced">Resynced</a>' moniker we've been hearing for a while now.</p>
<p>Still, this definitely seems to be a thing, and is yet another indication that a reveal may be imminent... sort of. A lot of things are up in the air at the moment since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/ubisoft-cancels-6-games-in-major-organisation-restructure">Ubisoft announced major restructuring</a> at the company. Seven games currently in development have been delayed, so it's unclear if Resynced is included in the lineup.</p>
<p>We should hear more from Ubisoft later today regarding its plans when it releases its Q3 financial report, so we'll be sure to update you on that as soon as we can.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Black Flag Resynced has already been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-has-been-rated-by-pegi">rated by PEGI</a>, while its main star, actor Matt Ryan, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/assassins-creed-4-black-flag-actor-drops-the-biggest-remake-hint-yet">dropped a major hint</a> while speaking with a fan, stating "you may have to beat it again".</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Final Crimson Desert Overview Video Focuses on the Game’s Non-Combat Activities]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/final-crimson-desert-overview-focuses-non-combat-activities/</link>
            <guid>1433371</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Today, South Korean developer <strong>Pearl Abyss</strong> has released the third and final <strong>Crimson Desert</strong> overview video. While the previous overviews were focused on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/from-medieval-combat-to-combat-mechs-new-crimson-desert-gameplay-overview-highlights-the-story-pywel-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">story</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-second-features-overview-combat-depth-progression/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">combat</a>, this time the footage puts the spotlight on the game's non-combat activities.</p>



<p>The heart of the player's journey in Crimson Desert will be <strong>in the Greymane Camp</strong>. After losing their homeland, Paelun, to the Black Bears, the faction established this stretch of land in Hernand as their new base of operations.</p>



<p>Although the camp has humble beginnings, owing to the ragged state of the Greymane band at the beginning of the game, it is designed to evolve. <strong>Players can invest the funds and resources they gather on their travels to upgrade the camp's facilities over time</strong>. It is not just a resting point, either, but also a survival hub. Players can cook meals to maintain health, purchase provisions, and engage in farming and ranching to produce essential resources when the wilds of Pywel are unable to provide them. Cooking was also presented in the video as an essential activity rather than a sideline: <strong>hearty meals cooked at the bonfire provide crucial health, spirit, and stamina buffs</strong>.</p>



<p>Perhaps most intriguing of all is the Companion System. As the camp grows, scattered Greymanes (some actively recruited by the players, others arriving on their own) will join to regroup. <strong>These are not static NPCs, according to the developers; they can be assigned roles or deployed on missions across the continent</strong>. Whether gathering wood and ore or thinning enemy ranks in distant, blockaded regions, <strong>these companions actively contribute to the war effort</strong>, even when the player character is miles away.</p>



<p>The villages and cities of Pywel teem with activity. As well as the usual blacksmiths forging weapons and tailors outfitting players for their travels, these hubs offer a glimpse into the region's daily life. <strong>Residents will offer commissions ranging from delivering goods and tracking missing persons to providing protection against bandits</strong>.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Crimson Desert Features Overview #3: Life in Pywel" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1ATPfgrNZos?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>We also learn from the overview video that <strong>Crimson Desert features a robust crime system</strong>. Harmful actions against innocents can turn both residents and guards hostile, so layers who choose the life of an outlaw may find themselves forced to fight their way out of towns, pay hefty fines, or even serve time in jail.</p>



<p>We're now exactly one month and one week away from the <strong>March 19</strong> release date. If you're a PC user and are looking to purchase new AMD hardware imminently, you can take advantage of the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-amd-game-bundle-announced-free-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crimson Desert AMD Game Bundle</a></strong>, available at select retailers <strong>through April 25</strong>.</p>

<p>Contexto is a word association game that gives you a new word to guess every single day. With every attempt, the AI algorithm determines how close your guess is to the daily answer based on thematic and contextual similarity.</p>



<p>Sometimes, though, no matter how experienced you are, the word you’re looking for can be incredibly vague and hard to deduce. Luckily for you, this guide is full of hints to give you a helping hand, but make sure you give today’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwipr4zrptGSAxWdREEAHYkSF0kQFnoECAwQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcontexto.me%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw21MfS02qcTAe3-U9GeyYlh&amp;opi=89978449" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Contexto</a>&nbsp;a go if you haven’t already!</p>

<figure><figcaption>Time to guess. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Contexto is incredibly simple to play, but difficult to master. All you have to do is type words into the search bar, and the AI algorithm will tell you how close your word is to the answer.</strong></p>



<p>You’ll know how close your guess is based on the colour of the bar and the number next to it.</p>



<ul>
<li>Red includes guesses with the number 1,501 and above, meaning you’re way off from the secret word.</li>



<li>Orange includes guesses between 301 and 1,500, meaning you’re getting closer, but still some ways off.</li>



<li>Green includes guesses between 1 and 300, meaning you’re on the right track.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-contexto-tips-amp-tricks">Best Contexto Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>



<ul>
<li>Start off using broad terms, then narrow down once you’ve got under the 1,000 mark.</li>



<li>Try using Nouns first, and dip into verbs or adjectives once you’ve discovered the context.</li>



<li>Experiment with random words at times, especially as different forms of a root word can rank differently, such as work and worker.</li>



<li>Guess away, as unlike other word games like Wordle, you aren’t limited to a strict number of attempts.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-starting-words-for-contexto">Best Starting Words For Contexto</h2>

<p>Quordle takes the complexity of the original daily word game and ups the ante by having you solve four solutions at once. Your 100% attention suddenly needs to be diverted four ways, and completing the daily Quordle is a tough proposition, no matter how experienced you are. The February 12, 2026, Quordle has four new words for you to find, and this guide has hints and a helping hand to have you be four for four.</p>



<p>Before the information comes thick and fast at you, make sure you give today’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/quordle/" id="3574" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Quordle</a> a go if you haven’t already!</p>

<figure><figcaption>Rest assured, they will be tested. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Quordle is different from other daily word games as it requires you to correctly work out four words at once, and you can attempt this through the official Quordle website.</strong></p>



<p>Before anything else, check out this set of instructions on finding and playing Quordle:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://beta.quordle.com/#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Quordle</a> website.</li>



<li>You should be presented with four equal boxes reminiscent of a Wordle setup.</li>



<li>Enter your first guess using the keyboard input at the bottom of the screen.</li>



<li>The game will fill out the first of nine lines for all four boxes.</li>



<li>A green box means the letter is correct AND goes in that exact spot on the grid.</li>



<li>A yellow box means the letter is correct BUT needs to go in a different spot on the grid.</li>



<li>A grey box means the letter DOESN’T feature at all.</li>



<li>Do this up to nine times to try to solve all four words.</li>
</ol>







<h2 id="h-best-quordle-tips-amp-tricks">Best Quordle Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>



<ul>
<li>Try to use as many of the five vowels as you can in your first two guesses.</li>



<li>Focus on solving words with more green and yellow boxes first.</li>



<li>Avoid reusing letters that are not applicable across any of the four answers.</li>



<li>Don’t be afraid to try the same letter twice in one word, as answers can be sneaky like that.</li>



<li>Play the Practice game first if you’re not used to Quordle, or need a warm-up before today’s new game!</li>

<p><strong>Quordle is a variation of the popular Wordle daily word game, but instead of giving you one word to solve, you must figure out four unique words at the same time.</strong></p>



<p>Needless to say, Quordle is MUCH harder than Wordle! There are days when it might be an achievement just to solve one of the four words. Whereas you can guess Wordle with your first answer, that’s impossible with Quordle. You need to be thinking on all cylinders with Quordle, and Insider Gaming strongly recommends you take the hints above on board and apply them to future Quordle puzzles.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Kojima and Zampella Almost Created a First-Person Metal Gear Solid Game]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/first-person-metal-gear-solid-game-kojima-zampella/</link>
            <guid>1433359</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hideo Kojima recently took to the stage at DICE in Las Vegas to reveal something long-forgotten. Shortly after the release of Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots in 2008, he ‘had many discussions’ with the late Vince Zampella about creating a first-person MGS game.</p>



<p>The title, which has understandably never seen the light of day, would have represented a major pivot for the Metal Gear franchise. While it has featured snippets of a first-person perspective in some sequences, we’ve never had a <strong>dedicated </strong>first-person title in the series.</p>







<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/metal-gear-solid/" id="162">Metal Gear Solid</a> 4: Guns of the Patriots launched to a positive reception way back in 2008, emerging as a core PlayStation 3 title with immense cinematic potential. It represented a penultimate point for Kojima, as the next title, Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, would be his final major release in the series before leaving Konami.</p>



<p>In 2008, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/vince-zampella/" id="3380">Vince Zampella</a> was busying himself with the development of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, the sequel to 2007’s Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. This would have been when he was the CEO at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/infinity-ward/" id="1999">Infinity Ward</a>, and up to a year and a half before he was unexpectedly let go from the company.</p>



<p>In April 2010, Zampella founded <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/respawn-entertainment/" id="2483">Respawn Entertainment</a> and went to work developing Titanfall.</p>



<p>But in a new segment at DICE, Hideo Kojima spoke fondly of the late Zampella, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-head-vince-zampella-killed-in-crash/" id="167252">who died just before Christmas</a> in a car wreck in California. In a post on social media from Geoff Keighley, it was confirmed that Kojima and Zampella had ‘many discussions’ about creating a first-person Metal Gear Solid game, building on the success of MGS4.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">At DICE, Hideo Kojima revealed that he had many discussions with Vince Zampella about creating a first person Metal Gear Solid game together after the release of Metal Gear Solid 4. <a href="https://t.co/hhjbCqG7T2">pic.twitter.com/hhjbCqG7T2</a></p>— Geoff Keighley (@geoffkeighley) <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/2021671381382181056?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 11, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>Nothing more was said on the matter, but it’s safe to assume that a first-person Metal Gear Solid game would have drastically shifted the game’s perspective in more ways than one. In the comments under Keighley’s post, die-hard MGS fans stressed that the franchise ‘only works’ as a third-person shooter.</p>



<p>Kojima also confirmed that Zampella helped him to establish Kojima Productions after parting ways with Konami around 2015.</p>

            <p>Edmund McMillen and Tyler Glaiel's cat breeding roguelike <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mewgenics">Mewgenics</a> came out earlier this week to an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mewgenics-review-a-roguelite-where-sacrificial-arse-maggots-and-frightful-defecation-are-the-keys-to-success">overwhelmingly positive reception</a> and plenty of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mewgenics-sells-over-150k-copies-in-first-6-hours-this-is-beating-expectations-by-quite-a-lot">early success</a>. However, one aspect of the game has left folks on the fence - this <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/252481/mewgenics/credits/windows/?autoplatform=true">list of pretty... complicated internet personalities</a> who've voiced the copious amounts of meows emitted by in-game cats. So, to get a better picture of how those cameos came to be, I reached out to developer McMillen.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Here's a brief rundown of the people included that some potential Mewgenics players on social media - principally in <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/mewgenics-has-some-problematic-meows-ethan-klein-hila-klein.1431916/">this thread</a> that's been hanging out near the top of ResetEra, the past couple of days - have voiced unhappiness over.</p>
<p>The presence of YouTubers Ethan and Hila Klein of h3h3Productions has drawn criticism from those who don't agree with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFznOHunD_c">their</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytOl5hbTrCY">views</a> on the Israel-Palestine conflict. Mewgenics also features a voice performance from Matan Even - that's the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23502321/game-awards-bill-clinton-rabbi-kid-matan-even-hong-kong/">15-year-old stage invader from 2022's Game Awards</a>, who <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/the-kid-who-crashed-the-game-awards-was-on-inforwars-when-he-was-12/">appeared on far right conspiracy podcast InfoWars</a> when he was 12. There's also Christine Chandler - an autistic trans Youtuber who has been the subject of considerable online bullying. She was arrested on a charge of incest in 2021 that was dismissed in 2023.</p>
<p>According to McMillen, the list of cameos is a kind of cross-section of internet culture during the game's development, with an emphasis on featuring people from across the ideological spectrum. "When we added most of the people on the list it was ages ago, like Ethan was included a good four years back," he told me over email.</p><p>"I wanted the game to feature a huge array of iconic voices I’ve been hearing echoing across the internet for most of my time making games," McMillen added. "As some probably noticed I was [pretty] all over the place when it came to cameos and did my best to include and keep ones that clashed or kinda counterbalanced each other.</p>
<p>"The inclusion of Ethan and Hila was counter balanced by iDubbbz and Anisa," he pointed out. For context, iDubbbz and Anisa are Youtubers and streamers who have <a href="https://x.com/overzealots_/status/2018074085964575102">publicly</a> <a href="https://x.com/AnisaTheGreasy/status/1716214668669436177">supported</a> Palestinians during Israel's invasion of Gaza. iDubbbz and Ethan Klein are former friends who are now locked in a <a href="https://dailydot.com/idubbbz-content-cop-ethan-klein/">public feud</a>, after iDubbbz released a 'Content Cop' video criticising Klein for his stance on Israel.</p>
<p>"I made sure to contact both to make sure they were ok with the others' involvement so it didn’t feel like a weird gotcha on release," McMillen explained. "They were both very adult about it and said they had no issue with the other being added and I really respected that, since I know they have been publicly feuding for a while now. It’s hard to explain without revealing aspects of the game people haven’t really experienced yet, but the inclusion of people with clashing ideologies felt appropriate.</p>
<p>"I understand we live in a time where a meow from someone who has different beliefs as you is scary and frustrating, confusing and controversial..." McMillen continued, "but it felt interesting so I decided to explore it. Also, I should probably point out that I don’t share the same opinions as, well probably any of the people we included, if I only included people who share the same exact opinions as me, I’d be the only one meowing in the game. I included Chris but also liquid Chris (those who know, know)...I didn’t [realise] Matan was controversial, I mean a lot of these people are characters doing bits.</p><p>"It’s sad that some people might read this or other articles and be so put off by the idea of an inclusion of someone they don’t like so much that they will never play the game," he concluded, "but I’m not sure someone who would be that upset by a 'problematic meow' would really enjoy the game that much anyway. Honestly the thing that bothers me the most about all this is, if a cat appears with the voice of someone you hate...you can literally throw it in the trash...or worse! People need to get more creative with their hate!"</p>
<p>McMillen also pointed out that once Mewgenics has full mod support, modders may well have a go at offering players the means to remove any meows they aren't fans of, and possibly add in their own custom meows.</p>
<p>In our review of Mewgenics, Callum wrote that "McMillen and Glaiel’s brand has long been stapling together obsessive gameplay loops with juvenile potty humour and more than a sprinkle of morbid horror." He noted in conclusion that "Whatever happens, I know I'll come back with a corker of a story. And it’ll almost certainly involve poo." That spirit definitely seems to have carried over to the voice-casting, too.</p>
