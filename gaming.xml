            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Cairn is a single player, story focused, survival game about climbing a mountain. You won’t be leaping from platform to platform, or swinging round a sledgehammer to propel yourself and your cauldron, though. No, you’ll actually be climbing, moving each of your limbs one at a time to grab handholds and wedge into cracks to scale an entire mountain. It’s not a small one, either, and it’s already populated by the remains of those who have tried and failed to reach the summit before you. It’s a dangerous situation that, somehow, becomes incredibly relaxing and meditative once you get used to it.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cairn - Launch Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x6KWhvvk3bM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Cairn begins, as it must, with a quick tutorial. It’s essential in spite of the fact that you can easily infer the basics. Walk up to a wall, press the button, and you’ll start climbing. From there, it’s “just” a matter of moving your hands and feet, one at a time, to handholds, footholds, crevices, cracks, ledges, and whatever else you can find. Then keep going.</p>


<p>If you were Nathan Drake, you could easily spot a yellow-marked perfect route, scaling the walls like a spider-monkey, but for the more mortal character that you’re playing as, you can expect the camera to zoom in slowly and the edges of the screen darkening as your stamina drops and lactic acid builds up in your muscles. It forces you to quickly adjust to a more tenable position or fall into the abyss. How quickly your stamina drops depends on how good your handhold is, how your body is oriented, how much weight a limb is holding, and so on. You can prop yourself against a smooth wall with one foot if you’ve got a good grip elsewhere, but if you try to scale a completely smooth wall by itself, you’re going to fall almost immediately.</p>


<p>Thankfully there are a few tools to help you avoid the inevitable fall to your death. You have Climbot, a little robot that follows you around, managing your rope and gathering your self-screwing pitons when you finish a climb, and only sometimes getting in the way. Those pitons are pretty handy too, self-screwing into the rock and allowing you to attach a rope, release and recover your stamina. They also means that if you fall, you’ll be hanging from that point and only missing a chunk of health, instead of being impaled on some sharp rocks below.&nbsp;The pitons can break if you mess up the mini-game when placing them, two broken pitons can be recycled into a working piton by Climbot whilst camping.</p>
<p>The Climbot and the pitons are the really important tools, but there’s plenty of other things to think about as well. You also have water, for drinking of course, as well as a tub of chalk. The chalk is useful when you need a bit of extra grip for a riskier climb, granting you enhanced grip with your hands for twelve whole grabs, which can really make the difference. You also have climbing tape, which protects your fingers and improves your grip, and must be replaced regularly or your fingers will become bloody, damaged and worse at gripping rocks.</p>

<p>Of course these things are not unlimited, and this is where the survival elements come in. You’re managing resources, thirst, hunger, and temperature all in addition to actually climbing. The mountain is dotted with resources and you’ll want to find them because starvation, thirst, and hypothermia are just as happy to kill you as gravity is. The climbot can compost items you don’t need into chalk, water can be found in natural pools, falls, and so on, and tape and pitons can be found lying around or on expired climbers. You’ll also find a bunch of food, whether from plants growing or packaged things like coffee, oats, dehydrated soup, just left behind by others.</p>
<p>Most of these can also be processed, cooked, or infused into other things whilst you’re camping. That bag of oats and some sweetened goat milk can be combined into some porridge, you can find some coffee and get yourself a warm drink that gives you energy, or infuse your water bottle with dandelion. All of the food and drink has some effect, whether improving your grip strength, warming you up, or stopping a meter from decreasing for a bit, so they’re really essential even beyond just needing to eat and drink. Cooking ingredients is one of three reasons why you’ll always be looking for the next camping spot as you climb, the others being that resting restores your health, and that they’re also save points.</p>

<p>It seems like a lot to consider, and it is. In fact, I was initially a little overwhelmed by the hunger and thirst bars as I had barely found any food. After a while though, once you’ve got a hang of things and gathered a few things to stave off the hunger, the game becomes incredibly relaxing. Sure, you’re hanging over the edge of a mountain, but it’s a very pretty mountain. In fact, the game is very good looking, with a highly detailed, cel-shaded style. The environment is genuinely stop-for-a-minute-and-gawp gorgeous, though you and the few people you meet through the course of the story all look quite strange to say the least. It’s not just any mountain either, it’s one that was also populated at one point by troglodytes – a word I’ve now discovered means someone who lives in a cave. You’ll find not only notes and background information lying around, but parts of the mountain are carved and styled around where they used to live. It looks incredibly impressive, especially when you’re actively climbing it. I also found a night club in a cave complete with some thumping music. It’s quite a varied sort of place.</p>
<p>The main story itself is kind of strange. Following a woman called Aava, a famous mountain climber, climbing the notoriously unclimbable Mount Kami. Suffice to say the story didn’t go where I expected it to, other than up the mountain. It’s genuinely emotional as your reach the end, and I was taken aback by how impactful it was. Cairn feels like a way for some of the developers to try to express why they, personally, really like mountain climbing. A small but nice touch is that, once you’ve finished the story, you can reload your save game and follow your entire route up the mountain, which for some vaguely nerdy reason is quite satisfying.</p>

<p>There are a few issues in the way. First of all, whilst I appreciate how generous it is, Aava can be twisted and bent into positions that the human body is simply incapable of, especially whilst climbing, like a high altitude contortionist, which isn’t a profession. She can also clip through rocks as well, as can the rope that’s attached to her, and even Climbot itself, which also occasionally likes to move where you’re trying to climb, blocking you from seeing the handholds. There is also the spectre of frame rate drops on PS5, which initially only happen when you look up at the entire mountain, but become pretty temperamental everywhere. None of these really affect gameplay much – frame rate hiccups really only impact the piton mini-game as quick reactions are only needed if you’ve messed up, but they are there.</p>

              <p>The UGREEN Steam Deck Dock 9-in-1 USB-C Docking Station lets you upgrade your handheld gaming system, such as the Steam Deck or ROG Ally, or other USB-C-enabled devices, into a full desktop-style experience. You simply place your handheld device into the foldable stand, connect the docking station with a single cable, and immediately gain access to a display, a wired internet connection, and additional accessories. The stand’s design keeps the handheld device’s rear vents exposed, allowing proper airflow and cooling during both use and charging. A compact, low-profile base lets you easily position the docking station below a monitor or near the edge of a desk without overwhelming your work surface.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6939/">You can purchase the UGREEN Steam Deck Dock 9-in-1 USB-C Docking Station on Amazon for $40, which represents $20 in savings, or 33 percent off its original price of $60.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6939/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A handy dock to keep your Steam Deck and accessories on</h2>
<p><span>The UGREEN Steam Deck Dock’s adjustable, foldable stand uses two hinges to give you a comfortable viewing angle for your handheld gaming system. The front lip prevents the device from being pushed too far forward during button presses, while the open rear panel ensures adequate airflow around the system’s exhaust vents. When you are finished using your handheld system, the foldable stand allows you to quickly store it in a bag or drawer.</span></p>
<p>The HDMI port on the UGREEN Steam Deck Dock lets you display games and applications on a full-size television or computer monitor using a single cable. The docking station supports resolutions up to 4K at 60 Hz on compatible monitors and TVs, delivering clear image quality and smooth motion at higher refresh rates. Whether you are running games full-screen or using part of the display, video output gives your handheld system a much larger canvas to work with.</p>



<p>The four USB ports and two memory card slots turn the UGREEN Steam Deck Dock into a versatile accessory and storage hub for peripherals and media you already own. Two USB 3.2 Gen 1 ports, along with a USB-A port and a USB-C port, allow fast data transfers from external drives, while the two USB 2.0 ports let you connect a keyboard, mouse, or wireless dongle. The dual memory card slots let you transfer photos, videos, and other files directly from memory cards without needing a separate card reader.</p>
<p>Built-in Ethernet connectivity and Power Delivery are designed to give you greater reliability than relying solely on wireless connections. Gigabit Ethernet provides a direct wired connection to your router, helping improve stability for file transfers, cloud saves, and online multiplayer gaming. Up to 100W of USB-C Power Delivery also allows multiple devices to charge simultaneously.</p>
<p>Beyond handheld gaming systems and portable devices, the UGREEN Steam Deck Dock works with most USB-C-enabled tablets and computers. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6939/">At a sale price of $40, down from $60</a>, the UGREEN Steam Deck Dock 9-in-1 USB-C Docking Station offers a clean, organized way to store your handheld system, expand available ports, and simplify your cable setup.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>WWE 2K26 is finally moving to the modern era. According to the game’s ratings page on the ESRB website, WWE 2K26 will no longer release on last-gen consoles.</p>



<p>That means those only playing on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One are seemingly out of luck.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-esrb-page-gives-a-bit-away">The ESRB Page Gives A Bit Away</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>A visit to the <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/41019/wwe-2k26/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">game’s page</a> on the website mentions a release on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/xbox-series-x/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/xbox-series-x/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Series X|S</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC</a>. That lines up with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-releases-in-march-available-nintendo-switch-2/" id="172294" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">what had been previously reported</a> on the status of the game. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming has also reported in the past that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-island-returns-wwe-2k26-new-story/" id="170633" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Island</a> mode was set to come to PC this year. With it only being on current-gen systems and PC, it now makes sense as to why. </p>



<p>2K Sports has yet to officially confirm this, so it could be a case of just missing the systems. That said, with it so close to the game’s March 13 release, it’s highly likely that what’s on the ESRB website is accurate. </p>







<p>WWE 2K26 is expected to have a number of improved features and even some <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-new-match-types/" id="170273" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new and returning match types</a> this year. One of the game’s main modes, Showcase Mode, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-cm-punk-showcase-mode/" id="169985" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will also feature current World Heavyweight Champion CM Punk</a>. Other features include the Draft in Universe mode, a revamped reversal system, intergender matches in MyFACTION, and more. </p>

    <p><span>Kickstarter campaign coming soon.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Moon Beast Productions" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/moon-beast-productions">Moon Beast Productions</a>, a studio founded by <em>Diablo</em> veterans Philip Shenk, Peter Hu, and Erich Schaefer, has announced <em><a title="Games > Darkhaven" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/darkhaven">Darkhaven</a></em>, a dark fantasy isometric <a title="Genres > Action [3,351 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a> <a title="Genres > RPG [17,983 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPG</a> that “returns to the genre’s roots while pushing it forward with a fully dynamic, persistent world.” It will be available for <a title="Platforms > PC [25,368 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3571870/Darkhaven/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. A release date was not announced, but it will launch first in Early Access. A <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/moonbeastproductions/darkhaven-an-action-rpg-with-dynamic-worlds" target="_blank">Kickstarter campaign</a> is coming soon. <span id="more-1021761"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Moon Beast Productions:</p><blockquote><p><em>Darkhaven</em> is a dark fantasy isometric action RPG set in the aftermath of a great and final collapse of civilization. <a title="Companies > Ancient [9 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/ancient">Ancient</a> empires have fallen, their ruins reclaimed by wilderness, monsters, and predatory supernatural forces. Players are heirs to a legacy of power that is the last hope for this dying world. As eldritch evil worms its way into the world to feed on its remains, it falls to these few to bring the land back from the brink of death.</p><p>Designed for solo play, <a title="Genres > Co-Op [368 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative</a> <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,839 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a>s, and high-stakes player-versus-player-enabled realms, <em>Darkhaven</em> is set in a procedurally generated, fully dynamic, and persistent world. Terrain and structures are deformable and buildable, allowing players to dig through earth, tunnel through dungeon walls, drain lakes to uncover buried ruins, redirect lava flows to reshape battlefields, or rebuild shattered fortresses. Seasons change, weather alters combat and traversal, and world-altering events leave permanent scars. Every action contributes to a shared, evolving history.</p><p>Combat in <em>Darkhaven</em> enhances the balance between stat progression, build choice, and player skill. Heroes can jump, climb, swim, dash, and traverse the world freely, introducing a new layer of action and skill rarely seen in the genre. <a title="Companies > SUCCESS Corporation [106 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/success-corporation">Success</a> is not just a function of stats, but of movement, timing, and terrain awareness, dramatically expanding the “action” at the heart of <a title="Genres > Action RPG [1,946 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg/action-rpg">action RPGs</a>.</p><p>The game’s itemization and progression philosophy draws heavily on the originators of the action RPG genre, Diablo and Diablo II. Rejecting the incrementalism common in many modern titles, <em>Darkhaven</em> embraces bold, expressive loot—items that feel powerful, sometimes surprisingly so, and capable of redefining builds rather than merely optimizing them.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
        <div id="carousel_1021759"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><p>“From the very beginning, we wanted <em>Darkhaven</em> to feel good to play,” said Moon Beast Productions co-founder and chief creative officer Erich Schaefer in a press release. “Movement is fun. Being able to jump over attacks, climb cliffs, dash out of danger, or swim across a lake that may or may not be infested with riverfangs changes how combat feels in this kind of game. It’s not just about numbers fighting numbers anymore. It’s much more engaging. For me, it becomes more about skill, finding flow, and making smart decisions in the moment. I’ve never had more fun making and playing an action RPG.”</p><p>Moon Beast Productions co-founder and president Peter Hu added, “Great itemization is about possibility. In <em>Darkhaven</em>, we want items that open doors, gear that makes you stop and rethink your build, your strategy, or even how you play the game. Finding something powerful should be exciting and inspiring, not something that gets smoothed out into tiny percentage gains.”</p><p>Moon Beast Productions co-founder and CEO Philip Shenk said, “We’re incredibly excited to finally reveal <em>Darkhaven</em> and open its Steam page. This project represents everything we’ve learned about ARPGs over the last two decades, and what becomes possible when those ideas are combined with modern technology. We’re building a world that remembers what you’ve done, bears the scars of your victories and failures, and tells stories that only your playthrough can create. With the community’s support, we’re ready to bring <em>Darkhaven</em> to Early Access, which will allow us to continue to build the game into the incredible experience we all want it to be.”</p><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Stardew Valley creator Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone has shared an update on his next game, Haunted Chocolatier.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-creator-reveals-haunted-chocolatier">Haunted Chocolatier was initially announced back in 2021</a>. In May of 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-creator-wont-rush-haunted-chocolatier-better-to-have-a-good-delayed-game-than-a-bad-game-on-time">Barone said he's "not too concerned with the pressure" of releasing Haunted Chocolatier</a>, stating "it's better to have a delayed game that's actually good than a bad game that's on time". </p>
<p>Then, last year, Barone assured his fans that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-creator-promises-no-more-updates-until-haunted-chocolatier-releases">he is "committed to not working on Stardew Valley" until he's "done with Haunted Chocolatier"</a>. Since then, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/haunted-chocolatier-will-have-a-larger-world-than-stardew-valley-creator-confirms">Barone revealed that "the world of Haunted Chocolatier is larger than Stardew Valley"</a>, but otherwise word on the anticipated release has been somewhat slim.</p>

<p>That has changed now, though, thanks to a new <a href="https://www.hauntedchocolatier.net/2026/01/28/update-im-still-working-like-always/">Haunted Chocolatier blog post</a>. Here, the solo developer said he had "been very productive lately", and Haunted Chocolatier is indeed alive and well. While he did admit it is "taking a while" to get everything finished, he said there is nothing wrong with that.</p>
<p>"I know, I know, I shouldn’t have announced the game so early. But I had my reasons," Barone wrote, before going to on "debunk a few myths and false assumptions" he had seen making the rounds.</p>
<p>First off, he assured everyone he will not be abandoning Haunted Chocolatier. He added even if he did decide to move on from his next game, he wouldn't be adding any unused content to Stardew Valley, as they "are separate games".</p><p>"It doesn't even make sense from a technical perspective, as Haunted Chocolatier is written from scratch, it's not the same 'engine' as Stardew Valley. You can’t just copy and paste Haunted Chocolatier into Stardew Valley," he explained. He furthered that when he is working on Stardew Valley, he is "not thinking" about Haunted Chocolatier, and "vice versa". This means he would "wouldn't 'test something out' in Stardew Valley" for Haunted Chocolatier. </p>
<p>Speaking of Stardew Valley, he is also working on a new update with "additional ideas for how to improve it", so there is something else to look forward to.</p>
<p>Finally, Barone addressed Haunted Chocolatier's release date. We still don't have one, alas, but Barone doesn't sound too concerned about that really. "The bottom line is, I don’t want to give a release date," he explained.</p>
<p>"The game will come out when it's done."</p>

<p>Back in January last year, Barone revealed that, as of December 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-continues-its-wholesome-farming-dominance-with-latest-sales-milestone">Stardew Valley had sold in excess of 41m copies across platforms</a>. Of those 41m, over half are on PC, with 26m copies sold. Meanwhile, the Nintendo Switch accounts for 7.9m Stardew Valley sales.</p>

<p>After being announced back in the March 2025 Direct, Living the Dream has since cropped up again at the September showcase with a 'Spring 2026' release date. It looks expectedly silly, but we still have very little idea of what <em>new</em> stuff it will bring to the table over its 3DS predecessor.</p>
<p>Hopefully, we won't have long until we find out. The Living the Dream Direct promises 20 minutes of info, kicking off on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_0kl1WiSPg">Nintendo of America YouTube channel</a> (or your regional equivalent) at the following times:</p>
<ul><li><strong>North America:</strong> 6am PST / 7am MST / 8am CST / 9am EST</li><li><strong>UK/Ire:</strong> 2pm GMT</li><li><strong>Europe:</strong> 3pm CET / 4pm EET</li><li><strong>Asia/Oceania:</strong> 11pm JST / 10pm AWST / 1am (Fri) AEDT</li></ul>

<p>It's a game all about friendship and community, so it feels only right that you can watch along with us below. The Direct will kick off in just a few minutes, so grab yourself a beverage and get comfy, things are about to begin!</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/tcl-40-smart-tv-crashes-to-all-time-low-and-doubles-as-a-pc-monitor-for-less-alexa-built-in-apple-airplay-compatibility-2000663944</link>
            <guid>1419526</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Is your living room in need of a new TV, or do you want a screen for your bedroom to enjoy your favorite shows while snuggling in the blanket? Prefer a smaller screen and not looking to shell out big bucks on the upgrade? The TCL 40-inch Class S3 TV checks all those boxes.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6938/">Currently, this modest-sized TV is going for just $150 at Amazon, after the retailer took 21% off its usual $190 price tag</a>. It’s the lowest we have seen this screen go in a long while, and placing your orders today can also help you skip delivery charges altogether. But as you’d expect, the deal is selling out fast. If you’ve been looking to add a new screen to your entertainment setup, now is the time to act.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6938/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Impressive Visuals</h2>
<p>The 40-inch size is pretty decent. It’s not massive, but also not too small to make the content feel cramped. This size is ideal for bedrooms and smaller living areas where you don’t want the screen to take over the entire wall. With this one, you’re getting an elegant edge-to-edge glass design for that modern look that blends effortlessly into any space.</p>
<p>The 1080p full HD resolution delivers a bright, sharp, and detailed picture quality, which can bring any content to life. There’s also a direct LED backlight for better brightness uniformity and picture performance compared to edge-lit TVs, which adds to the immersive experience. Whether you’re catching up on the latest crime thriller on Netflix or streaming a nature documentary, you’ll experience breathtaking detail with exceptional color accuracy. Yellow won’t turn into neon, and shadows stay visible instead of turning black. The latter is especially helpful when you’re playing a game on the TV, as it helps you spot enemies hiding in the dark easily.</p>



<p>You’ll also never be out of content to watch, thanks to the built-in Fire TV. This TCL screen comes with all the popular streaming platforms – like Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, Peacock, and more – preinstalled. There’s support for Spotify too, which makes it easy to vibe to your favorite songs in the background as you finish house chores. Most of these platforms, however, require a monthly subscription. Looking to cut back on those? No sweat. Free options such as Freevee, Pluto TV, Tubi, plus live channels, are available too. Maybe start the day by catching up on what’s happening around the world with live TV, and then wind down at night with an episode of your all-time favorite show. All is possible, and that too, without cable.</p>
<p>Navigation is made easy with the Alexa voice remote. It lets you search and launch content both manually and using your voice. For instance, when you’re not in the mood to press some buttons, you can say something like “Alexa, launch Netflix”, or “Alexa, show me the latest horror movies on Prime Video”, and your command will be answered in seconds. Additionally, AirPlay compatibility lets you share videos, photos, and music, and more to the TV from your compatible iPhone or iPad.</p>
<p>There are more features to appreciate here, but to wrap it up, if you’re looking to grab a new smart TV without breaking the bank, this 40-inch TCL TV deal makes the jump easy. Just be sure to act before it’s too late.</p>

<p>Season two of Fallout is starting to wrap up, with this series' penultimate episode airing yesterday. Again, we joined Lucy, Maximus, Hank, The Ghoul and more to find out what is going on with that powerful and coveted cold fusion tech (among other plot points, such as the bombshell Steph is not American, but Canadian - those vault dwellers were shook!).</p>
<p>But, back to cold fusion. During a flashback in episode seven, which is known as The Handoff, Cooper Howard is told he can meet with the President of the United States, and give the cold fusion technology to the most powerful man in the world. Howard trusts that the president will do the right thing, and so does indeed hand over the technology with not as much hesitation as I personally would have expected, but that is maybe a conversation for another day.</p><p>The reason we are here today is because of who played the US President in the Fallout TV show. And, it was none other than Clancy Brown, who voiced Rhombus, the head knight of the Lost Hills chapter of the Brotherhood of Steel in the original Fallout.</p>
<p>This is another nice little Easter egg from the Fallout TV show, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-twos-latest-episode-has-a-super-easter-egg-cameo-for-fans">which last week also featured a familiar face from the games</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-2-moves-forward-last-two-episodes">second season of Fallout will conclude next week</a>, on 3rd February. There are still plenty of loose ends to tidy up, though I don't suspect we will get satisfying answers to many of them, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-renews-fallout-for-third-season-six-months-before-second-arrives">what with series three on the cards</a> to mop up some unanswered questions.</p>
<p>The third season of Fallout is already being written, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-three-filming-starts-sooner-than-expected">filming is expected to kick off this May</a>.</p>

<p>Nintendo is no stranger to a banging soundtrack. The company also isn't wholly against releasing said soundtracks on vinyl — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">Breath of the Wild</a> is scoring an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-soundtrack-is-scoring-a-gorgeous-vinyl-release-next-year">eight-LP box set</a> later this year, for example — but there's no way that the House of Mario could possibly cover <em>everything</em> in delightful disc form. That's where fans like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@huappyspins">Huappy Spins</a> come in.</p>
<p>We weren't aware of Huappy Spins' work until this week, when we first spotted the vinyl pressing of '<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_o3Fza5fFs">The Sounds of the Nintendo 3DS</a>' that you'll find above. Being the big old nerds that we are, we gobbled the whole thing up in one sitting, vibing to familiar bops like 'Home Menu' and 'Mii Maker', shedding a tear for the loss of Miiverse and its impeccable tunes, and pouring one out for forgotten classics like 'Activity Log Software Library'.</p>
<p>Sure, it's a digital recording of a vinyl playing a digital soundtrack, but you can't tell us that there isn't something satisfying about seeing those familiar beeps and boops come from a spinning plastic disc.</p>
<p>So, you can only imagine our joy when we took a look through Huappy Spins' account and saw a huge back catalogue of Nintendo soundtracks that they have ripped in the past. There's a vinyl for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAFwb4G_3vE">Mario Party 2</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aodLU51FCnI">Yoshi's Woolly World</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWug0tiAkok">The Minish Cap</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2roH9DewDk">Pokémon Red/Blue/Yellow</a>. They've even sorted releases for indies and third-party releases that we've poured hours into on Nintendo systems, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzbEsJ3ShdA">Stardew Valley</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pl6GXYsoUs">Spiritfarer</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZLJ4d3CTHw">Citizen Sleeper</a> and this writer's beloved <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ58D8qy2_g">Professor Layton and the Curious Village</a>.</p>
<p>All of these pressings appear on a colourful vinyl — often matching the game itself — with unique centre stickers to really sell the listening vibes. Heck, the thumbnails for each even show off a neat original sleeve for each LP.</p>
<p>Now okay, they're not for sale, so it's not as if you'll be able to add any of these to your collection right now, but there are worse ways to spend an afternoon than by listening to some of your favourite soundtracks as a colourful disc spins around on your screen.</p>
<p>In fact, we'll finish by linking to a couple more of our favourites below. Happy listening!</p>

              <p>Drumming up attention for the finale of Amazon Prime’s second season of <em>Fallout</em>, the fantastic first season is gradually being added to YouTube to watch over the next few days. However, if you’re looking to catch up on the first run without paying for Prime, you’ll need to get your gas-powered skates on.</p> <p>As I saw on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/sci-fi-shows/okie-dokie-fallout-season-1-is-now-free-on-youtube-but-its-going-back-to-the-vault-very-soon/"><em>GamesRadar</em></a>, Amazon Prime’s official YouTube channels around the world have added the first two episodes of 2024’s first season of&nbsp;<em>Fallout</em> to watch for free. The live-action adaptation of Interplay and Bethesda’s <em>Fallout</em> games was wildly better than anyone could have hoped, and proved a colossal hit for Amazon’s streaming service. The <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-tv-show-amazon-prime-audience-ratings-1851445138">network claimed 65 million viewers over the first two weeks</a>, and it went on <a href="https://kotaku.com/2024-emmy-nominations-fallout-walton-goggins-shogun-1851597281">to scoop a couple of Emmy nominations</a>.</p>

 <p>The release schedule is a bit odd, with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOKDDkFt4W0&amp;list=PLWz2DO39R-NX9gYByO7231inaftQYqI8v&amp;index=2">the first two episodes online now</a>, and then another two added every day until all eight are up by Jan 31. However, they won’t be there long: Prime will pull the videos on the turn of February 11, meaning you’ve got a fortnight to cram them all in. Heck, don’t wait, you can watch the first episode right now, right here!</p>  <p>Season two is ongoing, and proving to be equally fantastic television, delivering some jaw-hanging violence and brilliant dialogue, as well as delighting long-time fans of the games with all manner of <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-finally-brings-back-two-classic-pieces-of-the-franchise-2000661833">in-jokes and easter eggy references</a> for fan-favorite <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em>. And, seriously, if you’re a fan of watching heads go pop, no show has you better covered. Also, with just one episode yet to appear, it’s also <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-finally-fixing-dumb-midnight-release-time-2000663241">now releasing at a far less inconvenient time</a> than midnight.</p>

 <p>So no excuses now. And given the pleasingly quick turnaround of the second season just 18 months after the first (yes, this still seems bonkers-slow to people who remember network television, but it’s&nbsp;<em>so</em> much faster than the norm for these premium shows), perhaps you’ll not have to wait too long to see season two appear on YouTube.</p>

<p>BLAST, one of the leading names in the esports industry for event organization, has unveiled an all-new destination process, inviting countries worldwide to host BLAST-backed events in 2027 and 2028. The ambitious roadmap will incorporate more than 40 events and should accommodate more than <strong>half a million </strong>fans.</p>



<p>In 2025, a single BLAST Counter-Strike Major held in Austin, Texas, generated a whopping $102 million in economic impact, with fans travelling to the arena from <strong>37 countries</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-blast-to-host-another-global-sprint">BLAST To Host Another Global Sprint</h2>



<p>In a press release, the team at BLAST revealed an ambitious plan to host 40 events through 2027 and 2028, encompassing several games, hundreds of competitors, and dozens of countries. The expectation is that the company will achieve 250,000 ticket sales per year, for a total of half a million across the two-year window.</p>



<p>Per the latest update, cities and regions worldwide are invited to ‘express interest’ in hosting these grand and increasingly valuable tournaments, covering games like:</p>



<ul>
<li>Counter-Strike</li>



<li>Fortnite</li>



<li>Rocket League</li>



<li>Rainbow Six</li>
</ul>



<p>But it doesn’t end with games, as BLAST also promoted ‘new competitive entertainment formats.’</p>



<p>In a statement, BLAST’s VP of Destinations and Market Development, James Wollard, wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Esports continues to be one of the fastest growing entertainment sectors globally and BLAST has built a strong track record of delivering world class live events that attract millions of viewers and that increasingly sell out iconic arenas.</p>



<p>Our focus is on building long-term, strategic partnerships with host destinations that deliver measurable economic impacts, global exposure and lasting community and cultural value. We consistently return to and repeat partnerships with host cities, which demonstrates the value of our model and our commitment to sustainable, multi-year, deep collaborations.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Any host country interested in supporting a BLAST event must get its ‘expressions of interest’ logged by February 13.</p>



<p>The average esports major, at least for the largest games, draws thousands of visitors from around the world. They boost tourism, hospitality, and travel spending, aside from also spending money in the venue, buying merchandise, and supporting the teams and organizations that make the esports industry sustainable</p>

            <p>Ubisoft has finally, after months of speculation, acknowledged its rumoured Assassin's Creed: Black Flag remake. How has it done this, I hear you ask? Well, by sharing a meme from Grand Theft Auto, obviously.</p>

<p>The official Assassin's Creed social media account was responding to another post, which had shared images of a supposed Edward Kenway figurine releasing with Ubisoft's Black Flag Remake. "A guy on Vinted is selling a brand new Edward Kenway figurine and claims it’s releasing this year," this particular post read, with some accompanying images of the statue itself.</p>
<p>To this, Ubisoft replied with the classic meme from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-san-andreas">Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</a>, showing the game's protagonist CJ walking off while muttering in exasperation:</p>
<p>"Ah sh*t, here we go again."</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>via X</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As for the statue, its base shows logos for Ubisoft and PureArts, with a copyright mark registered for 2026. And, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-statue-leaks">this reported Black Flag remake statue</a> is just one of the many pieces of evidence we have that Ubisoft is gearing up to rerelease its piratical Assassin's Creed adventure.</p><p>In addition to this merchandise, we also have the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-music-upload">rather suspicious reuploading of the Black Flag sea shanties on YouTube</a> (though, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-claims-assassins-creed-blag-flag-music-reuploads-were-due-to-technical-issues-and-nothing-more">developer did try and pass this off as "technical issues"</a>). Then, back in August of last year, voice actor Matt Ryan - who portrayed Edward Kenway in Assassin's Creed: Black Flag - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-actor-threatened-with-legal-action-following-remake-slip-up">claimed legal action was brought against him by Ubisoft</a> after cheekily hinting at its existence at a convention. Oh, and we also have that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-spotted-again-ahead-of-the-game-awards">PEGI listing for Black Flag Resynced which was spotted</a> in December.</p>
<p>At one point, it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/long-rumoured-assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-could-set-sail-before-april">speculated Ubisoft would release its Assassin's Creed: Black Flag remake by this April</a>. However, earlier this month Ubisoft announced it had closed two studios and cancelled six projects - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sands-of-times-shock-cancellation-does-not-mean-we-are-stepping-away-from-the-franchise-says-remake-team">including its Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake</a> - as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-troubled-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-dead-as-publisher-kills-multiple-projects-closes-studios-and-orders-staff-back-to-the-office">part of a major restructuring effort that will also see delays for seven games</a>. One of these delayed games is believed to be the Assassin's Creed: Black Flag remake.</p>

              <p>While the&nbsp;<em>Pokémon TCG</em> has been in dire straits when it comes to availability for well over a year now, this has primarily been a result of a massively inflated resale market driving scalpers to scoop up all new releases and making it close to impossible for regular customers to buy online or in stores. But with the first new set of 2026, <em>Ascended Heroes</em>, the problem seems to be The Pokémon Company itself.</p> <p><em>Pokémon&nbsp;</em>card sets come in two types: there are the “main series expansions” that release with 36-pack booster boxes (usually bought by retail and sold individually) alongside Elite Trainer Boxes and various other bundles, with the majority of the product made available on day one. Then there are so-called “special expansions” that have no booster boxes or individually sold packs, but rather just the ETB and a broader range of other types of bundles. Special sets also tend to have more staggered releases, with new bundles and collection boxes appearing every now and then throughout a year. Ascended Heroes, the third set in the current Mega Evolution generation of TCG cards, is one such special set, but its initial release appears to be far more staggered than intended (thanks&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-pokemon-company-has-officially-delayed-the-pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-ascended-heroes-two-pack-blisters"><em>IGN</em></a>).</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="und" dir="ltr">Pokémon TCG Product Legality Update <a href="https://t.co/6eOCIpvkKe">https://t.co/6eOCIpvkKe</a> <a href="https://t.co/ujIpp9VLYC">pic.twitter.com/ujIpp9VLYC</a></p> <p>— Play! Pokémon (@playpokemon) <a href="https://twitter.com/playpokemon/status/2016587353247404141?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 28, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Officially released Friday 30 January, Ascended Heroes will be appearing with a real whimper. The set is super-attractive to collectors because it will see the return of both Trainer Pokémon and, more importantly, the Mega Pokémon cards emblazoned with the Japanese for their special attacks—something not seen since 2015’s XY Primal Clash. For reasons undeclared, this will not launch as expected, with the usual ETBs (that tend to contain nine to 11 packs, along with a special card, a set of dice, counters and dividers) already not showing up for three weeks, set to appear on February 20th. Instead, tomorrow was supposed to bring us two booster pack types, one pair of Tech Sticker Collections that come with three packs, a bonus card, and a sheet of stickers, a a pair of two-pack checklane blister packs that come with a bonus card and a coin featuring trainers Larry and Erika. The latter has now been announced as delayed until February 20th as well, making it seem frankly odd not to just delay the entire set’s release until next month.</p> <p>The bizarre release schedule of&nbsp;<em>Ascended Heroes</em> has also meant TPCi has had to <a href="https://www.pokebeach.com/2026/01/tpci-changes-tournament-legality-rules-for-special-sets-ascended-heroes-legality-date-moved-after-euic">change the rules</a> regarding when special expansion cards can become legal for tournament play, such that this new set now&nbsp;will not be playable in the upcoming European Championships. The new rule is that cards only become legal two weeks after either the set’s ETB or Booster Bundle has been released, and given the ETB is delayed until late February, that means the cards will not be allowed on the February 13 tournament.</p>

 <p>Of course, it’s not actually possible to pre-order&nbsp;<em>any</em> of these items anywhere, and you’ll be lucky to find the single release that is happening tomorrow in stores. Given the difficulty finding any sets from the last year and a half, “special” sets feel especially galling at the moment, with single packs not even an option. Eventually, over the year, <em>Ascended Heroes</em> will add quite a few larger collection boxes with eight packs in each, along with two-pack mini-tins, likely along with other unannounced product. The challenge will be finding any of it at RRP, rather than scalpers’ over-inflated resale prices.</p>

 <p>Right now, trying to pick up the $50 <em>Ascended Heroes</em> ETB <a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/668496/pokemon-me-ascended-heroes-ascended-heroes-elite-trainer-box?page=1&amp;Language=English">will cost you around $150</a>, while the six-pack Booster Bundle due for April 24 at $27 is already seeing pre-orders <a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/668541/pokemon-me-ascended-heroes-ascended-heroes-booster-bundle?page=1&amp;Language=English">resold at around $80</a>. It’s ludicrous, and it’s getting worse.</p> <p>Due to a whole other sort of delay, this time caused by the recent storms in the U.S. affecting shipping, our review of <em>Ascended Heroes</em> will also be coming later than expected (the original embargo was today). We’ll hopefully have more details very soon.</p>

            <p>Sellers of revamped retro PC games and also newer PC games GOG have been accused of using AI-generated artwork to promote their store's new year sale. Meanwhile, a job listing the Polish company have recently posted for a senior software engineer to work on their desktop app <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gog-galaxy">GOG Galaxy</a> lists among the role's responsibilities that they must "actively use and promote AI-assisted development tools".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Delving into the alleged use of AI art first, that was spotted by Reddit users and subsequently reported by <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2026/01/gog-now-using-ai-generated-images-on-their-store/">GamingOnLinux</a>. The artwork in question appears to be the New Year Sale header which - as of writing - is <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/new-year-sale">still up on GOG's storefront</a>, and does feature some weird blurring towards the bottom of it.</p>
<p>Discussion of the artwork on the GOG forums has garnered <a href="https://www.gog.com/forum/general/5000_gog_patrons_and_an_ai_banner/post69/?staff=yes">a response</a> from a user with the handle KosmicznaPluskwa, who appears to be a senior graphic designer on the GOG team. Declaring that they're "not a company spokesperson" and were only offering a personal opinion, they wrote: "To clear the air - current sale banner is fully AI. Not my work.</p>
<p>"This is all I can say on this," KosmicznaPluskwa continued. "My team is much smaller now than it used to be, and the requirements for the role are completely different than it used to be - it's possible to find job offers descriptions from less than a year ago and 5+ years ago to compare, if anyone is curious."</p><p>If you do go looking through GOG's job listings, you'll find a <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/work/senior-software-engineer-c-gog-galaxy">recently posted one</a> for a senior software engineer on GOG Galaxy. As spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/platforms/hooray-linux-is-gogs-next-major-frontier-oh-no-it-wants-to-actively-use-and-promote-ai-assisted-development-tools/">Please Call Gamer</a>, the gig's requirements include "active use of AI tools in daily development workflows, and enthusiasm for helping the team increase adoption". Furthermore, the day-to-day reponsibilities section mentions a need to "actively use and promote AI-assisted development tools to increase team efficiency and code quality."</p>
<p>I've reached out to GOG for comment about both the artwork and the job listing.</p>
<p>All of this follows GOG changing ownership just before 2025 morphed into 2026, with Witcher developers CD Projekt opting to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gogs-new-owner-will-stick-to-its-revamped-classic-and-zero-drm-guns-but-does-think-lessons-lie-in-steams-overstuffed-embrace">sell the storefront to original GOG co-founder Michał Kiciński</a> in a deal worth about £18.6 million. To this point, Kiciński's been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gogs-new-owner-will-stick-to-its-revamped-classic-and-zero-drm-guns-but-does-think-lessons-lie-in-steams-overstuffed-embrace">making a lot of reassuring noises</a> about GOG's future direction and plans, conveying a desire to grow while sticking to the platform's established preservation and anti-DRM strengths. Needless to say that I don't recall any chatter about aiming to do a bunch of AI bollocks as part of that.</p>

            <guid>1419454</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The holidays are a mere blip in our collective rearview mirror now, so why are <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/">Apple’s newest and arguably best AirPods still at their all-time low price of $199 at Amazon</a>? Don’t know, don’t care, don’t want to jinx it — we just want to get there before somebody looks at the calendar and removes this $50-off deal on the AirPods Pro 3 altogether.</p>
<p>The Pro 3 were one of the biggest audio tech drops of 2025. As hard as it is to believe, it’s been less than six months since they hit the market and sent waves of audiophiles scurrying to get some of the first pairs. Next-level active noise cancellation at twice the level of the AirPods Pro 2 is an awfully good start for a sales pitch, but Apple packed so many more upgrades and innovations into the AirPods Pro 3 that it’s worth revisiting them.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Better for Longer</h2>
<p>Active noise cancellation is a notorious battery hog for wireless earbuds and headphones, yet somehow Apple doubled the level of ANC from the AirPods Pro 2 to the Pro 3 and still boosted the battery life to 8 hours of listening time with ANC and 10 hours without. The redesigned MagSafe charging case now has a built-in speaker that makes locating them with the Find My app far easier.</p>
<p>The earbuds themselves received a very subtle but very effective facelift. They’re more streamlined, and the redesign was aimed at a more secure fit in your ear. That’s huge if you’re planning on making the AirPods Pro 3 your go-to source of entertainment while you’re working out, running, or otherwise physically active. The new foam-infused ear tips now come in five sizes, including a new XXS version, which addresses the unpredictability of ear shapes and sizes. Workout and exercise fans will also appreciate the health-monitoring upgrades, including real-time heart-rate monitoring and calories burned count that you can see on your iPhone.</p>



<h2>Sound Investment</h2>
<p>It’s really about the sound, of course, and the AirPods Pro 3 are now packing spatial audio and updated, vastly improved bass. That’s on top of the potent active noise cancellation, so your entire listening experience is getting an upgrade from the Pro 3 earbuds. The hearing aid and hearing test features and live translation? More icing on a really tasty audio cake.</p>
<p>It’s not as if Apple or Amazon are needing to unload a lemon with this deal — the AirPods Pro 3 are very possibly Apple’s best-yet wireless earbuds, and the reviews have been nearly unanimously great. Don’t waste time pondering why <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/">they’re still at a record-low $199 at Amazon a full month after the holidays</a> — just go buy yourself a pair.</p>

The item appeared to be the under-wraps tie-in teased last year by merchandise maker Pure Arts — and now, Ubisoft has effectively confirmed that this is the case. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Writing on Twitter / X, Ubisoft used its official Assassin's Creed account to <a href="https://twitter.com/assassinscreed/status/2016531108486095252?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2016531108486095252%7Ctwgr%5Ee6e1977daeaec6ece2a62381c01171e2fdc43ba0%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ign.com%2Farticles%2Fah-s-here-we-go-again-ubisoft-acknowledges-assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-leak-responds-with-gta-meme" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">respond</a> to the original post that shared photos of said statue, replying with the classic GTA San Andreas meme showing that game's protagonist Carl Johnson wearily stating: "Ah s***, here we go again." </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="qme" dir="ltr"> <a href="https://t.co/IRDhrgCPAp" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/IRDhrgCPAp</a></p>— Assassin's Creed (@assassinscreed) <a href="https://twitter.com/assassinscreed/status/2016531108486095252?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 28, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The statue's appearance online follows a hint by collectible company <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-rumors-swirl-as-collectible-maker-admits-there-is-something-going-on">Pure Arts last year suggesting it had something in the works for Black Flag</a> which would surface in the not-too-distant future as "there is something going on." Its Vinted listing gave no clue to its origins, though stated that it was due for release in 2026. A detailed close-up of the statue's base shown in photos displayed logos for Ubisoft and Pure Arts, with a copyright mark registered for 2026. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With this now out there, alongside everything else that has leaked about the game, it's perhaps unsurprising that Ubisoft has now given up pretending there's nothing going on. While clearly a humorous response, this also marks the first time Ubisoft has ever commented on anything to do with the Assassin's Creed: Black Flag remake, despite a long, long string of reports and leaks surrounding its existance.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps the most notable confirmation of the project came from Edward Kenway's own voice actor, who <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-edward-kenway-actor-alleges-ubisoft-threatened-to-sue-him-for-hinting-at-black-flag-remake">initially teased the project</a> before later suggesting he'd been told by Ubisoft in no uncertain terms to stop talking. Finally, last month, the game popped up on the PEGI European ratings board website revealing what looks to be its final title: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-is-the-name-of-ubisofts-long-awaited-pirate-remake">Assassin's Creed Black Flag Resynced</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Officially, Ubisoft has only referred to the game's impending launch by acknowledging it had an unannounced game due to arrive before the end of its current financial year on March 31. Last week, however, this game was then delayed into the coming financial year (ending March 31, 2027) due to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-6-projects-including-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-closes-2-studios-and-confirms-further-layoffs-in-major-company-restructure">company's major recent reshuffle of teams, projects and studios</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

But, with the latest delay, this means that just a single sealed product will now be available to fans during its release week.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/oSpnpZgEKl" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/oSpnpZgEKl</a></p>— Pokémon TCG (@PokemonTCG) <a href="https://twitter.com/PokemonTCG/status/2016587217083199505?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 28, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The new set is already getting a fairly staggered release, with the majority of products now releasing between February 20 and April 24. That includes some of the most popular items from a new Pokémon card set, such as the Elite Trainer Box, Booster Bundles, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The delayed booster set features a promo card with either Erika’s Tangela or Larry’s Komala, a metallic coin featuring the chosen Gym Leader, and two booster packs from the <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/uk/pokemon-news/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-ascended-heroes-product-showcase" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mega Evolution - Ascended Heroes expansion</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The only new booster set available in release week will be the Ascended Heroes Tech Sticker Collection, featuring Charmander and Ghastly as a foil promo card, plus a sheet of tech stickers featuring Mega Charizard Y and Mega Gengar, plus three Ascended Heroes boosters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's already been hard to come by Ascended Heroes preorders, and undoubtedly this delay won't make it any easier for fans after release day. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-ascended-heroes-sealed-products-are-up-for-preorder-at-tcgplayer">Ascended Heroes ETBs</a>, for example, are currently averaging around <a href="https://zdcs.link/QOjX3M?object_uuid=3e050d85-f909-4c14-bed0-d0f49191e04d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$115-120 on resale markets</a> - around a 135% markup from its MSRP of $49.99.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ascended Heroes' Booster Bundles are also looking a little steep right now, and sit at $79.10 market price. That's a fair lot more than its $26.94 list price, roughly a 194% markup, and almost triple the cost for what accounts for just six boosters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a similar story across the board, with fans likely to find it tough to find boosters from the new expansion outside of retailers like TCGplayer. That's also consistent with the follow up expansion for Mega Evolution, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-perfect-order-sealed-products-are-up-for-preorder-at-tcgplayer">Perfect Order</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ascended Heroes being hard to come by won't be surprising for most fans. The scarcity of the Mega Evolution series isn't exactly an outlier for Pokémon TCG, with stock issues, lack of common availibility, and delays plaguing the world's most popular trading card game for the past couple of years, at least, and stretches back through its Scarlet and Violet series as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Robert Anderson, Senior Commerce Editor, and IGN's resident deals expert on games, collectibles, trading card games, and more.

<p>It's been a cracking start to the year for Nintendo-themed LEGO sets, and one of the builds we're the most excited about is the upcoming 'Final Battle' diorama, inspired by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/legend_of_zelda_ocarina_of_time">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a>'s grand finale.</p>
<p>The set itself launches on <strong>1st March 2026</strong> for <strong>£99.99 / $129.99</strong>, packing in three Minifigures for Link, Zelda and Ganondorf, plus a big 'mech' build for ol' boar-form Ganon. Naturally, there are a handful of little easter eggs sprinkled in for fans as well, like a tiny Navi that accompanies Link in his airborne pose, and a hidden Megaton Hammer in the ruins of Ganondorf's Castle.</p>
<p>Before it hits store shelves, however, LEGO reviewer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TiagoCatarino">Tiago Catarino</a> has gone hands-on with the set and provided a five-minute deep dive into its intricacies to give us our best look at it yet. The video provides a closer look at the stunning Zelda and Ganon Minifigs (the Link remains the same from the Deku Tree set), and the big Ganondorf build.</p>
<p>It also lets us get up close and personal with the diorama design itself, showcasing the castle backdrop without any of the characters in it, and the secret 'trapdoor' hatch from which Ganondorf can spring out for a surprise attack.</p>
<p>All in all, it looks really rather neat — and not as pricey as we'd expect, after seeing the Deku Tree and recently-revealed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/lego-pokemon-reveals-first-sets-launches-february-2026">Pokémon sets</a>. Gosh, we're going to have to clear some shelf space, aren't we?</p>
