			<p>NVIDIA has released a new <a href="https://dlss.download.nvidia.com/demos/bonsaidiorama/2025.10.07_BonsaiDioramaDemo_NvRTX_5.6.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">downloadable 'Bonsai Diorama' demo</a> that shows off DLSS 4, path tracing, and RTX Mega Geometry. The Bonsai Diorama demo accompanies the latest update of the Unreal Engine RTX branch (version 5.6.1), showcasing RTX Mega Geometry alongside ReSTIR PT (which just received performance and image quality improvements) and the full DLSS 4 technology suite (DLSS Super Resolution, DLSS Ray Reconstruction, and DLSS Frame Generation).</p>



<p>If you wish to try the demo, NVIDIA says the minimum graphics card is a GeForce RTX 2080Ti, while the recommended one is the GeForce RTX 5060. Also, you should be using the GeForce driver 581.29 or newer.</p>



<p>NVIDIA also warns that the resolution and window settings can only be adjusted in the main menu, before actually launching into the Bonsai Diorama demo level. You should start the demo with full screen; if using an 8 GB GPU, start with 1080p or 1440p. If you use an 11 GB GPU or higher, try 4K resolution.</p>



<p>Once in the demo, you can toggle the user interface by pressing H. Here, you can toggle RTX Mega Geometry and Ray Reconstruction on and off and tweak DLSS Super Resolution (Off, DLAA, Auto, Quality, Balanced, Performance, Ultra Performance) and Frame Generation (Off, Auto, 2x, 3x, 4x). </p>

</p></figure>



<p>The main feature being showcased here is really RTX Mega Geometry, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-rtx-mega-geometry-performance-vram-improvements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">debuted in Remedy's Alan Wake 2 with a patch showing performance improvements</a>. In this case, though, NVIDIA focuses on the image quality benefits:</p>



<p><em>RTX Mega Geometry adds full quality Nanite geometry to the ray tracing bounding volume hierarchy (BVH). As a result, ray traced shadows and reflections no longer exhibit visual artifacts typically present with Unreal Engine 5's default behavior.</em></p>

<p>A webinar is <a href="https://gateway.on24.com/wcc/experience/elitenvidiabrill/1407606/3849291/level-up-with-nvidia?linkId=100000374605923" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scheduled</a> for Thursday, October 28, at 10 AM Pacific Time. Developers will be able to ask questions about the Bonsai Diorama demo and its featured technologies.</p>



<p>In other NVIDIA news, <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/ace-for-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ACE</a> (Avatar Cloud Engine) can now use the open-source Qwen3-8B AI model as an In-Game Inferencing (IGI) SDK plug-in. This simplifies integration within a developer's pipeline and optimizes the simultaneous processing of AI and graphics for accelerated game performance. Qwen3 enables developers to create enhanced game characters that can reason in real time through non-scripted events and respond dynamically to player inputs and contextual information.</p>



<p>Alongside the release of Qwen3-8B, NVIDIA also made several improvements to the core IGI SDK:</p>



<ul>
<li>MultiLORA adapters to quickly fine-tune model weights with minimal computational overhead</li>



<li>CUDA support for graphics with Vulkan backends, which optimizes graphics and AI workloads for accelerated performance when both are running simultaneously.</li>
</ul>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/battlefield-6-season-1-preview-phase-1-begins-october-28</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-season-1-preview-california-dreaming.1332013/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With <em>Battlefield 6</em> out now and doing quite well for itself in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/battlefield-6-multiplayer-preview-all-out-warfare-in-mirak-valley-and-operation" rel="nofollow">multiplayer</a> action sphere – as we detailed in our <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/battlefield-6-review-war-on-unprecedented-scale" rel="nofollow">full review</a> – it’s time to turn our attention towards what’s next for EA’s biggest game of the year. We’re just under a week away from Season 1. Launching on October 28 and across three phases over time in an effort to bring high-quality content to players at regular intervals.</p>

<p>The first phase of content will open with Rogue Ops, which includes a new map known as Blackwell Fields, and a new 4v4 mode called Strikepoint. In the second phase, starting on November 18, we’ll see California Resistance and the addition of another new map called Eastwood.</p>

<p>Then, on December 9, Winter Offensive will begin with a seasonal update to the existing Empire State map.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/20251021181326_1.jpg?itok=6bfODZKw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/20251021181326_1.jpg?itok=9x9Lk7bZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Each <em>Battlefield 6</em> season will include new weapons, maps, modes, as well as vehicles, and more. All of this content is being promised for free from the start, or is earnable on free tiers in the Battle Pass.</p>

<p>Digging into Rogue Ops specifically, it’s themed around high-stakes ops in pursuit of military secrets in the first all-new map: Blackwell Fields. While it’s a large map set in the Californian Chaparral and built for all-out warfare, there’s a good amount of structures that lean heavily into standoff with outdoor combat.</p>

<p>We got to try out this map in the Close-Quarters Battle mode, which meant smaller team sizes and up close and personal fights. Right away, it’s easy to see why this map is ideal for the selected mode.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can duck in and out of military installations and homesteads scattered across the land. Everything is dusty and dirty, and fires scatter the area, which makes it harder to see clearly in some aspects.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/20251021201408_1.jpg?itok=4h8jDo8g 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/20251021201408_1.jpg?itok=Iq-2VO-3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>New weapons available during this phase include the SCAR SC .300, which excels at close-quarters combat. There’s also the Glock 22 and the Mini Fix Bolt-Action rifle for long-distance attacks.</p>

<p>There’s also a new vehicle available – an APC called the Traverser Mark 2, which operates as an Infantry Support vehicle that offers up a spawn point and a supply station or other vehicles on your team. Rogue Ops and the Blackwell Fields map will run from October 28 to November 11, with Phase 2 to follow.</p>

<p>California Resistance is an apt name for the next round of Season 1 because it further explores another area of the region where both NATO and the local militia are trying to defend California from PAX’s incursion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The map coming up here is called Eastwood, is set in a quiet and upscale Southern California neighborhood – well, formerly quiet because now there’s a warzone running through it, and every part of it can be chaotic but also used to your advantage.</p>

<p>Trying out the All-Out-Warfare mode, it’s easy to see how this area has become a complete battlefield, and you’ll be fighting in and around houses, blowing them apart, and riding around in tanks and other vehicles to add to the destruction.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/20251021181509_1.jpg?itok=SEcq-bGQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/20251021181509_1.jpg?itok=8AJ9J0GV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This phase will also introduce a limited-time mode to<em> Battlefield 6</em> called Sabotage, in which two teams of eight attack and defend supply caches on the map. Attackers and defenders will swap sides after each round to mix things up, and destroying the most caches will net a win for the match.</p>

<p>Battle Pickups will also debut during this phase, which are high-value, rare weapons with limited ammunition but can do major damage to enemies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>New weapons will include the DP-12 shotgun, which has different ammo types in each of its tubes, and the 8-shot S&amp;W M327 revolver.</p>

<p>Phase 3 of the season will turn towards winter, and while details remain sparse for now, it’ll launch ahead of the holidays with a winter-themed Empire State map. Following that, players can expect Season 2 to drop within the new year.</p>

            <p>
You might be currently wondering where the latest <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> patch is, seeing as it hasn't turned up yet, and to explain its absence developer Arrowhead have taken to the game's Witter account with a post going into some details about it. Apparently it was originally planned for Tuesday, i.e. yesterday, October 21st, but a "last-minute certification issue caused a delay."
</p>
<p>
As a result, the studio is currently aiming for a release by the end of the week, with "staff ready to work over the weekend if needed." On that point, hope you pay good overtime and will give said staff members time off in kind, Arrowhead! However, you also shouldn't hold them to it, as they also say there's a chance the issue won't be fixed by this Friday, meaning the patch could be delayed even further into next week. "We’re doing everything we can to deliver it this week and will provide an update on Friday either way. Thanks for your patience and understanding," explains Arrowhead.
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Freedoms greetings Helldivers,</p><p>We want to share an update on our most recent patch. It was originally planned for Tuesday, but a last-minute certification issue caused a delay.

<p>
The post goes on to note how Arrowhead has <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-director-confirms-arrowhead-are-biting-the-addition-delay-bullet-while-working-on-performance-fixes">pushed back things like Warbonds</a> to focus fixing up performance, and outlined some of the optimisations coming to the game whenever the next patch launches. This includes things like optimised status effects, physics, asset distribution and setup, VFX, and AI behaviours. 
</p>
<p>
There should also be reduced stuttering during the drop-in sequence for missions on Hive Worlds, improved audio IO performance and general performance. Generally sounds like it'll be a good patch for smoothing over some of its current snaggly bits. You just have to wait a bit longer for it!

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/trials-developer-ubisoft-redlynx-to-lose-60-employees-in-layoffs-become-a-mobile-developer.1332004/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ubisoft Redlynx, the developers of the Trails franchise, is set to lose up to 60 employees in the latest round of layoffs by parent company Ubisoft. </p>



<p>A statement posted on <a href="https://www.redlynx.com/restructuring-proposal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the studio’s website</a> says that Ubisoft is moving forward with a <strong>“restructuring proposal for RedLynx as part of the company’s global efforts to simplify, reduce costs, and ensure a stronger prioritization and efficiency across the company’s worldwide studio network.”</strong></p>



<p>Redlynx says that it will negotiate with studio staff before making a decision on the proposal, which focuses “primarily” on the administration and production teams. These negotiations with the staff are scheduled to start on October 30 and will end by the end of November.</p>



<p><strong>“If materialized, this proposal would result in the reduction of maximum 60 positions,” </strong>they say.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-ubisoft-proposal-for-redlynx">What Is The Ubisoft Proposal For Redlynx?</h2>



<p>As far as what this proposal entails, it was said that Redlynx would “refocus” from being a multi-platform developer to one that’s “specialized in small screens”. </p>



<p>“This would enable it to position itself for sustainable success and optimize its resources to best leverage the studio’s unique expertise—starting with two unannounced mobile projects the studio is leading,” the statement reads.</p>



<p>Ubisoft RedLynx managing director Celine Pasula added that, “We are confident that, with the proposed changes, RedLynx would continue to play a meaningful role in Ubisoft’s future—driving technical excellence on mobile devices, and strengthening Ubisoft’s cross and multi-platform capabilities on small screens to expand our audience reach.”</p>



<p>The news of layoffs at Ubisoft RedLynx comes alongside the announcement that another Ubisoft studio, Massive Entertainment, was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-massive-entertainment-is-laying-off-staff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">having its own wave</a> of job terminations.</p>

                <p>The idea of exclusive games in 2025 is "antiquated," according to Xbox president Sarah Bond. She said in a new interview that people are beginning to "evolve way past" the idea that a game should be exclusive to one store or device.</p><p>"The biggest games in the world are available everywhere. You look at Call of Duty, you look at Minecraft, you look at Fortnite, you look at Roblox ... that's actually what's really driving community in gaming. That's where people gather. And the idea of locking it to one store or one device is antiquated for most people," she told <a href="https://youtu.be/yDmwJ7tuoD8?si=GKqqs8S6R2L7458R" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mashable</a>.</p><p>"You want to be able to play with your friends anywhere, regardless of what they're on. And we're really leaning into that with this experience [<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rog-xbox-ally-is-good-hardware-let-down-by-annoying-software/1100-6535471/" data-ref-id="1100-6535471">Rog Ally X</a>]. It just opens up another way for you to play, as does cloud, as does PC as do the consoles we all have in the living room," she added.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDmwJ7tuoD8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="435">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yDmwJ7tuoD8?start=435" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Microsoft was once a big believer in exclusive games, but the company has updated its business strategy and has in recent times opted to release its games in more places, including rival systems.</p><p>For Sony, the company has also begun to bring more of its games to places beyond PlayStation, including PC and, in the case of Helldivers 2, Xbox. Nintendo, however, only releases its own games for its own exclusive platforms, and that's proven to be good business for the company.</p><p>Microsoft does not have one single strategy it applies to all of its game releases, as some titles are released across multiple platforms simultaneously, others are not. One of the next Xbox games that could make the jump to PlayStation is Starfield, with a report saying <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-on-ps5-wont-be-announced-until-2026-report/1100-6535565/" data-ref-id="1100-6535565">this will be announced in 2026.</a></p><p>In other news, Microsoft is reportedly gearing up to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-halo-game-may-be-like-fortnite-with-live-service-report/1100-6535547/" data-ref-id="1100-6535547">announce a Halo: Combat Evolved remake, and it might be in the works for PS5.</a></p><p>Microsoft was also in the news recently regarding Bond's comments about the next Xbox console, labeling it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-next-xbox-will-be-high-end-with-a-curated-experience-xbox-president-says/1100-6535604/" data-ref-id="1100-6535604">"high-end"</a> and prompting fears from fans that it will be very expensive.</p>

<p>"That's me--I play games without killing to see if it's possible," he wrote in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1oakv3h/comment/nke465l/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">comment</a> a few days ago on Reddit. "For anyone interested, I'm now level 42 in 25 hours, I mostly finish top 5 scores in the game, most revives in 1 life is 47, I have 40.6% of my time on objective which puts me in the top 0.2% of players."</p><p>He didn't go into detail about those eight players that fell to him, although they could have been enemy soldiers who were trying to finish off the players he was saving.</p><p>Pacifist runs have become increasingly popular in multiplayer games that give players enough freedom to make it possible. We've seen them in other shooters and battle royales like Call of Duty: Warzone and Fortnite where players either hide or avoid combat until the last possible moment.</p><p>ThatFriendlyGuyTTV could probably make a Battlefield 6 version of Hacksaw Ridge, a dramatic and cinematic telling of the story of Desmond Doss. He was an American combat medic who saved 75 soldiers in Okinawa without firing a single shot.</p>

  </div><p dir="ltr">As for other Sony hardware, the company reportedly stopped issuing sales figures for PS4 in 2022, when the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps4-sales-reach-117-2-million-units-as-production-winds-down/1100-6506319/#:~:text=PS4%20Sales%20Reach%20117.2%20Million%20Units%20As%20Production%20Winds%20Down%20-%20GameSpot">system sat at roughly 117 units sold</a>. The PS2 is the best-selling system of all time, with Sony producing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-many-ps2s-sony-made-in-its-lifetime/1100-6528175/">over 160 million consoles</a> from 2000 to 2013. There is a chance--though possibly a small one at this point--that Switch could catch up to PS2. As of August, Nintendo had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-sales-blast-past-expectations-now-6-million-globally/1100-6533625/">sold more than 153 million Switch systems</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Circana shared September 2025 video game industry sales data for the US earlier today. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-had-the-biggest-launch-in-franchise-history-in-the-us/1100-6535624/">Borderlands 4 had the biggest launch in history for the looter-shooter series</a>, when accounting for dollar sales. Piscatella noted Borderlands 4 was performing "30% higher than the previous best, Borderlands 3" for launch dollar sales. Meanwhile, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-switch-2-release-has-been-delayed/1100-6534965/">Switch 2 port of Borderlands 4 has been delayed indefinitely</a>.</p>

Along with the electronic toy, this bundle comes with a playing surface depicting 151 Pokemon and a few tokens to track the action.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DW681M4R,B0DW6BJC2R,B0DW617BXC,B0DW66TD8K,B0DW6913FS&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DW681M4R,B0DW6BJC2R,B0DW617BXC,B0DW66TD8K,B0DW6913FS&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DW681M4R,B0DW6BJC2R,B0DW617BXC,B0DW66TD8K,B0DW6913FS&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20">Pokemon Trainer Guess</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DW681M4R,B0DW6BJC2R,B0DW617BXC,B0DW66TD8K,B0DW6913FS&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DW681M4R,B0DW6BJC2R,B0DW617BXC,B0DW66TD8K,B0DW6913FS&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DW681M4R,B0DW6BJC2R,B0DW617BXC,B0DW66TD8K,B0DW6913FS&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20">$28</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>This is essentially the opposite of the Pokemon Trainer Expert: Guessing Board Game.

<p>Dotemu has finally revealed that the hotly anticipated beat 'em up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/marvel-cosmic-invasion">MARVEL Cosmic Invasion</a> will assemble on Switch and Switch 2 on <strong>1st December 2025</strong>. What's more, it's lifted the lid on two new characters in the roster.</p>
<p>Aside from giving us the release date, the all-new trailer also gives us our first look at Iron Man and Phoenix, the final two fighters in the game's 15-hero line-up. <strong>Spectacular Spider-Man</strong>'s Josh Keaton will be lending his vocal talents to Tony Stark, while <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/bayonetta_3">Bayonetta 3</a>'s Jennifer Hale will voice Jean Grey — the same character she voiced in <strong>X-Men '97</strong>.</p>
<p>Yep, these were the two names unearthed in an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/marvel-cosmic-invasion-demo-datamine-leaks-more-heroes">earlier datamine</a> of the game's Steam demo, but hey, it's still exciting to see them in action. Here's a closer look at the new pair:</p>

<p>With these two newbies, the full launch character roster is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Captain America</li>
<li>Wolverine</li>
<li>Spider-Man</li>
<li>Storm</li>
<li>Phyla-Vell</li>
<li>Venom</li>
<li>Nova</li>
<li>She-Hulk</li>
<li>Rocket Raccoon</li>
<li>Silver Surfer</li>
<li>Beta Ray Bill</li>
<li>Black Panther</li>
<li>Cosmic Ghost Rider</li>
<li>Iron Man</li>
<li>Phoenix</li>
</ul>
<p>It's a strong collection, and every new trailer sells us even more on the beat 'em up gameplay — if <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles_shredders_revenge">Shredder's Revenge</a> is anything to go by, we're in for a treat.</p>

<p>Other notable entries for this back-half of October additions include Football Manager 26, which is set to be available on both PC and console. Commandos: Origins, and the survival roguelike Hall of Torment are also a couple of noteworthy titles entering the service.</p>



<p>With regards to the games that are entering Game Pass on their launch day for Game Pass Ultimate subscribers, those titles are: PowerWash Simulator 2, The Outer Worlds 2, Bounty Star, Super Fantasy Kingdom, and Football Manager 26.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of games entering Xbox Game Pass for the remainder of October 2025, what platforms they're playable on, and what tiers they're available at:</p>

            <p>Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth, whenever it is a damp, drizzly October in my soul, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. Specifically, I dream of cruise liners. I’ve never been on an ocean cruise, but I’ve been on at least two North Sea ferries and in my mind, cruise ships are paradise. 
</p>
<p>They are places of luxury and possibly a few exotic murders - ocean-going adventurelands that perversely harbour swimming pools and waterslides. Imagine it, a boat with a pool. Such delicious unreason. Here to disabuse me of these visions is No More Robot’s Cruise Control, which makes cruise ships look like hell.

<p>It's a management sim created by a team who include former <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overcooked">Overcooked</a> developers, but for all the ability to construct "fine dining" facilities, I see little of Overcooked’s saucy joyfulness in the trailer. I see suffocating bingo halls and arcade machines crammed together like tombstones. I see crowds so dense the people have no choice but to walk through each other.</p><p>I see trash and vomit and despairing janitors. I see carpet patterns that follow like a tedious argument of insidious intent. I see potted cinemas that resemble factory farm incubators. I see dollar signs floating up from smiling, empty heads. Worst of all, I can’t see any waterslides or swimming pools.
</p>
<p>You wish to know what it’s like to <em>participate</em> in this inhumane simulation, this abject spawn of the Bermuda triangle? Very well. Cruise Control looks like a familiar rhythm of ensuring your ship has the facilities to keep your customers happy, while avoiding long queues to attractions and mechanical breakdowns. The more guests you serve, the more amenities you’ll acquire and upgrade. Perhaps there’s a waterslide to unlock, once enough bodies have been fed to the dancefloors. Fail to amuse the clientele sufficiently, and they'll send you direct to Davey Jones' Locker. Fools! We are all already there.
</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3973220/Cruise_Control/">read more on Steam</a>. It’s out in 2026, and is the work of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/not-tonight">Not Tonight</a> developers No More Robots. No More Robots are also publishers – their recent signings include <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2451100/Little_Rocket_Lab/">Little Rocket Lab</a>, a Stardew factory sim that I have downloaded the demo for and feel guilty about not playing yet. Final anecdote: I have a musician friend who once worked on a cruise liner. He lives on a boat now. I'm not sure he's really my friend. Perhaps my friend is still out there, queuing for bingo in the doldrums, and some creature of the deep sea has stolen his face.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/pikmin-5-free-update-sequel-switch-2-miyamoto-2000638244</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo%E2%80%99s-being-real-weird-about-pikmin-all-of-a-sudden.1331944/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Nintendo has a history of making weird announcements out of the blue. Remember last year’s alarm clock? But even in its current chaotic era of tweeting out game reveals and doing hour-long follow-up livestreams for games like <em>Kirby Air Riders</em>, Wednesday’s <em>Pikmin 4</em> announcement is low-key bizarre.</p> <p>The <em>Mario</em> maker revealed its 2023 strategy adventure game will be getting a free update two years later. But not for the newly released Switch 2. Instead, <em>Pikmin 4</em> will get new content in November for the original Switch version. That game can be played on the new hardware, obviously, but an official Switch 2 upgrade remains nowhere in sight. Hmmm.</p>

 <p>The meat of the update revolves around new cross-functionality between <em>Pikmin 4</em> and <em>Pikmin Bloom</em>, the augmented-reality mobile spin-off by the creators of <em>Pokémon Go</em>. Decor Pikmin, which wear funny outfits and were previously only available in <em>Bloom</em>, can now be found in <em>Pikmin 4</em> and transferred back and forth between both games. Meanwhile, <em>Pikmin 4</em>‘s Ice Pikmin will be joining <em>Bloom</em> for the first time to mark that game’s fourth anniversary.</p>

  <p>The rest of the update includes a camera mode for <em>Pikmin 4</em> and new difficulty settings to make the game easier or more challenging. There’s also now a free demo for the game on the eShop. <em>Pikmin 4</em> sold <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2023/231107_4e.pdf">over 2.5 million copies</a>, making it the best-selling game in the franchise that began back on the GameCube, but still far from one of the platform’s bigger first-party sellers.</p>

 <p>So why <em>Pikmin</em>? Why now? And why on the original Switch? Nintendo hasn’t shied away from making DLC and packaging it with paid “next-gen upgrades” to push sales of older Switch games on the new hardware. At the same time, this seems unlikely to feed into any meaningful holiday resurgence in<em> Pikmin 4</em> for the original console, with the update wedged in-between <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> and <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>.</p>

 <h2>Is Nintendo laying the groundwork for <em>Pikmin 5</em> or something completely different?</h2> <p>There’s also the extra weirdness with this update coming just after Nintendo released a couple of Pixar-like <em>Pikmin</em> shorts. <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-pikmin-short-animated-film-mario-zelda-app-2000633651">It claims</a> those were tests to prove out the capabilities of its new internal Nintendo Pictures team, but the company rarely does random one-offs on a whim. Could this all be laying the groundwork for Nintendo’s next <em>Pikmin</em> project? And will that be a full-fledged <em>Pikmin </em>sequel, a <em>Pikmin</em>-centric movie or TV series, or a more unorthodox venture in the toy or theme park realm?</p>

 <p>There’s also the Shigeru Miyamoto factor. The famed Nintendo developer created the <em>Pikmin</em> franchise and it clearly lives near and dear to his heart. Would <em>Pikmin 4</em> have even happened without him pushing for it? He told press it was close to completion back in 2015, only for it to lay dormant until it was suddenly re-revealed in 2022 and released the following year.</p>

 <p><em>Pikmin 4</em> is also notable among Nintendo’s first-party projects for being made in Unreal Engine 4. There’s also that mysterious MMO playtest Nintendo performed exactly a year ago this week. It included <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-playtest-switch-2-mario-mmo-1851677142">world-crafting mechanics and user-generated content references</a> that suggested things like <em>Minecraft</em> and <em>Roblox</em> were possible inspirations.</p> <p>Could Nintendo be prepping a <em>Pikmin</em> crossover with <em>Fortnite</em>? Will the next <em>Pikmin</em> game be Nintendo’s ambitious take on the survival crafting MMO genre? Will Miyamoto return to development to make it the last game he ever directs? Or is Nintendo just throwing hardcore <em>Pikmin 4</em> stans one last bone before the franchise goes dark for another decade?</p>

Its first Gadget slot is dedicated to actual weapons, including the all-powerful M87A1 shotgun, carbines, and other decent guns. So, to compensate for that, we're listing two other Gadgets you can use in the second slot.</p><p>The Gadgets we've gone with are the Deploy Beacon and the Assault Ladder. The Deploy Beacon is extremely useful for flanking enemies and squadding up with your teammates, while the Assault Ladder can be used for a variety of reasons, including forgoing the need for stairs to reach a second-level building.</p><h3 id="Engineer_class">Engineer class</h3><p>Next up is Engineer, and it has access to some of the most varied and useful Gadgets in the entire game. As this class's goal is to take out vehicles, you'll find a slew of rocket launchers and other anti-vehicle equipment in the Gadgets section. Here's our picks for the best overall Engineer Gadgets:</p><ul><li>RPG-7V2</li><li>Supply Crate</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4589151-battlefield6screenshot2025.10.22-00.25.31.50.png" data-ref-id="1300-4589151" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4589151-battlefield6screenshot2025.10.22-00.25.31.50.png" data-ref-id="1300-4589151"></a><figcaption>The RPG-7V2 for the Engineer class</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4589151-battlefield6screenshot2025.10.22-00.25.31.50.png"></figure><p>The RPG-7V2 is our choice for the best rocket launcher Gadget you can use for the Engineer class. The rockets are unguided and can be fired relatively fast, making them perfect for taking out ground vehicles quickly. You can also hit some incredible clips if you manage to destroy a helicopter or jet with an RPG shot.</p><p>On the opposite end of the spectrum, there's the Supply Crate. Not only can this help solve the ammunition problem for your teammates in Battlefield 6, but it also allows you to constantly reload a vehicle's weapons without the need for the vehicle to visit a dedicated resupply station on the map.</p><h3 id="Support_class">Support class</h3><p>Support is far and away the most team-friendly class in Battlefield 6, and one of its Gadget slots is essentially filled before you even enter a match for the first time. If you've played Support, you know what Gadget we're talking about. As for the other slot, though, check out our pick for that Gadget below:</p><ul><li>Defibrillator</li><li>M320A1 SMK</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4589152-battlefield6screenshot2025.10.22-00.27.00.48.png" data-ref-id="1300-4589152" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4589152-battlefield6screenshot2025.10.22-00.27.00.48.png" data-ref-id="1300-4589152"></a><figcaption>The Defibrillator for the Support class</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4589152-battlefield6screenshot2025.10.22-00.27.00.48.png"></figure><p>The Defibrillator is basically a package deal with the Support class. It allows you to revive teammates instantly and can be used as a backup melee weapon if need be. You might as well not run Support if you're not going to use the Defibrillator.</p><p>The M320A1 SMK is our other Gadget pick for Support. This allows you to throw several smokescreens on the ground, allowing your team to reposition and not get picked off from a distance by snipers. You'll also clear any markers from enemies when you or a teammate runs into the smoke. This Gadget can replace a Smoke Grenade, but using the two together is even more powerful.</p><h3 id="Recon_class">Recon class</h3><p>Finally, there's the Recon class. This class is mostly reserved for sniper rifle players, as snipers are given massive advantages when running Recon. Whether you're using a sniper or not, though, you'll want these Gadgets on your loadout:</p><ul><li>Recon Drone</li><li>AP Mine</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4589153-battlefield6screenshot2025.10.22-00.27.41.74.png" data-ref-id="1300-4589153" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4589153-battlefield6screenshot2025.10.22-00.27.41.74.png" data-ref-id="1300-4589153"></a><figcaption>The AP Mine for the Recon class</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4589153-battlefield6screenshot2025.10.22-00.27.41.74.png"></figure><p>The Recon Drone might seem controversial for your first Gadget slot. While it won't impact your gameplay too much, it really helps out your team, as you can mark enemies continually as long as your drone doesn't get shot down. The Recon Drone also grants you incredible XP, which is hard to come by in Battlefield 6. If you're using a sniper, you can use the drone to scout out potential targets as well.</p><p>Our second pick is the AP Mine, which is basically a claymore that you can put down behind you as you set up in a cozy spot with your sniper or long-range weapon. As long as you place the mine in a hidden spot where enemies will run into it if they try to flank you, you're guaranteed a kill.</p><p>Use our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-guides-hub/1100-6533950/" data-ref-id="1100-6533950">Battlefield 6 guides hub</a> for lots more help on EA's massive shooter.</p>

                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a> is a PvPvE third-person extraction shooter set in an apocalyptic future. In this game, you strap on the boots of a scavenger who must collect valuable resources and gear from dangerous territory overrun with deadly robots and human threats. Like most extraction shooters, this game requires considerable risk to reap the best rewards. Our guide will provide you with some helpful tips for looting and staying alive in Arc Raiders.</p><p dir="ltr">Matches in Arc Raiders are called Raids, and they last for 30 minutes each. You can play solo or in a party of up to three players. You'll need to loot up and safely extract with your gear before the match ends in order to keep your stuff. If you’re eliminated or fail to extract, you'll lose everything on you--well, mostly everything, but we'll explain more on that below.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Basic_tips_for_solo_players">Basic tips for solo players</a><ul><li><a href="#Use_stealth_tactics">Use stealth tactics</a></li><li><a href="#Choose_your_fights_wisely">Choose your fights wisely</a></li><li><a href="#Approach_extraction_with_caution">Approach extraction with caution</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Plan_ahead_and_watch_the_time">Plan ahead and watch the time</a></li><li><a href="#Loadout_and_inventory_tips">Loadout and inventory tips</a><ul><li><a href="#Free_loadouts">Free loadouts</a></li><li><a href="#Know_what_weapons_to_bring">Know what weapons to bring</a></li><li><a href="#Don_t_let_your_guns_break">Don't let your guns break</a></li><li><a href="#Pick_the_right_shield">Pick the right shield</a></li><li><a href="#Make_the_best_use_of_your_inventory_space">Make the best use of your inventory space</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Movement_and_combat_tips">Movement and combat tips</a><ul><li><a href="#Drop_and_roll">Drop and roll</a></li><li><a href="#Watch_for_sneaky_alarms">Watch for sneaky alarms</a></li><li><a href="#Combat_tips">Combat tips</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Base_tips_and_upgrades">Base tips and upgrades</a><ul><li><a href="#Visit_Scrappy_often">Visit Scrappy often</a></li><li><a href="#Invest_in_the_right_skills">Invest in the right skills</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="Basic_tips_for_solo_players">Basic tips for solo players</h2><p dir="ltr">While these are great tips for all players, they are especially useful if you're planning on playing Arc Raiders solo.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Use_stealth_tactics">Use stealth tactics</h3><p dir="ltr">Every little sound you make is dangerous in Arc Raiders. Footsteps, looting containers, opening doors. Every action you take creates audio cues that can be used against you. Likewise, listening carefully can help you use the same audio cues against others.</p><p dir="ltr">Crouch to make less movement noise, move cover-to-cover, and use light shields when possible for faster movement. Popping a smoke grenade can also be a great stealth tactic for looting, healing, or escaping a fight.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4589417-arcraiders_screenshot_tt2_14.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4589417" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4589417-arcraiders_screenshot_tt2_14.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4589417"></a><figcaption>Arc Raiders The Queen enemy type</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4589417-arcraiders_screenshot_tt2_14.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Choose_your_fights_wisely">Choose your fights wisely</h3><p dir="ltr">Some missions require you to fight Arc robot enemy types, but it's best to avoid them if you don't need to engage. You should choose gunfights wisely, as firing your weapon can alert nearby enemies to your location.</p><p dir="ltr">Check your surroundings and approach extraction points with caution. Sometimes players can be waiting to ambush others at the extraction points. Activating the lift at an extraction point also creates a lot of noise, so make sure you stay alert for potential enemies to arrive.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Plan_ahead_and_watch_the_time">Plan ahead and watch the time</h2><p dir="ltr">You'll want to go topside with a clear goal in mind. Raids have a maximum timer of 30 minutes. If you need a specific item for a quest or an upgrade, make sure you check your map locations right away, so you know exactly where you need to go. Each main POI will tell you what types of loot are available there.</p><p dir="ltr">Example: If you need a mechanical part, hover over the POIs to see which specifies mechanical loot.</p><p dir="ltr">Also, watch the timer and give yourself enough time to get to an extraction point. Each extraction point has its own timer to indicate how long the point will be active. Don't wait too long and end up at one of the last points active, as other teams might be fighting you for that same extraction.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4589420-arcraiders_screenshot_tt2_06.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4589420" data-ratio="0.56283783783784" data-width="1480" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4589420-arcraiders_screenshot_tt2_06.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4589420"></a><figcaption>Fighting robots in Arc Radiers</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4589420-arcraiders_screenshot_tt2_06.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="Loadout_and_inventory_tips">Loadout and inventory tips</h2><h3 dir="ltr" id="Free_loadouts">Free loadouts</h3><p dir="ltr">What happens if you lose all your gear? Don't worry, Arc Raiders never leaves you completely empty-handed. You always have the option to start a match with a free loadout. This won't be a very good offering of gear, but you'll have a random weapon and some equipment to use for each match.</p><p dir="ltr">Using the free loadout is great when you're just getting started and don't want to risk much. It's also good for regaining and building up your inventory after some tough losses.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Know_what_weapons_to_bring">Know what weapons to bring</h3><p dir="ltr">As mentioned above, you want to plan out your objective before you start the raid. This also helps to make sure you bring the right weapon types for the job. Heavy weapons with bullet penetration are best for robots, while guns with light or medium ammo types are all you'll need for human threats.</p><p dir="ltr">You'll probably want to conserve the heavy ammo and weapons unless you know you're going topside to fight big robots.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4589421-weapondurability.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4589421" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4589421-weapondurability.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4589421"></a><figcaption>Weapon details and durability</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4589421-weapondurability.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Don_t_let_your_guns_break">Don't let your guns break</h3><p dir="ltr">Weapons break in Arc Raiders. You'll want to be mindful of the durability of all your weapons. Highlight a weapon in your inventory to get its details and see what condition the item is in. You don't want to go into a fight with a gun that's on the verge of giving out on you. Make sure to make repairs when needed.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Pick_the_right_shield">Pick the right shield</h3><p dir="ltr">Consider your playstyle when picking a shield for your loadout. Shields are categorized as either heavy, medium, or light. Heavy and medium shields mitigate more damage but slow you down, while light shields mitigate less but are lighter, and you can move faster.</p><p dir="ltr">It's also worth mentioning that shields work differently from many other games. A shield doesn't completely block you from taking damage and instead only reduces how much damage you take. Each shield's description will detail the percentage of damage it will reduce, but it's important to remember that a shield won't save you in a fight if you're low on health. Always keep healing items available in case you take damage.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4589434-salvagingitems.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4589434" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4589434-salvagingitems.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4589434"></a><figcaption>Salvage items to free up your inventory</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4589434-salvagingitems.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Make_the_best_use_of_your_inventory_space">Make the best use of your inventory space</h3><p dir="ltr">At the start, you'll load into raids with 30 inventory spaces and one safe pocket slot, but you can get more space by equipping various bag types. Safe pocket slots are for your most important items. These are the <strong>only loot items you keep if you die</strong>. This is a good place to store high-value loot or quest items that you want to make sure you don't lose.</p><p dir="ltr">Your inventory will fill up really fast when looting, especially in the beginning, before you get a bag with extra space. This doesn't mean you should avoid or discard items you find. Try to hide and safely check your inventory while in the match to see if you're holding items that can be salvaged and into basic materials such as fabric and metal parts. These materials are highly stackable, and they can be salvaged mid-match to free up space.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, any required quest items you find are marked with a white diamond icon in the top left corner. This should help you better identify them, because these are items you'll want to hold on to.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Movement_and_combat_tips">Movement and combat tips</h2><h3 dir="ltr" id="Drop_and_roll">Drop and roll</h3><p dir="ltr">When jumping or falling from heights, press the crouch button right before falling to perform a roll and protect yourself from fall damage. This won't work from really tall heights, but you can save yourself from reasonable heights.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4589422-redalarm.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4589422" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4589422-redalarm.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4589422"></a><figcaption>Destroy these sneaky alarms</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4589422-redalarm.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Watch_for_sneaky_alarms">Watch for sneaky alarms</h3><p dir="ltr">Keep an eye out for small red lights. They can be subtle, but you'll often notice a red light on a car or inside a doorway. These are alarms, and getting close will trigger a noisy sound that gives away your position. You can melee the light to destroy the alarm.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Combat_tips">Combat tips</h3><p dir="ltr">There is an orange explosion and an audio cue when you break a player's shield. The killfeed will indicate with text to let you know you've knocked that player.</p><p dir="ltr">A knocked player sends up a flare. This can be seen by anyone in the area, so you don't want to linger too long, but listen for any approaching squadmates before finishing any kills and looting bodies. If they have teammates, they might be close. Knocked players also have a fair amount of health. Don't waste your ammo on them. Use your melee weapon to finish the kill.</p><p dir="ltr">Also, flares can be tricky. Don't assume you're going towards a flare to third-party a fight or loot potential bodies. Players can manually call flares if they have one to equip, and that can be a sly way to lure you into a trap.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Base_tips_and_upgrades">Base tips and upgrades</h2><p dir="ltr">Arc Raiders can feel tough in the beginning, especially if you are new to extraction shooters. There are ways to level up your character and experience while you are back home in your underground base inside Speranza. Make sure to utilize the workbench and other features to craft new items, recycle unwanted loot, and make upgrades to your gear.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4589423-scrappy.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4589423" data-ratio="0.56208791208791" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4589423-scrappy.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4589423"></a><figcaption>Scrappy the rooster</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4589423-scrappy.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Visit_Scrappy_often">Visit Scrappy often</h3><p dir="ltr">Scrappy is your rooster companion. Yes, a rooster. He'll gather small quantities of essential materials for you. Make sure to visit Scrappy after every raid, as he'll collect items for you during each match. He can also be trained to be more efficient at scavenging materials.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Invest_in_the_right_skills">Invest in the right skills</h3><p dir="ltr">You'll earn experience from your raids, and leveling up earns you skill points to invest in a skill tree. This skill tree is divided into three sections: Conditions, Mobility, and Survival.</p><p dir="ltr">Ultimately, how you choose your skill points will depend on your playstyle and if your focus is on looting, fighting, or movement-based skills. However, you can pull skills from all three tiers, which will give you a pretty well-rounded character.</p><p dir="ltr">Skills good for solo players include:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Agile Croucher </strong>to increase your movement speed while crouching</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Silent Scavenger</strong> to make less noise when looting</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>In-Round Crafting</strong> to gain the ability to craft items mid-match</li></ul>

<p>But producer Kensuke Tanabe decided against it</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure data-uuid="359443003808c"><a title="Metroid Prime Remastered" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/359443003808c/metroid-prime-remastered.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo is shortly launched <strong>Metroid Prime 1-3: A Visual Retrospective</strong>, a new art book looking at concept art for the original trilogy on GameCube and Wii (with a small section dedicated to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_remastered">Metroid Prime Remastered</a>).</p>
<p>Speaking of the more recent Switch remaster, the book reveals that Retro Studios had originally proposed completely new cutscenes for the game. However, in a producer's note, Kensuke Tanabe confirmed that he opted against this approach.</p>

<p>"However, I came to the decision to closely observe the cutscenes from the GameCube version and replicate them essentially as they were. The reason for this choice was that the cutscenes were not created solely for dramatic effect; they also played a role in conveying gameplay-relevant information to the player. Each scene was carefully crafted with this purpose in mind. Retro demonstrated exceptional professionalism and fully adhered to this direction."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interesting, huh? It's hard to imagine what this cutscene prototype might have looked like, but our assumption is that it might have been something akin to Halo 2: Anniversary. That game, remastered by Halo Studios (then 343 Industries) took the original Bungie-created cutscenes and revamped them from the ground up.</p>
<p>Still, we fully understand Tanabe's reasoning here. The cutscenes do provide a lot of information to the player regarding gameplay mechanics, so we can't be too mad. The final product looks pretty amazing as it is, after all!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>As 2025 approaches its final months, AI becomes more and more a subject of discussion across all industries, including game development. The games industry has long utilized artificial intelligence to populate its virtual worlds. Still, with the veritable explosion of generative AI in the last few years and the concurrent ballooning of game budgets and development timelines, some developers have been exploring whether it could be used to reduce costs and production time.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/starfinder-afterlight-qa-even-after-bg3-not-many-are-jumping-into-crpgs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In our most recent interview with independent developer Epictellers Entertainment</a> about their upcoming cRPG Starfinder: Afterlight, we asked the Spanish team their opinion on the thorny matter. CEO and co-founder Richard Pillosu was crystal-clear: he'd like AI to help him with daily tasks around the house, but he doesn't really want it to touch any creative areas.</p>



<p><em>The problem with AI is that AI should be doing the things that we don't want to do, and it seems that it wants to do the things that we want to do. We want to do games. We want to invent characters. We want to invent worlds. We want to draw them. We want to invent them for that. Why? We don't want AI for that. I mean, this is the fun part of video game development. I would like an AI that does my dishes and cleans my apartment. Then I can stay creative. But we don't have the AI for that. It seems that the AI that we are being pushed into is the AI that removes this kind of creativity. So, no, no. We could be doing other stuff, but we jumped into making games because we truly love inventing those things and seeing how we connect those things. There is no point in using AI for any creative endeavor. So, no, we don't like it.</em></p>



<p>Famous video game designer and director Hideo Kojima <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-sees-creating-together-with-ai-way-stay-one-step-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently shared his own take on AI</a>, calling it 'a friend' that will help him stay ahead. However, he also noted that he wants AI to do the menial tasks while he focuses on the creative part, so in that regard, he is aligned with Pillosu.</p>



<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://wccftech.com/discussing-ghost-of-yoteis-lord-saito-with-actor-feodor-chin-he-and-atsu-are-really-two-sides-of-the-same-coin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we interviewed actor Feodor Chin</a>, too, who provided a similar take from his point of view:</p>



<p><em>I think, like with any technology, there is a place for AI as a tool, but I don't think it should ever be a replacement for human beings.</em></p>



<p>Will the games industry be able to use the latest advancements in artificial intelligence to allow humans to give their best creatively without replacing jobs? That remains to be seen, but we'll continue to gauge the opinions within the industry and the various implementations of the development studios.</p>

            <p>
Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/palworld">Palworld</a> developer Pocketpair used its newfound success to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworlds-creators-are-paying-the-kenzera-devs-to-make-a-horror-game-about-the-entertainment-industry">start a publishing arm</a>. This, I think, is generally a net good, even if I have some feelings about the studio as a whole, which we'll dig into shortly. Nobody has money in this industry except for the few who do, so when a few of the few who do decide to put some of that money into much smaller games, that is somewhat of a win. But heed this warning from Pocketpair's communications director and publishing manager John Buckley: they won't publish your game if you use generative AI.
</p>
<p>
Buckley recently spoke with <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-we-don-t-believe-in-it-palworld-maker-pocketpair-wont-be-publishing-games-that-use-generative-ai">Game Developer</a>, saying that he just "doesn't believe" in AI as a technology. Worth noting is that many often accuse Pocketpair of using the stuff in Palworld, a point Buckley does acknowledge: "People are going to say I'm lying, but these are just the hard facts. We don't believe in it. We're very upfront about it. If you're big on AI stuff or your game is Web3 or uses NFTs, there are lots of publishers out there [who'll talk to you], but we're not the right partner for that."
</p>
<p>
Buckley does also know we're seeing more and more games releasing on Steam that he describes as "low quality, AI-made," but to counteract that he thinks "think we're going to enter this kind of authenticity market where people are going to slowly say 'no, these guys are really trying to make something special' to fight back."
</p>
<p>
I do think it's worth highlighting the slight bit of irony here. The quality of Palworld notwithstanding, it is incredibly hard to argue that it doesn't harbour similar issues that AI has. Many of the Pal designs are a regurgitation of various Pokemon designs, but worse, or even more crude, removing them from their original contexts, or assigning them new ones that don't make much sense.
</p><p>
I'm not exactly thrilled that one of the poster creatures, that big yellow guy you can see up in the featured image, is essentially My Neighbour Totoro's titular beastie but with a gatling gun, personally. Everyone knows how anti-war Hayao Miyazaki is! It genuinely is great to hear a studio like Pocketpair, which has the financial capability to back other, smaller independent games, take a stance against AI. I just also hope that they look at the tech steadily encroaching on the games industry, and think about the ways they might perpetuate its aesthetic sensibilities.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-steam-record-login-queue-multiplayer-download-issue-2000634042">Battlefield 6</a>‘</em>s first season launches soon across consoles and PC, and it promises new maps, modes, vehicles, and weapons. I was recently invited to check out some of this new content ahead of next week’s release. If you’ve been wanting a new, giant map, this season will give you that. Eventually.</p> <p>Season one of <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-review-steam-ps5-campaign-multiplayer-2000633379"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> launches on October 28 and brings with it a lot of new and completely free content. <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-two-new-maps-modes-roadmap-free-updates-dlc-2025-ea-2000630301">As outlined in EA’s previously released roadmap</a>, <em>BF6</em>‘s first season (and all future seasons) will be split into multiple phases with different themes and battle passes. Season one’s first phase is titled “Rogue Ops” and will add three new weapons, a new armored APC, a new mode, and, perhaps most excitingly for fans, a new map.</p>

 <p>Earlier this week, EA and Battlefield Studios held an hour-long preview session for <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/10/22/battlefield-6-season-1-first-details-and-hands-on-report/"><em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s upcoming first season</a>. In this preview, we were able to go hands-on with the content being added in Rogue Ops, as well as some of the content coming in phase two of season one. I played a few matches of <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-reverts-conquest-ticket-change-48-hours-angry-backlash-2000636658">Conquest</a> on the first new map coming this season, Blackwell Fields, and came away unsure of it, but then played Eastwood, which will be added later, and had a fantastic time.</p>

  <h2><em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s first new map is just fine</h2> <p>The new map, which is located in an oil field in California, doesn’t feel very big. It’s also a very empty and sparse map, with rolling hills often being the only cover you can hope for when crossing the map to reach a new area. Snipers and aircraft were extremely deadly on this map, and I often found myself frustrated by how much the infantry was at a disadvantage. The map just feels too barren and small to support a mode like Conquest. Perhaps with more time, I’ll learn to love Blackwell Fields, but for now, I’m lukewarm on the map. At the very least, it’s a very pretty map as the sun is setting during your fight, leading to some gorgeous colors and shadows.</p>

 <p>While checking out the new map, I played around with the new armored APC, the Traverser Mk. 2. This vehicle came in handy on Blackwell Fields as it provides a safe way for soldiers to get around the battlefield quickly, is packed with mounted weapons, and can even support an integrated med bay to heal allies who hop in. The new APC is such a perfect fit for <em>BF6</em>, offering something more powerful than a jeep, but less bulky than a tank, that I’m a bit shocked it didn’t ship with the game earlier this month.</p>

 <p>I also checked out the new weapons. The new Glock pistol is fine, but who really cares about a pistol in <em>Battlefield 6</em>? That’s just the gun you pull out when you are desperate or need to complete a daily challenge. The other two new weapons are the SOR-300C carbine and the Mini Fix sniper rifle.</p>

 <p>I played a lot of the preview with the carbine, and I’m still not sure if it will dethrone the M4, but I did enjoy it. Its slower rate of fire and heavier-hitting bullets make it feel more like an assault rifle than a carbine, and it can hold its own in midrange fights. However, in close-quarters combat, I felt like SMGs and faster-firing carbines often beat me in one-on-one fights. Meanwhile, the Mini Fix sniper rifle seems like it might become the rifle of choice for recon players as it hits hard, fires fast, and is extremely accurate. In the hands of a skilled sniper, this might be too powerful. I could see EA nerfing it a tad in a future update. We’ll have to wait and see how things shake out.</p>

 <p>The other bit of Rogue Ops I played during the preview was Strikepoint, a 4v4 mode king-of-the-hill-like mode with limited respawning. It’s…certainly a new game mode. I just don’t understand why<a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-reveal-la-event-behind-the-scenes-brie-larson-ea-2000614190"> EA and Battlefield Studios</a> continue to spend so much time and energy on these tiny, tactical modes. <em>Battlefield</em> is all about big moments, chaotic warfare, and silly moments involving tanks, choppers, bombs, and more.</p> <h2>Eastwood is a new map that people are going to love</h2> <p>The best part of the preview was when I got to play the other new map, Eastwood. This map is set in a rich Southern California suburb, complete with McMansions, pools, and even a golf course nearby with drivable golf carts. This map felt very big, is filled with vehicles, and has plenty of houses and buildings for infantry to duck into during more explosive or dangerous moments. After playing it for just an hour or so, I quickly fell in love with it and can’t wait to play more. Sadly, this map won’t be added to the game until phase two of the first season, which launches on November 18.</p> <p>I personally would have led with Eastwood as the first new map added to <em>BF6</em>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-bigger-maps-leak-datamine-eastwood-mirak-ea-bf-labs-2000618202">as it seems to offer the giant, vehicle-filled chaos that some fans believe the new entry lacks.</a> It’s also just a visually distinct, super memorable, and fantastic map with lots of places to fight and wild moments to get involved in. At one point during the preview, some folks from both teams orchestrated a golf cart race. Well, they tried. A helicopter pilot flew by and wiped out some of the racers. Another great moment involved a tank crashing through the large mansion I was hiding in and then getting trapped in the backyard pool, letting me destroy it with some rockets. No idea why EA isn’t shipping this map first, but at least we all have something to look forward to next month.</p> <p>After playing a lot of season one’s new content, I came away excited for<em> Battlefield 6</em>‘s future, even if some of the new content<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->like the new tiny modes and boring pistol<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->don’t do much for me. I’m just happy to see that so soon after launch, EA has big plans and new stuff for its popular online shooter. And if future maps can be as great as Eastwood, I think the next year for <em>Battlefield 6</em> will be a good one. And who knows, maybe I’ll end up liking Blackwell Fields eventually.<em>&nbsp;Battlefield 6</em> is out now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Season one launches on October 28 on all platforms.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/no-man%E2%80%99s-sky-goes-full-space-pirate-in-latest-free-update.1331899/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s free update time for <i>No Man’s Sky</i> again. Keep your wallet in your back pocket or purse, because Hello Games just shipped “Breach” which, among other things, allows you to harvest materials from stranded shipwrecks out there in the infinity of simulated space.</p> <p>Announced via a <a href="https://youtu.be/eNaY10DQkJw">brisk 51-second trailer on YouTube</a>, “<a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/2025/10/expedition-twenty-breach/">Breach</a>” is the latest free <i>NMS</i> update from developer Hello Games. The update boasts a new expedition as well as the introduction of drifting space wrecks from which you can salvage new ship parts. It feels like a subtle update in some ways, but one that builds well on the foundations laid in <a href="https://kotaku.com/no-mans-sky-voyagers-6-0-star-trek-mass-effect-2000620674">the previous update, Voyagers,</a> which included epic <a href="https://kotaku.com/no-mans-sky-corvette-ship-build-voyagers-update-star-wars-2000630689">custom ship build options</a> and the ability to spacewalk.</p>

  <p>As always, the new update’s release followed a trail of cryptic tweets from managing director Sean Murray, this time with a series of closed-door emoji. It naturally sent the community into a frenzy of speculation.</p>

   <p>Unfortunately for those on the r/LightNoFireHelloGames subreddit, which is dedicated to the studio’s upcoming <a href="https://youtu.be/jKQem4Z6ioQ">full-scale planet sim</a>, the doors had nothing to with <i>Light No Fire</i>. Some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LightNoFireHelloGames/comments/1o9grvf/guys_guys_this_is_it/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">folks had speculated that the door</a> was a reference to the band The Doors who have a song called “Light My Fire.” Things are desperate over there, ya’ll.</p>

   <p>Sorry, guys. That wasn’t it.</p> <h2>Also, check out these awesome user-made ships</h2> <p>Look, I’m probably not gonna get away with writing a “15 Awesome Ship Builds” showcase every week, much as I would like to. But I see so much cool shit coming out of the <i>NMS</i> community that I just have to share this stuff with you.</p>

 <p>Here’s the complete Death Star build I <a href="https://kotaku.com/no-mans-sky-voyagers-death-star-star-wars-2000635367">told ya’ll about last week</a>. Too sick:</p>   <p>This “Venator Class Star Destroyer” looks clean and awesome:</p>   <p>This mod-free build is a whole damn natural wildlife habitat just cruising through space like it’s no big deal.</p>

   <p>Fancy a solid X-Wing build?</p>   <p>Or how about an original build inspired by <i>Star Wars</i>’ weathered space junk aesthetic?</p>   <p>A’right, that’s enough outta me. If you spot something cool in this game, please don’t hesitate to shoot me an email at cjackson [at] kotaku [dot] com. Safe travels out there!</p>

This big expansion, due out in December, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/walton-goggins-is-set-to-play-the-ghoul-from-the-fallout-tv-show-in-fallout-76-but-how-does-the-character-fit-in-the-fallout-76-timeline">sees Walton Goggins reprise his fan-favorite role as The Ghoul from the Fallout TV show</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fallout Shelter is also mentioned, as is Fallout 4 and Creations, which suggests the decade old role-playing game will get some new content soon. Creations are community created mods released officially for Bethesda’s video games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, there are new merch drops, community in-person events, and a post-show celebrating the community. There is no specific mention of the Fallout TV show, either. Season 2 is due out in December.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is no mention of any Fallout remaster, either. There are all sorts of rumors floating around about potential Fallout remakes now that The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered is out the door (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/oblivion-remaster-fallout-3-remaster-and-more-leaked-from-microsoft-document"><u>Fallout 3 Remastered was leaked back in 2023</u></a>, but those plans may have changed). And we know Bethesda plans to eventually get to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-5"><u>Fallout 5</u></a>, albeit after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-vi"><u>The Elder Scrolls 6</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">October 23, 2077 is of course the day in the Fallout timeline the bombs fell, sparking The Great War that caused the irradiated wasteland fans of the franchise have been playing in over the last few decades.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Fallout Season 2: Who's Confirmed to Return and Who's New?</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The last we heard on Fallout 5, by the way, was back in June 2024, when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-doesnt-feel-the-need-to-rush-fallout-5-in-the-wake-of-tv-shows-success"><u>Bethesda Softworks head Todd Howard said he wasn’t interested in rushing it out the door</u></a>. Howard opened up about the future of the hit post-apocalyptic RPG series during <a href="https://youtu.be/2ew8LQFGNWU?si=Ua6SywsuPtdIr0yv" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>an interview with YouTube content creator MrMattyPlays</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"For other Fallout games in the future, you know, obviously I can’t talk about those right now, but I would say, sort of rushing through them, or we kind of need to get stuff out that is different than the work we’re doing in 76… we don’t feel like we need to rush any of that," he said. "The Fallout TV show fills a certain niche in terms of the franchise and storytelling."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The last mainline Fallout game was Fallout 4, which was released in 2015. DLC content for the entry was steadily released for PC and consoles over the next year, and in 2018, Bethesda launched its multiplayer-centered offshoot, Fallout 76. While fans slowly flocked to the West Virginia-set open-world RPG, it wasn’t until the premiere of Prime Video’s Fallout TV show that the Bethesda series leveled up in terms of attention.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, Howard wouldn't budge when it came to desires for a substantial video game release. For him, it comes down to wanting to treat Bethesda's franchises with care.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Totally get the desire for a new kind of mainline single-player game," he said. "And look, those things take time. I don’t think it’s bad for people to miss things. We just want to get it right and make sure that everything we’re doing in a franchise, whether it’s Elder Scrolls, Fallout, or now Starfield, that those become meaningful moments for everybody who loved these franchises as much as we do."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

<p>Fans have been speculating about the prospect of a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metroid_prime_2_echoes">Metroid Prime 2: Echoes</a> remaster/remake for quite some time now, and interestingly, the book actually somehow teases and debunks such a concept in one go.</p>
<p>The following quote from Tanabe regarding Echoes' multiplayer mode seemingly confirms that a remake isn't in development, and nor is it currently being planned. But at the same time, it kind of reads like a bit of a tease, right?</p><div><figure data-videoid="4gZSQE4poJM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed402431wnogvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

<p>"Retro completed the multiplayer mode without compromising on quality even under such challenging conditions. Being of its time, it was designed for local play, so the number of players who actually experienced it might not have been very large. If it is remade, I would be delighted for more people to have the chance to experience it."</p>

<p>Gosh, who knows... Either way, it's seems likely at this point that we won't be seeing anything of the sort until well after the launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, which drops on <strong>4th December 2025</strong>.</p>

			<p>Marvel Cosmic Invasion, the latest beat-em-up game from <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tmnt-shredders-revenge-the-reason-online-netcode-is-important/">TMNT: Shredder's Revenge</a> developer, Tribute Games, and publisher Dotemu, finally has a release date after its reveal at <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/summer-game-fest/">Summer Game Fest </a>earlier this year. It'll arrive on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and Nintendo Switch 2, on December 1, 2025.</p>



<p>The news came with a new release date trailer showing off more of Tribute Games' pixel art and the classic gameplay beat-em-up fans love, while also showcasing some of the 15 playable heroes that'll be in the game when it arrives.</p>



<p>Specifically, the trailer revealed Phoenix and Iron Man as playable characters joining the roster. The rest of the playable characters include Wolverine, Spider-Man, Storm, Captain America, Phyla-Vell, Venom, Nova, She-Hulk, Rocket Raccoon, Silver Surfer, Beta Ray Bill, Black Panther, and Cosmic Ghost Rider.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Marvel Cosmic Invasion is a classic beat-em-up style game with a few unique twists, including Tribute Games' Cosmic Swap system, where you'll switch between two characters while playing to address whatever the situation in front of you calls for, making use of one character's abilities over another when they're better suited for the fight.</p>



<p>There's also plenty of upgrades to use, and with the roster of 15 characters, plenty of ways to mix-and-match characters to suit your own playstyle. </p>



<p>Tribute Games has made a name for itself as the studio to follow if you like good beat-em-up games, and there's no sign that this will be anything less than the quality the studio has already delivered with previous titles, specifically TMNT: Shredder's Revenge.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Dotemu and developer Tribute Games have announced the release date for their upcoming star-studded superhero brawler&nbsp;<em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em>, and it won't be long before you get to check it out.</p>

<p>As revealed in a press release,&nbsp;<em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em>, which was first announced as part of a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-march-2025-all-news-and-announcements" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Direct show earlier this year</a>, will be launching across PC and consoles on December 1st.</p>

<p>Not only that, but the two studios have also announced the two final characters to round out the game's 15-fighter-strong roster: Phoenix and Invincible Iron Man. They join a lineup that also includes iconic characters like Venom, Spider-Man, Storm, and Wolverine.</p>

<p>Published by&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/absolum-200k-sales" rel="nofollow"><em>Absolum&nbsp;</em>outfit Dotemu</a>,&nbsp;<em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion&nbsp;</em>sees Marvel heroes banding together to fight the villainous Annihilus (the clue's in the name, I suppose), who's "launched an unprecedented attack across the galaxy".</p>

<p>You'll choose a team of two Marvel heroes, swapping between them as necessary and creating "unique team-ups" to deal "devastating damage" to your foes.</p>

<p><em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion&nbsp;</em>supports co-op play for up to four players, and you can play either locally or online. Drop-in-drop-out co-op is supported as well, so if you can't enjoy the entire adventure alongside the same people, it's no big deal.</p>




<p>Each player chooses their own team of two heroes, too, so you may well have up to eight heroes battling through the streets of New York towards the sinister-sounding Negative Zone to defeat Annihilus.</p>

<p><em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion&nbsp;</em>launches across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2753970/MARVEL_Cosmic_Invasion/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10012545" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/marvel-cosmic-invasion/9n79tqtztqq4" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and Nintendo Switch (although not for Switch 2, it seems) on December 1st. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>
