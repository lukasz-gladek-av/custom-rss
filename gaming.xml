            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://remapradio.com/articles/brief-thoughts-on-every-switch-2-game-i-played/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>On Wednesday, while Austin, Cado, Rob, and Ren played board games in front of cameras, I was a few blocks down the street playing Switch 2 games all day. It was, as many of you figured out, the reason why we decided to host an in-person stream during the week (not ideal!). But the appeal of getting together during such a momentous event in the games industry, which just happened to also be taking place in New York, seemed like too much of an opportunity to ultimately pass on.</p><p>You’ll hear many in-depth thoughts on Remap Radio, which we’re recording live as this is article/email/who can say is going live, but I’m left to my own thoughts in my hotel, so I thought I’d share a few.</p><p>Please excuse any typos!</p><p>First, I have to set the scene. When you walked in, everyone cheered for you. Like, full-on applause. <em>Clapping</em>. The event took place at the same location where in a few days time, Nintendo fans will walk through the same place and play the same games. It felt like a dress rehearsal for the folks hired to run the event, but it was tremendously funny and weird to be cheered after a few minor events, like:</p><ul><li>Going to the bathroom</li><li>Eating lunch</li><li>Checking to see if I could line up an interview</li></ul><p>Nonetheless, I enjoyed the applause.&nbsp;I deserved it.</p><p>The lineup was a mixture of existing games coming to a Nintendo platform for the first time (ports, ports, ports), updates to Switch 1 games that will cost an unknown amount, and brand-new games from Nintendo. Because these demos are also going to be played by the public in the coming weeks, this wasn’t a situation where I was given an opportunity to poke at these games for an hour. Instead, it was between 10 and 20 (often exhilarating, sometimes puzzling) minutes.&nbsp;</p><p>And yet, I love Nintendo games. I’ll take 10 to 20 strange minutes, you know? So, a few brief thoughts on everything I played on a Switch 2.</p><hr><h2 id="donkey-kong-bananza"><strong>Donkey Kong Bananza&nbsp;</strong></h2><figure><figcaption><span>What a wild and zany guy!</span></figcaption></figure><p>Really fun, loud, and weird. A surprising mashup of <em>Bowser’s Fury</em> and <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, with the player getting dumped into large-ish areas with both main and side “quests” to explore, the ability to climb up anything and everything, and Donkey Kong pulling a <em>Red Faction</em> and being able to smash through nearly every object in front or below him. It has a very chaotic feeling, and was the only game whose demo I went back to multiple times, because it was always clear when the screen went to black and cut me off that I’d hardly seen everything there was to do.</p><p>This comes out in July, but really, <em>this</em> is my Switch 2 launch game.</p><hr><h2 id="mario-kart-world"><strong>Mario Kart World</strong></h2><figure><figcaption><span>There's a dedicated "wave at people" button in the open world.</span></figcaption></figure><p>Do I need another <em>Mario Kart</em> in my life? No. Yes? Apparently. It’s hardly a graphical tour de force and my first moments with the game felt disquietingly familiar…but folks, Knockmode Tour, a race mode where players are booted if they don’t place at checkpoints, is <em>thrilling</em>. I was hooting and hollering within minutes, especially as I heard people groaning in defeat. The races feel long and <em>sweaty</em>. You never know when to use an item. It’s chaos at checkpoints, as 20+ players dump every power-up into the world in a desperate attempt to stay relevant.</p><p>I cannot fathom what it must feel like to lose in the opening act, because I simply did not. At least, until I did. </p><p>Alas.&nbsp;</p><p>The new Mario Kart game seems to whip ass. The open world is TBD, however.</p><hr><h2 id="super-mario-party-jamboree"><strong>Super Mario Party Jamboree</strong></h2><figure><figcaption><span>This will be much better after a few beers.</span></figcaption></figure><p>I hate how much I liked this, because it only reinforces how much of a mark I am for hardware gimmicks. It’s unclear how long Nintendo will fully and faithfully incorporate video support into their games, or if it ends up going the way of HD Rumble, but <em>Super Mario Party Jamboree </em>makes good and goofy use of players jumping in front of a microphone. Plus, it’s one of the better demonstrations of the “mouse” support—much more so than <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>, oddly?</p><hr><h2 id="metroid-prime-4-beyond"><strong>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</strong></h2><figure><figcaption><span>I'm such a sucker for these slower first-person-shooters.</span></figcaption></figure><p>Gorgeous. Nintendo talking about “performance modes”? My love language. They were not showing the game in 4K/60 but instead, 1080/120. It looked incredible, a showcase in how good art <em>immediately</em> looks great when dropped into higher resolutions and frame rates. This will prove a trend with Switch 2, I think.</p><p>Nintendo was pushing the game’s “mouse” support, though I was not required to use it. Swapping control methods was as simple as placing the Joy-con face down or picking it up and holding it normally. Seamless. But in the spirit of experimentation, I stuck with playing using the Switch 2's version of a mouse through the demo, which concluded in deeply familiar <em>Metroid Prime</em> fashion, as you circled a boss while locked on. (This is, to be very clear, a compliment.)&nbsp;</p><p>This is the most “cinematic” <em>Metroid Prime</em> yet, which could go either way?</p><p>It feels like <em>Metroid Prime</em>. It looks like <em>Metroid Prime</em>. But I was not able to really explore, nor use any of the psychic powers. The mouse controls absolutely worked but felt odd in a game where, by design, you’re locking on to objects in the environment to scan and attack. You cannot dash in <em>Metroid Prime </em>without first locking on; it’s not possible in free aim.&nbsp;Yet <em>whatever</em>, I can’t wait to play more.</p><hr><h2 id="cyberpunk-2077"><strong>Cyberpunk 2077</strong></h2><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uR1_HYENDFo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="CYBERPUNK 2077 arrivo su Switch 2 trailer NINTENDO DIRECT ITALIANO"></iframe></figure><p>A fine version of <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>at a frame rate that, to my Not Digital Foundry Eyes, seemed like 30 frames per second. Very playable. No real notes, other than to wonder whether porting older games will have the same draw on the Switch 2.</p><hr><h2 id="breath-of-the-wildtears-of-the-kingdom-switch-2-edition"><strong>Breath of the Wild/Tears of the Kingdom (Switch 2 Edition)</strong></h2><figure><figcaption><span>Pretty! C'mon!</span></figcaption></figure><p>Truth be told, I did not play these—I watched other people. It felt like I could glean everything noteworthy by watching someone else pick up the controller and gawking at the visuals. It makes me feel better about my decision to put <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> down in the midst of a boss battle, convincing myself it was because Nintendo, inevitably, would release an upgraded version. Maybe, maybe not? Who can say? But this looks awesome, and I am so glad Nintendo finally added the ability to share creations within the game. It should've been there on day one.</p><hr><h2 id="dragxdrive"><strong>DragxDrive</strong></h2><figure><figcaption><span>Extremely cool to see video game characters featured in a wheelchair.</span></figcaption></figure><p>Exhausting, but in a good way?</p><p>It was the first time—but not the last—Nintendo emphasized you don’t need a table to use the mouse controls. Instead, you can place the Joy-cons on your pants and go to town. It works shockingly well, but then I became distracted wondering how much time, energy, and pairs of pants Nintendo had torn through before they could so confidently talk about this. Again, the pants thing came up <em>multiple</em> times.&nbsp;</p><p>Ahead of playing games, I watched the Nintendo Direct at the same time you did on a large video screen with a couple hundred people in the audience. Everyone was dead silent when this game was revealed, but I can tell you that actually playing it, despite how complicated navigating the controls can be, is pretty fun!</p><p>I think this one will find an audience once people actually play it.</p><hr><h2 id="kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-switch-2-edition"><strong>Kirby and the Forgotten Land (Switch 2 Edition)</strong></h2><figure><figcaption><span>Once video feature I had was Project K.I.R.B.Y. where we'd play every Kirby game and lean all the lore.</span></figcaption></figure><p>What a good looking <em>game</em>. </p><p>This is what I mean by Nintendo’s art immediately looking spectacular on better hardware. This is a game that I have at home, and yet I spent 20 minutes of my time playing Nintendo’s next-generation hardware because it looked that good. I’m not sure there’s a higher compliment you can really pay than that, and that’s without knowing what Nintendo’s even gonna charge me for upgrading this one.</p><hr><h2 id="switch-2-welcome-tour"><strong>Switch 2 Welcome Tour</strong></h2><figure><figcaption><span>Neat! Make it free!</span></figcaption></figure><p>This is not <em>Wii Sports</em> or <em>Nintendoland</em>, and yet, I’m still trying to figure out why Nintendo is charging for this. It's possible the fee is nominal, but knowing that Nintendo is charging $80 for <em>Mario Kart</em>, can you say that with <em>any</em> guarantee?</p><p>And yet, this was profoundly charming. I cackled at having to try and guess a ball bouncing across the screen at different frame rates. It was fun to play a version of the original <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> that stretched far, far, far, <em>far</em> across the screen to demonstrate how 4K works. I played a variation of <em>FantaVision</em> that helped me better understand the implementation of HDR. (I still think HDR is overstated.)</p><p>This feels meatier than a tech demo, and yet…it should probably just be a bundle. There is <em>so</em> much love here, why not go the extra mile in sparking the imagination of a kid inspired to play this, wanting to know what’s inside their favorite device?</p><hr><p>I was, truth be told, left wanting more. Okay, yes, I want to see the next Mario. I’m selfish. It’s unclear to me if the current Switch 2 lineup demands showing up on day one, even if all the games I played that will only be on Switch 2 are <em>very</em> likely to make credible arguments for being in a list of my favorite games of the year. </p><p>Great games? Almost certainly.&nbsp;</p><p>Revolutionary games? We’ll have to see.&nbsp;</p><p>An unfair burden, but one Nintendo's earned, and I intend to hold them to it.</p>

<p>A new console generation hinges on several variables: Its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-officially-confirmed-at-449-99/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">price</a>, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-features-officially-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">features</a> and specs, and software. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2 Direct</a> finally revealed much of this and gave people reasons to buy the new console. You want better graphics? The new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-4k-120fps-hdr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">4K, HDR, and 120 FPS</a> upgrades will do this.

                <p dir="ltr">Donkey Kong is one versatile monkey. He's gone from one of the most infamous video game villains to a hero of his own platformer series, a rhythm game star, and more. His one attempt at a 3D platformer, Donkey Kong 64, was a bit of a low point in his storied career, but you can't keep a good ape down, and now he's back with another swing at the genre. After some hands-on time with the new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> game, I think Donkey Kong Bananza may just be his 3D platformer redemption.</p><p dir="ltr">Donkey Kong Bananza carries some noticeable DNA from another Nintendo game, but its central hook is all its own. The general feel and flow of movement around the world feels very similar to Super Mario Odyssey, but whereas Mario is a fleet-footed little plumber, Donkey Kong is known for being a brutish bruiser. He hits hard, and in this case, that means a playground of destructible environments to smack your way through.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="379878773" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

DK's powerful punches can clear out a huge swath of cave wall or ground, so it's easy to just charge in a direction while quickly burrowing through obstacles. After a while you start to learn some finesse, especially when it comes to the controls. The directions of the face buttons generally correspond to which direction you smack--B for a downward, digging-like slam; Y for a forward punch; and X for an upward strike. You can start pummeling with intention, clearing away caves in the direction you mean to.</p><p dir="ltr">There are also things that can't be punched through--specifically metal floors and walls, which serve to guide you in the right direction. Still, in the way that any child naturally loves to dig up dirt, thwacking your way through the soil just strikes a primal part of your brain. It's fun to clear a room, and DK is just the ape to do it.</p><p dir="ltr">The environments are bright and vibrant, and the rock and soil terraform nicely with a satisfying crunchy feeling. Still, if any one aspect makes Donkey Kong Bananza a visual showpiece for the Switch 2, it's DK himself. Both the titular character and the monkeys and baddies he meets are rendered as adorably squat cartoon characters that squash and stretch with expressiveness. Donkey Kong has never looked better in video game form, and his look here bears an incredible resemblance to his appearance in the animated Mario movie.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4470116-nintendoswitch2_donkeykongbananza_scrn_07large.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4470116" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4470116-nintendoswitch2_donkeykongbananza_scrn_07large.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4470116"></a><figcaption>Donkey Kong Bananza</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4470116-nintendoswitch2_donkeykongbananza_scrn_07large.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In the context of the story, the metal floors and walls are there because this version of DK happens to be in some kind of monkey-world mining operation, where all of the monkeys happily labor away looking for gems shaped like giant bananas inside the earth's crust. Why a monkey would particularly want a banana that they cannot eat, I have no idea. Stop asking questions. A disaster befalls the mining operation and DK's adventure begins in earnest. He also for some reason loses his pants. That he ever <em>had</em> pants implies that this world recognizes nudity, but the other apes politely seem to ignore it.</p><p dir="ltr">At this point the digging through dirt gets a bit more direction, both figuratively and literally, as you burrow your way through stages and start to deal with enemies. You can sometimes punch them, but other times you need to grab a piece of explosive rock and hurl it in their direction. What happens when you hurl explosive rock in the direction of destructible environments, you may ask? Now you're thinking like a true destruction connoisseur.</p><p dir="ltr">This segment of the demo took place in a watery stage, and while there wasn't a clearly defined objective marker, all of the momentum and visual markers led upwards. So DK was largely making his way up a hilly slope, dispatching enemies along the way, to reach the story objective at the top. But DK semi-regularly discovered crystal bananas hiding in the rock, similar to how Mario finds power moons littered throughout the open-world stages of Mario Odyssey. The bananas even look similar to the moons, visually.</p><p dir="ltr">There is a platforming game in Donkey Kong Bananza, buried somewhere deep inside the recesses and soil and rock. From the small taste I played, I can tell that there will be objectives and crystal bananas and enemies to dispatch and directions to go and probably more than a few boss fights. The relatively small number of each of those that I saw in the demo seemed very fun. But Donkey Kong Bananza more than anything is a toy that lets you dig through solid rock and dirt as a super-strong monkey, and that's just the purest form of childlike fun.</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-hands-on-more-of-the-same-but-it-can-still-surprise-you/1100-6530580/" data-ref-id="1100-6530580">Switch 2 Hands-On: More Of The Same, But It Can Still Surprise You</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-hands-on-the-conservative-switch-2-gets-a-bold-sequel/1100-6530583/" data-ref-id="1100-6530583">Mario Kart World Hands-On: The Conservative Switch 2 Gets A Bold Sequel</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-hands-on-facing-18-years-of-expectations/1100-6530584/" data-ref-id="1100-6530584">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Hands-On: Facing 18 Years Of Expectations</a></li></ul>

The game was announced at E3 2017 before being delayed and rebooted and delayed again, but even at the time of that reveal, it had been a decade since Metroid Prime 3: Corruption released. At one time it seemed like a game doomed by its own sky-high expectations.

It's too early to say if it can rise above almost two decades of anticipation, but having now played it, I don't think it will be a victim of them.</p><p dir="ltr">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is now part of the cross-generational push, representing both a swan song for the original Switch and a launch-window game for Switch 2. I only played the Switch 2 version, so I can't speak to differences in performance between the platforms--but it already appears to make for a very nice Switch 2 showpiece.</p><div tabindex="0"

and modernizing it to a new platform. Yes, Samus' face reflects in her visor when you fire a shot close to a wall, but this time she squints slightly in the direction of the light. Retro Studios is clearly exercising great care for stewarding this franchise, even down to the little touches.</p><p dir="ltr">The demo starts with a cinematic that echoes how the industry has matured over the last few decades. While Samus would often land her ship on an alien planet and begin exploring without much preamble, this game begins with a massive battle scene reminiscent of a blockbuster. Samus weaves through Federation ships, lending support and narrowly avoiding disaster, showcasing her skills as a crack pilot in addition to a bounty hunter. You get the sense that she's the Federation's most trusted ally for a reason.</p><p dir="ltr">What followed from there was an early-game tutorial, teaching the basics of shooting, scanning, using the morph ball and bombs, and so on. It was punctuated by cinematic moments and battles, but this was clearly aimed at teaching me the ropes. And I'm glad, because Metroid Prime 4 introduces a new approach to control schemes that will take some getting used to.</p><p dir="ltr">The Metroid Prime Trilogy on Wii already experimented with using the Wii remote as a cursor, functionality that was echoed by one of the options in the recent Metroid Prime Remastered. Metroid Prime 4 adds the Switch 2's mouse functionality to emulate first-person aiming on PC. You may expect that this would necessitate a menu in which you pick a control scheme, but Prime 4 takes a novel approach: What if you just had access to all the control schemes, all the time, and could switch between them on demand?</p><p dir="ltr">It's complex without feeling complicated. When exploring the world you'll mostly rely on the traditional dual-stick control scheme. When you lock-on to an enemy, your Joy-Con automatically converts to the gyro pointer mode like Prime Trilogy or Remastered. And most impressively, at any point you can simply put your Joy-Con controller down on a surface and it instantly converts to mouse mode, letting you control it that way. No menu selection or toggle required. It's a heck of a trick.</p><p dir="ltr">This led to a general pattern of traditional controls for exploring and then using the pointer control to fire at legions of alien bugs. At the end of the demo, a boss creature was infected by a Metroid, leading it to develop Metroid-like pustules all over its body. Being a lifelong gamer I immediately recognized these as weak points, but I wasn't quite getting the precision I wanted from the pointer functionality, so I put the Joy-Con down and swapped to mouse controls. It all just worked.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4470297-nintendoswitch2_metroidprime4beyondnintendoswitchedition_scrn_05large.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4470297" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4470297-nintendoswitch2_metroidprime4beyondnintendoswitchedition_scrn_05large.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4470297"></a><figcaption>Aiming down sights on a hostile alien planet in Metroid Prime 4: Beyond.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4470297-nintendoswitch2_metroidprime4beyondnintendoswitchedition_scrn_05large.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The switching did feel awkward sometimes. I would forget that I'm using a cursor and miss a shot, for example. But I'm not too proud to admit this seemed like a skill issue, and developing a rhythm of switching between the control schemes as the situation dictates feels like it would come with time, not in the compressed conditions of a press demo.</p><p dir="ltr">The only concern I have, and it's a minor one, is that this very limited slice of the game seemed notably more action-oriented than Metroid Prime tends to be. I suspect this is simply because I was playing the beginning of the game, and the tutorial, which is engineered to both excite the player and also teach all the combat-related mechanics in a short period of time. But Metroid Prime has always been at its best when it felt serenely eerie and lonely. A massive battle full of explosions and Federation soldiers is neither. I hope after this initial burst of action the game settles into a more recognizable form.</p><p dir="ltr">And I expect that of Metroid Prime 4, because Retro Studios seems to understand what makes this series so special in the hearts of Metroid fans. The expanded control options are an important part of removing the barriers between you and Samus, to feel like you're the one behind the visor. The extremely long wait may not have led to a revolutionary overhaul, but it does feel like coming home--even if that home is a strange alien planet.</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-hands-on-more-of-the-same-but-it-can-still-surprise-you/1100-6530580/" data-ref-id="1100-6530580">Switch 2 Hands-On: More Of The Same, But It Can Still Surprise You</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-hands-on-the-conservative-switch-2-gets-a-bold-sequel/1100-6530583/" data-ref-id="1100-6530583">Mario Kart World Hands-On: The Conservative Switch 2 Gets A Bold Sequel</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-hands-on-red-faction-gorilla/1100-6530581/" data-ref-id="1100-6530581">Donkey Kong Bananza Hands-On: Red Faction Gorilla</a></li></ul>

In a break from recent tradition, Nintendo showcased only few unique hardware advancements and instead focused on a field it's been historically reluctant to dive into: online multiplayer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The mysterious "C" button, it turned out, wasn't some button that unlocked magical hardware capabilities, but instead quickly brings players into a feature called "GameChat." GameChat appears to be a slimmed-down version of social platforms like Discord that acts as an all-in-one hub for group multiplayer, video calls, private game streaming, and more, all run through the Nintendo Switch 2.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In other words, the company that rolled out a mobile app to support voice chat on Nintendo Switch has gone all-in on a console-based micro social network.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Why would the normally multiplayer-shy Nintendo dive deep into online multiplayer this way? Well in a world where players are asking developers "can I play with my friends?", the company seems to have picked up on a growing game industry trend: a future where players—especially younger ones—want to play together at all times.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Nintendo thinks it can finally make &quot;safe&quot; online spaces">Nintendo thinks it can finally make "safe" online spaces</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a follow-up presentation at a media event held during the Nintendo Direct, Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser seemed to tip the company's hand as to why it seems to have finally committed resources to robust online features. He spoke of how players of all ages can now "safely connect" and play games with friends and family.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/console/-redesigned-from-the-ground-up-the-nintendo-switch-2-will-launch-on-june-5" target="_self" data-discover="true">'Redesigned from the ground up:' The Nintendo Switch 2 will launch on June 5 for $449</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Safety" has been the watchword for Nintendo's hesitance to jump feet-first into online play.

"So we had each person place their game screen in front of their camera instead of their faces.

Adding in the expansion pack? $50 a year. The most they charge for online play is $80 a year for a full family plan.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Those prices are low compared to subscription plans on Xbox and PlayStation, but up until this point its offerings were relatively light. A robust suite of social tools is more likely to convince a bunch of dedicated Switch users to make the jump.</span></p><p>Image via System Era Softworks/Devolver Digital.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Switch 2 also now has a clear hardware feature that sets ahead of other handhelds. To set up comparable multiplayer services on say, an ROG Ally, players need to download an app like Discord and calibrate it to fit with their playstyle before they can chat with friends. With the Nintendo Switch 2, players can start talking with the push of a button.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Then there's the mysterious but ever-present concept of "brand loyalty." Nintendo isn't short on loyal players, but its scaled-back social systems have created an exit vector for players to leave its ecosystem. Now, in a very Apple-like fashion, Nintendo can support voice chat and screen sharing without pushing users to another service (and with the Nintendo Switch 2 Camera, it can also eliminate the need to buy non-Nintendo hardware).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The runaway success of the Nintendo Switch certainly raised expectations for the Switch 2's sales performance. While the multiplayer tools themselves may not propel the system to over 150 million units sold in its lifetime (Switch 2 exclusive </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Duskbloods</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> might do a lot of heavy lifting), it sets the table for more monetization opportunities down the line.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">However the Switch 2 performs, its multiplayer-centric hardware shows Nintendo is keeping an eye on changing trends. Multiplayer has long been a domain into which Nintendo barely treads, so its choice to go all-in on the technology—especially in lieu of drastically new physical hardware features—signals the weight of its strategic shift.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shenmue">Shenmue</a> has topped a BAFTA poll to find the most influential video game of all time.</p>
<p>The 1999 Dreamcast release may have struggled commercially at launch, but it has provided the blueprint for open world games ever since, received a cult following, and was followed by two sequels.</p>
<p>It's perhaps a surprise choice for the public-voted poll, with creator Yu Suzuki stating he was "deeply honoured and grateful" for Shenmue's win. "At its inception, we set out to explore the question, 'How real can a game become?', aiming to portray a world and story unprecedented in scale and detail," he said. "This distinction serves as a powerful reminder that the challenge we embraced continues to resonate with and inspire so many people even today. It is truly the greatest of encouragement."</p>

<p>The top five games in the poll are all classics worthy of the title. Following Shenmue are Doom, Super Mario Bros, Half-Life, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a> (my own personal choice).</p>

<p>But there's one outlier in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>. Whether <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review">it's a good or bad game is one thing</a>, but can a game released just two months ago in February 2025 really be considered that influential, especially when compared to others in the list?</p>
<p>"We made Doom to push boundaries and ignite imaginations, and it’s amazing to see its legacy still resonating over 30 years later," said Doom co-creator John Romero. "Doom's lasting impact is also thanks to the incredible community that embraced it, modded it, speedran it, and kept it alive across generations - this recognition is a tribute to them as much as the game itself."</p>
<p>"We're honored to hear that players felt that both Half-Life 1 and 2 should be included in the list of influential video games," said Valve. "When we set out to make them, like all developers, we had big dreams. Like what if the game didn't immediately crash your computer upon load? So, unsurprisingly, the legacy of these games was the last thing on our minds when we were in the thick of development. For the Half-Life games to become both meaningful to players and foundational to our medium is, frankly, humbling. We can only hope that everyone who has enjoyed them over the years has as much fun with our future efforts."</p>
<p>Shenmue fans will surely be happy to see the game recognised, especially after the news last year that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shenmue-3-gets-new-publisher-sparking-multiplatform-hope">Shenmue 3 has a new publisher</a>, sparking hopes of a multiplatform release. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shenmue-fans-rent-times-square-billboard-campaigning-for-fourth-game">Fans even rented a Times Square billboard to campaign for a fourth game</a>.</p>
<p>Last year BAFTA ran a similar poll ahead of its BAFTA Games Awards, with Lara Croft voted the most iconic video game character.</p>
<p>The top 20 most influential video games of all time in the BAFTA poll are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Shenmue</li>
<li>Doom</li>
<li>Super Mario Bros.</li>
<li>Half-Life</li>
<li>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</li>
<li>Minecraft</li>
<li>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</li>
<li>Super Mario 64</li>
<li>Half-Life 2</li>
<li>The Sims</li>
<li>Tetris</li>
<li>Tomb Raider</li>
<li>Pong</li>
<li>Metal Gear Solid</li>
<li>World of Warcraft</li>
<li>Baldur's Gate 3</li>
<li>Final Fantasy VII</li>
<li>Dark Souls</li>
<li>Grand Theft Auto 3</li>
<li>Skyrim</li>
<li>Grand Theft Auto</li>
</ol>
<p>This year's BAFTA Game Awards will take place next week on Tuesday 8th April.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-receives-most-nominations-at-this-years-bafta-games-awards">Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 has the most nominations</a>, but Best Game will be a tussle between Black Myth: Wukong, Helldivers 2, Thank Goodness You're Here!, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, Astro Bot, and Balatro.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This isn't the case for Cyberpunk 2077.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But, this also begs the question: how quickly will a Switch 2's internal storage fill up?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-supports-120fps-up-to-4k-resolution-docked">Switch 2's 256GB internal storage</a> is a big step up from the original Switch’s 32GB. However, early signs already suggest Switch 2 games will be much larger. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cyberpunk 2077, like we've mentioned, is a 64GB download. By comparison, one of the biggest games on the original Switch, Tears of the Kingdom, was just 16GB. The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/some-nintendo-switch-games-are-getting-nintendo-switch-2-upgrades-including-breath-of-the-wild-and-metroid-prime-4">Switch 2 version</a>—and other titles like the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-costs-80-30-cheaper-if-you-buy-it-bundled-with-the-nintendo-switch-2">$80 Mario Kart World</a>—will likely demand significantly more space.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The obvious solution? Expandable storage. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-ps5-ssd">PS5 has it</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-ssds-for-xbox-series-xs">Xbox has it</a>, and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-sd-cards-for-nintendo-switch">Switch has always supported it</a>. But unlike the original Switch, which accepted standard microSD, microSDHC, and microSDXC cards, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-confirms-some-switch-2-game-cards-will-only-include-a-download-key">Switch 2 is locked to microSD Express</a>. That means your old microSD cards won’t work, and more importantly, you’ll need to buy new, notably pricier memory cards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you can tell, IGN’s deals team has already tracked down the best prices on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-microsd-express-cards-where-to-buy">Switch 2-compatible microSD Express cards</a>, including <a href="https://zdcs.link/QPp5EV?object_uuid=c261c5f9-8f6b-4fb0-95dc-698a4c23b7b8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">128GB</a> ($44.99), <a href="https://zdcs.link/aewqoJ?object_uuid=c261c5f9-8f6b-4fb0-95dc-698a4c23b7b8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">256GB </a>($59.99), <a href="https://zdcs.link/9lXGRE?object_uuid=c261c5f9-8f6b-4fb0-95dc-698a4c23b7b8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">512GB</a> ($99.99), and <a href="https://zdcs.link/QPp55W?object_uuid=c261c5f9-8f6b-4fb0-95dc-698a4c23b7b8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">1TB versions</a> ($199.99) options from SanDisk and Lexar. However, some are already being snapped up in bulk and are now listed as "temporarily out of stock" on Amazon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo is also partnering with SanDisk and Samsung to release its own branded cards, though if history is any indication, expect them to be more expensive than identical third-party versions. It’s also possible more manufacturers will jump into the microSD Express market now that the Switch 2 is driving demand, but whether that leads to lower prices remains to be seen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more on Switch 2, you can catch up on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-direct-everything-announced">everything from the Nintendo Direct right here</a>, and read our full guide on how to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-start-time">secure your preorder for the Switch 2</a> on April 9.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Robert Anderson is a deals expert and Senior Editor, Commerce, for IGN.

            <p>Judging by reactions online across the world, the cost of the Switch 2 and its software has proven to be controversial. Perhaps Nintendo knew this, considering it didn't include the price in the actual <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-release-date-revealed">Direct presentation</a>.</p>
<p>Here in the UK, the console will cost £395.99, or £429.99 bundled with Mario Kart World, when it launches on 5th June. That's compared to the £280 launch price of the original Switch, and £310 launch price of the OLED.</p>
<p>It's the increase in the cost of games themselves, though, that's proven most shocking. Mario Kart World, for instance, will cost £74.99 for a physical copy, or £66.99 digitally. That's an increase from £49.99 for most brand new original Switch games.</p>

<p>Donkey Kong Bananaza, meanwhile, is slightly cheaper: £66.99 for a physical copy and £58.99 digital. There's the Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour game too, which will cost 990 yen <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/games/switch2/aahea/index.html">according to the Japanese website</a> - that's around a fiver.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-some-switch-2-physical-releases-will-just-have-a-download-key-on-the-card">some Switch 2 physical game cards won't actually include the full game</a>, but include a download key instead. As for the difference between physical and digital pricing, this appears to be a shift towards pushing digital games - especially with the addition of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-unveils-virtual-game-cards-thatll-let-you-share-you-digital-switch-and-switch-2-games">sharable Virtual Game Cards Nintendo revealed last week</a>.</p>
<p>Still, accounting for inflation, the Switch 2 Mario Kart World bundle works out cheaper in the UK than the original Switch with a copy of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">Breath of the Wild</a> in 2017.</p>
<p>To directly compare the consoles alone, £280 for the original Switch works out at £367.40 today with inflation, still cheaper than Switch 2. However, throw in the big launch game and it's a better deal - an original Switch with a separate copy of Breath of the Wild cost £340 at launch in 2017, which works out at £446.13. That's pricier than the Switch 2 Mario Kart World bundle.</p>
<p>Over in Europe, the Switch 2 console costs €469.99, or €509.99 for the Mario Kart World bundle. That's equivalent to the cost in the UK.</p>
<p>It's a different story in other parts of the world, however.</p>
<p>In Japan, for instance, Nintendo will be selling a region-locked console at a lower price, in a bid to stop importers due to the weak yen.</p>
<p>The Japan-only console will cost 49980 yen (around £258.95), but will only play Japanese games in Japanese language, with a Japanese Nintendo account.</p>
<p>A more expensive Switch 2 with multilingual support will also be available at 69980 yen, around £362.57. That's still slightly cheaper than in the UK, though doesn't account for import costs.</p>
<p>As for the price of Mario Kart World in Japan, it'll be 9980 yen compared to the cost of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-8-deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a> on the original Switch at 6578 yen. As Dr. Serkan Toto, CEO of Kantan Games, wrote on social media, that's 52 percent more expensive, which is a higher jump than the 33 percent rise from $60 to $80 in the US.</p>

<p>As for the console itself in the US, it costs $450, but there are fears this could rise to as much as $600 if impacted by new tariffs from the Trump administration.</p>
<p>Tariffs - taxes charged on products when they enter the country - could be as much as 46 percent on products from Vietnam, which is where the majority of Switch 2 manufacturing has taken place, <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-trump-tariffs-vietnam-china-trade-war-1851774438">Kotaku</a> has reported.</p>
<p>David Gibson, analyst at MST Financial, confirmed to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a781c853-3fed-4dfc-b940-4137546180de">The FT</a>: "Export data combined with finished product codes confirms that Nintendo shipped finished Switch 2 [from Vietnam] across five days in January for a total of 383,000 units with all of them going to the USA."</p>
<p>He added: "I suspect this occurred to test the distribution system and get ahead of the risk of tariffs. I expect the numbers to have ramped-up significantly in February and March."</p>
<p>Wrote Niko Partners director of research and insights <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1907545230699610327">Daniel Ahmad on social media</a>: "Nintendo shifted its manufacturing to Vietnam to avoid tariffs and with today's reciprocal tariff announcements they're likely going to end up paying tariffs anyway."</p>
<p>Ahmad <a href="https://nikopartners.com/niko-partners-take-on-nintendo-switch-2-reveal/">continued in a blog post</a>: "The higher cost of the console in the US compared to Japan is likely a calculated move on Nintendo's part, driven by tariff impacts, the weak Japanese yen and local market conditions. Japan accounted for nearly 25 percent of global Nintendo Switch unit sales, with Nintendo offering a cheaper Switch 2 SKU in this market to stimulate early adoption and maintain momentum.</p>
<p>"While the company has shifted some of its manufacturing to Vietnam to offset US tariffs on China, the looming threat of reciprocal tariffs prior to the Switch 2 showcase will have also forced Nintendo to consider a higher price for the rest of the world. The reciprocal tariffs on Vietnam and Japan have come in higher than expected, and Nintendo will feel the impact of this if the tariffs go into full effect. That being said, we think it's unlikely that Nintendo will raise the price of the console at this point, but it's also unlikely to see a price drop in the next 5 years."</p>
<p>Piers Harding-Rolls of Ampere Analysis also suggested to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/heres-why-the-nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world-and-everything-around-them-is-so-expensive">IGN</a> Nintendo "probably had a range of pricing for the US market in play up until the last minute due to the uncertainty on import tariffs", which is why the price wasn't included in the Direct.</p>
<p>However, analysts don't believe the pricing will impact sales of Switch 2 initially.</p>
<p>"Based on what we're seeing across the market, sales to higher-income or more affluent households likely won't be impacted by this pricing," Circana analyst Mat Piscatella told IGN. "And, of course, we have the price insensitive super enthusiasts that will do and pay whatever it takes to acquire the Switch 2 at launch. Therefore, because of the limited quantities that will be available during the launch year, I do not anticipate this pricing to hinder year one sales volumes.</p>
<p>"The true test will come in year two, as supply is likely to become more readily available, and the addressable market will be forced to widen. So, we'll have to see what happens over the next 9-12 months."</p>
<p>And compared with Sony's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PlayStation 5 Pro</a> at £699.99 and Valve's Steam Deck OLED at £479.00, the price of Nintendo's new console still appears reasonable.</p>
<p>Of course, this all depends on whether consumers are able to pre-order, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-pre-orders-will-prioritise-players-with-the-most-switch-playtime">Nintendo is enforcing strict criteria on pre-orders</a> from its own Nintendo store in a bid to reduce scalping. That's based on playtime and the requirement of a Nintendo Online account.</p>
<p>In the meantime, multiple online UK retailers have already gone live and sold out of Switch 2 stock, without the need to meet Nintendo's criteria.</p>

<p>Whereas most American outlets have April 9 penciled in for Nintendo Switch 2 pre-orders, the UK has bucked the trend and decided to start taking Switch 2 orders ahead of schedule.</p>



<p>April 2 was a huge day. An hour-long <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-games-announced-during-the-nintendo-switch-2-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2 Direct</a> finally revealed a good chunk of information about the Nintendo Switch 2. We got to see exciting first-party software in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/donkey-kong-is-getting-a-new-3d-adventure-on-the-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, and there was also a hefty amount of controversy about the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-much-will-nintendo-switch-2-games-cost-physical-digital-game-prices-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cost of games</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/not-all-nintendo-switch-2-games-include-game-on-cartridge-despite-prices-of-up-to-90/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game cartridge confusion</a>.</p>



<p>Despite this, many fans are still chomping at the 8-bit, ready to pre-order. The official word is that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-when/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pre-orders</a> would go live in the United States on April 9, with the UK getting a 24-hour headstart on April 8. UK residents are currently bemused as Switch 2 pre-orders are already live—sort of.</p>

<p>Most UK residents know of <strong>Argos</strong>—a classic retailer in these parts. If you head to the <a href="https://www.argos.co.uk/list/get-ready-for-nintendo-switch-2?tag=ar:browse:plp:nintendoswitchconsoles:m020:cm:nintendo-switch-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Argos website</a>, you can already pre-order and pay for a standalone Nintendo Switch 2 unit or the bundle packaged with a much cheaper <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mario-kart-world-revealed-as-nintendo-switch-2-launch-title/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>



<p>We reported the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-officially-confirmed-at-449-99/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2 price</a> yesterday, and nothing has changed. Argos is offering the base unit for £395.99 and the MK bundle for £429.99.</p>



<p>Other retailers are unmoved in their position, and are still reserving their Switch 2 orders for waiting lists or allowing you to register your interest. It’s unclear if this is an error on Argos’ part or special dispensation has been permitted.</p>



<p>Argos is the way to go if you want to secure your Switch 2 pre-order!</p>

            <p>Switch 2 editions of both <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">Tears of the Kingdom</a> will include a number of new features, including achievements.</p>
<p>Both games are getting Switch 2 editions on the console's release, which will boast things like improved visuals and loading times, as well as a second save slot.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, over on the Nintendo Switch Online app (which is being rebranded Nintendo Switch app later next month), users will be able to access Zelda Notes. Zelda Notes is a "new feature that can help you get even more out of your adventures in Hyrule", and is "designed to provide a more streamlined gameplay experience".</p>

<p>Zelda Notes looks pretty nifty, I have to say. It will include things like a voiced navigation guide, all-new voice memories which were not in the original games (with Breath of the Wild having Zelda's memos, and Rauru also confirmed to be chirping up in Tears of the Kingdom), and autobuild sharing in Tears of the Kingdom.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the My Play Data section will keep track of achievement-like medals, which players can earn for doing things such as traveling a great distance across Hyrule, defeating enemies, scooping up those precious rupees, and so on and so forth. Medal names included things like "Monster's Bane", "Treasure Hunter", and "Citizen of Hyrule".</p>
<p>You can then compare your various achievements with others via the Global Play Data section. The Achievements section here has headers such as "Locations Visited" and "Quests and Adventures Cleared".</p>
<p>You can check out the full video breaking down the Switch 2 editions of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom below. I now wonder if this will open up the door for more <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-nintendo-switch-2-launch-games">Switch 2 games</a> to get achievements. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/03/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-price-confirmed-in-japan/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Revealed during the Direct yesterday, Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour is a tech demo tour of the incoming <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> console, but instead of being a free pack-in, Nintendo stated that this would be a paid experience. Now we know how much (or how little) that will cost.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour Clip" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Va65mE9PNDg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The price for Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour has not been confirmed for North America or Europe, but the Japanese Nintendo site has confirmed that this will at least be a very cheap app, priced at ¥990. That’s a little under $7 and a little over £5 with a direct currency conversion, so it will likely translate to $10 and £7.</p>
<p>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour is pitched as an interactive exhibit that lets you walk a miniature human avatar around a giant Switch 2 museum, walking up to the various parts of the console and then getting little experiences to explore all the technology that’s gone into it.</p>
<p>“Uncover lots of insights about the console,” Nintendo writes. “Explore basic features, like the magnetic connectors that keep the Joy-Con 2 controllers firmly attached, and more advanced tech details that you might not otherwise notice.</p>

<p>“Roam the exhibit halls, which resemble a giant Nintendo Switch 2. Discover hidden facts, take quizzes, and enjoy playful minigames and tech demos.”</p>
<p>The thing that’s difficult to accept is that this is a paid experience, as opposed to a free pack-in game, and there’s inevitable points of comparison to how Sony have treated their customers to comparatively much more lavish tech demo experiences over the past couple of generations. For the PS4, anyone that bought the PS4 camera could use it with Playroom and get a cutesy little tech demo based around the DualShock 4 controller and augmented reality, debuting Astro Bot for the first time. That was then continued with The Playroom VR that arrived alongside the original PlayStation VR headset, and most recently, the quite excellent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/08/astros-playroom-review-the-first-game-you-should-play-on-playstation-5/">Astro’s Playroom</a> that toured the PS5 hardware with hundreds of cute easter eggs to find through a surprisingly well-rounded platformer experience. All of those were free from Sony, but Switch 2 Welcome Tour is not.</p>
<p>Nintendo has also drawn some flak for the way that they’re pricing titles for Nintendo Switch 2. While <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/these-games-are-getting-free-nintendo-switch-2-upgrades-from-nintendo/">some games are getting free updates</a> to support Switch 2, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/nintendo-switch-2-edition-paid-upgrades-come-to-mario-party-zelda-kirby-and-more/">Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom are paid upgrades</a> that are alternatively included with a Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription.</p>
<p>The base price of games is also rising.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/mario-kart-world-revealed-as-nintendo-switch-2-launch-title-and-its-going-open-world/">Mario Kart World</a> will be £67 / $80 / €80 digitally or £75 / €90 for a physical game card. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/donkey-kong-bananza-revealed-for-nintendo-switch-2-coming-in-july/">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> will then be £59 / €70 digitally or £67 / €80 physcally.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-will-be-a-smash-hit-says-analyst-high-retail-prices-are-meant-to-drive-digital-sales.1153899/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-will-be-a-smash-hit-says-analyst-high-retail-prices-are-meant-to-drive-digital-sales/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's time for the first analyst reactions to the Nintendo Switch 2 announcements, starting with the higher-than-expected pricing for both the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-launches-june-5th-120fps-4k-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">console itself</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-game-prices-go-up-to-e90/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its games</a>. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/its-official-switch-2-going-pop-off-rhys-elliott--qtgbe/?trackingId=cnZA73cER1enucCFauha9Q%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to MIDiA Research's Rhys Elliott</a>, whom we often interviewed exclusively on Wccftech, the console is poised to become a smash hit even at the $450 price.</p>
<p><em>The Nintendo Switch 2 is slightly more expensive than many of us analysts thought, but $450 is still within the $400-500 price range I expected. While I still reckon $400 is the sweet spot, and we'll see a cheaper SKU eventually, $450 is still affordable and in line with other consoles and the Steam Deck.</em></p>
<p><em>Unlike other manufacturers, Nintendo relies almost solely on its console and console software business, so loss-leading pricing simply wasn’t in the cards. At $450, the Switch 2 is still cheap enough for mass-market adoption, and given the stacked and diverse software lineup, I believe it will sell well among core gamers, casuals, families, and more.</em></p>
<p>Perhaps an even tougher pill to swallow for consumers is the increase in Nintendo Switch 2 game prices, chiefly Mario Kart World, which will cost $80 (€90 in Europe) if you buy a physical copy. According to Elliott, the rationale is mainly to drive users to purchase digital instead, since Nintendo's split is currently around fifty-fifty (whereas the other consoles made by Microsoft and Sony already skew much more toward digital sales).</p>
<p><em>While the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2s-price-could-go-even-higher-due-to-trumps-tariffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">orange man’s tariffs</a> and Nintendo wanting to increase ARPPU factor into the reasoning behind Nintendo charging $80 for Mario Kart World, I think there’s more at play. </em><em>Nintendo also wants to nudge consumers to buy games digitally. The lower prices for digital games versus boxed (true for Donkey Kong and Mario Kart) point to this. Another factor is last week’s announcement of the Digital Game Card, which lets players ‘’lend games’’ to their Switch Online Family Plan members.</em></p>
<p><em>A little bit of context here: PlayStation and Xbox have already pushed their platforms to become digital-first, driven by strategies like multi-game subscriptions, digital-only consoles, free-to-play’s rise, and platform holders pushing consumers to digital versions via perks (like extra cosmetics and the ability to pre-load a game so it’s instantly ready to play at launch). </em><em>So PlayStation and especially Xbox are very digital-first. But Nintendo is different, more 50-50. </em></p>
<p><em>For consumers, a unique value proposition of physical games is the preowned and rental markets. But Nintendo’s reliance on physical impacts its bottom line, hence the nudging. </em><em>Nintendo does not gain revenues from physical renting and resales. After all, a copy of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe could be sold on the reseller market 100 times or rented 100 times, but Nintendo would only capture revenues from that first sale. A digital-only market means more revenue and price control for Nintendo. Long story short, Nintendo’s use of framing (sticker shock for physical) is actually pushing people to digital, which benefits Nintendo.</em></p>

            <p>
It’s rare that a video game pumps actual joy into my shrunken, leathery heart, but I definitely felt a certain springtime stirring when I first jumped in 3D platformer Demon Tides. Hit the button again exactly when you land and you’ll be rewarded with a higher, twirlier jump. Hit it a third time and you’ll be treated to a triumphant, arcing somersault. Yes, this is the stuff! This is the old N64 Mario magic I’ve been missing. 
</p>
<p>
Nostalgia is the enemy of critical thinking, you say? The games industry is a flat circle of corporate iteration, is it? A stifling quAAAgmire from which not even moderate oddballs like New York-based developers Fabraz can escape? I know, I know, but please, let me have this. Let me do the “let people enjoy things” meme, just this once. Look, I can turn into a bat as well. I can turn into a fat little frisbee with ground-pound functionality. I can turn into a spindash-capable snek.

In Demon Tides you are a surly devil queen called Beebz who has sailed to a mysterious archipelago to meet a fellow monarch. Things immediately go pear-shaped in the demo when your ship encounters a pop-up coral reef and is swallowed by purple gunk.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Beebz doesn’t really need a ship to get around. She starts the tale with a platforming skillset worthy of an endgame build, extending from more obvious capital-A abilities like the bat transformations to little, speedrunner-pleasing flourishes you tease out by feel. And this is but the beginning, for there are “over 50 unique talismans that uniquely modify or add to your move-set”, including a paraglider tool, the ability to stand on bubbles, and a mod that turns your UFO move into a hookshot.

The world, meanwhile, is an infectious jumble of tropical islands and dockyard flotsam and big goofy collectibles. There’s a graffiti system with online affordances that is portrayed as the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jet-set-radio">Jet Set Radio</a> version of soapstones in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a>. You can also race the ghosts of other players across the islands, and snap photos. Ah, smell that (Super Mario) sunshine. I think I prefer the crunchy 2D sprite/3D world aesthetic of the developers’ previous <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1325900/Demon_Turf_Queens_Edition/">Demon Turf</a>, but it’s a charmer nonetheless.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/investors-demand-ubisoft-to-renegotiate-tencent-subsidiary-deal-and-initiate-legal-proceedings.1153893/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/investors-demand-ubisoft-to-renegotiate-tencent-deal/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A minority shareholder and a growing coalition of shareholders have issued an open letter to Ubisoft to initiate legal proceedings around the recently announced Ubisoft and Tencent subsidiary deal.</p>



<p>In an open letter to Ubisoft, which was sent to Insider Gaming, the letter demands that Ubisoft hold an Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) to give shareholders the right to vote on the recent subsidiary deal. For those not in the know, an EGM is a special kind of meeting that’s held outside of the general annual general meeting (AGM) to discuss significant issues that cannot wait. </p>



<p>The letter, which was sent by the minority shareholder AJ Investments demands that shareholders can vote on two separate resolutions when it comes to the Tencent deal.</p>



<p>Resolution 1 is to renegotiate the Tencent deal and have it restructured into a direct asset sale for no less than €4 billion, which is roughly the valuation already accepted by both Tencent and Ubisoft’s board. AJ Investments says that at the moment, “moment, shareholders have no clarity how the deal that was announced last week will eventually benefit shareholders of Ubisoft.”</p>



<p>Resolution 2 for the EGM would be to vote on a distribution of a Extraordinary Dividend. It’s said that following the sale (if shareholders vote for it), “Ubisoft shall return €23 per share in cash to shareholders (totalling €3 billion), while preserving.”</p>



<p>AJ Investments say that the reason for such extreme measures is because “shareholders are not sure whether they will get a significant benefit from this transaction. Ubisoft’s share price fell by more than 20% on unusually high volume. This signals a clear verdict from investors — the proposed deal is deeply flawed, structured to bypass mandatory public offer rules, and designed to entrench control by the Guillemot family, who now hold less than 10% of the company’s economic interest.”</p>



<p>Following the deal of the announcement and at the time of writing, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-stock-falls-double-digits-days-after-tencent-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft stock has fallen 24%</a> since the subsidiary deal announcement, which will see <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-is-forming-a-new-subsidiary-with-tencent-valued-at-4-3-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">three of Ubisoft’s most valuable IP’s</a> move to a new subsidiary. </p>



<p>You can read the full open letter to Ubisoft below:</p>



<div><p><strong>PRESS RELEASE</strong><br><strong><br>AJ Investments and Shareholder Coalition wants clarity on the transaction with Tencent, vote on EGM</strong></p><p><strong>Bratislava / Paris – April 2, 2025 –</strong> In direct response to Ubisoft’s decision to transfer the IP and related rights of three major gaming franchises (Assassin Creed, Far Cry and Rainbow Siege) into a newly created subsidiary—before raising <strong>€1.16 billion</strong> from Tencent in exchange for a 25% ownership stake (implying a <strong>pre-money valuation of €4 billion</strong>)—AJ Investments, alongside a growing coalition of shareholders, is initiating <strong>legal proceedings in France</strong>. </p></div>



<p>We are demanding that a French court compel Ubisoft to convene an Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM), giving all shareholders the right to vote on two critical resolutions:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Renegotiate the Tencent Deal </strong>– This transaction must be restructured into a <strong>direct asset sale to Tencent for no less than €4 billion</strong>, the valuation already accepted by both Tencent and Ubisoft’s board. At the moment, shareholders have no clarity how the deal that was announced last week will eventually benefit shareholders of Ubisoft.<br></li>



<li><strong>Distribute an Extraordinary Dividend – </strong>Following the sale, <strong>Ubisoft shall return €23 per share in cash to shareholders</strong> (totaling <strong>€3 billion</strong>), while preserving<strong> €1 billion to cover remaining corporate net debt</strong>.</li>
</ol>



<p>Additionally, we will seek a ruling that:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Tencent be excluded from voting</strong>, due to its direct interest in the outcome of the<br>transaction.<br></li>



<li><strong>Guillemot Brothers Holding’s voting rights be limited </strong>to their non-Tencent-linked shares.</li>
</ul>



<div><p>The market’s reaction to this deal is clear that shareholders are not sure whether they will get a significant benefit from this transaction. <strong>Ubisoft’s share price fell by more than 20% on unusually high volume</strong>. This signals a clear verdict from investors — the proposed deal is deeply flawed, structured to bypass mandatory public offer rules, and designed to <strong>entrench control by the Guillemot family</strong>, who now <strong>hold less than 10%</strong> of the company’s economic interest.</p><p>We believe this is a critical moment for shareholders. Without immediate intervention, the company may pursue further asset sales or dilution <strong>without delivering value to shareholders</strong>. In contrast, a simple vote at an EGM could deliver <strong>€23 per share in cash ( €3 billion valuation</strong>, source: Euronext outstanding shares for calculation)—more than <strong>double the current share price</strong>—and restore shareholder trust in Ubisoft’s future.</p><p>We suggest that management will explain the benefits of the deal to the shareholders in detail (not 2 A4 pages from where many details are not clear) as the owners of the business and we will have a vote on it. Sell the core IPs to the Tencent as a whole or sell them the 25% stake in a subsidiary that was already announced. Shareholders will choose what they prefer.</p></div>



<p>We call on all minority shareholders to join us now in this legal effort to protect value and demand accountability. The time to act is today—before the damage becomes irreversible.</p>

            <p>When you shoot your beginner pistol in action <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hell-clock">Hell Clock</a>, it feels like someone slapped the foundations of the catacombs you're standing in with a pork chop big enough to decapitate god. There is beefy gun feel, and there is this: a gun chutney so chunksome and tactile I had to check my mouse hadn't suddenly sprouted haptics. As a single player, single class genre entrant, it's not quite fair to compare it to more sprawling mainstays like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/path-of-exile-2">Path Of Exile 2</a>. But I woke up feeling unfair today: even in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1782460/Hell_Clock/">its demo form</a>, I'd much rather play Hell Clock than either of them.</p>

<p>In 1897, the near entirety of the Brazilian municipality of Canudos's 25,000 inhabitants were massacred by heavy artillery bombardments, after successfully repelling three previous assaults from government forces. That's a very truncated account, and you can <a href="https://www.aaihs.org/state-violence-and-the-canudos-massacre-in-brazil/">learn more here</a>, but that's the setting that Brazilian studio Rogue Snail (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/relic-hunters-zero">Relic Hunters</a> series) are folklore-ifying and undead-itising here. You play as gunslinger Pajeú, slinging his way gun-fully through dungeons to rescue the soul of his mentor The Counselor.</p>
<p>There's plenty here that'll be immediately familiar to dedicated ARPeGgios, but there's also a good dose of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hades">Hades</a> and other action <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelikes</a> (lites). You blast mobs with hotkey commands, building mana with one kind of bullet, then spending it on other, better bullets. You gulp down potions. You dodge with space (it hurts enemies though!). You collect shiny loot and…</p>
<p>Wait, but you actually <em>don't</em> collect shiny loot. And even if you did, you'd lose it after your run anyway. Instead, you collect purple crystals to spend on permanent gear and abilities between runs. Everything else - gold, ability buffs,   - is temporary. There's another wrinkle, too. Each run has a time limit of 20 minutes, although there is a 'relaxed mode' option to disable this, and it does pause during boss fights.</p>
<p>Here are some lovely bullet point features from Steam. Actually, I added the bullet points. Wouldn't want to misquote Steam. SEGA once misquoted a review I wrote of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer">Total War: Warhammer</a> 3 in which I said I'd be "hesitant to call Warhammer III a landmark strategy game in its own right". "A landmark strategy game in its own right" - The Guardian. Utterly shameless. Here's the fact-me-doos:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li><strong>RACE AGAINST TIME</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Every second counts as you battle the undead forces of your oppressors. Risk delving deeper for powerful loot and face the nightmarish incarnations of those who sought to bury the truth.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FORGE UNSTOPPABLE BUILDS</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Hunt down ancient Relics infused with the strength of resistance. Create devastating combinations that channel Canudos's unbreakable spirit into unstoppable power.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>UNLEASH HELLISH POWER</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Master a diverse selection of devastating abilities born from righteous fury. Dance through hordes with lightning-fast knife strikes, smash enemies with Canudos' great bell, or rain rapid-fire death from your trusty sidearm.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>REWRITE HISTORY</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Each descent brings new chances to right historical wrongs. Discover unique combinations of Blessings to evolve your build as you face the demons of Brazil's dark past, present, and future.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FIGHT AT YOUR OWN PACE</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Whether you seek a brutal test against history's oppressors or a thoughtful journey of justice, Hell Clock adapts to your path. Remove all time pressure with Relaxed Mode, or push your limits in Hardcore mode.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>VENGEANCE NEVER ENDS</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Experience a complete three-act story campaign, then test your perfectly tuned builds in the challenging Endgame, where your gear, abilities, and playstyle are pushed to their limits.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you're a sicko for the long term grind, build theorycrafting, and the like, then sure - it's far too early to say whether Hell Clock can compete with its behemoth genre mates. But in terms of just, like, having fun with a videogame - yeah, this is the only ARPG I'm interested in playing right now. It's due out "Q2" of this year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/is-fromsoftwares-new-game-a-bloodborne-sequel/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Bloodborne is still the name on everyone’s lips years later. Its impact has been profound, and bridged a gap between casual gamers and the Soulslike genre. It’s considered one of FromSoftware’s finest pieces of work, and a Bloodborne 2 sequel is being discussed because of a certain The Duskbloods.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-games-announced-during-the-nintendo-switch-2-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2 Direct</a> unveiled a ton of exciting details about the new console. But one of the most shocking reveals was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-lands-fromsoftware-exclusive-the-duskbloods/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Duskbloods</a>—a new FromSoftware Switch 2 exclusive. In an age where exclusivity is dying and multi-platform releases are common, this feels like a huge win for Nintendo.</p>



<p>One thing you can’t help but feel watching The Duskbloods is that it’s a Bloodborne 2 sequel.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-duskbloods-a-bloodborne-2-sequel">Is The Duskbloods a Bloodborne 2 Sequel?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>I’m getting Majora’s Mask vibes. Credit to FromSoftware</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Duskbloods is not a direct sequel to Bloodborne, and is considered more a spiritual successor to FromSoftware’s 2015 hit.</strong></p>



<p>I watched the Switch 2 Direct live and saw <a href="https://www.fromsoftware.jp/duskbloods/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Duskbloods</a> reveal trailer. Hand on heart, I was waiting for a “Bloodborne 2” graphic to pop up at the end. The aesthetic, the vibe, and the enemies exude a distinct Bloodborne feel.</p>



<p>But I think it’s pretty clear this is a standalone title—perhaps borrowing from the Bloodborne library. It’s due in <em>2026</em>, so there’s plenty of time to see what other influences FromSoftware has taken from its own IP—although it’s doing new things courtesy of its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/switch-2-exclusive-the-duskbloods-will-feature-8-player-pvpve-multiplayer-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">8-player PvPvE multiplayer</a>.</p>



<p>It remains to be seen if we ever get official new Bloodborne media (a remake or a remaster), but this will do in the meantime.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-bloodborne-getting-a-remake">Is Bloodborne Getting a remake?</h2>



<p><strong>FromSoftware has not indicated they are developing a Bloodborne Remake, nor does it look like we’re getting a remaster or even a basic PC port for extra platforms.</strong></p>



<p>I’d argue Bloodborne is the most influential and most-loved title FromSoft has created outside of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-elden-ring/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elden Ring</a>. It’s resonated with fans for years, making its continued absence puzzling. Players have begged for a remake for years, or a 60 FPS remaster at the very least.</p>



<p>Worst still, while Sony continues to release its exclusives on PC, Bloodborne still hasn’t received a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fromsoftware-boss-does-not-mind-a-bloodborne-pc-port/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC port</a>. FromSoftware’s president has even brought up the notion of a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fromsoftware-bloodborne-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloodborne remake</a>, too. It probably should’ve happened by now, leading us to wonder if it ever will.</p>



<hr>



<p>Are you happy to see FromSoftware making a game that looks to be in a similar vein to Bloodborne? Or are you still desperately hoping for a remake or remaster?</p>
