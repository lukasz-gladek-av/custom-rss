		<p>OwlCat Games has released the main theme song for The Expanse: Osiris Reborn, with the theme being composed by Paweł Perepelic. It has quite the epic sound to it and does capture some of that The Expanse feeling, delving into something that seems hopeful and inspiring but ending slightly on a mournful note. Have a listen for yourselves.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Expanse: Osiris Reborn — Main Theme" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9PqNeoff3NI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Here’s a little bit of blurb to establish the setting of The Expanse: Osiris Reborn:</p>
<p><em>You play as a Pinkwater Security mercenary whose brief shore leave on the asteroid Eros spirals out of control. Trapped in a deadly lockdown and drawn into a solar system-wide conspiracy far beyond your control, you’ll have to adapt, survive, taking command of the most advanced ship in the whole of the solar system. Gather a crew and find your own path through the web of lies to leave your mark on the solar system.</em></p>
<p>This puts the game’s setting right at the start of the sci-fi series’ timeline, running in parallel to the adventures of the crew of the Rocinante during the first and second seasons of the TV series. You can choose to be from Earth and Mars, or be a Belter. You will need to use different skills in combat and outside of it. In combat, the action will be that of a third person shooter but with tactical elements as you will need to use tactical items and the skills of your crew to get the upper hand. The crew will be incredibly important to the story and the way events can unfold. Each person you pick up has their own goals, motivations, and history to unpick, which you may discover while living together on the ship, which is called Gemini. Uncovering the layers of your crew and the secrets of the wider Expanse universe, and by doing so the paths that open to you can and will change.</p>

<p>There are four versions of The Expanse: Osiris Reborn including the standard edition, the deluxe edition, the Miller’s Pack, and the Collector’s edition. What is worth noting is that the game will not be getting a physical release. The standard edition is priced at $49.99 which includes the game, an early adopter item and a Discord role.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deluxe Edition ($59.99) – </strong>All standard edition items plus name in credits, Miller’s OPA Heavy armour, and UN Spec Ops assault rifle.</li>
<li><strong>Miller’s Pack ($79.99)&nbsp;</strong>– All standard and deluxe items plus digital Artbook, digital soundtrack, Hall of Fame, Miller’s Casual outfit, Miller’s revolver, exclusive beta access.</li>
<li><strong>Collector’s Edition ($249.99)&nbsp;</strong>– All the items from the other editions plus a physical Gemini ship model, a physical Gemini medallion, printed artbook, three embroidered patches, and stickers.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Expanse: Osiris Reborn will be released for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series XS.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/europa-universalis-v">Europa Universalis 5</a> has its first public patch, which encompasses over 350 fixes. Among the bigger things it smacks with the heal-o-spanner (an actual game development tool, traditionally carved from the base of a Taito arcade machine) is the Steams achievements system, which will no longer shower players in plaudits they haven't earned. On the plus side, you'll now earn achievements even if you activate the "allow ahistorical" game rule.
</p>
<p>I grasp at those relatively intelligible nuggets like somebody lunging for the doorhandle in a room full of bees. I do not play Europa Universalis 5. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/europa-universalis-5-review">That review gig</a> went to Brendy, who was anointed many months ago as our human sacrifice to this particular god of 4X <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a>. Brendy is now more number table than man. He bleeds - erm, well, I can't even say what he bleeds, because I'm not hip to the Europa Universalis terminology. As such, I'm a poor choice to write up the game's first set of patch notes, but what can you do. Here are the apparent highlights, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3450310/view/589535332141105331?l=english">as detailed on Steam</a>:
</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Fixed more than 350 bugs (not counting Translation-related number of errors fixed, which you can find in its own section)</li>
<li>Fixed the scope type for Achievement triggers, which was triggering several errors, along with many other minor fixes to them; also, activating the "Allow Ahistorical" game rule now doesn't block getting Achievements</li>
<li>Fixed several CTDs</li>
<li>Made several fixes to Personal Unions, especially to AI Union Law voting, making it less spammy</li>
<li>Fixed an issue making the Timurid spawning player event to not work properly</li>
<li>The 'Claim French Throne' peace treaty during the 'Hundred Years' War' situation no longer requires you to be senior in a PU already</li>
<li>The events that convert Hussite pops for Bohemia during the 'Hussite Wars' situation are now converting much more aggressively and impactfully</li>
<li>Japanese clans will now properly lose their clan's foreign buildings when being landed after the 'Sengoku Jidai' situation starts</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>The rest of the notes span all aspects of the game, from whether or not the Earldom of Ulster is a Vassal of the Pale, through the addition of province capital map markers, to ensuring that there are "proper reasons for countries to join Autocephalous Patriarchates". WTF is an Autocephalous Patriarchate. Some kind of octopus grandad? Can you conquer things with it? If you're reading these notes, you've likely played the game and I look forward to your generous explanations.
</p><p>Europa Universalis 5 seems to be going down well among players. It and Paradox stablemates <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings-iii">Crusader Kings 3</a> and Hearts Of Iron IV are currently congregating in the high 20s on Steam's 100 Most Played. They've got <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> sandwiched between them like a strip of horse jerky. If you're keen on EU5, but are having trouble running it, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/if-your-pc-is-too-puny-to-launch-europa-universalis-5-theres-a-secret-very-low-graphics-preset">this workaround for lower-spec graphics cards might be of interest</a>.</p>

              <p>We’re all now used to every big-name game coming out in five differently priced versions, each containing more in-game stuff than the last, but no matter which you choose you will still be buying the <em>same game</em>. That’s never been the case for the mainline&nbsp;<em>Pokémon&nbsp;</em>series, starting even with its very first English-language release in 1998 with <em>Pokémon Red</em> and <em>Pokémon Blue</em>, each version subtly (but to fans, crucially) different. But have you ever stopped to wonder why? The reason is wonderfully silly.</p> <p>Creating two versions of what mostly boils down to the same game is certainly not an obvious choice. It introduces a huge amount of confusion to an unaware audience, not sure which is the most recent game or whether they’re making a mistake by buying one over the other. To those familiar with the series, it’s a huge feature and selling point, and deciding which version of the game you’re going to buy and why is a big part of the experience. But given the fear of alienation and confusion, it’s hard to imagine most marketing executives would ever allow such a conceit to survive its first boardroom whisper. Yet one of the best-selling game series of all time suggests it can work out OK.</p>

 <p>But why? Well, as&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/pokemon/nintendo-legend-shigeru-miyamoto-says-one-of-the-reasons-pokemon-red-and-green-were-made-was-because-creator-satoshi-tajiri-joked-mario-couldnt-be-surpassed-unless-fans-were-sold-2-copies-of-a-game/">GamesRadar</a>&nbsp;</em>spotted via <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1986266577789133097">Genki_JPN’s X account</a>, in a recent shareholders meeting Nintendo director Shigeru Miyamoto was asked if anything could ever outsell <em>Mario Kart 8</em>. This caused him to recall a conversation with the creator of the&nbsp;<em>Pokémon</em> franchise, Satoshi Tajiri, about how the monster-catching games could ever outdo the success of the <em>Mario&nbsp;</em>games. Via machine translation, <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251105_2.pdf">Miyamoto told investors</a>, “A long time ago, Tajiri-san, the director of <em>Pokémon</em>, joked with me that if you want to surpass Nintendo’s <em>Mario </em>you’ll have to sell two copies of the game to each customer.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">In a shareholders meeting Shigeru Miyamoto shared a story about Pokémon creator Satoshi Tajiri and one of the reasons Pokémon Red and Green came to be!</p> <p>"A long time ago, Tajiri-san, the director of Pokémon, before creating the first Pokémon game, once joked to me ‘If you want to… <a href="https://t.co/YTS4AvAbu9">pic.twitter.com/YTS4AvAbu9</a></p> <p>— Genki✨ (@Genki_JPN) <a href="https://twitter.com/Genki_JPN/status/1986266577789133097?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Miyamoto continued, “This was one of the reasons why <em>Pokémon Red&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Green</em> were created.”</p> <p>(In Japan, the games were originally released in 1996 as&nbsp;<em>Red</em> and&nbsp;<em>Green</em>, with a&nbsp;<em>Blue</em> later the same year.)</p> <p>For what it’s worth, it’s rarely actually worked! As phenomenally successful as the <em>Pokémon&nbsp;</em>games have been,&nbsp;<em>Mario</em> tends to beat them on each system. The two wins for <em>Pokémon</em><em>&nbsp;</em>in this match-up have been <em>Pokémon Gold </em>and&nbsp;<em>Silver</em> on Game Boy Color and <em>Pokémon</em> Ruby and&nbsp;<em>Sapphire</em> on Game Boy Advance. On the DS, 3DS and Switch, <em>Mario</em> has taken the lead each time. (There were no mainline <em>Pokémon</em> games on Wii or Wii U.) But it certainly hasn’t hurt, either, with&nbsp;<em>Sword</em> and&nbsp;<em>Shield</em> selling 26.84 million copies, and&nbsp;<em>Scarlet </em>and&nbsp;<em>Violet</em> hitting 27.15 million. It’s just that&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart 8</em> has rather rudely sold 69.56 million, <em>Super Smash Bros</em>. <em>Ultimate</em> 36.93 million, and&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> 29.84 million.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Sony is filing a lawsuit against an eBay seller who it accuses of selling fake PlayStation 5 accessories, such as carrying cases for the console and its various peripherals, claiming that it has made unauthorized use of the company’s trademarks.</span></p> <p><span>As </span><a href="https://thegamepost.com/sony-lawsuit-ebay-counterfeit-playstation-5-accessories-2-million/"><i><span>The Game Post</span></i></a><span> lays out, Sony’s lawsuit against eBay user “zaocuand-002” has the company seeking potentially millions of dollars in damages as it continues to target counterfeit PlayStation products being sold around the internet. eBay is but one of several platforms Sony has been combing through in its search for fake PS5 accessories, as it has also gotten into legal scraps with sellers on Amazon, Walmart, and other sites.</span></p>

 <p><span>Sony has previously targeted “dozens” of anonymous marketplace sellers in its lawsuits targeting counterfeit PS5 accessories, but this latest eBay lawsuit specifically homes in on the zaocuand-002 account which has, according to </span><i><span>The Game Post</span></i><span>, sold over 9000 items on the platform. A PS5 carrying case is specifically mentioned in the lawsuit, but this listing has seemingly been taken down after the lawsuit was filed in October. Sony’s suit demands that platforms such as eBay “shall disable and cease displaying any advertisements used by or associated with Defendant in connection with the sale of counterfeit and infringing goods using the PlayStation Trademarks</span><span>.” </span><span>Alternatively, the company requests up to $2 million “for each and every use” of the counterfeit trademark, as well as compensation for its legal fees.</span></p>

 <p><span>“Defendant created an e-commerce store operating under at least the Seller Alias that is advertising, offering for sale, and selling Unauthorized Products to unknowing consumers,” the complaint reads. “Defendant attempts to avoid and mitigate liability by operating under at least the Seller Alias to conceal both its identity and the full scope and interworking of its counterfeiting operation.”</span></p> <p><span>Sony’s been getting pretty lawsuit-happy these past few months, as the PlayStation company is also </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-lawsuit-sony-tencent-clone-knock-off-light-1851787163"><span>suing Tencent over a pretty blatant </span><i><span>Horizon Zero Dawn </span></i><span>knock-off</span></a><span>. However, the Chinese publisher claims Sony is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/light-of-motiram-horizon-lawsuit-sony-tencent-monopoly-2000626858"><span>trying to monopolize open-world genre conventions</span></a><span> with the suit.</span></p>

                <p>Nintendo enjoyed enormous success in the film department with The Super Mario Bros. Movie, which earned more than $1.3 billion worldwide. Now, Nintendo is gearing up to release The Super Mario Galaxy Movie in 2026, with a live-action The Legend of Zelda film to follow in 2027. More films based on Nintendo properties <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-teases-more-movies-to-come/1100-6535943/" data-ref-id="1100-6535943">could come next</a>, and Nintendo has now said moviemaking is something Nintendo wants to be "even more actively involved in going forward."</p><p>Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa said in <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251105_2e.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo's latest earnings report</a> that Nintendo is keen to pursue moviemaking because it believes films can become long-term assets for the company as it looks to the future beyond games.</p><p>Nintendo has an internal unit called Nintendo Pictures, which is conducting experiments in the video space, including the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendos-second-weird-baby-short-introduces-pikmin-to-the-mix/1100-6535303/" data-ref-id="1100-6535303">recent Pikmin shorts</a>. But Nintendo Pictures won't be the team that handles future feature films--that work is being done by established Hollywood studios like Universal and Illumination.</p><p>"For movies, there is an established business framework where the distribution companies manage movies. The past indicates that following that established structure and creating content with care and attention leads to profits," Furukawa said.</p><p>Hollywood is an established machine with a "proven business model," Furukawa said, but Nintendo Pictures is a new unit trying to "take on various challenges in areas that have not yet clearly taken shape."</p><p>"The 'Close to You' Pikmin-themed short video that was released recently was created as an experiment based on this concept. We would like to continue providing this kind of content that generates enthusiasm around the world, and develop it into an important asset for Nintendo," Furukawa said.</p><p>No more Nintendo movies beyond the live-action Zelda film have been announced, but there have been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-movie-team-returns-for-a-donkey-kong-film-listing-reveals/1100-6533131/" data-ref-id="1100-6533131">rumors of a Donkey Kong film.</a></p><p>Nintendo also recently discussed its general philosophy for filmmaking recently. The company said it doesn't simply license its properties to film studios. Instead, Nintendo is involved in the financing and "deeply involved" in production. Shigeru Miyamoto, for example, produced The Super Mario Bros. Movie and will be a producer on The Super Mario Galaxy Movie and the Zelda movie, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/live-action-zelda-movie-from-sony-and-nintendo-is-now-filming-apparently/1100-6535988/" data-ref-id="1100-6535988">just began filming in New Zealand. </a></p><p>The Super Mario Bros. Movie made a gargantuan $1.36 billon at the global box office, ranking as the No. 2 highest-grossing movie of 2023, only behind Barbie ($1.44 billion). The Super Mario Bros. Movie ranks as the <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/chart/ww_top_lifetime_gross/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">No. 18 highest-grossing movie in history.</a></p><p>"It was enjoyed by a vast audience, including those who had experienced Mario games, those less familiar with gaming, and people of all ages, from children to seniors," Nintendo said. "What has pleased us most about this film, even more than the measurable results, are the warm comments we received from so many people."</p><p>Nintendo's gaming business is booming at the moment, thanks in part to the recent launch of the Switch 2. It's sold <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-continues-to-be-a-massive-hit-selling-over-10-million-units-in-six-months/1100-6535903/" data-ref-id="1100-6535903">more than 10 million units thus far</a>, becoming Nintendo's fastest-selling platform ever. Nintendo is enthusiastic about its sales potential this holiday, recently boosting the console's sales projections from 15 million to 19 million for the fiscal year that ends in March 2026.</p>

                <p>Whenever a new mainline Pokemon game rolls around, you can expect not one but two versions of the same game to hit the shelves. That's a sales decision that was made with a primary goal in mind--to give Nintendo's iconic plumber Mario a run for his money.</p><p>During an investor Q&amp;A this week, Nintendo veteran Shigeru Miyamoto spoke about a meeting he once had with Pokemon creator Satoshi Tajiri, who joked that the only way to beat Mario Kart in sales was to sell two copies of Pokemon to each consumer. Miyamoto says this was one of the reasons why the first Pokemon game was released as Pokemon Blue and Pokemon Red, which is a tradition that was continued since then with most mainline games.</p><p>"That is one reason why Pokémon started with both Pokémon Red and Pokémon Blue," <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251105_2e.pdf" rel="nofollow ">Miyamoto said</a>. "I believe that new ideas are born precisely because of people like him, who challenge themselves to surpass what came before."</p><p>These Pokemon games typically offer exclusive Pokemon for players to collect, and as of Pokemon Silver and Gold, two distinct legendary Pokemon that can only be found in their respective games. Of course, trading Pokemon is a big part of the experience as well, and recent games have made the process of completing your Pokedex easier thanks to advances in online connectivity. There are still fans who are completionists at heart and will buy both versions of a Pokemon game, with Nintendo even selling two-packs to cater to player demand.</p><p>This year marked the 30th anniversary of Pokemon, and while a new Generation 10 game wasn't released, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-free-nintendo-switch-2-game-updates-changes/2900-6591/" data-ref-id="2900-6591">Pokemon Scarlet and Violet did get a Switch 2 upgrade</a> that greatly improved the game on the new Nintendo hardware. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/pokemon-legends-z-a-review-a-battle-revolution/1900-6418423/" data-ref-id="1900-6418423">Pokemon Legends: Z-A was also released</a>, and it saw players return to Lumiose City for the first time since Pokemon X and Y on the Nintendo 3DS.</p><p>In the business department, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-continues-to-be-a-massive-hit-selling-over-10-million-units-in-six-months/1100-6535903/">Nintendo has reported that it has sold 10.36 million Switch 2</a> units as of September 30, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/software/index.html" rel="nofollow ">Mario Kart World has sold 9.57 million units so far</a>. The company also revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-vast-majority-of-nintendo-switch-2-owners-transitioned-from-switch-1/1100-6535947/">84% of Switch 2 owners previously owned a Switch 1 console</a>, and while it'll still sell the older console, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/original-switch-will-not-be-removed-from-sale-but-nintendo-will-focus-on-switch-2-going-forward/1100-6535968/">Nintendo will focus on the Switch 2 going forward</a>.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/">Grand Theft Auto VI has been delayed</a>, which means we'll have to keep going back to Grand Theft Auto V to get a fix for Rockstar's best-selling franchise. If you're one of the handful of people who have yet to play one of the highest-selling video games ever, it looks like you'll get another chance, at least on PlayStation. According to <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps-plus-extra-grand-theft-auto-v-revient-bientot-dans-le-catalogue-de-jeux-60766">Billbil-kun at Dealabs</a>, Grand Theft Auto V is heading back to the PS Plus Extra games catalogue.</p>



<p>Billbil-kun and Dealabs have a strong track record when it comes to reporting PS Plus games, whether it's one of, or sometimes all three, of the three games offered for the Essential tier, or one of the games entering the catalogue at the Extra tier.</p>



<p>This report pertains to the latter, as we've already had the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/10/29/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-november-stray-ea-sports-wrc-24-totally-accurate-battle-simulator/">three games for November at the PS Plus Essential tier</a> revealed (<a href="https://wccftech.com/stray-playstation-plus-november-2025/">one of which Billbil-kun also correctly reported ahead of the official announcement</a>).</p>



<p>Billbil-kun also predicts that this coming Wednesday, November 12, we'll get the official reveal of what games are coming to the PS Plus Extra catalogue, which will include Grand Theft Auto V.</p>



<p>With GTA VI delayed, it lines up perfectly that GTA V would re-enter the PS Plus Extra catalogue, just to make it as accessible as possible for people wanting to remain immersed in the world of Grand Theft Auto on their consoles. It's already available on Xbox Game Pass, so having it back on PlayStation's subscription service just rounds out where players can find it.</p>



<p>Regarding the additional delay for GTA VI, Take-Two boss <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-delay-help-rockstar-exceed-expectations-take-two-ceo-never-regretted-delay/">Strauss Zelnick says the company has <em>"never regretted</em>" delaying a game</a>. At least it looks like we'll get another way to play GTA V in the meantime.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rockstar has announced that the hotly-anticipated <i>Grand Theft Auto 6&nbsp;</i>has been delayed once again, with the game now due to launch in November next year.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/ak3ak31a49a221/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-now-set-to-launch-november-19-2026" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> on the official&nbsp;Rockstar website, the studio says that the open-world game, which was originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-vi-release-date-delay" rel="nofollow">due to arrive in May 2026</a>, will now launch on November 19th that same year. This represents the game's second delay; it was initially set for a 2025 launch before being pushed back to May.</p>

<p>The studio says it's sorry for "adding additional time" to what it knows "has been a long wait", but that the extra months of development will allow the team to "finish the game with the level of polish you have come to expect and deserve".</p>

<p>Their consternation makes a lot of sense; as of February last year,&nbsp;<em>GTA 5&nbsp;</em>had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-v-has-sold-over-195-million-units-red-dead-redemption-2-at-61-million" rel="nofollow">sold a mammoth 195 million units</a>, and since it's been almost two years since that figure, it's likely that the game's sales have only increased since then.</p>

<p>News of&nbsp;<em>GTA 6</em>'s delay also comes just a few days after developer Rockstar was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rockstar-union-busting-accusation-gta-6" rel="nofollow">accused of union-busting</a> following the dismissal of a number of employees who were reportedly involved in union activity.</p>

<p>Rockstar subsequently <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-05/-grand-theft-auto-studio-says-fired-employees-were-leaking-information" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">claimed</a> that the employees in question were leaking information about&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>, with a spokesperson saying that the employees were sharing company information in a forum that also included non-workers.</p>




<p><em>Grand Theft Auto 6&nbsp;</em>is now set to launch for <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/grand-theft-auto-vi/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/grand-theft-auto-vi/9NL3WWNZLZZN" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on November 19th, 2026. No PC version has yet been confirmed by Rockstar.</p>

            <p>Arc Raiders may have sold over 2.5m copies, according to data from industry analyst Rhy Elliott from Alinea Analytics.</p>
<p>Alinea Analytics, a video game data and market analysis company, has stated that 2.5m copies, surpassing $100m in revenue for developer Embark Studios. The majority of these sales come from Steam users, where roughly 69.2% of are present according to Alinea Analytics.</p>

<p>So why is Arc Raiders so popular, when other extraction shooters haven't reached such highs in terms of sales or player count? Well, <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/arc-raiders-has-sold-25m-copies">according to the blog posted by Elliott</a>: "ARC Raiders is great because it focuses on community - NOT because it's an extraction shooter".</p><p>They also noted that there's a crossover between other co-operative games, and that the focus of community in Arc Raiders may have made all the difference. Elliott wrote: "Our crossover estimates show that about half of ARC Raiders players on Steam have also played <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lethal-company">Lethal Company</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>, respectively. And over 40% have played <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/repo">R.E.P.O</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/valheim">Valheim</a>, PEAK, and Dead by Daylight."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-players-are-waging-war-over-a-controversial-topic-are-pvpers-ruining-the-experience">Arc Raiders are actually waging a war of words between themselves over the collaborative nature of the game</a>, with many feeling torn between helping other raiders out and going in for the kill on strangers. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-trials-are-the-perfect-way-to-do-ranked-in-extraction-shooters">While taking on the weekly trials</a>, it's clear to see the frustration from dying after a bountiful run.</p>

            <p>While we are going to have to wait a bit longer for GTA 6 following last night's news that its release has been delayed once more, it sounds like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">Grand Theft Auto 5</a> will be making its return to PlayStation Plus quite soon.</p>
<p>According to the ever reliable <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps-plus-extra-grand-theft-auto-v-revient-bientot-dans-le-catalogue-de-jeux-60766">Dealabs</a>, Rockstar's juggernaut of a video game (<a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps-plus-extra-grand-theft-auto-v-revient-bientot-dans-le-catalogue-de-jeux-60766">which has now sold more copies than there are people in Brazil</a>) is going to be available for those PS Plus subscribers on the Extra and Premium tiers in the very near future, with an announcement from Sony expected later this month.</p>
<p>Dealabs said we will hear official word of GTA 5's return on 12th November, with the game then making its PS Plus comeback on 18th November. GTA 5 hasn't been available for those on PS Plus since it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-5-leaves-playstation-plus-next-month">removed from the service around the middle of last year</a>. As for what else may be coming to PS Plus, Dealabs has no current information. </p>

<p>Looking to the future of the Grand Theft Auto series, GTA 6 is now expected to release on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-gta-6-is-delayed-again-by-half-a-year-to-november-2026-take-two-stock-immediately-begins-to-drop">19th November, 2026</a> (for now, at least. Personally, I wouldn't be surprised if it gets delayed again).</p>
<p>Per publisher Take-Two, the most recent GTA 6 delay is designed to give "some additional time to finish the game with the high level of polish players expect and deserve". It added "Rockstar has our full support of course", and that the Take-Two team is "confident they will deliver an unrivalled blockbuster entertainment experience".</p>

Here's The Chance To Make Your Voice Heard 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/af10206becfb1/what-are-the-100-best-nintendo-games-heres-the-chance-to-make-your-voice-heard-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Gavin Lane / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has been in this business for a <em>long</em> time, so when you're attempting to decide on what the 100 best games released on its consoles and handhelds are, it's little wonder that it's <em>quite</em> the challenge.</p>
<p>However, we've teamed up with our friends over at <a href="https://www.ign.com/">IGN</a> to do just that – and we're in the process of concocting a list of the best games ever released on Nintendo's systems.</p>
<p>You may wonder how this list differs from the one <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/top-100-best-nintendo-games-of-all-time">already on this site</a>, but the remit here is somewhat different; this collaborative ranking will include third-party games that are either Nintendo hardware exclusives or are synonymous with Nintendo consoles.</p>
<p>"IGN and Nintendo Life have come together to build the definitive list of The 100 Best Nintendo Games of All Time," <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-100-best-nintendo-games-ever-faceoff">says IGN's Simon Cardy</a>. "We'll be rolling that ranking out from Monday, November 10 to Friday, November 14, revealing 20 picks a day until one game is crowned Number One."</p>
<p>Be sure to check out IGN's <a href="https://www.ign.com/watch/nintendo-voice-chat">Nintendo Voice Chat</a> for a rundown of the selected games. Who knows? You might even spot a familiar face...</p>
<p>Before the final list is published, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-100-best-nintendo-games-ever-faceoff">IGN is running a face-off campaign</a> that allows you to cast your votes and shape a separate, reader-curated list.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Talk to any <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-review-in-progress-difficulty-1851782700"><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em></a> fan lately and you’ll find a tarnished husk eager for a reason to jump back into their favorite obsession of 2025. Even after spending hundreds of hours toiling across the same map and fighting the same bosses we’re hungry for more, especially after the game’s new <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-hard-mode-deep-night-ranked-2000620376">Deep of Night ranked mode</a> ended up being a dud. Well, we apparently only have to wait a little longer. FromSoftware’s parent company has confirmed the game’s first official paid DLC will arrive by April 2026.</p> <p>That morsel of good news came in Kadokawa Corporation’s <a href="https://ssl4.eir-parts.net/doc/9468/ir_material_for_fiscal_ym13/190133/00.pdf">latest financial earnings report</a>. In it, the company said the <em>Elden Ring</em> spin-off exceeded sales expectations but fell off steeply in the second quarter. It’s hopeful an expansion can revive the game’s momentum the same way <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> did with the original game.</p>

 <p>“FromSoftware is currently developing <em>Elden Ring Nightreign DLC</em> (planned for release in FY2025), <em>Elden Ring Tarnished Edition</em> (planned for release in 2026 for Nintendo Switch 2), and <em>The Duskbloods</em> (planned for release in 2026),” Kadokawa Corporation confirmed. Is FromSoftware working on anything else for next year? <a href="https://kotaku.com/dark-souls-3-remaster-armored-core-6-fromsoftware-1851786550">Previous rumors</a> suggested it’s next game isn’t as far away as some fans might think, with hints that it could be a new <em>Armored Core</em> or a remaster for <em>Dark Souls III</em>.</p>

 <h2><em>Nightreign</em> needs a new map</h2> <p>But for <em>Nightreign</em> sickos like myself, the DLC will be more than enough to keep us occupied, at least if it’s on par with the studio’s previous expansions. What does that wishlist include? A new map, for one. I’ve grown quite <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-tips-items-wending-grace-flask-1851782963">fond of Limveld</a> during my time there, but it represents only a small, randomized portion of the original game’s big open world. There are so many other parts that could be adapted into similarly sized, procedurally generated maps.</p>

 <p><em>Nightreign</em> is, first and foremost, a game about logistics and cost-benefit analysis. Much of that decision making has become streamlined and rote as players have become experts in all of the tradeoffs and probabilities underlying the current map. A new one, in addition to a fresh visual palette and new enemies and points of interest to draw upon, would almost feel like a sequel.</p>

 <p>Fans have also been begging for <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-renant-summon-necromancy-faith-1851784379">more character classes</a> to try. There are currently eight in the game and most players have settled in on their favorites. Two new classes, especially ones that favor different weapons and abilities than the existing ones, would be another draw. New bosses also seem like a must for any DLC. FromSoftware has its entire Soulsborne back catalog to draw from, and the time it takes not just to learn new encounters but master them is no small investment.</p> <p>That’s especially the <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-everdark-sovereign-libra-fissure-1851786568">case for the Nightlords</a> that cap off each run. The game currently has eight. Add four more and their Everdark variants and we’ll essentially have <em>Nightreign 2</em>. But I’ll settle for anything at this point. I just want a reason to send out party invites, round up the crew, and get our asses kicked like it’s launch all over again.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar has updated the main GTA 6 website to reflect the game’s most recent delay, and it’s sticking with its console-only launch for now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GTA 6 was delayed from May to November 2026, with Rockstar saying the extra half year “will allow us to finish the game with the level of polish you have come to expect and deserve.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some had wondered if this latest delay — its second since it was officially revealed in December 2023 — would cause Rockstar Games to revise its launch plans, which so far include PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S only. But, as spotted by <a href="https://x.com/videotechuk_/status/1986784619530801294" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@videotechuk_</a>, now Rockstar has updated the official GTA 6 website to mention the November 19 release date, it lists the consoles as the only launch platforms.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/07/screenshot-2025-11-07-131810-1762522553789.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">GTA 6 is still set for console only at launch. Image credit: <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/VI">Rockstar Games website</a>.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What does this mean for PC gamers? They already faced the prospect of having to wait longer for GTA 6 — back when GTA 6 was planned for release in the fall of this year, some thought the game would come out on PC in 2026. That now looks impossible, and some PC gamers are worried they won’t get to play the game until 2028. Late 2027 feels like a safe bet, but this is Rockstar. It’s hard to predict what the company will do.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with IGN last night, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-is-highly-confident-on-new-gta-6-release-date-but-says-when-games-are-released-too-early-bad-things-happen">Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick said he was "highly confident" that this is the last time GTA 6 will be delayed</a>. “We wanted to give Rockstar the appropriate amount of time to polish the title and make sure it can be the very best it can be," he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Previously, GTA 6 was announced for a fall 2025 release, which Zelnick was confident in at the time. The game was later delayed to May of 2026, with Take-Two and Rockstar similarly citing a need for polish. Zelnick sounded confident then, too.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for launch platforms, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/is-gta-6-coming-to-pc-take-two-boss-has-a-coy-response">last year Zelnick was asked if the lack of a PC version of GTA 6 was set in stone</a>. Here’s Zelnick’s response in full:</p><blockquote>Well, the lack of an announcement is not something that could be set in stone as near as I could tell, because the only thing that happens after the lack of an announcement is an announcement, I suppose, or a continuing lack of an announcement, I guess that could happen too. It doesn’t seem to me that either would be set in stone.</blockquote><blockquote>But Rockstar has an approach to platforms which we’ve seen before, and they will make more announcements in due time. I do believe that the right strategy for our business is to be where the consumer is, and historically what this company has done is address consumers anywhere they are, on any platform that makes sense, over time.</blockquote><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Vice City Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That was Zelnick dancing around the inevitable PC version of GTA 6, but he did point to Rockstar’s release strategy for its previous games. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/place-your-bets-will-gta-6-release-on-pc-on-the-same-day-it-does-on-consoles/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Fans of Rockstar games</u></a> have noted the studio's historical reluctance to release other past games on PC day-and-date with console, as well as its fraught relationship with the modding community over the years. Still, some had hoped that a game as big as GTA 6 could be a turning point for the studio's PC gaming attitude, only to have those hopes dashed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Big Rockstar titles tend to get to PC eventually, but the question is how long PC gamers will have to wait for the biggest entertainment launch of all time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty more on GTA 6 in the meantime, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/publisher-jokes-concern-and-a-lot-of-memes-the-internet-reacts-to-the-gta-6-delay">how the internet reacted to the GTA 6 delay</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-shouldnt-be-surprised-gta-6-grand-theft-auto-delayed-rockstar-history">why it’s no surprise it was delayed in the first place</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: </em><a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/VI" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Rockstar Games website</em></a><em>.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-is-delayed-again-until-november-2026">GTA 6 is delayed again</a>, this time from May to November 2026. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-shouldnt-be-surprised-gta-6-grand-theft-auto-delayed-rockstar-history">Perhaps we should have seen it coming</a>. After all, aren’t all Rockstar games delayed multiple times before they eventually come out and break sales records?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty of coverage on the delay already, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-is-highly-confident-on-new-gta-6-release-date-but-says-when-games-are-released-too-early-bad-things-happen">comments from Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick</a>, who told IGN in an interview he was “highly confident” in the new release date (I’m sure he’s said that before?). And, if you need a reminder, here's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/89-details-from-the-gta-6-trailer-2">a whopping 89 details from GTA 6 Trailer 2</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But how has the internet reacted to the GTA 6 delay? Fans are, as you’d expect, in tatters. And spare a thought for PC gamers, who now face the prospect of having to wait to play GTA 6 in 2027 at the earliest. But video game publishers — some, publicly at least — are having fun with it, while some are expressing concern for any game that might have earmarked a fall 2026 release window. And then there are the memes. Lots of memes.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s start with Cyberpunk 2077 developer CD Projekt, which took the opportunity to remind everyone that it once promised no more delays to Cyberpunk 2077, and look how that turned out when its sci-fi action RPG came out in December 2020. What CDPR is saying here is trust in Rockstar to deliver — it’s better to delay the game and ensure it’s great than launch it when it isn’t ready.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="qme" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/SqC2ZYRK6s" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/SqC2ZYRK6s</a> <a href="https://t.co/l5o58PULml" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/l5o58PULml</a></p>— Cyberpunk 2077 (@CyberpunkGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1986547061886427406?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 6, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Hotline Miami and Cult of the Lamb publisher Devolver Digital, meanwhile, continued the bit by continuing to promise (threat?) to release a game on the same day GTA 6 comes out. Now it’s moved whatever game it had in mind to GTA 6’s new release date: November 19, 2026. Devolver won’t — can’t at this point — stop. It even cheekily asked Rockstar if it needed help getting GTA 6 out the door, tweeting: "DO YOU NEED A PUBLISHER TO GET THIS THING BACK ON TRACK? DMs are open. Our work on @BALLxPIT speaks for itself." Those scamps!</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Devolver Digital (@devolverdigital) <a href="https://twitter.com/devolverdigital/status/1986545399910289732?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 6, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking more seriously, Christofer Sundberg, founder of Liquid Swords and former boss of Just Cause developer Avalanche, <a href="https://x.com/CHSundberg/status/1986705793048031697" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">called the delay</a> “a gravitational shift.” He continued: “When giants move, the ground shakes. That’s not competition. That’s opportunity.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a comment about how publishers will be left scrambling to adjust their own release dates in the wake of GTA 6 moving from May to November. Some may be able to hit May or thereabouts now GTA 6 has moved out of that window. Others already locked into fall 2026 may now be set for crisis talks. Will next year’s Call of Duty be okay, for example? COD usually launches in November, so we're potentially set for a GTA 6 vs Call of Duty showdown in 2026. I know what my money's on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But the delay may even impact games set to launch in 2027. John “Bucky” Buckley, Communications Director and Publishing Manager at Palworld developer Pocketpair, <a href="https://x.com/Bucky_cm/status/1986583034326622227" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">took to X / Twitter</a> to say "expect to see many games (especially AAA ones) swerve to avoid the 2027 awards season," now GTA 6 is set for a November 19 launch, which puts Rockstar's game outside the nominaton window for most game awards in 2026. "Intentional or…?🤔" Bucky wondered.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Microsoft might be the publisher most heavily impacted by this GTA 6 delay.</p><p>Halo Remake, Gears E-Day, Fable, AND Call of Duty 2026 are all almost certainly scheduled for next Fall.

                <p>The next BioShock game has been in development for the better part of a decade, but 2K Games parent company Take-Two Interactive has confirmed that there are no plans currently to cancel it. In a new interview, CEO Strauss Zelnick addressed the lengthy development cycle, promising that BioShock will eventually be released.</p><p>"It's going to come out. That I can say hand on heart, without question," Zelnick said to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioshock-4-is-going-to-come-out-take-two-ceo-strauss-zelnick-promises-that-i-can-say-hand-on-heart-without-question" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>. The CEO added that with longer development cycles for AAA games, it had become more challenging to build a game that can stand out from the pack as part of its quality-over-quantity mindset. "The strategy of this company has always been to make the best entertainment, not necessarily the most entertainment. Of course, sometimes we've fallen short, but frankly, a precious few times," Zelnick boasted, adding that Take-Two is aiming to release "exceptional" games.</p><p>Zelnick's comments come in the wake of a recent <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-01/next-bioshock-game-changes-leaders-after-development-turmoil" rel="nofollow ">Bloomberg report about BioShock 4 undergoing a partial overhaul</a> to improve on key areas. Meanwhile, Take-Two president Karl Slatoff also addressed the status of BioShock during this week's earnings call and spoke about changes at Cloud Chamber following layoffs at the studio. This led to the departure of studio head Kelley Gilmore, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioshock-4-studio-laying-off-devs-as-diablo-boss-takes-over/1100-6534080/" data-ref-id="1100-6534080">with former Diablo boss Rod Fergusson taking ove</a>r.</p><p>"We've made some changes in the organization," Slatoff said (via <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4839738-take-two-interactive-software-inc-ttwo-q2-2026-earnings-call-transcript" rel="nofollow ">Seeking Alpha</a>). "We're shifting some things around. But right now, we feel that the game is on a great track for us to deliver something that's going to exceed consumers' expectations. So not much more to update other than that and the fact that the next BioShock is going to take the franchise to the next level, which is always our ambition with all of our franchises."</p><p>In other news from Take-Two's earnings call, the company confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-november-2026/1100-6536012/">GTA 6 had been delayed to November 2026</a>, and despite being the third-highest-selling game of the year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-came-in-below-take-twos-sales-expectations/1100-6536020/">Borderlands 4 has fallen short of sales expectations</a>.</p>

                <p>Red Dead Redemption 2 is climbing up the sales charts, surpassing Nintendo's best-selling Mario Kart game ever. As part of Take-Two's latest earnings report, the company disclosed that the 2018 open-world Western sold another 2 million copies in the past three months to climb to 79 million overall.</p><p>In reaching that mark, Red Dead Redemption 2 has surpassed 2014's Mario Kart 8 on the list for all-time game sales. Mario Kart 8 has sold 78.02 million units--this includes 69.56 million units sold for Switch with Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and 8.46 million copies of Mario Kart 8 for Wii U.</p><p>Of note, however, is that the Mario Kart 8 sales figure is inflated in a way that can't be said for Red Dead Redemption 2, as the Mario Kart 8 sales numbers include pack-in sales. Given that Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is the centerpiece of Nintendo's annual Black Friday and holiday bundles, copies of the game sold in bundles are surely numerous.</p><p>Red Dead Redemption 2 is now the No. 5 best-selling game of all time, only beaten by Tetris (520 million), Minecraft (300 million), GTA 5 (220 million), and Wii Sports (82.9 million).</p><p>Given the immense success of Red Dead Redemption 2, many are expecting Rockstar to make a third game in the series. This hasn't been announced, but Rockstar founder Dan Houser--who no longer works there--has said he <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rockstar-co-founder-dan-houser-says-red-dead-redemption-3-will-probably-happen-and-hed-feel-a-bit-sad-about-it-because-it-was-a-cohesive-two-game-arc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">expects Rockstar to make Red Dead Redemption 3 someday.</a></p><p>Sales of Red Dead Redemption 2 could climb higher still if the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/red-dead-redemption-2-still-planned-for-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-switch-2-report/1100-6535240/" data-ref-id="1100-6535240">rumored PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch 2 ports of the game</a> are real. Rockstar has yet to confirm this, but the ports are rumored to launch this year.</p><p>Rockstar's next project is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a>, which was recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-november-2026/1100-6536012/" data-ref-id="1100-6536012">delayed to November 2026.</a></p><p>As for the Mario Kart series, Mario Kart World was a launch title for the Switch 2 and has <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/software/index.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">sold more than 9.57 million copies so far.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/what-we-played-%E2%80%93-arc-raiders-ghost-of-yotei-and-hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment.1346830/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>I’ve been playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>, and it’s proved to me that most people just want to get along. Everyone is helping you out, almost no one is shooting at you who isn’t a robot, and you can party up with other players and just have a lovely time (while you hide and skulk from increasingly difficult robots). Its presentation is also pitch-perfect, and it’s so far been something of a revelation. Unfortunately, this now means I’m no longer playing Overwatch, but I have snuck in some Lumines: Arise, Plants Vs Zombies and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/04/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-review/">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>, which has given me plenty of variation.</p>

<p><strong>Nic B</strong> has just started on Ghost of Yotei. It’s early days mind you, as he tells us, “I’m only an hour in, so it’s still super fresh, but I’m enjoying it so far!” But for <strong>Aran</strong> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/04/football-manager-26-review/">Football Manager 26</a>? The verdict is well and truly in, as he says it “needs lots of improvements,” There was also some Umami for review.</p>
<p><strong>Jason</strong> is somewhat lost with what to play right now. He tells us, “I am wandering lost between games, unable to find anything I really want to sink my teeth in while teetering on the edge of buying Final Fantasy XVI, FF7 Remake 2: The Second Coming Of Shoulder Shimmying, Mordor Mark 2: This Time It’s Even More Morally Grey, and a few roguelikes. Also, I’m playing Arc Raiders, which is fun.”</p>
<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> is another who’s on the Arc Raiders train. He says, “I love the music and setting and it’s genuinely a new experience in that most people aren’t out to kill you, in fact I’ve never been shot by a player. Everyone seems to be working together and helping each other out which is probably not what the devs wanted, but given how the real world is, it’s really quite comforting.”</p>


<p><strong>Steve</strong> finished PowerWash Simulator and started Tormented Souls 2 but he’s been away at a family wedding and so that’s slowed him down from his usual tear, opting instead for the new Garth Merenghi book. Meanwhile, Ade got a bit bored of Ninja Gaiden 4. He says, “It was finally getting to play as Ryu, only to be stuck going through all the same levels and fighting the same bosses that I’d already just beaten whilst playing as generic emo Ninja guy that polished me off. Felt like a very cheap way of padding out the game’s length. Overall, a bit disappointed with Ninja Gaiden 4, especially considering the pedigree of the developers.”</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the team, <strong>Gamoc</strong> has played Sweet Surrender for review, as well as Deep Rock Galactic Survivor and Fights in Tight Spaces.</p>
<p><strong>Laura</strong> has been squealing at baby dinosaurs in Jurassic World Evolution 3 and shrieking at legs jumping out at her from under tables in the Silent Hill 2 Remake. She says, “It’s quite the combination, but when I’m exhausted trying to get 5 stars by getting all of my dinosaurs up to 100% comfort (why are the Ankylosaurus so damn picky?!) I switch over. Then when I’m tired of constantly walking around yet another grimy looking apartment block I switch back!”</p>

<p>Next up, <strong>Jim</strong> is making slow but steady progress with Ghost of Yotei. He tells us, “Instead of blitzing the main story missions, I’m finding too many distractions! The fact that they don’t feel obtrusive or repetitive is always the true sign of a good open world game. I’ll definitely be going for the platinum trophy.” He continues, “I also played more Battlefield 6 which is easily the most fun I’ve had with the series since Bad Company 2. Initially I started as a Support main though I’ve since warmed towards the Engineer, having racked up quite the kill count with my cheeky anti-tank mines.”</p>
<p>And finally, <strong>Tef’s</strong> had a few matches in Battlefield 6, though it’s much more casual time filler than it was around launch for him. He’s also had another hands on session with Kirby Air Riders, ahead of this weekend’s online tests, and you’ll see his thoughts on this rather soon!</p>

			<p>Chinese developer miHoYo, the studio behind the popular <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/genshin-impact-gacha-highjacked/">Genshin Impact</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/zenless-zone-zero-the-perfect-gacha-game-for-those-who-dont-like-gachas/">Zenless Zone Zero</a>, is working on a new game that will be much different from anything it has released so far.</p>



<p><span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">As spotted on the&nbsp;<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/mihoyo-is-working-on-new-open-world-game-mmo-pvp-ue5-ai.1346665/" target="_blank">ResetERA forums</a>, the developer is currently working on a fantasy open-world MMO featuring realistic graphics, PvP, an AI-stimulated ecological system, large-scale boss fights, and advanced AI-powered NPCs.</span> These new features will mark a significant shift in gameplay terms, and a considerable step forward from the games the developer is currently supporting.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>The teaser shared by miHoYo as part of a recruitment effort for their Unreal Engine 5-powered new game</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Besides sharing the first information on the yet to be named game, miHoYo released a video providing a very early look at the visual style the studio is aiming for has also been released, and it looks more technically advanced than anything it has done to date. Hopefully, the developer will also be able to address the known performance issues that plague games powered by the engine to deliver an experience that can be on par with its previous games.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The upcoming project from miHoYo, alongside other open-world games such as Where Winds Meet, which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/where-winds-meet-ps5-pc-release-date/">launching globally on November 14</a>, seems to signal a radical change for free-to-play open world games, which are doing away with colorful and stylized visuals to offer experiences that are edging ever closer to the PC and console premium AAA experiences. As such, it will be fascinating to see how players will react to these experiences, and if the realistic visuals and advanced AI-powered features will make these games as big a hit as Genshin Impact.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/first-ea-fc-open-world-gameplay-has-leaked.1346821/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you didn’t know, EA announced a while back that it was working on an open-world addition to the EA FC franchise. Recently, a new FC playtest has been underway, and it’s been revealed that it’s indeed for the open-world content. Gameplay footage has leaked and been shared already.</p>



<p>All publicity is good publicity. Yes, the EA FC open-world game mode playtest is supposed to be private, but the community is desperate to see what it looks like, what you can do, and how it plays. Internal documents have already revealed the expected <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-fcs-new-open-world-mode-release-window/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA FC open-world mode release window</a>, and there’s gameplay to keep you ticking over.</p>



<h2 id="h-ea-fc-open-world-gameplay-leaks-early">EA FC Open World Gameplay Leaks Early</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Even Cole agrees the footage is cold. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>There were rumors that an EA FC open-world mode would be akin to NBA 2K’s open-world hub. It would include fun mini-games and ways to interact with other players.</p>



<p>This seems to be the case. You can check out leaked videos and gameplay, especially through <a href="https://footballgamingzone.com/ea-sports-fc/ea-fc-open-world-map-has-already-leaked-during-playtests/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FGZ, as they first reported that gameplay had leaked</a>. You can also find snippets across all forms of social media.</p>



<p>Check out the initial media here, but be warned, there’s every chance EA will have the content removed.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Players can dip in and out of several mini-games, watch from the sidelines if needed, walk around, and talk to other users, and the initial maps look quite sizable. Rumor has it that there <a href="https://footballgamingzone.com/ea-sports-fc/exclusive-ea-fcs-open-world-will-have-several-maps-to-explore-based-on-major-countries/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will be several maps to explore based on major countries</a>.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Again, a quick search on X, TikTok, and YouTube is bound to give you the footage you’re looking for. It’s certainly out there. EA is presumably doing its best to clamp down on leaked clips and have the gameplay footage removed. You might need to be quicker than Mbappe to see certain videos!</p>



<p>Does an open-world EA FC gameplay mode interest you? Should EA be concentrating its efforts on other areas of EA FC, such as Career Mode or Clubs? The place to dissect all of this and more is the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>, which continues to grow each day.</p>

<p>The zombie horde returns to face off against players in Black Ops 7, and, as has become customary in the mode, there are a wealth of Perk-A-Colas available that assist in the battle to fend off the undead army.</p>



<p>Black Ops 7 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launches worldwide on November 14</a>, bringing a new campaign, complete with four-player co-op, multiplayer action, and Zombies, the latter of which will be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-7-zombies-maps-survival-dead-ops/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expanded further with the addition of new maps</a> throughout the game’s lifespan.</p>



<p>Perk-A-Colas have long been a core part of the mechanics of Zombies in the Call of Duty franchise, and we’ve got all the details on what will be available to save up for in Black Ops 7.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-black-ops-7-perk-a-colas">All Black Ops 7 Perk-A-Colas</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Collect them all. Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Black Ops 7 Zombies launches</strong> <strong>with 12 Perk-A-Colas available, 11 of which are returning to the franchise, with the other being brand new.</strong></p>



<p>Wisp Tea is the only new Perk-A-Cola added to Black Ops 7 Zombies at launch, with a unique benefit that summons a companion wisp after killing zombies. All other Perk-a-Colas in the game have featured in the franchise in the past, with the majority having been available in Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>Zombies will be regularly updated throughout the game’s lifespan, however, so new and returning Perk-A-Colas could come later down the line with seasonal updates.</p>



<p>The table below shows all of the available Perk-A-Colas at launch in Black Ops 7 Zombies, along with a description of the bonus they provide.</p>
