			<p>Set during the Age of Exploration, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/new-world-aeternum">New World: Aeternum</a> asks what would happen if – instead of the Americas – we stumbled upon a volatile fantasy realm where legends come to life. And where they never perish…</p>
<p><iframe title="New World: Aeternum - Gameplay Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qK8jtTMHCRU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As an adventurer who takes to the high seas, you soon find yourself shipwrecked on its stormy shores, your destiny forever changed. While Aeternum boasts a stunning natural beauty and a bounty of precious resources streaked, there’s a growing corruption sweeping the land, drawing dark and unseen forces into a wider conflict as humans look to make their mark upon this untamed land.</p>


<p>New World: Aeternum is very much an action-oriented MMORPG. The game sports an active combat system similar to souslike RPGs thanks to an intuitive lock-on camera while rewarding well-time blocks and dodges – elements that will feel somewhat alien to fans of traditional MMOs.</p>


<p>These same fans may also baulk at New World’s streamlined character builds. Instead of choosing a class and gradually filling the screen with hotbars and icons, players can only slot a total of six abilities (split between their two equipped weapons) with branching skill trees add a satisfying amount of depth. Weapon pairings will ultimately dictate your role in combat, though New World does give the option to freely switch and experiment, allowing you to completely respec without too much admin involved.</p>
<p>The straightforward controls and condensed ability loadouts complement New World’s fresh console ports particularly well. Navigating chat windows and some of the more advanced menus can get a bit finicky on a gamepad yet it feels like the game was always designed with console players in mind, rather than being an afterthought.</p>
<p>Unlocking its doors to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S isn’t the only thing that’s new for New World: Aeternum. Since the game originally launched on PC there have been a glut of content drops, new features, and quality of life improvements. One of the most notable upgrades is a renewed focus on storytelling and worldbuilding through improved character interactions and cutscenes. It’s clear that <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/amazon-game-studios">Amazon Game Studios</a> has poured a lot of love into the lore and presentation of its flagship MMO with fully-voiced NPCs and a living in-game codex that grows as you learn more about the realm of Aeternum and its denizens.</p>

<p>Archetypes are another new addition to New World: Aeternum that will help you slip into one of its many flexible playstyles. After all, while the solo levelling experience is relatively agnostic of the weapons you choose, group PvE activities such as Expeditions and Raids – as well as PvP – require players to choose a role whether that’s a thank, DPS, or healer.</p>
<p>However, it will be a while before you can fully immerse yourself in team play with much of this content unlocking when you hit the game’s original level cap of 60. Thankfully, it doesn’t take too long to reach this milestone. For my Mystic (New World’s de facto healer/support archetype) it took around 30 hours of mostly main story quests and Expeditions with limited uptake of side missions.</p>
<p>Aside from straight up duels, there are plenty of PvP options in New World including a recently introduced 3 versus 3 Arena and the more objective-based 40-player Outpost Rush. Then there’s the ongoing Faction War that permeates in the game’s persistent world. Soon after washing up on the shores of Aeternum, you can choose to ally with the Covenant, Syndicate, or Marauders, who are locked in a never ending conflict. Through careful planning and brute opportunism Companies (player-run guilds) can occupy the many settlements found spread across the map, first working collectively to gain influence and then throwing down in massive siege battles.</p>

<p>Away from combat and questing, New World offers a comprehensive crafting system that is split between gathering supplies and then processing these into materials, gear, or sellable goods. Choosing a certain archetype will give you a small boost in certain crafting skills though you’re truly free to pursue any at your own leisure, from refining ore and engineering muskets to fishing and building furniture for your home. Oh yes, there’s player housing.</p>
<p>Beyond its walled cities, townships, and makeshift settlements, Aeternum offers a diverse patchwork of biomes each teeming with life. Covered in forests and fauna, there’s an element of untouched natural beauty streaked with the occasional gash of red and a dense dark miasma to signal the presence of corruption. Each region has its own aesthetic and local tales, rewarding inquisitive players with little nuggets of lore and painting a more detailed picture of Aeternum’s mysterious past. These areas are well populated too, New World touting a bestiary of wild animals to hunt as well as a grimoire of exotic creatures from zombie pirates and mystic dryads to cosmic horrors from another dimension.</p>

			<p>One of next year's most anticipated games is undoubtedly <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-q4-2025-gears-of-war-e-day-before-that-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fable</a>. The fantasy RPG franchise originally created by Lionhead is returning fifteen years after its previous mainline installment, and fans are understandably excited.</p>
<p>Since IP owner Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-legends-officially-cancelled-lionhead-studios-closing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">canceled</a> Fable Legends and subsequently shut down Lionhead in 2016, they had to pick a new studio to reboot the series from the ground up. As we've known for a few years, that studio is Playground Games. The British team has crafted some stellar games in the Forza Horizon IP, but that's a racing game; could they deliver the same level of quality with an RPG?</p>
<p>That's certainly the biggest question mark at this point. According to Windows Central's Jez Corden, though, there's not much to fear. Speaking in the latest episode of the Xbox Two <a href="https://youtu.be/VmNZUoJnqdg?t=5844" target="_blank" rel="noopener">podcast</a>, he claimed to have seen some footage of Fable that looked fantastic, featuring combat modeled after The Witcher series, probably due to Playground having hired some former CDPR employees.</p>
<p><em>I very recently saw some Alpha gameplay footage from Fable. I have no idea when it was from, I don't know if it was earlier in development or if it was recent, but it looked fantastic. You can tell that this game has CD Project Red DNA. Playground Games picked up a bunch of developers, I believe they picked up the combat designer and you can kind of tell. I'm not saying it's 100% one-to-one with The Witcher because it's not, but you can kind of tell with that melee combat, the pirouettes, the dodging, the seamless hack and slash into an execution, which looks really cool. All that stuff is there; it looks super polished, super good. If this was early gameplay, then it probably looks even better now.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Beyond that,&nbsp;there was a lot of mixing in of different weapon types. There was pulling out a bow and arrow and also dropping spells I saw a spell that lifted a group of dudes off the ground and slammed them down. I also saw some enemies, like a giant chicken, for example. It actually just looked like a chicken with that sort of comedic angle but also not. Like, it looked like a dangerous scary chicken. Also, I saw werewolves. There was a scene where they lured a werewolf out of its lair with bacon and eggs and sausages.</em></p>
<p><em>It looked really great. The combat looked really tight. I saw a variety of weapons. I saw a big mallet thing which was being used to swing around and hit multiple enemies at once. My hype level went up a lot from seeing that stuff, so that's why I'm so bullish on Fable now.</em></p>
<p>To be fair, The Witcher 3's combat was one of its few criticized gameplay elements. Then again, the developers of this new Fable might have simply been inspired by the foundation while polishing it even further. We'll have to wait until we see proper gameplay to tell. With The Game Awards coming up, maybe Microsoft will show a new trailer.</p>
<p>Corden also reported to have heard back at Summer Game Fest that Fable would allow character selection, probably between a male and a female option, which will be good news for those who didn't fancy the character seen in the trailers so far.</p>
<p>Fable is currently slated to launch next year, probably toward the end of 2025, for PC and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

            <link>https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-in-talks-to-buy-elden-ring-dark-souls-developer-fromsoftware</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-in-talks-to-buy-elden-ring-dark-souls-developer-fromsoftware.1039194/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-in-talks-to-buy-elden-ring-dark-souls-developer-fromsoftware<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

        <p>Kadokawa buyout would also include Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership studio.</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>
PlayStation maker Sony is currently in talks that would likely see it acquire a controlling stake in FromSoftware, the developer behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>, Dark Souls and Bloodbourne, as part of a buyout of its owner, the Japanese publishing giant Kadokawa.
</p>
<p>
That's according to a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/sony-talks-buy-media-powerhouse-behind-elden-ring-sources-say-2024-11-19/">Reuters</a> report which claims a deal could be signed in weeks, via sources with knowledge of discussions between the two companies. Both Sony and Kadokawa declined to comment on that report.
</p>
<p>
Launched in 2022, Elden Ring has now sold more than 25m copies worldwide.
</p>
<p>
Sony already owns a 14 percent stake in FromSoftware, and already has ownership of both the Bloodborne and Demon Souls franchises. FromSoftware, meanwhile, owns the rights to Elden Ring and Sekiro.</p>
<p>This deal would likely result in PlayStation gaining the 69.6 percent stake in FromSoftware that Kadokawa holds, meaning it would hold a commanding 84 percent of the company. (Chinese giant <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> currently owns the remaining 16 percent.)
</p>
<p>
Kadokawa owns various other studios, too. These include <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/octopath-traveler">Octopath Traveler</a> and Tenchu developer Acquire, which recently developed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-and-luigi-brothership">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</a> for Nintendo Switch, Shiren the Wanderer studio Spike Chunsoft and RPG Maker developer Gotcha Gotcha Games.
</p>
<p>
Outside of video games, Kadokawa is also a huge name in anime and manga, and would be a significant addition to Sony's existing portfolio that includes Crunchyroll and Funimation. 
</p>
<p>
PlayStation's other recent purchases include UK studio Firesprite, plus Housemarque and Nixxes, all in 2021. Most recently, Sony bought the Jade Raymond-founded startup Haven Studios in 2022, currently working on Fairgame$.

            <p>Good morning, how about a nice big bowl of your favourite breakfast cereal: Corporate Consolidation? Sony are in talks to buy Kadokawa, the parent company of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a> developer From Software. Sony is eyeing up the company as a hefty snack because they want the various manga and anime owned by Kadokawa, according to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/sony-talks-buy-media-powerhouse-behind-elden-ring-sources-say-2024-11-19/">a report by Reuters</a>. But also because they want all the tasty games owned by them too, such as the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/danganronpa">Danganronpa</a> series, the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/octopath-traveler">Octopath Traveler</a> games, and the biggest corn flake of them all, the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> series.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Talks between the companies are continuing, Reuters was told, and a deal might be finalised "in the coming weeks". The game studios owned by Kadokawa include not just From Software but also Spike Chunsoft (the Danganronpa people), Gotcha Gotcha Games (who do the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rpg-maker">RPG Maker</a> engines), Acquire (the Octopath Traveler and Tenchu owners) and Vic Game Studios (makers of the Black Clover mobile games). Owning the Dark Souls developer would also give Sony the publishing rights to the third-person mech marauding of Armored Core and swordy soulslike Sekiro. </p>
<p>These all make sense for a gaming company to own, but it is also a further <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-worrying-about-timed-exclusives-and-worry-more-about-games-industry-consolidation">slurping of studios down the megacorp gullet</a>. Sony being the owners of Fromsoft also puts them in a position to pull a Bloodborne and make the next Souls game a PlayStation exclusive. But true console exclusives are a rarity these days - publishers prefer to make exclusives time-limited and eventually release on as many machines as possible. And we on PC have been getting almost everything from Sony in recent years, if after a little wait. It's likely the follow-up to Elden Ring <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-is-the-limit-for-from-software-project-scale-says-miyazaki-multiple-smaller-games-may-be-the-next-stage">won't be quite as big in size</a>, but it probably will still sell like masochistic hot cakes.</p>
<p>As for Kadokawa, they were hit by a ransomware cyberattack this summer, from which they seem to have recovered, and have more recently confirmed that they have a combined <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/fromsoftware-and-spike-chunsoft-parent-company-kadokawa-has-26-new-games-in-development/">26 game projects in development</a> across all the studios they own. Those games will now likely be Sony's. Maybe one of them will make back <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-write-off-ill-fated-200-million-shooter-concord-as-a-loss-by-closing-studio-permanently">the $200 million Sony lost on Concord</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/sony-rumored-to-be-in-talks-to-buy-fromsoftware-owner-kadokawa-corporation/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>This morning, some earth-shattering rumors are coming from the Land of the Rising Sun. Reuters&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/sony-talks-buy-media-powerhouse-behind-elden-ring-sources-say-2024-11-19/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports&nbsp;</a>that Sony is in talks to buy FromSoftware owner Kadokawa Corporation. Two sources said a deal could be closed in the coming weeks. The mere rumor was enough to send Kadokawa's stock up nearly 23% today.</p>
<p>Like most big Japanese corporations, Kadokawa is really old. It was actually founded only a few months after the end of the Second World War. Needless to say, a lot has changed since then. The most recent version of the corporation was borne out of the October 2014 merger with Dwango.</p>
<p>The group as a whole has several branches for publishing books, manga, films, anime, and much more. Of course, for Sony's PlayStation, the fact that Kadokawa owns nearly 70% of FromSoftware, the studio behind Demon's Souls, Bloodborne, Dark Souls, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, and Elden Ring, is clearly a big deal. Moreover, if you've been reading Wccftech, this might not surprise you that much.</p>
<p>Sony already <a href="https://wccftech.com/from-software-owner-kadokawa-corporation-alliance-sony/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">entered</a> a capital alliance with Kadokawa in February 2021. In August 2022, they even <a href="https://wccftech.com/fromsoftware-gets-new-investments-by-sony-and-tencent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">invested</a> directly in FromSoftware, acquiring around 14% of the shares (Tencent also purchased 16% of the shares at the same time). Shortly following the latter announcement, Hermen Hulst (then head of PlayStation Studios, now CEO of SIE's Studio Business Group) <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-studios-head-teases-new-pc-gaas-investments-possible-transmedia-collaboration-with-fromsoftware/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hinted</a> at possible collaborations with FromSoftware not only on games but also on adaptations through the PlayStation Productions division.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to this July, and renowned author G.R.R. Martin, who famously contributed to the worldbuilding and lore behind Elden Ring, <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-movie-or-tv-series-seemingly-being-teased-by-george-r-r-martin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teased</a> in a not-so-subtle fashion that a feature film or a TV series adaptation might be on the way. Again, it wouldn't be out of character for Sony, which is pushing a lot of its big franchises (Uncharted, The Last of Us, Gran Turismo, God of War, Ghost of Tsushima, while the Horizon Netflix TV series was halted due to the showrunner's issues) to be adapted for cinema or television.</p>
<p>Fans of FromSoftware's games are really only interested in knowing how this potential acquisition might affect them, though. Would Sony remove the studio's upcoming games from Xbox and possibly stagger their PC releases? It seems unlikely. Much of the studio's success was built on the multiplatform availability of most of its games, and besides, Sony has already shown with Bungie that they're willing to let a newly purchased studio keep making games for other platforms, too.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree was <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-gets-nominated-in-the-game-of-the-year-section-at-tga-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nominated</a> for the GOTY category at The Game Awards 2024 and has a solid chance of winning again.</p>

<p>The Call of Duty League has published the full spread of competitive settings ahead of the 2025 season. On social media, the unveiling caused some issues with fans worldwide, especially concerning the mapset that has been lined up for the CDL 2025 season. It’s not amazing, and many fans are clinging to the hope that a resurgence of old maps will make their way into the pool.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-cdl-2025-season-settings-unveiled">CDL 2025 Season Settings Unveiled</h2>



<p>The map list for the 2025 season of the Call of Duty League isn’t amazing, and many are wondering why Control is still a thing.</p>



<p>Here’s the spread:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Hardpoint: </strong>Protocol, Red Card, Rewind, Skyline, Vault</li>



<li><strong>Search and Destroy: </strong>Protocol, Red Card, Rewind, Skyline, Vault</li>



<li><strong>Control: </strong>Protocol, Vault</li>
</ul>



<p>Having just two maps for Control is a bit of a nightmare, and it’s yet another year that fans are clamouring and asking for a different mode to fill the competitive slot. For the longest time, people have asked for something like CTF or Blitz to make a return to the Call of Duty esports scene, to no avail.</p>



<p>The settings put forward by the Call of Duty League <a href="https://callofdutyleague.com/en-us/competitive-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">in a recent guide</a> are mostly typical and nothing has changed from last season, but it’s in the restricted items that things start getting interesting. During the pre-season window, we’ve seen plenty of GAs get lobbied around, but the official rules from Activision are something else.</p>



<p>As usual, the need to keep things as balanced as possible is front and centre, and with that in mind, almost every perk and streak is eliminated. Only the RC-XD and Hellstorm missiles remain in the scorestreak selection.</p>

The 1,157-piece playset is the largest Donkey Kong expansion in the Lego Super Mario lineup. This Lego set originally retailed for $110, so you're saving almost 50% right now.</p><p>It also might be your last opportunity to buy it from a major retailer. The set is currently marked as "retiring soon" on the Lego Store, so once major retailers are out of stock, Diddy Kong's Mine Cart ride is gone for good. Amazon was matching this deal but already sold out, so Donkey Kong fans should grab this deal fast.</p><p><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FLEGO-6425894-Super-Mario-Dry-Bowser-Castle-Battle-Expansion-Set-1321-pcs%2F1102790062%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fthis-110-donkey-kong-lego-set-is-only-58-at-walmart%2F1100-6524893%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Walmart</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BSRD1SK5?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon</a> also have the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BSRD1SK5?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dry Bowser Battle Lego Set for $80, down from $110</a>.

You're saving over $50 off this card's launch price, but you're essentially paying the same price for 1TB as you would for 1.5TB. This card has a read speed of up to 100MB/s, so it's not as fast as the Ultra either.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-game-awards-nomination-sparks-renewed-debate-among-fans<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The full list of Game Awards 2024 nominees has dropped, and one release in particular has been sparking plenty of discussion on social media and elsewhere.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2024-complete-list-of-nominees-goty">Since the nominees were revealed Monday morning</a>, fans have been discussing whether Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree deserves to be on a list that also includes <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metaphor-refantazio-review">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-review-pc">Black Myth Wukong</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/balatro-review">Balatro</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>. They mainly point to it being an expansion pack that can only be accessed by completing the main game, making it less of a standalone experience than comparable ones like The Witcher 3: Blood and Wine.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"As amazing as Shadow of the Erdtree was, it getting a GOTY nom just kind of rubs me the wrong way. Yes, it was expansive, but it wasn't the first DLC for a game to be giant. Witcher, Xenoblade, Cyberpunk, etc. Would've rather seen an <em>actual</em> game," one fan wrote on Reddit in what has become a common sentiment online. Others simply memed the decision.</p><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Elden ring dlc in goty nominations <a href="https://t.co/y47ujBGgCe" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/y47ujBGgCe</a></p>— Jonah (@NahImGhost) <a href="https://twitter.com/NahImGhost/status/1858558736249348356?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 18, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The Game Awards has made it clear that Shadow of the Erdtree falls within its official selection criteria. Its website includes a statement issued today reading: "The Game Awards aims to recognize the best creative and technical work each year, irrespective of the format of that content’s release. Expansion packs, new game seasons, DLCs, remakes and remasters are eligible in all categories, if the jury deems the new creative and technical work to be worthy of a nomination. Factors such as the newness of the content and its price/value should be taken into consideration."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Certainly, there's no doubt that Shadow of the Erdtree is one of the biggest releases of 2024. We awarded it a 10 in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-review">our review</a>, writing, "Erdtree’s absolutely jam-packed with secrets, valuable treasures, challenging boss battles, and horrific monstrosities to face off against, as well as cool new weapons, spells, Ashes of War, Spirit Ashes, talismans, and more to play around with and use to find even more novel ways to tackle its memorably brutal battles. Add on some very interesting lore revelations, not to mention the same spectacular visual design and stellar music that accompanies its larger-than-life bosses, and you’ve got what is certainly one of the best DLC expansions I’ve ever played."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's also not light on content, clocking in at a cool 51 hours for a completionist run on IGN's sister site <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/139385" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HowLongtoBeat</a>. It came in second in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/faceoffs/whats-your-game-of-the-year-2024-so-far/results/community">community GOTY Face-Off</a>, surpassed only by fellow nominee Black Myth Wukong.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I'm a bit 'eh' about DLCs being nominated, but SOTE is my favourite release of the year and is a very substantial gaming experience so I'm fine with it (not that I played the others lol)," <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-game-awards-2024-goty-nominees-revealed-astro-bo[%E2%80%A6]-elden-ring-sote-ff-vii-rebirth-metaphor-refantazio.1038660/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one fan wrote</a>. "Obviously it couldn't function as a standalone game in its current state, but on the other hand, everyone's been saying that Fromsoft could have easily released it as a sequel, it took almost 2.5 years to make, and it cost $40. It's not really setting much precedent for a typical 6-12 months, 5-10 hour Fromsoft DLC to be nominated in the future. Like, they will still be lower down the list for being too iterative or not expansive enough."</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">WHAT CHICANERY! FOR YEARS, DLCS HAVE NEVER COUNTED, BUT NOT OUR FROMSOFT! ANYTHING FOR PRECIOUS FROMSOFT! SILENT HILL 2 BLEW EVERYONE'S EXPECTATIONS OUT OF THE WATER AND THE $40 DLC GETS TO BE A NOMINEE?

Plenty of others feel that other well-received releases such as Animal Well have been snubbed to make room for Shadow of the Erdtree.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One way or another, Shadow of the Erdtree figures to take home some hardware when The Game Awards streams on December 12. In addition to Game of the Year, it was also nominated for Best Game Direction, Best Art Direction, and Best RPG. Astro Bot and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth led the with seven nominations apiece.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Stay tuned for lots more GOTY coverage as 2024 comes to a close, and make sure to check out our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-reviewed-games-of-2024">list of the best video games of 2024 so far</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat.

			<p>Video game publisher tinyBuild has teamed up with indie developer Fire &amp; Frost Studios to reveal their upcoming title Of Ash and Steel, an immersive third-person RPG which is inspired by old-school exploration and storytelling. This title is set to release in 2025 on PC via Steam. Of Ash and Steel draws inspiration from classic fantasy RPGs, offering a nostalgic experience that captures the old-school spirit of adventure, combining it with modern graphics and designs with expansive character progression and dynamic combat.</p>
<p>Of Ash and Steel takes you to the Kingdom of the Seven, where you work on honing your combat skills and creating alliances with those you find on your journey to survive in a harsh land. You start off as a lowly adventurer, but have a lot of potential to become a great hero that people won't be forgetting any time soon. Compared to a lot of RPGs, Of Ash and Steel doesn't plan to hold your hand, as there are no quest markers that tell you where to go. Instead, the exploration is entirely up to you, and you have to rely on your instincts and curiosity to take you to where you need to go. Of course, along the way, you will find plenty of secrets, treasures, and side quests, which will provide you with a lot of content.</p>
<p><iframe title="Of Ash and Steel - Official Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JYB0piWxULE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>To celebrate the announcement of the upcoming RPG, a five-minute trailer has been released on the tinyBuild YouTube channel, which showcases the graphics, some of the characters you'll meet along the way, and most importantly, the world in which you'll be thrown.</p>
<p>As you explore the Kingdom of the Seven, you'll get to experience an immersive atmosphere with a dynamic weather system, a suited soundtrack, and lots of rewards for those who choose to explore the vast wilderness ahead of them. If you're looking for the medieval RPG experience, the game is available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2893820/Of_Ash_and_Steel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wishlist now on Steam</a> if you want to keep up with when the game is set to release in 2025.</p>
<p>Of Ash and Steel is the first game to be released by Fire &amp; Frost Studios, an indie studio that describes itself as "a small studio by choice... of enthusiasts with burning hearts and cool heads."</p>
<p>When it comes to teaming up with publishers, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tinybuild-acquires-banner-saga-versus-evil-and-qa-testing-firm-red-cerberus/">tinyBuild is one of the most well-known publishers</a> in the indie world, as they are responsible for releasing games such as Hello Neighbor, Graveyard Keeper, and SpeedRunners, with some of their most recent games being Kingmakers and SAND.</p>

The tweet contained a screenshot of someone sitting on a car and looking at a building at night. And in the sky above is the moon. Seems like a fairly mundane, boring image. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/GTA6/comments/1gh69am/a_waning_gibbous_moon_in_the_most_recent_rockstar/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GTA6/comments/1gh69am/a_waning_gibbous_moon_in_the_most_recent_rockstar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">But one fan on Reddit</a></span> pointed out that the moon seen in the screenshot was in its waning gibbous phase. After some additional research, the community decided that on November 22, something will (<em>probably</em>) happen. </p><p>What exactly are they predicting? Well, that remains to be seen, with some suggesting a new trailer, others a release date announcement, and others a teaser for a future trailer. <br></p><p>This whole moon theory popped up not long after the tweet was published, but has continued to pick up support and momentum online as we get closer and closer to November 22. At first, this was a fringe theory, but now it’s all <em>GTA</em> fans can talk about at the moment. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/that1detectiv3/status/1858561899597619561&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/that1detectiv3/status/1858561899597619561" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I even saw one popular account suggest</a></span> that, because the first trailer contained a Tom Petty song off the album “Full Moon Fever,” this moon theory was more plausible. </p><p>Here’s the wild part: This isn’t the first time the Rockstar community has tried to predict the future using the phases of the moon as seen in a tweet. Last year, fans did the same thing, and guess what...<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/GTA6/comments/1ghdw6o/before_yall_say_im_loosing_it_last_year_there_was/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GTA6/comments/1ghdw6o/before_yall_say_im_loosing_it_last_year_there_was/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> they ended up being right in the end</a></span>! Two months before the first <em>GTA 6</em> trailer was announced, Rockstar shared an image with the moon in it, with the phase pictured arriving on December 1. And weeks later, on December 1, Rockstar teased the December 5 release date for the first <em>GTA 6 </em>trailer. Hmmmm. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-vi-release-date-ps5-pc-1851482968&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-vi-release-date-ps5-pc-1851482968"><em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> arrives in Fall 2025</a></span> for PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. And, if all this is to be believed, we might be only a few days away from a new trailer for the highly anticipated open-world game. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That’s because the event changed its rules this year to allow DLC to be considered alongside full, standalone games. It seemed obvious that the loophole was added to give FromSoftware’s latest release a shot at recognition, and not undeservedly so. <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> has received almost universal acclaim. At its most reductive, it’s just more <em>Elden Ring</em>, but that still puts it head-and-shoulders above much of the competition.</p><p>At the same time, there are a bunch of other games that could have taken that nomination slot and added something newer and more interesting to the mix. Plus, it’ll be a bit weird if <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> wins and a bunch of people run out to play 2024’s GOTY, only to realize they need to play dozens of hours of a different game and also beat two of its toughest bosses. Maybe a better solution is just to give expansions their own category, especially as they become more and more frequent. <em>Factorio</em>’s <em>Space Age</em> DLC, for instance, just came out and reinvents a game that was already one of the best resource management sims around. —Ethan Gach </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="55c66314777f98a02f3007ceef94f978" data-recommend-id="image://55c66314777f98a02f3007ceef94f978" data-format="jpg" data-width="1022" data-height="575" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Helldivers stand triumphant on a hill.

Arrowhead Game Studios’ coop alien shooter was more than just a great game, it was an entire phenomenon, taking over Tiktok and even convincing normie friends of mine who haven’t played games in ages to hop in. While it’s on the lower end of the Metacritic spectrum for a GOTY winner (at 82), it’s one of the fresher and more innovative games of the decade so far.</p><p>The Game Awards jury didn’t agree, however.

It’s a multiplayer game with no story-driven campaign, open world, or RPG systems to speak of. It didn’t have the blockbuster production chops to make up for it either, unlike 2016’s <em>Titanfall 2</em> which snuck into the category even before it was expanded to six entrants. Perhaps to make up for <em>Helldivers 2</em>’s snub, it’s in the running for best ongoing game despite not even being a year old yet. —Ethan Gach</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b1567bfb41aae79fd688796649a1ec93" data-recommend-id="image://b1567bfb41aae79fd688796649a1ec93" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cards on a board deal combo points.

Some great reviews here, positive chatter on social media there. Eventually, it had people everywhere hooked. Then it came to mobile and everyone kept playing its compulsive mix of roguelike deckbuilding and high-score arcade chase. The mix of playing card combos and<em> Diablo</em>-style buildcrafting is nominated across five different categories, including best game, best indie game, and best mobile game.</p><p>Its total number of nominations is equal to that of <em>Silent Hill 2</em> and one ahead of<em> Black Myth: Wukong</em>, and behind only <em>Astro Bot</em> and <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>, which each have seven. It still seems like a long-shot for the best game win—my guess is that it and <em>Animal Well </em>split the best indie and best debut indie categories—but it’s an impressive showing for a game that wasn’t even on anyone’s radar until it blew up this year. — Ethan Gach</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="70897997f420d5fcdc92f3f980266a42" data-recommend-id="image://70897997f420d5fcdc92f3f980266a42" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="675" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Dragon Age heroes confront a monster.

We here at <em>Kotaku </em>really like it. I’m currently in the middle of a 40+ hour playthrough and I’m loving it. Sure, it’s not perfect and some might miss the darker tone of the older <em>Dragon Age</em> games, but what’s here is a very good RPG that expertly balances combat, exploration, and narrative.</p><p>And yet, <em>Veilguard </em>only got one nomination at this year’s Game Awards. The new RPG from Bioware was nominated for “Innovation In Accessibility,” a very important category, and the devs should be proud. Still, it’s a bit wild that <em>Veilguard </em>failed to receive any other nominations at this year’s Game Awards. Perhaps the game was too new and too big, and so too few jurors had gotten a chance to finish it and vote for it. Or maybe it had some support, but it was too divisive to get enough votes in any one category. It’s a shame that one of the best BioWare RPGs in years won’t have a chance to win in the RPG category, yet a DLC for <em>Elden Ring</em> is in there.

It has a higher Metacritic rating than every other game in the category, including <em>WWE 2K24 </em>and <em>F1 24</em>, even if it has far fewer overall reviews than those games. In the end, there’s probably just much less overall interest in a simulation of an American college sport among the Game Awards’ global jury pool. — Ethan Gach</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As someone still actively playing Gray Zone Warfare as a sherpa for new players, I am excited and eager to try out the upcoming update. I’m certainly not alone. Most players can’t wait to return, but they want quality-of-life tweaks and AI improvements before returning. I can’t blame anyone, especially when helicopter wait times prove formidable. But this new Gray Zone Warfare update should change everything!</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-the-next-gray-zone-warfare-update-release">When Does the Next Gray Zone Warfare Update Release?</h2>



<p>Gray Zone Warfare’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gray-zone-warfare-night-ops-update-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next major update</a>—0.2 Night Ops—is out on <strong>November 27</strong>. We’re many months out since release, with the game launching in Early Access on April 30. Most players finished the entire storyline and all available quests within the first month of the game’s lifespan and have since eagerly awaited more or moved on to a different tactical shooter. A few of us continue playing, repeatedly running the same tasks and points of interest.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>This is a major game update, and alongside countless fixes for the AI and additional content, like weapons, tasks, and night operations gear, there’s a wipe. Essentially, this means you’ll lose all your current progress and equipment, resetting to zero alongside everyone else.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-does-the-next-gray-zone-warfare-update-include">What Does the Next Gray Zone Warfare Update Include?</h2>



<p>The next major update for Gray Zone Warfare, dubbed Night Ops, focuses primarily on resolving many of the community’s notable issues with the gameplay experience, namely helicopter wait times and AI one-shotting everything in sight. However, it’s not without significant content additions. The update expands the core gameplay with a day and night cycle, night vision optics, IR laser sights, canted sights, new weapons, and tasks. Here’s an overview of what’s to come:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Day/Night Cycle</strong>: A 2:1 ratio with three hours of real-time gameplay making up a single day in Lamang.</li>



<li><strong>Exterior and Interior Lighting</strong>: In addition to NVGs, you can activate lamps, light barrels, and candles and illuminate or snuff out the light in your environment to gain an advantage.</li>



<li><strong>New Missions</strong>: This update features 22 tasks across the various vendors, with some designed specifically for nighttime.</li>



<li><strong>AI Improvements</strong>: AI will no longer one-shot players; they now adapt to their surroundings, taking cover and hiding in the tall grass, and will pose unique challenges by patrolling or remaining indoors at night.</li>



<li><strong>New Equipment</strong>: Night vision goggles, flashlights, laser sights, and new weapon customization attachments enter the fray.</li>



<li><strong>New Weapons</strong>: MP5, AKS-74U, and various modern AK variants.</li>
</ul>



<p>Furthermore, we’ll see high-value loot, in-game economy alterations, reduced landing zone times, an aim-down-sight toggle option, enhanced progression systems, and more!</p>

<p>Do you need a bit more GZW in your life? Me too! Thankfully, according to the game’s roadmap, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gray-zone-warfare-roadmap-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">three years of content updates</a> are coming!</p>

Ahead of its release on January 16, PS5 players will get access to a preview slice for free on November 22, right on time for the weekend.</p><p>The demo, which was previously playable at this year's Tokyo Game Show, has you wielding an array of weapons as the "nameless hero" to survive in the Battle of Sishui Gate. Unlike the playable teaser in the event, there's no time limit for the console demo, and you'll be able to choose the difficulty level.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_iFXThRtls" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/N_iFXThRtls" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Choosing from four weapon types--sword, guandao, pudao, and wheels--you can mix and match a number of arts, gems, and accessories with them to try different combinations in the demo. Then, you can opt for a strategic approach by acting as a commander for a number of allies, or by jumping into the fray solo against enemy armies.</p><p>If you've recently grabbed a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-review-powerful-on-paper-ordinary-in-action/1100-6527571/" data-ref-id="1100-6527571">PS5 Pro</a>, good news, as the demo will be enhanced for the console. In case you're interested in buying the game early, preorders will also go live on November 22, including a collaboration costume inspired by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-review-souls-like-of-the-three-kingdoms/1900-6418040/" data-ref-id="1900-6418040">Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty</a>.</p>

But what makes Sonic Sway so beneficial is that it doesn’t cost any resources and will instead deplete your opponent’s Ki. Additionally, it can also be used by every character besides giants like Anilaza and Great Ape Vegeta. This guide will cover how to use Sonic Sway as well as the best way to practice it.</p><h2 id="h70598"><a id="perform"></a>How to Perform Sonic Sway</h2><figure id="" data-id="ad01672c14d14eb865e3931b03f02334" data-recommend-id="image://ad01672c14d14eb865e3931b03f02334" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Trunks turns into a blur as he dodges Super Buu’s attacks." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Trunks turns into a blur as he dodges Super Buu’s attacks." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ad01672c14d14eb865e3931b03f02334" data-recommend-id="image://ad01672c14d14eb865e3931b03f02334" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Trunks turns into a blur as he dodges Super Buu’s attacks." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>A Sonic Sway is executed when you press the Perception button right as an enemy’s melee rush attack lands.</strong> Those on the Standard Control scheme will need to press B/Circle for Xbox and PlayStation. Meanwhile, Classic Controls use B+Y/Circle+Triangle for your system of choice.</p><p>Successfully performing Sonic Sway will cause a short animation of your character swiftly dodging a flurry of punches and kicks from the opponent as their Ki is depleted by one bar. The animation then ends with a powerful counter hit that sends the opponent a short distance away. Unless they’re in a corner, they will likely be launched too far away to start your own rush chain. However, you can follow up with vanishing attacks and then combo into smashes or even a rush super.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-rush-super-landing-guide-1851673589&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-rush-super-landing-guide-1851673589"><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em>’s Rush Supers Can Be A Super-Rush Once Mastered</a></span></p><p>Aside from Sonic Sway only being able to counter rush chains, the biggest thing to stress here is the precise timing required. <strong>Sonic Sway will only come out if you press the button(s) right as an attack hits, while Super Perception comes out right before the attack hits</strong>. It’s very easy to keep performing the latter when trying to nail the timing for the former. Although both can be helpful, Super Perception does cost one skill count each time you use it.</p><p>Another important similarity to Super Perception is that <strong>you’ll want to use Sonic Sway while blocking</strong>. It is possible to immediately counter the first hit from a rush chain, but that will require some crazy reaction time and a lot of knowledge of the character you’re fighting. The general instability of the online mode will only make that more difficult too. That’s why I recommend blocking an opponent’s rush chain so you can better see the rhythm of their attacks and try to counter them.</p><h2 id="h70599"><a id="practice"></a>The Best Way to Practice Sonic Sway</h2><figure id="" data-id="27276ba7bde56cd5993bf01358f3e8ed" data-recommend-id="image://27276ba7bde56cd5993bf01358f3e8ed" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Opponent Settings and Strategy submenu in the training mode." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Opponent Settings and Strategy submenu in the training mode." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="27276ba7bde56cd5993bf01358f3e8ed" data-recommend-id="image://27276ba7bde56cd5993bf01358f3e8ed" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Opponent Settings and Strategy submenu in the training mode." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Pulling off a successful Sonic Sway is complicated further by the large roster size and differences in attack speed. I’m not saying you need to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-unlock-every-character-shop-1851670640&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-unlock-every-character-shop-1851670640">unlock every character</a></span> and practice against them, but you’ll benefit from some training if you’re looking to master this technique. The goal is to set up a CPU that only uses rush melee attacks to help you perfect the timing. Here are the steps to make the perfect Sonic Sway practice buddy in Training Mode.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Pick a Character you want to practice against.</li><li>After you’re loaded in, pause and head into Training Settings.</li><li>Under Gauge Settings, turn your health to Maximum. You’re going to be taking a lot of punches and kicks to the face, so it’s best to have health to spare.</li><li>Scroll down a bit under Gauge Settings and set the opponent’s Ki to Minimum. The CPU likes to switch things up a bit now and then. This will prevent them from throwing out Ki blasts or charging for Ki.</li><li>Under Opponent Settings, set the strategy to either Rush Attacks or Rush Chains.</li></ul><p>This approach will ensure the CPU only uses Rush Chains against you. Sometimes the training dummy will get a little stuck, so you might need to throw out a Ki blast or a couple of punches to get it back in the rhythm. Just remember to go back to blocking as soon as you can. Once you feel comfortable landing it, try switching to a different character to practice against.</p><hr><p>Sonic Sway might be the hardest defense mechanic to use in <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em>, but the potential rewards are more than worth the trouble. Turning the tide on your opponent’s offense and wasting a whole bar of their Ki is amazing, especially when it doesn’t cost you any resources such as Ki or a Skill Count. Your character turning into a motion blur as they dodge attacks is also just a cool thing to see.
