			<p>Barnyard Games, a studio founded by Epic Games with industry veterans including the creator of Borderlands Matthew Armstrong, John Blakely, Mark Cieslar, and Christopher Sturr, that was focused on making games within the Fortnite Creative mode using Unreal Engine for Fortnite (UEFN), has shut down, Blakely <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7372106491253698561/">confirmed in a post on LinkedIn</a>.</p>



<p>With Fortnite leaning more on user-generated content in Fortnite Creative, Blakely, Armstrong, Cieslar, and Sturr all took the chance to make games specifically for Fortnite Creative and be a part of the growing selection of titles available within Fortnite. While the studio was founded in part by Epic Games, it was not an Epic Games subsidiary.</p>



<p>The studio was founded and revealed in <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/new-dev-barnyard-games-formed-to-make-games-within-fortnite">December 2023</a>, and at the time, Blakely, who also took the role as chief executive officer, <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20231214945970/en/Announcing-Barnyard-Games-a-New-Breed-of-AAA-Developers-Making-Epic-Games-on-Unreal-Engine-for-Fortnite-UEFN">said on the potential he saw in the stuido</a>, "<em>UEFN is an array of untapped and exciting possibilities; a relatively unexplored landscape that allows us to experiment while also giving players a central role in shaping their virtual worlds</em>. <em>We’re excited to see how gamers resonate with Barnyard’s fun and quirky style of game-making, and we’ll continue to iterate with our players as we learn more about what delivers uniquely amusing game experiences and cultivates strong social connections</em>."</p>



<p>Barnyard Games is responsible for titles like Mega Fun Golf Zone, and when it was first founded, was able secure $3.4 million in seed funding to get things going.</p>



<p>Today, Blakely shared "<em>It is with a heavy heart I am sharing that the barn doors have closed on Barnyard Games.</em> <em>To our investors, founders, and team, thank you for believing in us, for pouring your energy into the work, and for walking this journey with me. Building alongside you has been the privilege of my career, and even in closing, I feel nothing but gratitude, respect, and pride in what we created together.</em>"</p>



<p>Blakely cited issues with finding funding for the studio as the reason Barnyard Games is being shuttered, and how the industry is going through a "<em>tough moment</em>" for anyone looking for funding.</p>



<p>Barnyard Games was certainly an interesting experiment, as Epic continues to try to compete with <a href="https://wccftech.com/roblox-sets-record-concurrent-users-gaming-platform/">Roblox</a> and its vast array of user-generated content. But if a group of industry veterans can't seem to make things work, then it doesn't bode well for others who might've looked to Fortnite and UEFN to tap into the massive player base that Fortnite wields.</p>



<p>With so many of today's players <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-biggest-competitor-threat-video-games-industry/">spending their time playing nearly nothing else besides Fortnite</a> and a few other games, the fact that there seems to be little to no room for studios to tap into that is another troubling thought on the mountain of troubling thoughts that build for developers struggling in today's industry.</p>

            <p>Françoise Cadol, the long-time French voice actor for Lara Croft, has reportedly launched legal action against <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tomb-raider-iv-vi-remastered">Tomb Raider IV-VI Remastered</a> publishers Aspyr over alleged use of generative AI to replicate her voice for lines in the game. Cadol claims Aspyr didn't contact her to ask for permission, and it appears the voice of Croft in at least one other dub of the remasters may have been put in a similar position.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>According to a report from French publication <a href="https://www.leparisien.fr/culture-loisirs/cinema/cest-une-trahison-quand-lia-vole-la-voix-francaise-dangelina-jolie-pour-tomb-raider-10-09-2025-63HIGMNMEZBSFLELCKNN4S5I2M.php">Le Parisien</a>, spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/tomb-raider-4-6-remastered-ai-voice-generation-france-francoise-cadol-cease-and-desist/">TheGamer</a>, Cadol has issued a cease and desist to Aspyr over the matter.</p>
<p>We've reached out to Aspyr for comment.</p>
<p>It looks like the alleged AI-generated lines may have been added to the game by <a href="https://www.tombraider.com/news/video-games/tomb-raider-iv-vi-remastered-patch-2-notes">Patch 2</a> in mid-August. The notes for that patch include one that reads: "Restored missing or incorrect voiceover lines in various languages (especially Brazilian Portuguese)".</p><p>Cadol told Le Parisien she'd been alerted to the possible use of genAI to mimic her lines in the remaster by Tomb Raider fans, who've circulated what they believe to be examples of it happening on social media. Some of the lines supposedly using genAI in the remaster look to be tutorial instructions telling you how to do things like climb, with the comparison below featuring some different wording in the Remastered versions of some lines. The apparent genAI lines have a more robotic edge to them, in contrast to the natural inflections Cadol speaks with in the original.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="fr"><p>🇫🇷 ALERTE INFO — Le patch des remasters de Tomb Raider IV, V et VI par <a href="https://twitter.com/AspyrMedia?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@AspyrMedia</a> vient de sortir…</p><p>Mauvaise surprise pour les fans français de Lara Croft, certaines répliques de Françoise Cadol dans le tutoriel ont été refaites avec l’IA et ça s’entend ! <a href="https://t.co/YRbZsY669H">pic.twitter.com/YRbZsY669H</a></p></div>— Bastien D.

</p></div>
<p>The French version isn't the only dub of the game to have allegedly done this. Lene Bastos, Croft's Brazilian Portuguese actor, has posted a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DOMNDrFj8R9/?hl=en-gb">video to Instagram</a> stating that Tomb Raider fans have informed her that some of voice lines appear to have been subject to AI generation in the remasters. Bastos claims to have recieved a message from Aspyr about it, with the publishers putting the blame at the feet of an external development partner and telling her the lines will soon be removed in the game's next patch.</p>
<p>Voice actors fighting for protections against the possibility of companies using generative AI to mimic their voices was a key element of the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5ykx117keqo">SAG-AFTRA strike</a> that concluded a few months ago. "Basically you have to get our consent to make a digital replica of us," Horizon and Borderlands voice actor Ashly Burch told the BBC when the strike was suspended. "You have to tell us how you're going to use it, and then you have to compensate us fairly."</p>

		<p><em>Have you heard Rob moved into a house? Besides the normal disruption that comes with moving, especially with something pretty permanent, it causes all sorts of micro disruptions with a small group like ours.</em></p><p><em>Take, for example, Thursday stream. Plan A was a Wheel of GeForce NOW stream—but Nvidia's servers were wonky. Plan B was checking in on with Rob's obviously safe and normal beavers in Timberborn, except when Rob turned the game on, the power went off. Why? Hard to say.</em></p><p><em>Which is what brings us to this week's letter series. </em></p><p><em>Part of being in a place—rent, own, whatever—is inviting others in and trusting they will treat it with respect. It's trusting they will charge a fair amount of any work that needs to be done. It's realizing trust can easily be misplaced to a frustrating degree, because you don't know better.</em></p><hr><p><strong>Patrick: </strong>There was a moment during a stream last night where someone in chat asked when we should expect you back and my response was “Well, I haven’t received any concerning DMs from Rob, so I’m choosing to be optimistic!” Which, of course, was not something I should have said out loud, because in the days after I would receive several semi-alarming DMs from you.</p><p>One of the most concerning elements of owning a house is the first few years of not knowing what you don’t know. What do you need to look out for? What yearly maintenance is something you should absolutely keep up with versus something you can get away with overlooking a bit?&nbsp;</p><p>It’s a bit like a Metroidvania, if you think about it.</p><p>Too often, those answers come when something goes wrong and you go “Oh.” Then, the concern becomes the level of wrong and the amount of zeroes you attach to fixing it. My rule of thumb is that anytime I’m calling someone to help, I mentally budget $500 disappearing from my bank account and come away relieved when it’s anything below. Then, I’ve saved some money.</p><p>Some years back, I had a chimney company come out to do some routine cleaning. They also inspected the chimney and asked if I knew that the chimney wasn’t up to code. At one point, the city required chimneys to be a few feet higher. Thing is, that change happened before we bought the house, so why didn’t I know to ask the owners to knock some money off the cost of the house? (This is a common tactic to avoid actually paying a new buyer money to cover a repair; they just take that proposed money off the cost of the home. It saves money eventually?)</p><p>So, I did like I said: I got an answer and went “Oh.”</p><p>Why, exactly, didn’t the house inspector tell us about this? Because apparently we should have hired a separate inspector who specializes in chimneys, or something to that effect. Why didn’t our realtor tell us about that? Good question. Why didn’t reddit answer that when I was casually browsing some threads about buying a home and what to look out for? Another good question.</p><p>The next steps are what prompted my philosophy of getting three quotes before you approve non-emergency work on your house. I had three companies come out to propose the cost to raise the chimney by a few feet and they varied <em>wildly.</em> We’re talking thousands and thousands of dollars apart from one another. One felt way too expensive. One felt too cheap. The other was right in the middle. During the third inspection, I leveled with the guy and asked him why.</p><p>The answer, it turns out, was that the job I wanted done was too little work to take on without jacking up the price. The estimates I’m getting simply reflect the different ways the companies view taking on a small, boring job that won’t result in the company making all that much money.</p><p>Once again, I got an answer and went “Oh.” And then I chose the middle option. It went fine.</p><p>This is a long preamble to set you up for the past two weeks of your life. What are the things you didn’t know that you needed to know, and how much stress has it already caused you?</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@josholalde?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Josh Olalde</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Rob: </strong>Can we walk about the complete nonsense that “quoting” is? A business comes along and guesses at what they are going to charge you, but they’re not <em>bidding </em>on the job. If anything goes wrong or, more importantly, if their guesses about what the job will entail prove to be wildly inaccurate, the risk is <em>entirely </em>on you. So what incentive is there for anyone to give you a good quote rather than lowballing it?</p><p>Our move to the new place went <em>badly</em>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/beelink%E2%80%99s-ryzen-7-mini-pc-falls-below-prime-day-pricing-a-tempting-windows-alternative-for-mac-mini-users.1295739/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The mini PC wave doesn’t seem to be cresting anytime soon. Far from it, in fact, as more and more new models hit the market — and, like this Windows 11 Pro model from Beelink — hit the Amazon sale list. <strong>The Beelink SER5 PRO Mini PC has an AMD Ryzen 7 processor</strong> that can reach speeds of up to 4.5GHz, and three-monitor support via HDMI, DisplayPort, and USB-C, all of which can support 4K resolution.</p>
<p>This mini PC has all the connections you need, including Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.2, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4085/">during this limited-time Amazon deal, this price is very definitely right — just $265 after a 26% drop from its usual retail price of $360</a>. There’s a whole lot of productivity and computing muscle in this small package that’s now at a smaller price, so read on and decide.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4085/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Is This You?</h2>
<p>A mini PC is not going to be your hardcore gaming rig or your high-end 3D-editing station. But if you’re looking for a PC that’s reliable, more than fast enough for everyday productivity tasks and streaming, quick for browsing, and positioned in an excellent price point, that’s a pretty solid description of the Beelink SER5 PRO. If you value efficient spatial organization and hate the idea of adding a bulky tower or even a large laptop to your desk, then the SER5 PRO is <em>really</em> for you.</p>
<p>The SER5 PRO is so small that you can easily fit three 4K monitors on your desk. And you’ll be able to run them all at the same time, since the SER5 PRO’s Ryzen 7 5825U 8-core processor, 16GB of RAM (expandable to 64GB), and 2000MHz AMD Radeon Graphics 8 chip provide more than enough graphic-generating muscle. There’s an HDMI 60Hz port, DisplayPort, and USB-C port at the ready for your monitors, along with four USB-A 3.2 Gen2 ports and a 2.5Gbps LAN for super-fast hardwired internet.</p>



<h2>Built to Last</h2>
<p>The Beelink SER5 PRO is designed to be your everyday PC for a long time to come, and that’s not just because of the sturdy construction bolstered by a silent high-speed fan, heat sink, and other safety features to guard against overheating. It’s also expandable — there are dual SO-DIMM RAM slots so you can easily boost the RAM as high as 64GB, and the 500GB SSD storage can be swapped out for one as large as 4TB.</p>
<p>The mini PCs are only going to keep becoming more common and more advanced, but this Beelink SER5 PRO has the power to be your everyday desktop PC right now, and also the capacity to expand to meet future workloads. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4085/">The Amazon limited-time deal price of $265 may end up being your PC budget for years to come.</a></p>

Footage has emerged online, showing off a good look at the map, vehicles, and combat.</p><p>People are reacting positively to the leak, but it remains to be seen if Electronic Arts will attempt to scrub the footage from the internet. A second video reveals the drop-in sequence in the battle royale mode. You can see the footage for yourself in the videos below (<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-gameplay/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via Insider Gaming</a>).</p><p>Earlier this week, Battlefield Studios opened the floodgates on the battle royale mode for Battlefield 6 in terms of information and specifics. The game will support 100-player matches and it will feature Battlefield's trademark destruction elements. The developers also said the battle royale mode will have the deadliest ring in the entire battle royale genre--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-battle-royale-touching-ring-is-insta-kill-100-player-matches-destruction-more-revealed/1100-6534644/" data-ref-id="1100-6534644">if you simply touch it, you're dead.</a></p><p>You can <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-labs" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">sign up for Battlefield Labs</a> for a chance to try the battle royale mode ahead of launch.</p><p>Battlefield 6 launches on October 10 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. There is no word yet when the battle royale mode could be released, or if it's a premium game that's part of Battlefield or a standalone download.</p>

              <p>When it comes to deckbuilding roguelites, there’s one name that tops almost every list:&nbsp;<em>Slay the Spire</em>. The incredible 2019 release from Mega Crit is still enormously popular, but six years on we’re definitely ready for its sequel. Sadly, that’s now looking like it’ll be a seven year wait, with the game’s Early Access launch delayed until next March. And no, it has nothing to do with the release of&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>.</p> <p>Originally slated to appear this fall,&nbsp;<em>Slay the Spire 2</em> is set 1,000 years after the massive hit original, offering a more complicated path through the Spire, new characters joining the old crew, and as-yet unrevealed “new ways to play” (although the update does reveal one!). And given that the original game, six years later, still routinely sees 18-20,000 people playing every day on Steam (let alone on console and mobile), you can only imagine how many people are waiting in digital lines to be able to start playing the follow-up.</p> <p>“After a lot of internal discussion,” <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/646570/view/529856925490218829">a very lengthy update post</a> for the game begins, “we’ve made the call to move <em>Slay the Spire 2</em>‘s Early Access launch to a secret Thursday in March 2026.”</p>

 <p>“There’s no single dramatic reason,” the post continues. “Some personal life stuff hit the team (everyone’s okay!), we kept saying ‘wouldn’t it be cool if…’ one too many times, and honestly, the game just needs more polish to meet our standards.” Thus another six months development before the game reaches players.</p> <p>Knowing exactly where people’s minds would immediately go, an FAQ about the delay begins with the question, “Is the real reason for the delay the timing of the&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em> release?” But, Mega Crit insists, this had nothing to do with it.</p>

 <blockquote><p>“We got together as a team to determine our new release window before <em>Silksong</em>’s date was announced. The timing just worked out like that, but on the bright side, everyone can keep busy playing <em>Silksong</em> during the wait!”</p></blockquote> <p>The FAQ continues with an even more conspiratorial theory: that the developers are spending too much time on merch and community events. (You have to assume this is something on a forum or Discord somewhere, right?) Again, they say no.</p> <blockquote><p>“Our merch is made by 3rd party partners and our community manager is the primary liaison on our team for collabs like that. No game development was harmed in the making of those plushies! Likewise, anything community-focused that we create, participate in, or promote is generally handled by the CM and doesn’t cut into any game development time.”</p></blockquote> <p>Mega Crit also promise no radio silence between now and March. But then the post goes on to reveal a brand new&nbsp;<em>Slay the Spire 2</em> feature: “alternate acts.”</p> <blockquote><p>Once unlocked, upon entering a new act in&nbsp;<i>Slay the Spire 2</i>, you will be randomly greeted with one of two possible acts. These acts differ radically in their environments, enemies, events, and bosses, all of which greatly increase the variety of gameplay between runs. For instance, Act 1a is Overgrowth, a lush, tangled ruin with much of its fauna resembling mystical woodland creatures and sentient flora that might just eat you alive. This is the act you’ve primarily been seeing in our teasers and trailers, though there’s still plenty left to uncover here. Act 1b is known as the&nbsp;Underdock<b>s</b>, a miry waterway connected to the Spire’s sewer system, from which all manner of mutant sea creatures and vagrants might emerge. We’ve only just begun to tease the trove of content that lurks within these murky depths.</p> <p>As the mathematically-inclined among you have probably realized, that means there will be&nbsp;double the amount of content in this new act structure. We won’t be launching with all of the alternate acts right away, but Acts 2b and 3b will come later down the road in Early Access updates. The capabilities of these different enemies, the opportunities these events offer, and how they all might impact your strategy as you ascend the Spire will be seen in time.</p></blockquote> <p>The rest of the post features some superb community engagement (really, developers need to study this for a class in how to connect with customers), including player art, in-jokes, and even <a href="https://custom-connections-game.vercel.app/g14MCkop8mMRKjn3lwdZ">a <em>Connections</em> wall</a>. It’s lovely stuff, which goes some way to easing the blow of another six months to wait.</p>

            <p>It's Nintendo Direct time. At 2pm UK time (9am ET, 6am PT, 3pm CEST), Nintendo will give us an hour-long look at what it's been cooking up.</p>
<p>We've been promised updates and releases for both Switch consoles, old and new, and the pressing question for this Direct broadcast is will it feature Mario? Remember, it's the 40th anniversary of Super Mario Bros. this weekend, so now would be a great time to unveil something new. But what?</p>
<p>The Mario Galaxy team was behind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, so perhaps it's a follow up to the 2D Mario Wonder from 2023. Or perhaps it's something else altogether. Besides Mario, we're hoping for a release date for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4</a>. And a lovely basket of surprises besides.</p>
<p>Tom and I will be delivering the blow-by-blow report, and after the show ends, we'll continue the day's liveblogging here.</p>

		<p>I’ve been away for a bit through the middle of the week, so I’ve got some gaming to catch up on. Having made a start on Indiana Jones and the Great Circle: The Order of Giants last weekend, and enjoying my return to this setting, the only real gaming that I got in while on planes was some Everybody’s Golf Hot Shots, which sure is Everybody’s Golf, with some barmy character story stuff thrown in for some reason. Got to play some more before I can drop a review, though. </p>

<p>All that Aran can say is that he’s played a bit of Ghost of Yotei, and since Nic’s family is apparently cursed to be eternally ill, all he can contribute is that he’s looking forward to Ghost of Yotei.</p>
<p>So, let’s move swiftly along to Jim, who played some more of Sword of the Sea, and has found it rather soothing, if a bit lesser than it could have been. He was also happy to find Mortal Kombat 1 in the PS Plus catalogue: “I like how they’ve rebooted the MK universe with some notable changes to certain characters. I’m currently playing through the campa- sorry, Kampaign, and find it oddly refreshing how little blood and gore there has been though I’m pretty sure that will quickly change.”</p>
<p>With a new real job in his future, Tuffcub has vacillated between joy and dismay at having new work. He’s also started Metal Gear Solid Delta, and he’s enjoying it, but exclaims that “the cut scenes/talky bits make Death Stranding look reserved. They go on forever!! Should have done what I did with MGS4 and bought popcorn for these bits.”</p>


<p>It’s been Hirogami and Discounty on Gamoc’s review docket –&nbsp;“The Discounty trailer has a little jingle in it. I only watched the trailer once, I haven’t heard the jingle in the actual game itself, but every time I play it that jingle gets stuck inside my head again.” He’s also been playing a bit of Baldur’s Gate 3 on a PC that should not really be able to play it.</p>
<p>Ade’s been playing plenty more Marvel Rivals with Season 4 dropping around about now, and is looking forward to play as Angela. I’m out of the loop, so I assume that this is Angela Bassett? </p>

<p>Steve had intended to play a bunch of Silksong, but instead had to finish off some reviews. I’ll let him ramble: “I put 20 hours into finishing Lost Soul Aside and was underwhelmed throughout. It was clear that it had gone through several iterations throughout its complicated development history and never really took full advantage of any of them. I also put a few hours into Davy X Jones which is fun but I encountered a quest breaking bug which I’m waiting for a fix for before I write up my full views. It’s in Early Access so this isn’t unusual. Finally I’ve put Wuchang down for a bit as I am stuck on two different bosses and can’t make any progress without having the time to really devote to learning them. I’ve switched instead to checking out the feline Dark Souls game, Kristala which I’m enjoying a lot more (at least until I hit a difficult boss in that too…). Finally I went back to Breath of Fire II on a commute to Liverpool but could not remember what I was doing so had to restart it.”</p>
<p>And we’ll round things out with Dom, whose nightly gaming tradition has become a bit of Mario Kart World, while he’s had Switch 2 Star Wars Outlaws, some Frostpunk 2 and some Grit and Valor on the go elsewhere.</p>
<p>Now then, what have you been playing?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>See all those wires cluttering your desktop? Quick — do you know right away where all of them go, and which ones are powering or connecting what device? It sucks when the cable octopus turns into a vicious cable kraken and kills any semblance of organization on your desk, but Amazon’s running a fat deal on the ultimate clutter-killing hub: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4084/">HP’s G5 11-in-1 dock works with any USB-C or Thunderbolt-enabled laptop or PC, and it’s never been priced lower than it is right now at just $104.</a></p>
<p>When the opportunity presents itself to give your work or gaming setup the ultimate dose of organization and power management while saving a huge 55% off the regular price of $230, you jump at it. We don’t make up the rules here, we just advise you not to break them.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4084/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Here’s the Lineup</h2>
<p>Take another look at your current setup and then read this list of available ports on the HP G5 dock. See how many of your cables will fit in this one unified power hub:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 DisplayPort 1.4</li>
<li>1 HDMI port</li>
<li>4 USB-A ports (one SuperSpeed)</li>
<li>1 RJ-45 Gig Ethernet</li>
<li>2 USB-C ports (one for data/power out, one to connect to your computer)</li>
<li>1 audio jack</li>
</ul>
<p>If your desktop or laptop is either USB-C or Thunderbolt compatible (and virtually all of them are now), the HP G5 dock will work with your machine, and work brilliantly. For charging purposes, it brings up to 100W of power to your connected devices. If you’re on a PC, your machine will still get updates pushed through the G5 dock, even if the computer is in sleep mode.</p>
<p>As for the G5 dock itself, it’s an unassuming little device despite that huge number of ports and docks. It’s just 5-by-5 inches square, and stands less than 2 inches tall, so you can tuck it away and effectively hide the source of all of your peripheral connections.</p>



<h2>Universal Appeal</h2>
<p>The HP name might make you think the G5 dock is a PC-exclusive device, but it works equally well with Macs — anything with a Thunderbolt or USB-C port, across platforms, across desktops and laptops. Anything with the prerequisite hookup can not only be given a dose of cable-management sanity, it can also become a triple-monitor productivity hive.</p>
<p>We’ve seen Amazon run deals on the HP G5 11-in-1 Dock before, and it’s been a solid recommendation every time it comes up. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4084/">But now that it’s being offered at its lowest price ever — just $104 after a huge 55% price cut</a> — we can’t recommend it more strongly than now.</p>

Microsoft's answer is to go multiplatform with its Xbox games, releasing them on rival consoles as well as PC. Sony is late to the party on this front, refusing, for the most part, to release its PlayStation games on PC at the same time. However, it has shown wriggle room on that front recently, with its live service games like Helldivers 2 coming out on PC at the same time as PS5. Helldivers 2 even ended up on Xbox in what was a first for Sony.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As former president and CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment America Shawn Layden has previously said, when a video game's costs exceed $200 million — as it sounds like Intergalactic will — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ex-playstation-boss-shawn-layden-says-exclusivity-is-your-achilles-heel-if-game-costs-exceed-200-million"><u>"exclusivity is your Achilles’ heel."</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It reduces your addressable market,” Layden said at the time, citing the success of Arrowhead’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii"><u>Helldivers 2</u></a>. “Particularly when you’re in the world of live service gaming or free-to-play. Another platform is just another way of opening the funnel, getting more people in. In a free-to-play world, as we know, 95% of those people will never spend a nickel. The business is all about conversion. You have to improve your odds by cracking the funnel open."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/12/gettyimages-2219410002-1757674687124.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet will be Naughty Dog's biggest and "maybe" most expensive game ever, Neil Druckmann has said.

            <p>
Gearbox has released an optimisation guide for Borderlands 4 on PC, following reports of poor performance.
</p>
<p>
The latest in the series released yesterday, but so far has a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1285190/Borderlands_4/#app_reviews_hash">Mixed response on Steam</a>. One player has dubbed it "Stutterlands".
</p>
<p>
While some players have had no problems at all, others have complained of "terrible optimisation" and advised others not to purchase until a fix is released.

<p>
Earlier this week, series creator <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1964424122861064640">Randy Pitchford responded</a> to an article shared on social media, stating the game's day one patch "does a lot", but the game will be "unplayable" if using a below min-spec machine.
</p>
<p>
Still, it appears the day one patch isn't sufficient for some players. And when the game already has a peak of over 200k concurrent players on Steam, that's potentially a lot of people.
</p>
<p>For instance, here's a player struggling with an appallingly unplayable frame rate:</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>
Gearbox has since released an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1285190/view/679602429802577921">optimisation guide</a> for better performance using Nvidia GPUs, while re-sharing the <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/news/pc-specs-and-features/">minimum and recommended PC specifications</a>.
</p>
<p>
The expected results for Borderlands 4 on PC are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Minimum PC specs - 1080p @ 30FPS with Low Preset settings</li>
<li>Recommended PC specs - 1440p @ 60FPS with Medium Preset settings</li>
</ul>

<p>
"Please note that any time you change any of your graphics settings, your shaders will need to recompile," the guide reads. "Please keep playing for at least 15 minutes to see how your PC's performance has changed."
</p>
<p>
The guide then lists in granular detail the optimal settings for each type of Nvidia graphics card.
</p>
<p>
It should also be noted the game runs in Unreal Engine 5. Many recently released games using the engine - including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> and Wuchang: Fallen Feathers - have been known to have performance issues.
</p>
<p>
However, Epic boss <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-ceo-blames-unreal-engine-5-issues-on-developers-but-more-support-incoming">Tim Sweeney recently put blame on developers for engine issues</a>, though more support is on the way.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a> modders have yet again managed to pull off something remarkable. You know how creating patches to ensure two mods work together smoothly's long been something that requires firing up the likes of the creation kit or xEdit? Well, thanks to a new mod dubbed the in-game patcher, it's possible to resolve issues like that simply by wandering up to the location as the Dragonborn and editing the very make-up of the world.</p>
<p>See a rock clipping through a house because you've downloaded a couple of works that give the same bit of Whiterun a makeover? Just mosey over, grab the misbehaving mineral, and either move it elsewhere or delete it. You'll have make sure you've not messed up anything else in the process before you save your changes, but assuming all the NPCs still have their own heads, you've got your own patch.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The modder behind this <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/158681?tab=description">in-game patcher</a> is RavenKZP, whose previous projects include some equally advanced stuff. <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/101364">Adding seasons</a> to the new areas added to the RPG by the likes of Beyond Skyrim: Bruma and a mechanic that <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/113658">makes food go mouldy</a> if you keep it in your pockets too long. They've also made <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/125890">a quest</a> involving <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iii-morrowind">Morrowind</a>'s Uncle Sweetshare, which earns them a million extra points in my book.</p>
<p>Anyway, enough of me curiously nerding out. This in-game patcher, originally spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/skyrim-mod-conflict-fix-in-game-patche-nexus-mods/">TheGamer</a>, is a plugin for Skyrim: Special edition's script extender. Once it's installed, you enter and exit a patching mode by opening and closing the game's console, where you typically enter the likes of spawn commands.</p><p>Once open, you select objects as you usually would in the console, and can move, rotate, scale, or remove them as you see fit. Markers, such as spawn points and those which control the likes of idles, furniture interactions, and which way water flows can also be manipulated in the same fashion. You can also add keywords to items if you're so inclined. There are a bunch of quick YouTube tutorials under the mod page's video tab to help you get started.</p>

<p>RavenKZP wrote that their creation can also be used simply to rejig the world clutter to your liking or do a bit of redecorating of houses, cities and the like, which'll probably be what I try first if I give it a whirl. Once you've made your tweaks, they can be saved as "BOS/KID patches so they persist across game sessions" and shared with others in ini file form. The modder's also got plans to keep expanding what their work can do going forwards, including adding the ability to edit multiple objects at once.</p>
<p>As you might imagine given what it pulls off, the in-game patcher does come with a pretty chunky list of requirements - the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30379">Skyrim script extender</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32444">Address Library for SKSE Plugins</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/123664">Object Manipulation Overhaul</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/120352">SKSE Menu Framework</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/148703">SkyPrompt</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60805">Base Object Swapper</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55728">Keyword Item Distributor</a>, and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/136456">Debug Menu</a>. <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13090">Jaxonz Positioner Converter Remastered</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19250">More Informative Console</a> are optional extras.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/slay-the-spire">Slay the Spire</a> 2, the sequel to the roguelike deck-building game that spawned a genre, has been delayed. Developer Mega Crit had been aiming for an autumn 2025 release, it said, but has now realigned for March 2026.</p>
<p>We don't know the date but we do, bizarrely, know the day. Mega Crit has already, quirkily, announced that Slay the Spire 2 will be released on a Thursday. According to my calendar, which I presume is the same as yours, it means Slay the Spire 2 will be released on either the 5th, 12th, 19th or 26th March 2026. Maybe provisionally book-off all these days from work?</p>
<p>"We know this isn't the news anyone wanted to hear," Mega Crit wrote in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/646570/view/529856925490218829">a Steam update</a>. "There's no single dramatic reason [for the delay]. Some personal life stuff hit the team (everyone's okay!), we kept saying 'wouldn't it be cool if...' one too many times, and honestly, the game just needs more polish to meet our standards."</p>
<p>Mega Crit added, in a lighthearted delay FAQ accompanying the news, that the delay wasn't <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Silksong</a>'s fault, despite appearances. "We got together as a team to determine our new release window before Silksong's date was announced," the studio said. "The timing just worked out like that, but on the bright side, everyone can keep busy playing Silksong during the wait!"</p><p>Slay the Spire 2 looks a lot like Slay the Spire 1, but upon closer inspection has some notable differences - evolutions, it's probably fairer to say. A lot of effort has gone into improving the visual presentation of the game - with what appear to be 3D models in 2D environments now - and there's also apparently a great deal more content stuffed in.</p>
<p>One major change outlined in the post is alternate acts. These allow you to choose different "a" and "b" variations of acts when you replay the game to help ease rerun repetition. Each alteration is said to have "radically" different environments, enemies, events and bosses. The two examples shared in the update were Act 1a variation Overgrowth, a lush jungle-themed alteration; and Act 1b, the Underdocks, a miry waterway.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Noble Fokus Amadeus Wireless Earbuds Review]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/noble-fokus-amadeus-wireless-earbuds-review.1295601/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>In the last year I’ve covered a dearth of different headsets, headphones and earbuds. One of the clear highlights has been <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/17/noble-fokus-apollo-headset-review-astounding-audio-with-an-astounding-pricepoint-to-match/">Noble’s Fokus Apollo</a>, one of the best-sounding pairs of headphones I’ve ever put on my head. Their latest, the Noble Fokus Amadeus, have a certain weight of expectation behind them then, and I had to wonder whether they could repeat the same trick with a pair of wireless earbuds. The answer is an emphatic ‘yes’, though, as with their other offerings, this sits well towards the premium end of the market.</p>

<p>In the box, you’re getting the Fokus Amadeus earbuds, a 42-hour charging case, USB-C to USB-A charging cable and a selection of eartips. On first impressions, the Fokus Amadeus are certainly eye-catching, with the bright red jewel-like design of each earbud an immediate visual highlight, and one which ensures that they’re not going to be mistaken for one of those boring bland earbuds everyone else is wearing. Everything feels like an event with the Amadeus, and every visual detail has been covered, right down to the Noble logo on the tiny metal speaker grilles.</p>


<p>Detaching the foam tips, it’s apparent that they’re a slight touch heavier and more substantial than some wireless earbuds you might own, though they’re only a spot larger than Sony’s WF-1000XM5, and smaller than the older XM4s. They feel rock solid, and the design and build quality reflect the premium price point.</p>
<p>The red jewel design is mirrored by the metal lid of the case, but this feels thin and lightweight in comparison to the earbuds themselves. It doesn’t scream quality, though the rest of the case is solid enough, but it’s a chunky thing to drop into your pocket, being considerably thicker than the case for the AirPods Pro 2 and the elongated case for the Bose Sport Earbuds that I also carry around with me – you might think I have too many earbuds considering I only have two ears, but I would disagree. It’s not huge – we’re not talking anything like the enormous Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 case – but it’ll definitely put a lump in your pocket. I took to chucking them in my bag.</p>


<p>The Fokus Amadeus is equipped with Bluetooth 5.4 and Active Noise Cancellation, boasting a battery life of 8 hours with it enabled, and 12 without. That’s right around the ballpark of other premium wireless earbuds, such as the newly announced AirPods Pro 3 or the Sony WF-1000XM5. It’s going to last you a whole day at work then, and with the 42hrs of charge from the case they’re a solid companion that’s unlikely to let you down when you’re ready to block out the world.</p>
<p>There’s a set of six different ear tips, with three standard tips, and three with dual fins for a tighter fit. The Fokus Amadeus need a twist into your ear to sit properly, and while I had no problem at all with the fit in my right ear, I had to test a few different tips to get my left ear to feel as solid as its partner. In the end, and in a first for me, I used a smaller eartip in one ear over the other, before finally opting for the largest pair of dual tips. It’s well worth taking the time to find the best ones, because the Fokus Amadeus reward you for your perseverance, but this is a pair of earbuds with a particularly pernickety fit.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the touch controls aren’t as fussy, and while I do prefer swiping for volume rather than repeated taps, I soon got used to using the left earbud for volume and toggling ANC while the right looks after your music controls and Siri/Gemini. The most impressive thing is that they all work relatively reliably.</p>
<p>The accompanying Noble Fokus app includes Audio presonalisation, which means you get a hearing test before it provides you with a bespoke EQ setting for your ears. I have to say, I didn’t particularly like the curve it gave me for the lower frequencies, but the top end was definitely improved by its tinkering. You can, of course, completely override whatever it suggests, and though there’s a disappointingly slim selection of genre-specific EQs, you can completely customise the EQ so that it fits exactly where you want it to, with both a 10-band option, and an easy-to-parse three-point one.</p>
<p>The Fokus Amadeus is capable of dealing with most modern Bluetooth codecs, including two of the highest bitrate offerings we currently have access to – if your device supports them. I was interested to discover that my new Honor Magic V5 defaulted to using AptX Adaptive at first, before then more commonly connecting via LDAC.&nbsp;Both of these offer high-bitrate connections, and while you might find more detail with LDAC, AptX Adaptive offers lower latency, which might suit you if you’re going to do a spot of mobile gaming along the way. If you’re an Apple user, you’re going to be stuck to AAC or SBC, so you won’t be getting the best out of them at all.</p>

<p>With lossless audio, the Fokus Amadeus sound stunning. The amount of detail their custom-made triple-layer diaphragm drivers are capable of reproducing will make you wonder just how much you’ve been missing listening to music elsewhere.</p>
<p>While I did eventually check out Falco’s Rock Me Amadeus sounded with these earbuds – you’d have to, wouldn’t you? – it fell to my current heavy rotation track, Specter by Bad Omens, to really put the Amadeus through its paces. This soaring slab of emotional metal opens with plaintive piano and a host of reverb that the Fokus Amadeus picks through with care, creating an enveloping soundscape that brings Noah Sebastien’s vocals to the fore, grasping every nuance of this melancholy opening before ripping it apart with chugging guitars and heavy beats. If you’ve got the fit right, I love the rounded and well-balanced bass delivery here, but it’s almost too easy for an earbud to slip out of that sweet spot. My most enjoyable listening sessions with the Fokus Amadeus were static, at home.</p>
<p>I’ve got a full playlist of songs I like to use to review headphones and headsets, and after playing some Death Stranding 2, I’ve found myself drawn back to the music from the first game. That means that Don’t Be So Serious by Low Roar stood out as one I had to try out with the Fokus Amadeus, and its multiple instrumentation types and multi-layered soundscape were an ideal fit. The earbuds’ wide soundstage made it feel as though there was plenty of room for each different instrument, and the precision of the Fokus Amadeus meant you could pick out and focus on each part, even in a busy environment. Seriously, there were elements of this song I’d never heard before that the Amadeus brought out.</p>
<p>It’s all aided by the inclusion of active noise cancellation. It does a good job of removing background sounds from your listening experience, even if it’s not quite as powerful as the ANC you’ll find in Sony and Bose’s top-tier audio products. A recent train journey was ably dimmed, allowing the music and the odd episode of Kaiju No.8 to shine through, while walking around town with an audiobook cranked up proved that the Amadeus was capable of more than just delivering excellent audio.</p>
<p>At $320/£279.99, the Fokus Amadeus are putting themselves right amongst the world’s priciest earbuds, and in terms of audio and build quality they absolutely deserve to be there. However, their fit remained idiosyncratic throughout my time with them, something which I’ve never struggled with while using the Sony WF-1000XM5s and AirPods Pro 2s. If you’re looking for the best ANC though, then you’re going to want the Bose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds, which tune out the world to an incredible degree.</p>

            <p>Gearbox and Take-Two Interactive's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> has launched to cries of "pretty good" from (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-4-is-out-now-but-our-review-code-just-arrived-so-im-writing-about-this-silly-bicycle-game-instead">some</a>) professional reviewers, and "Stutterland bugfest" from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1285190/Borderlands_4/#app_reviews_hash">a vocal portion of the Steam playerbase</a>. In amongst the complaints about performance, there are some fears about potential breaches of player privacy supposedly allowed for by Take-Two's terms of service. A Borderlands developer has now responded to these fears in the Steam forums, reiterating that Take-Two at large aren't in the business of "spyware".
</p><!--more-->
<p>"Take-Two does not use spyware in its games," reads <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1285190/discussions/1/596285654384685820/">the statement on Steam</a>. "Take-Two's Privacy Policy applies to all labels, studios, games, and services across all media and platform types such as console, PC, mobile app, and website. The Privacy Policy identifies the data activities that may be collected but this does not mean that every example is collected in each game or service.
</p>
<p>"Take-Two identifies these practices in its Privacy Policy to provide transparency to players and comply with its legal obligations," it goes on. "Take-Two collects this information to deliver its services to players, including to protect the game environment and player experience."</p>
<p>The statement gives a couple of examples of more innocuous data collection, such as sponging up player and device identifiers to ensure compatibility with platforms, or making usernames visible to other players, together with more ambiguous practices like gathering data "to better understand how players play games".</p><p>Take-Two have been caught deploying some pretty 
insalubrious data collection software in the past. As reported by Alice O (RPS in peace) in 2018, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vi">Civilization 6</a> once made use of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/civilization-vi-removes-red-shell">Red Shell software</a> to track certain system data, in a bid to identify whether people who've clicked on adverts for games then proceed to buy them.
</p>
<p>The Steam statement also seeks to clarify Take-Two's policy towards mods, noting that they "prohibit mods that allow users to gain an unfair advantage, negatively impact the ability of other users to enjoy the game as intended, or allow users to gain access to content that the user is not entitled to", but do not "generally" take action against mods "that are single-player only, non-commercial, and respect the intellectual property (IP) rights of its labels and third parties." I'm not that familiar with the Borderlands modding scene, but Take-Two and subsidiary Rockstar Games <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/somebody-recreated-all-of-gta-4s-liberty-city-in-gta-5-aaaaand-its-gone">have a legendarily iffy relationship with GTA modders</a>.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/borderlands-is-the-latest-battleground-for-steam-review-bombing-but-the-justification-is-extremely-flimsy/">Perignon Champagne Gamer</a>, the concern about Take-Two spyware dates back at least to May this year, when a Youtuber video about <a href="https://www.take2games.com/privacy/en-US/">the publisher's recently revised TOS</a> sparked a short-lived uproar.</p>
<p>I do not want to hand over any of my data to any particular large corporation, myself, but I have to say, I don't see anything in that TOS that strikes me as out of the ordinary, for better and worse. Suspicion is the appropriate response to such things, but exaggeration helps nobody. I've read a few comments that assume that Take-Two are automatically hoovering up everything mentioned in the list of possible data types collected, the second you boot up a game, rather than when you deliberately opt into certain services, such as Borderlands 4's irritating SHiFT service for cross-play.</p><p>I am adding "interview somebody to do a proper explainer about data collection practices and privacy" to our endlessly extendable, usefully hypothetical Long Term Features trello. While we're at it, we could look into related anxieties about anti-cheat and DRM, which have recently resurfaced thanks to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-follows-battlefield-6s-lead-will-also-require-secure-boot-on-pc">Call Of Duty and Battlefield requiring that you enable secure boot on PC</a>.</p>
<p>The TOS aside, some Borderlands 4 players are concerned about the game's usage of two types of digital rights management - the infamous Denuvo software, which has been cited by a few of the reviews that mention launch performance problems, with proprietary Symbiote software stacked on top. We interviewed a Denuvo executive last year <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/denuvo-respond-to-their-rep-for-tanking-games-im-a-gamer-myself-and-therefore-i-know-what-im-talking-about">about their reputation for tanking games</a>.
