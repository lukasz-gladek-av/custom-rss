		<p>Nintendo has <a href="https://corporate.pokemon.co.jp/PostImages/pokemon_pressreleases_20251023_2.pdf">announced</a> that Pokémon Legends: Z-A has quickly reached 5.8 million copies sold through its first week, making it the fifth fastest-selling Pokémon game of all time. Perhaps more interesting is that around half of those sales have come from Nintendo Switch 2 owners, showing just how strong the initial sales of the console have been.</p>
<p>Of the games that Legends: Z-A is lagging behind – as noted by <a href="https://xcancel.com/pierre485_/status/1981599907262714267">games sales tracker Pierre485</a> – all of them are Nintendo Switch games – Scarlet &amp; Violet leads the bunch at 10 million in 3 days, Arceus had 6.5 million in 3 days, Sword &amp; Shield had 6 million in 3 days, matched by&nbsp;Brilliant Diamond &amp; Shining Pearl.</p>


<p>The Switch 2 has been the best-selling console of all time through its opening months, and with such strong early adoption, it’s natural that some of the keenest Pokémon gamers are also then making the jump, leading to that rough 50:50 player split.</p>
<p>You do have to wonder if some of the issues that plagued Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet hampered some of the interest for Z-A, with that game having significant performance issues on the original Switch, or perhaps being a “Legends” branded spin-off make this feel less essential than a traditional dual game release.</p>
<p>But, Pokémon Legends: Z-A is one of the biggest, most impactful gameplay shakeups to the series to date. Taking place entirely within Lumiose City from Pokémon X &amp; Y, the big shift comes with the battle system, which has been transformed with real time battles. There’s also now a day-night cycle with tougher battles at night.</p>

<p>Nic was effusive with his praise of the game, saying in our review, “Pokémon Legends: Z-A is a game that really holds your attention. The spiritual successor to Legends Arceus, it’s learned from the mistakes of the distant past and beautifully shows what city life is like in the Pokémon universe. I can see myself playing this for another hundred hours as I finish my Pokédex, shiny hunt and generally have a great time. This is easily the best Pokémon game on the market.”</p>

			<p>Improvisational theatre can be a bit hit and miss, depending on the direction the actors decide to take a story in the moment. At its best theatre can be a place that tells excellent stories across genres, while at its worst things can make no sense leading to disappointment. I was only half aware what to expect when lifting the curtain on Once Upon a Jester, and I was surprised from start to finish with the heart it has.</p>
<p><iframe title="Once Upon a Jester - PS5 &amp; XBSX|S Release Date Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/i-nag8ey1qQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Once Upon a Jester follows Jester &amp; Sok, a couple of thieves from Dorp Town who come up with a plan to enter a theatre competition in an attempt to steal a diamond from the royal palace. To get into the palace, the duo first need to perform shows in three different towns and gain fifteen flower bouquets from each location. To get the bouquets, though, Jester &amp; Sok need to perform plays that will appeal to the crowd, picking up clues on how to do so by exploring the towns each day.</p>


<p>Each town is rather small and only has a couple of people to interact with per day, but speaking to them and looking around the environment gives you clues on what the people want to and don’t want to see. One day, they may be in the mood for drama but absolutely do not want music, while another day they will want a love story or action. Once you have worked out what the town wants, Jester can put together a poster with stickers, of which more are unlocked through the game, and then start the show with Sok.</p>


<p>There are only a few shows to unlock, but you can take them down different routes, picking options which correspond to the different genres. You might put on a play about a prince facing off against a dragon, but if the audience is looking for romance, then Jester will have to flirt with the Sok’s dragon instead of fighting him. There are some genuinely funny moments both on and off stage in Once Upon a Jester, and the whole game just brought a smile with its absurdity.</p>
<p>While the plays are the main focus, the moments off stage can be just as funny and it is almost like you are watching another play as minor characters get introduced. The story is pretty predictable but the journey is so earnest, warm, and humorous that that is not a big takeaway.</p>

<p>Once Upon a Jester looks a bit like a 2D cartoon show with all characters having different styles to them, and environments that look bright and colourful. Music also plays a huge role in Once Upon a Jester, with a number of catchy songs throughout that can lift your spirits. In some of the plays you will play music by having to press and hold a button for period of time. There are other actions in the plays too that are essentially quick time events, but these can be a bit hit and miss. However, the misses are also weaved into the narrative so if you mess up Jester will mess up on stage which can bring shows to a premature end.</p>

		Once Upon a Jester is surprising game for me and I do recommend it, especially if you are looking for something comedic and that is only a few hours long. It might be over rather quickly, but will stay with you for quite a while.	</p></div>

              <p>EA and Battlefield Studios have some good news. Soon, you won’t have to inject yourself over and over with magic soldier juice and kill over two dozen people to unlock a spawn beacon in the recently released online FPS <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/new-battlefield-6-skin-is-causing-community-meltdown-grounded-ea-2000638294">Battlefield 6</a>.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>In <em>Battlefield 6,</em> there are numerous <a href="https://battlefield.fandom.com/wiki/Battlefield_6_Assignments">in-game challenges</a> to complete that provide various rewards. Some of these aren’t much to write home about, like a camo skin or some extra XP. However, other rewards are extremely useful and offer powerful gadgets or gear. For example, to unlock the Assault’s spawn beacon, a device that lets others spawn in at that spot, you have to complete one of these in-game challenges. And some of these, like the aforementioned spawn beacon challenge, are a real pain in the ass. Thankfully, EA has confirmed that big changes are coming soon to alleviate some of these annoying grinds.</p>

 <p>On October 24, <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1981707319550341305">the <em>Battlefield</em> devs published a blog post</a> announcing some minor changes that have been recently made to the game and teased some bigger tweaks coming over the course of the online shooter’s first season. Among the updates is the news that many challenges will be made easier to complete starting in season one. Here are the challenges EA specifically revealed will be tweaked in the post:</p>

 <ul data-offset-key="7itjf-0-0"> <li data-block="true" data-editor="ck3kq" data-offset-key="a1edv-0-0"> <p><span data-offset-key="a1edv-0-0">Class Assignment – Assault 1 – Get 30 kills while using the Adrenaline Injector – Changing to 3 kills</span></p> </li> <li data-block="true" data-editor="ck3kq" data-offset-key="98fhh-0-0"> <p><span data-offset-key="98fhh-0-0">Class Assignment – Engineer Expert 3 – Repair Vehicles for 6,000 health in a match – Changing to 1,000 health</span></p> </li> <li data-block="true" data-editor="ck3kq" data-offset-key="92rjp-0-0"> <p><span data-offset-key="92rjp-0-0">Weapon Assignment – Deadeye 2 – Get 150 headshot kills over 200m with Sniper Rifles – Changing to 5 kills and distance requirement will be reduced, too</span></p> </li> </ul> <p>These are just the ones EA revealed. Others are being tweaked, too. And that’s great, as some of these challenges were incredibly annoying. I recently completed the Assault challenge involving the injector, and it was like pulling teeth. The injector currently sucks in <em>Battlefield 6,</em> as it doesn’t last long and takes forever to use. But the spawn beacon is a very valuable tool, so I spent time grinding for it and hated the experience. Talking to friends who play <em>BF6</em>, they have had similar issues with the challenges sucking the fun out of the game, so I think these tweaks are smart. Also, maybe EA could make the injector actually good one day in a future update? Just a thought.</p>

 <p>Beyond the challenge tweaks, the devs are also planning some changes for player movement in an effort to make the game feel more consistent, but without changing the “pace” and “core feel” of how <em>BF6</em> plays now. “These adjustments aim to deliver a smoother and more precise aiming experience, all while preserving an immersive first-person feel,” explained the devs in the update post.</p> <p>You can also expect some more fixes for weapon bloom issues, an ongoing problem in the game, and changes to lighting and brightness, which will hopefully help players who keep being blinded by the sun when stepping outside. There are also some notes in here about <em>BF6</em>‘s battle royale mode, which doesn’t officially have a release date, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-datamine/">rumors are swirling</a> that it will <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6s-first-new-map-review-season-1-blackwell-fields-eastwood-update-2000638228">drop on October 28, alongside season one.</a> We’ll see if that happens. For now, I’m just happy people won’t have to grind for that damn spawn beacon when these <em>BF6</em> season one changes start rolling out across consoles and PC later this month.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-redsec-is-battlefield-6s-new-battle-royale-mode/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-redsec-is-battlefield-6%E2%80%99s-new-battle-royale-mode.1334191/</guid>

<p>A fresh story has revealed that Battlefield: RedSec is the name for the rebranded battle royale game mode coming in Battlefield 6. ‘Firestorm’ is now a thing of the past, and BF 6 is gearing up for its strongly rumored October 28 battle royale shadow drop.</p>



<p>We’ve known for weeks that Battlefield 6 is getting a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-free-to-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battle Royale</a> mode. It features an innovative insta-death circle mechanic, and a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-datamine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">datamine revealed that the Battle Royale is to release on October 28</a>. Now, we’ve learned the new game mode’s full title. </p>

<figure><figcaption>It will be war. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>Get ready to enter Battlefield: RedSec! </p>



<p>Thanks to <a href="https://x.com/ModernWarzone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ModernWarzone</a>‘s exclusive story, we’ve learned that this is the new name for EA’s rebranded, free-to-play battle royale mode in Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>Here’s what they’ve said about the news:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“EXCLUSIVE: The F2P Battlefield 6 battle royale is officially named “Battlefield: RedSec”. Releasing October 28th as previously reported, however, it looks like there won’t be any trailers or official announcements until the 28th itself, instead of a day before. Full on shadowdrop.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This doesn’t alter the gameplay in any way, but it is a cool name. It’s unclear if this is a way to get clear of Firestorm and start anew, or if Battlefield Studios is simply looking for a fresh relaunch.</p>



<p>Either way, the shadow drop is looking less like a shadow drop and more like a surprise birthday party where everyone knows it’s happening. Still, EA will be looking to right the wrongs of Firestorm and hope Battlefield: RedSec is the start of something special.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Shoot, loot, and level up with these codes.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Pixel Quest is a brand new 2D bullet hell RPG, where you'll face an onslaught of foes across biomes that range from the beach to the desert. The Third Dimension has been destroyed by 1x1x1x1, and now the Robloxians will need to work together to protect the pixelated 2D land of Robloxia. There are over 70 quests to complete, and legendary loot to obtain that will make it far easier to eviscerate hordes of enemies. With so much to do, you'll want some codes to make use of.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Working Pixel Quest Codes</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Here are all the currently active Pixel Quest codes. Be sure to redeem them before they expire!</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>LUCKYDAY</strong> - 1x Gold Clover, 2x EXP Booster, 1x Medium Dungeon Key, 3x Defense Infusion</li><li><strong>PQDISCORD2025</strong> - Wumpus Skin</li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2">How to Use Pixel Quest Codes</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Redeeming Pixel Quest codes is a straightforward process. Launch the experience and complete the tutorial if you haven't already done so. When you're in the main hub, here are the steps you need to follow:</p><ol data-cy="list"><li>Locate the chat box on the bottom left of the screen. It says "To chat click here or press / key".</li><li>Click or press the / key and then press / again. This will bring up a list of commands.</li><li>Type code, so it now says /code in your text box.</li><li>Copy and paste the code from the article and enter it into the box, <strong>e.g. /code PQDISCORD2025</strong></li><li>Hit enter.</li><li>You'll then see a message in the chat that tells you if the code has been redeemed successfully, and what the reward is.</li></ol><h2 data-cy="title2">How to Claim Gifts from You Gift Box</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Some codes will give you rewards that you need to claim from your Giftbox. On the righthand side of the screen, you'll see a yellow and red gift box. Click on this and you'll be automatically transported to the southeast corner of the main hub. The Gift Box menu will also automatically open, so you can drag them into your inventory.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">How to Find Skins</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If you receive a skin via a code, then you'll want to find the icon on the left side of the screen that shows a person and says Wardrobe. When you open the Wardrobe, you'll see three sub-menus: Skins, Badges, and Titles. You can then scroll through and see any Skins, you've unlocked.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Expired Pixel Quest Codes</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">You're in luck! There are currently no expired Pixel Quest codes, but don't let the above ones slip away before you use them.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Why Isn't My Pixel Quest Code Working?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Codes for Roblox experiences are usually case-sensitive, so the best way to ensure you've got a working code is to directly copy it from this article. We check all codes before we upload them, so you can guarantee they're working. Just double-check that you haven't copied over an extra space!</p><h2 data-cy="title2">When Is the Next Pixel Quest Update?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Pixel Quest is currently in Alpha release, but that doesn't mean that the Pixel Quest! group isn't already working hard to bring new content to the RPG. The next update is planned for Sunday, 26th October. This mini update will introduce a new dungeon and new Legendary items.

                <p>Xbox boss Phil Spencer got pretty candid at the Paley International Council Summit in California, saying that protecting creativity is important to the gaming giant but that it hasn't been the best at doing that as of late.</p><p>During the moderated discussion with Double Fine head Tim Schafer (<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-says-nurturing-and-protecting-creative-teams-that-want-to-go-take-risks-is-the-priority-admits-we-dont-always-succeed-at-that/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via PC Gamer</a>), Spencer expressed how valuable it is for not just game companies but the media industry writ large to shield the creative teams that pour their hearts and souls into the work they produce.</p>

<p>"The creativity of the teams is, in my mind, the most important thing and the thing that we need to protect and foster," Spencer said.</p><p>Not long after saying this, Spencer noted that Xbox hasn't always safeguarded the creative talent behind its biggest and best games. The sentiment was expressed in the context of internet criticism, but Spencer still admitted that Xbox--and maybe the whole media industry--doesn't protect its workers when it should.</p><p>"I think it's the most brave thing a team can do, whether you're making a movie or a television show, to go and put something out for the internet to evaluate, judge and comment on," Spencer said. "Sometimes I scratch my head on why anybody wants to go do that, because the internet's not always a nice place for the discourse around things that have been created, but nurturing and protecting creative teams that want to go take risks. We don't always succeed at that, but I think it is kind of the root of any media industry, the creative nugget."</p><p>This is true if you look at the recent evidence. In January 2024, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-cutting-1900-jobs-from-its-video-game-division/1100-6520601/" data-ref-id="1100-6520601">Xbox eliminated about 1,900 jobs</a> following the Activision Blizzard acquisition. Over a year later, in May 2025, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-7000-people-in-latest-round-of-massive-cuts/1100-6531500/" data-ref-id="1100-6531500">the company laid off roughly 7,000 people</a> in response to the "dynamic marketplace." And in July 2025, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-layoffs-begin-with-200-cuts-in-europe-report/1100-6532905/" data-ref-id="1100-6532905">Xbox cut some 9,000 people</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/" data-ref-id="2900-6726">canceling a slew of games and closing an assortment of studios</a>. Despite these slashes to its workforce, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-reached-4-trillion-valuation-after-mass-layoffs/1100-6533588/" data-ref-id="1100-6533588">the company still reached a $4 trillion valuation</a> at the end of July. An October 2025 Bloomberg report suggested that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsofts-sky-high-profit-goals-for-xbox-may-be-doing-more-harm-than-good-report/1100-6535643/" data-ref-id="1100-6535643">the mountainous profit goals Xbox has for itself are doing far more harm than good</a>, and I suppose that makes sense when you cut nearly 18,000 of your workers within the year.</p><p>Still, Schafer explained that, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-2019-xbox-game-studios-acquires-psychonauts-2-d/1100-6467547/" data-ref-id="1100-6467547">after Xbox bought Double Fine in 2019</a>, the California studio has maintained its creative independence because of that Xbox money.</p><p>"When we talked about becoming acquired, it was a big thing for me, like, 'How do we keep our culture intact?'" Schafer said. "And everyone was like, 'No, we really want you to stay who you are.' And that's been true all these years … You know, creatively, we can be like, 'Hey, we want to make this game about a walking lighthouse,' and [Xbox is] like, 'Cool. Sounds cool.'"</p><p>That game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/keeper/" data-ref-id="5000-681590">Keeper</a>, is doing pretty well critically for both Double Fine and Xbox. We awarded it a 9/10 in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/keeper-review-this-ones-a-keeper/1900-6418424/" data-ref-id="1900-6418424">our Keeper review</a>, with critic Steve Watts calling it "a visual feast, a tone poem, an exploration of movement mechanics, [and] a fable about the world and what we owe to it."</p>

              <p>Halloween has reached Gearbox’s recently released looter shooter, <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-the-kotaku-review-bugs-pc-performance-ending-gearbox-ps5-2000627149">Borderlands 4</a>.</em> But the free event is being heavily criticized online because, well, it sucks.</p> <p>As we reach the end of October and get closer and closer to Halloween, many live-service and online games start to activate seasonal, limited-time, <a href="https://kotaku.com/halloween-events-in-video-games-are-just-the-best-1839174541">Halloween-themed events.</a><em> Borderlands 4</em> is one of these games, and its new “Horrors of Kairos” event went live on October 23 and ends on November 6. And nobody really likes it, as the “event” is less of a big, in-game Halloween celebration and more of a small change to a pre-existing mechanic with two new weapons and some pumpkin-y skins.</p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:sxmjis6jypsib2k7rk6pjoau/app.bsky.feed.post/3m3uuejx3fs24" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreigwrz7ycyz5c4end5542plzpzo4bzo4hvcxcyafg6fivvwufpvnea"> <p lang="en">Double, double, recoil and trouble 🎃💥</p> <p>During Horrors of Kairos, defeat World Bosses for a chance to earn two new Legendary weapons:</p> <p>💀 Legendary Order Grenade – Skully<br> 💎 Legendary Tediore Assault Rifle – Murmur</p> <p>Event ends Nov. 6.</p> <p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:sxmjis6jypsib2k7rk6pjoau?ref_src=embed">Borderlands (@borderlands.2k.com)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:sxmjis6jypsib2k7rk6pjoau/post/3m3uuejx3fs24?ref_src=embed">2025-10-23T17:15:38.775Z</a></p></blockquote></div>  <p>Basically, the new Halloween event in<em> Borderlands 4</em> changes how random world boss spawns work in the looter shooter. They still happen during “Horrors of Kairos,” but now, when you enter the boss’s holo-bubble to start the fight, the sky turns orange, and when you kill the big bad, they might drop one of the two new legendary guns temporarily available during the spooky event. Then the bubble closes and the sky goes back to normal. And uh, that’s it. Oh, and there are some free Halloween skins you can get from using a Shift code. Okay, that’s it.</p> <p>This is not very exciting. And because world bosses spawn randomly in the open world, players have to just drive around waiting for a boss bubble to appear. And if you have a strong build, the fight might be over in less than a minute. Compared to <em>Borderlands 3</em> and its big Halloween event, this is extremely disappointing. In the last game, the Halloween event introduced a new character, added a new limited-time map, featured a new boss, and more.</p>

 <p><em>Borderlands</em> content creators are ripping the new event apart in YouTube videos and posts. Popular <em>Borderlands</em> YouTuber Joltzdude139 uploaded a new video on Friday that spelled it out simply and bluntly with the title: T<a href="https://youtu.be/HFfPynrUr30">he Horrors Of Kairos Halloween Event Sucks In <em>Borderlands 4</em></a><em>.</em> In the comments below, he added: “<span dir="auto" role="text">As a biiiiig <em>Borderlands</em> fan, I am absolutely disappointed in this Halloween event.” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands4/comments/1oev9am/gearbox_making_premium_content_for_premium_game/">And he’s not alone</a>. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands4/comments/1oerp2e/bl4s_halloween_event_is_so_bad_i_booted_up_bl3_to/">Checking Reddit,</a> Twitter, YouTube, and elsewhere, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands4/comments/1oeiv0v/say_what_you_will_but_mad_respect_for_moxsy/">everyone seems sad about it. </a></span></p> <p><span dir="auto" role="text">Sure, Gearbox advertised the Halloween update as a mini-event, but this feels more like a super-tiny event. I can’t wait for <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-randy-pitchford-gearbox-80-real-fan-post-1851782855">Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford’s 700-word tweet</a> about all of this that will likely drop within the next 48 hours.&nbsp;</span></p>

                <p>There are few unmade video games more famous than <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/silent-hills/" data-ref-id="5000-306236">Silent Hills</a> and its beloved Playable Trailer. Although P.T. is now very hard to find since Konami took it offline, an instructor in Japan is using it as a tool to teach students how to speak English.</p><p>Tsunan Secondary School in Niigata Prefecture <a href="https://tsunan-ss-edu.note.jp/n/n831cfb652bdc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">shared a blog entry</a> (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/japanese-secondary-school-students-learn-english-by-playing-hideo-kojimas-p-t-demo/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>) that demonstrated how an assistant language teacher utilized P.T. in class as a learning tool. Students were invited to play through P.T. in English, while other members of the class would get to weigh in on what the player should do next by using English phrases.</p><p>The blog noted that alarmingly loud ringing telephone from P.T. startled the fifth-year students, who are roughly the same age as high school sophomores. But this is one of the most novel ways to learn another language. It's impressive they have the game at all considering that the only easy way to play it is with PlayStation 4 consoles that downloaded it before P.T. was taken down.</p><p>Metal Gear Solid creator Hideo Kojima, director Guillermo del Toro, and actor Norman Reedus were lined up to collaborate on Silent Hills before Konami pulled the plug on the project. Kojima subsequently left the company and released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/death-stranding/" data-ref-id="5000-451575">Death Stranding</a>, which featured Reedus in a leading role and del Toro in a cameo appearance. The sequel, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/" data-ref-id="5000-577622">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a>, was released earlier this year.</p><p>Kojima is currently working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/od/" data-ref-id="5000-612205">OD</a>, an upcoming horror game with director Jordan Peele. One of the first trailers for OD appeared to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/od-trailer-seems-to-contain-silent-hills-reference/1100-6519914/" data-ref-id="1100-6519914">feature a Silent Hills callback</a>. A more recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojimas-od-gives-us-p-t-vibes-in-new-preview/1100-6534933/" data-ref-id="1100-6534933">OD teaser trailer</a> was also very reminiscent of P.T., and Kojima subsequently stated that he had to make sure that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojima-had-to-make-sure-that-od-wasnt-haunted-by-a-real-ghost/1100-6534991/" data-ref-id="1100-6534991">he hadn't captured a real ghost</a> while he was visiting locations for the game. OD doesn't currently have a release date, but it's being produced by Xbox Game Studio in conjunction with Kojima Productions. Actors Sophia Lillis, Hunter Schafer, and Udo Kier are lending their likenesses and voices to the game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Slot machines are, to put it lightly, just a tiny bit addictive. There’s that compulsion to go for just one more spin because that next one will <em>definitely</em> be the one to get you a jackpot. It’s almost devilish that Friedemann has taken the workings of a slot machine and wrapped a highly engrossing dungeon crawler around them. Slots &amp; Daggers mixes gambling with fighting monsters and attempting to overthrow an evil Lord. It is very entertaining.</p>
<p><iframe title="Slots &amp; Daggers Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jzvvhfs0VYY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The set up of Slots &amp; Daggers is simple. You are on a quest to overthrow the evil Lord Slother, but to do that you have to traverse through different places like swamps, sewers, and citadels. Luckily you can do that from the comfort of a seat at a table with a slot machine in front of you. You start your journey by picking three items to populate the rollers, with the initial offerings being a rusty sword and shield, but as you progress you will unlock better and more powerful items. Once you have picked the items, you begin the adventure.</p>


<p>The slot machine screen shows you the enemy you are facing, with their health and attack power also displayed. Below the screen are the slots, with a tray of coins to the left, for spending in the upgrade shop, and your health and shield bars to the right. Both you and enemies have melee and magic attacks to use, with magic being especially powerful as it bypasses shields altogether.</p>


<p>While the set up of Slots &amp; Daggers is simple, it is a game with a lot of depth to it. As you make your way through the game, you will be able to pick new weapons, skills, and power ups to take on stronger foes. There is a major tactical element to it too when deciding on which items to upgrade, add to your inventory, or even remove. You can pick as many items as you want, as long as you can afford them, but overloading the rollers with too many items can see you missing out on critical attacks or getting things you do not want. For example, if your shield is maxed out but you have a few shield items equipped, there is a big chance they will appear in a slot doing nothing when you would rather a weapon appear to attack. Some weapons and items have bonuses like dealing poison damage, or getting more powerful the more times they appear on screen.</p>
<p>You need to plan out what you think will get you through each enemy, but you cannot continuously rely on the same tactics as each enemy has their own tactics, strengths, and weaknesses to consider. The further you go, the stronger they get, so you need to be prepared. And in roguelite fashion, all your items, weapons and their upgrades are lost whenever you die.</p>

<p>Modifiers are available to unlock to help give you an advantage as permanent upgrades. These can be bought with the chips earned form defeating enemies, and&nbsp;I advise spending the earlier part of the game repeating levels to get chips quickly so you can boost things like critical chance, get a revive option, and lower prices in the upgrade store. Doing so will make the later runs against the stronger enemies much easier to deal with. It was only after a couple of attempts at the same level around the halfway mark that I settled on this approach, and it helped a lot. It is also nice to see enemies that once caused major issues fall within a couple of hits.</p>
<p>The presentation of Slots &amp; Daggers is really good. The enemies are quite simple in design but each has its own look, and the subtle changes in lighting as you move through levels is well done too. The coins falling into the tray to your left make a satisfying clinking sound as they fall, and the music is atmospheric too. The sounds and looks combined with the slot gameplay really make the time pass quickly as you try to beat the enemies.</p>

<p>It took around seven hours for me to overcome the main campaign, but there’s then an arena mode to tackle, which introduces enemies that are not present in the story. It is a good way to keep things going, and allows you to experiment with new ways to take on challenges while chasing a high score.</p>
<p>My one gripe with Slots &amp; Daggers would be the upgrade store, specifically the power ups that cost additional money to use in combat. I do get what the developer is trying to do by forcing a tactical decision like using one of your slots to get coins, but some of the prices did seem a bit steep to use the items. Fortunately, you can complete the campaign without using power ups that need additional in game currency to utilise.</p>

<p>This marks the first occasion that Mario has joined in on the celebrations, and his balloon will feature the character's iconic flying pose from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_mario_galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a>.

<p>Devin Pritchard, EVP of Revenue, Marketing &amp; Consumer Experience and soon to be President at Nintendo of America, said the following:</p><div><figure data-videoid="ws0BZJ-l_eg" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ws0BZJ-l_eg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ws0BZJ-l_eg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ws0BZJ-l_eg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed626890mvpngr&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

We are excited for Mario fans of all ages to see his new balloon’s Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade debut.”</p>

<p>To coincide with this, the Nintendo New York store will also feature festive decor and will feature "plenty of Nintendo-themed holiday magic". Bowser in a Santa costume, anyone?</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-battlefield-6-update-tweaks-custom-search-player-movement-and-progression-updates-still-to-come.1334107/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Now that Battlefield 6 has been out and in players' hands for a full two weeks at the time of this writing, EA and Battlefield Studios have begun updating, tweaking, and refining the experience to squash bugs and address player feedback. <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/battlefield-6-community-update-latest-changes-and-preparing-for-season-1">The latest update, which went live today in preparation for Season 1,</a> includes tweaks to the Custom Search queue option and a fix for a vehicle spawn bug.</p>



<p>What's more intriguing about the update is what's still to come, as Battlefield Studios lists changes and refinements to player movement and continued changes to player progression <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-clamping-down-battlefield-6-xp-farms-portal-increasing-xp-gained-in-matches/">that Battlefield Studios began implementing last week</a>.</p>



<p>"<em>We are actively refining player movement to address areas that previously felt inconsistent, while staying true to the gameplay pace and maintaining the core feel of the launch experience</em>," Battlefield Studios writes. "<em>In parallel, we are enhancing sight stability by minimizing reticle movement during specific animations. These adjustments aim to deliver a smoother and more precise aiming experience, all while preserving an immersive first-person feel.</em>"</p>



<p>Beyond player movement, the player progression changes and tweaks continue to be a point of issue for players, since a large chunk of the community was looking to custom servers in Portal <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-players-advantage-xp-farms-portal-ea-tries-to-stop-them/">to farm XP in bot-filled PvE matches</a>. </p>



<p>Battlefield Studios is "<em>continuing to monitor</em>" the changes it made and the conversations around player progression within the community, with a specific focus on XP received in Escalation and King of the Hill matches not properly registering for players, and how players feel about the challenges offered in daily and weekly challenges, and the challenges for classes and weapon unlocks. </p>



<p>"<em>We've seen all your feedback about the challenges and their criteria, the team's working on a series of improvements to make challenges more straightforward to understand and faster to complete. Given the scale of these challenges, these changes will roll out over at least two updates.</em>"</p>



<p>Hopefully EA and Battlefield Studios can find a better balance for player progression compared to the current state of it, specifically around how challenges work for unlocking weapons and attachments. It was <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/battlefield-6-battlefield-is-mostly-back/">an aspect I commented on in my Battlefield 6 review</a>, and would like to see improved sooner than later.</p>



<p>More updates to come include changes to weapon dispersion, which will arrive with Season 1 on October 28, and changes to visibility when it comes to exposure and brightness in matches.</p>



<p>Lastly, it's worth noting that Battlefield Studios comments on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-mode-details-testing-starts-this-week/">battle royale mode that it has been testing in Battlefield Labs</a>, with changes made to close-range time-to-kill, armor changes, world improvements and vehicle balances. Even if you're not a part of the Battlefield Labs playtesting, it's worth going over these changes since it seems extremely likely that the battle royale mode will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-mode-shadow-drop-next-week-rumour/">shadow-dropped into the game next week on October 28.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Is there a disturbance in the force when it comes to <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>‘s week-one sales? Will Steam Deck compatibility help aid the Switch 2 on its road to becoming a handheld port machine? And why are <em>Sims 4</em> creators abandoning EA’s official affiliate program? It’s another edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture.</p> <p>People <a href="https://x.com/SuperSavajin/status/1981324284493443583">are once again</a> debating whether Nintendo should bring back Virtual Console instead of forcing fans to rent all of its games in perpetuity. While it’s true that people had been wanting Nintendo to do a low-cost Netflix-like retro service for a while, much of that was due to constantly needing to <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-virtual-console-switch-online-classic-retro-1851760770">re-purchase the games across non-backwards-compatible devices</a>. With the Switch 2, that’s no longer an issue. Personally, I’d prefer to just buy the original <em>Luigi’s Mansion</em> again instead of pay $50 a year to play it.</p>

 <h2><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> is selling less than other recent games in the series</h2> <p>The Pokémon Company announced the latest entry sold 5.8 million copies in its first week, split roughly evenly between Switch and Switch 2. Sounds impressive, but it’s slightly behind other recent Pokémon games:</p> <ul> <li><em><strong>Pokémon Sword</strong></em><strong> and </strong><em><strong>Shield</strong></em>: 6 million copies in its first three days</li> <li><strong><em>Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl</em></strong>: 6 million copies in its first week</li> <li><em><strong>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</strong>: </em>6.5 million copies in its first week</li> <li><em><strong>Pokémon Scarlet </strong></em><strong>and </strong><em><strong>Violet</strong>: </em>10 million copies in its first three days</li> </ul> <p>That’s a little surprising given the hype around a new console launch and the fact that it’s been three years since fans received a mainline Pokémon game. Are those viral videos about the bad graphics and how lifeless Lumiose City looks putting a damper on things? Are some fans aging out all these years later?

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a> <span>is secretly </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-npc-dialogue-funny-moments-lines-2000638295"><span>one of the funniest games of the year</span></a><span>, as I was reminded last night when I experienced something that was as annoying as it was hilarious.. I’ve finished the main story, and so I’ve been chipping away at all the remaining side quests, filling up my Pokedex, and trying to get everything in a place where I’m okay with putting the game down until the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-raichu-evolution-x-y-paid-dlc-2000625371"><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC</span></a><span>. So I’m spending most of my time chatting up citizens, battling wild Pokémon, and checking off research assignments without a care in the world. But last night, something happened that now has me putting my guard up. I was trapped in a conversation with a child about their special interest, and it was one of the funniest scenes I’ve encountered in the game.</span></p> <p><span>In Lumiose City’s Rouge Sector, you’ll find a school called Académie Étoile. There are a few quests here, including one really cute one where you teach a group of curious kids about </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-evolution-list-new-all-switch-2000621380"><span>Mega Evolution</span></a><span>, but there’s one student who’s just hanging out in a corner by herself. This nameless child’s speech bubble exclaims, “I’ve memorized a bunch of people’s names!” As someone who has become terrible with names in his 30s, that’s impressive to me. If someone doesn’t have a name tag on, I </span><i><span>will</span></i><span> forget what they’re called when they tell me. That happens with anyone, and it’s nothing personal. I used to have a mind like a steel trap, and then everything started sliding right out of my skull once I got old enough to rent a car. So I talk to this kid, and she tells me she has a “super amazing memory” and can remember every name she’s ever seen, even if she only saw it once.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>She asks if I want her to show me, and I’m like, “Hell yeah, queen. Pop off!” because who wants to shoot down a child telling you about something they’re excited about? Then she asks me again if I’m sure because it’ll take her about six minutes to rattle off every Bob, Jan, and Jimbo she’s ever known. I fully expected the game to make me skip through a bunch of text boxes before we were interrupted by a teacher or parent who had been looking for this girl, but no, </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>did something even funnier: it started playing the game’s credits and would not let me skip or opt out of them.&nbsp;</span></p>   <p><span>For six minutes, I watched the credits roll a second time, and just laughed at how good of a fucking bit this is. Anyone who’s interacted with children knows they love to talk your ear off about whatever they’re hyperfixating on. If you don’t know anything about it, you just gotta kinda smile, nod, and say “oh, wow!” now and then so they know it’s okay to be excited about things. Game Freak emulating this by making you watch the credits is such an efficient gag that I couldn’t help but giggle at the mess I’d gotten myself into. The kid told me exactly what she was going to do, and for some reason, it didn’t occur to me that she might actually deliver. Hopefully, she gets a job in comms because never forgetting a face or a name is an invaluable skill in that field.</span></p>

<p>The developers of Steal A Brainrot, a popular game within Roblox, are suing the developer of a copycat game in Fortnite called “Stealing Brainrots”..</p>



<p>According to the complaint, which was first reported on by <a href="https://aftermath.site/brainrot-roblox-court" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nicole Carpenter at Aftermath</a>, Spyder Games and Speedy Simulator Gaming are suing Thomas Van Der Voort for copyright infringement. They say that Van Der Voort’s game, which was released two months after theres, within the Fortnite Island Creator Program <strong>“copies the Game’s [Steal A Brainrot] protectable expressions, including user interface elements, in-game objects, artwork, level design, animations, design aesthetics, game pieces, and the selection and coordination of game elements, colors, and shapes.”</strong></p>



<p>They <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/937410050/Brainrot-Goes-To-Court#content=query:defendant,pageNum:2,indexOnPage:0,bestMatch:false" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">continue to say</a> that similarities in Van Der Voort’s game are “not merely the result of the games existing in the same genre or dictated by function”. It’s alleged that he “made conscious decisions” to copy the choices of Steal A Brainrot, which, within the Fortnite Creator Program, can earn the developers money. </p>



<p>In a statement given to Aftermath, attorney Adam Starr, who represents Spyder Games and Speedy Simulator Gaming, says that his parties are doing this to protect their work, which they acquired a copyright for in August.</p>



<p>“We always prefer to resolve these matters cooperatively, but when necessary we will take appropriate legal steps to safeguard our IP,” he said.</p>



<p>The suing parties are requesting a jury trial for the claims presented. They are looking to see the infringing game taken down while also receiving damages and profits that can be attributed to the game.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Does Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Have Early Access?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-early-access/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/does-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-have-early-access.1334086/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>We’re getting toward the end of the year, which means it’s time for a new Call of Duty game. Black Ops 7 follows BLOPS 6, and if you want to get your boots off the ground quicker than most, early access is the perfect fuel to do so—we’re checking if Black Ops 7 has it for you.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> was having a fairly tumultuous build-up toward launch. Battlefield 6 was the shooter on everyone’s lips, and Black Ops 7 possibly felt too similar to its predecessor for some. It all changed in the blink of an eye when Activision declared <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-will-have-non-disbanding-lobbies-at-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7 was getting rid of skill-based matchmaking</a>.</p>



<p>Black Ops 7 is now back on the menu for many, so let’s check if there’s any possibility of early access.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-black-ops-7-early-access">Can You Play Black Ops 7 Early Access?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Judgment day is near. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There is no Black Ops 7 early access, meaning it doesn’t matter which edition you buy, all of them will give you access to Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 at the same time—release day.</strong></p>



<p>One thing we can definitely say is the same as Black Ops 6 is the decision not to give Black Ops 7 players early access. You have to be patient and pass the time until launch. As usual, there is a super-duper edition (Vault Edition) offering a Season Pass, as well as the usual benefits, such as packs and items for CoD Zombies.</p>



<p>The good thing is that no one can gain an advantage before November 14. Once Black Ops 7 is out, everyone is near-enough on a level playing field and can upgrade weapons, earn attachments, and do everything in between at the same starting point.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-there-any-way-to-play-black-ops-7-early">Is There Any Way To Play Black Ops 7 Early?</h2>



<p><strong>No, the only way you could’ve played Black Ops 7 slightly earlier than anyone else was by pre-ordering the game to give yourself an exclusive early access beta window.</strong></p>



<p>If you didn’t know, Black Ops 7’s beta has come and passed. If you pre-ordered BLOPS 7, you were guaranteed a code to play the early access Black Ops 7 beta. That’s it, though, just the beta.</p>



<p>The beta window has closed, as has any chance to play Black Ops 7 before launch. We’ve seen other titles spontaneously announced impromptu betas—like ARC Raifers did—so we can’t theoretically rule out one more chance to play early. If this doesn’t happen, we’ll see you in a persistent Black Ops 7 lobby!</p>



<p>If you did play the Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 beta, let us know if you enjoyed it. Can the removal of disbanding lobbies and a lack of SBMM make this one of the best CoDs ever? Leave your thoughts through the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1416770944961220720/1416780218936463463" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming Discord</a> and the comments section below.</p>

So we’re left with regional data from sales analysts, who are unable to confirm hard sales figures but can compare launch performance in percentage difference terms.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m3wthi4twc2u" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Circana’s Mat Piscatella took to social media</a> to reveal the data underpinning the commercial performance of Sucker Punch’s sequel, calling its launch “perfectly fine...

That is, in terms of the revenue it has generated, as opposed to unit sales. Ghost of Yotei launch week unit sales in the U.S. were down by a mid-single digit percent versus Ghost of Tsushima — so yes, it sold slightly less — but dollar sales were up by a similar mid-single digit percent, Piscatella confirmed. The average price per unit was about 12% higher for Ghost of Yotei than Ghost of Tsuhima’s launch week. “So... effectively flat,” Piscatella said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Piscatella pointed out, there is an important context we need to understand when making the comparison. “Everyone was home in July of 2020, and gaming saw a significant boom in player count and engagement,” he said. “At the time, the PS4's installed base was about 20% higher than the PS5's is today.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I look at it and say... it did somewhere between fine and great given all the factors at play,” Piscatella continued. “But it's early.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The true test now for Ghost of Yotei in terms of commercial performance will be in how well it holds in the coming weeks and months. And we of course do not know what Sony’s internal targets are for the title. It may be underperforming, doing fine, or overperforming versus Sony expectations. Ghost of Tsushima ended up a hugely successful release, with over 13 million sold as of September 2024, so Ghost of Yotei has plenty of work to do.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“In any case, in the U.S. it was a perfectly fine launch,” Piscatella concluded. “Not amazing, not bad.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a similar situation in Europe, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sales-of-ps5-exclusive-ghost-of-yotei-in-line-with-ghost-of-tsushima-in-europe-new-data-reveals">where Ghost of Yotei sales are in-line with Ghost of Tsushima’s</a>. <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/ghost-of-yotei-delivers-strong-opening" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Game Business</a> noted that Ghost of Yotei is the biggest first-party PlayStation launch since Spider-Man 2 in October 2023.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/">Battlefield 6</a> has posted some impressive numbers since launch, but right now, it looks like the game has some competition. While Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 won't be out until next month, indie eggs-traction shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/escape-from-duckov/">Escape From Duckov</a> is busy climbing the charts on Steam. For a brief time, the viral indie game had 152,207 concurrent players, beating Battlefield 6 during that time period with its concurrent-player count of 129,729 players.</p><p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/indie-shooter-escape-from-duckov-overtakes-battlefield-6-on-steam-3273511/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dexerto</a>, Escape From Duckov outshone Battlefield 6 during that period before the current Steam status quo reasserted itself. The game has proven to be a big hit with players since launch, and what makes the achievement even more impressive is that the duck-themed parody of Escape From Tarkov is the product of the five-person team known as Team Soda. At the time of writing, Escape From Duckov has peaked at <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3167020/charts/" rel="nofollow ">257,952 concurrent players on Steam</a>.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Battlefield 6 Essential Starter Guide</p>
      </div>
<p>Battlefield Studios made the battle royale game available to testers in the Battlefield Labs program, and now the studio is addressing feedback. The updates include an adjustment to time-to-kill values at close range, along with armor changes (everyone can hold two armor plates now), bug fixes and lighting improvements, and vehicle-balance changes. Here is a rundown, as written by the developer:</p><ul><li><strong>Close-range TTK:</strong> We’ve adjusted time-to-kill at close range for all weapons to reward clean positioning and tracking while giving players more time to counter attacks. We’ll keep monitoring this once it’s live.</li><li><strong>Armor Changes:</strong> Everyone will now have the capacity for 2 armor plates at the start of the game. All players will spawn with 1 plate, so you will have the chance to upgrade as soon as you start looting, giving everyone an equal chance at upgrading their armor fully.</li><li><strong>World Improvements:</strong> We’ve been fixing pesky world bugs and optimizing areas to improve the environment. With these improvements, we made adjustments to the lighting as well as enhancing the visibility across the map.</li><li><strong>Vehicle Balance:</strong> We’ve adjusted the balance for helicopters and combat vehicles to keep them as powerful tools showing off Battlefield’s core DNA, without making them necessary to survive or win the late game. This includes significant adjustments to the heli countermeasures and ammo economy.</li></ul><p>Beyond all of this, Battlefield Studios said it has been working to unlock "smoother performance overall" for the battle royale game. "We have identified and addressed a range of issues that affected performance that we simply couldn't have done without our players' involvement in the tests," the developer said.</p><p>Battlefield Studios has confirmed it's working on a battle royale mode for Battlefield 6 but has not shared much in the way of specifics about it yet, including whether it will be free or paid. Footage of the game has leaked out of the Battlefield Labs tests, however, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-battle-royale-gameplay-footage-leaks/1100-6534689/" data-ref-id="1100-6534689">showing off a first look at gameplay.</a></p><p>Battlefield 6 got off to a great start earlier this month, selling 7 million copies out of the gate for the "biggest opening" ever for the FPS series. The game is set to grow with the debut of Season 1 on October 28, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-season-1-release-date-and-free-content-revealed/1100-6535112/" data-ref-id="1100-6535112">adds new maps and modes</a>, along with battle royale, if the reports are true.</p>

                <p>While <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hades-2-review-witching-hours/1900-6418231/" data-ref-id="1900-6418231">Hades 2</a> fans finally can take their journey through the Underworld on the go on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hades-2-release-times-revealed-for-switch-2-and-pc/1100-6534925/" data-ref-id="1100-6534925">Nintendo Switch and Switch 2</a>, the battle continues on PC with the release of the first Post-Launch Patch 1 Preview for the game. <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1145350/announcements/detail/505090299391902120" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Supergiant Games said it is grateful for all the community feedback</a> since the v1 Launch, and those reports have directly inspired a host of new enhancements, most notably to the narrative's True Ending. This preview is now available to brave players who want to jump in early, offering a significant update to Boons, foes, and getting to the heart of Melinoe's quest.</p><p>In Hades 2, players step into the role of Melinoe, the sister of the first game's protagonist, Zagreus, on a quest to defeat the titan Chronos, who has overthrown her family's domain. Melinoe's journey is guided by her mentor, Hecate, and supported by a cast of new and returning gods. While the game maintains the same fast-paced action of its predecessor, it introduces a key mechanical shift: Melinoe is less reliant on dashing and more on a new sprint ability, which can be upgraded with boons and even used offensively to encourage a fresh approach to combat. You can check out GameSpot's review here, where we gave it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hades-2-review-witching-hours/1900-6418231/" data-ref-id="1900-6418231">a perfect 10/10 score</a>.</p><p>The most significant changes in this preview focus on the game's late-stage narrative, with major enhancements to the True Ending. This includes new events both leading up to and following the ending, increasing the number of Underworld clears required, and revising key True Ending scenes. To help players revisit these moments, a new Cauldron Incantation has been added that lets you return to an earlier point in the story. Beyond the story, players will see a general balance pass to various Boons, Aspects, and Daedalus Hammer Upgrades, along with a Crossroads Renewal that reduces the Kudos cost of many decorative items, refunding any excess Kudos you've already spent.</p><h4>True Ending &amp; Narrative Enhancements:</h4><ul><li>Added new events in the lead-up to and after the True Ending.</li><li>Increased the number of Underworld clears required to achieve the True Ending.</li><li>Added to and revised parts of the main True Ending scenes before the end credits. (Note: Changes are primarily to the Underworld route; the Surface route is largely unchanged.)</li><li>Art and dialog have been updated with new artwork, animations, and voice lines for characters such as Chronos, Zagreus, Hecate, and Hades, to support these new events.</li><li>Returning to a Real Possibility: A new Cauldron Incantation lets you return to an earlier point in the story so you can re-experience the True Ending.</li><li>Fated Prophecy Adjustments: Some character-related Prophecies, including the story epilogue one, should now unfold faster than before.</li><li>Fated List of Minor Prophecies: Priority of key events increased for: Melinoe, Help Us, Silk and Spitefulness, and Voice and Vanity. Born to Win is revealed sooner, and the requirements for Denier of Suitors are reduced.</li></ul><h4>Combat and Balance Changes:</h4><ul><li>Witch's Staff (Circe): Smolder Ring (Hestia) now also applies Scorch from the bonus Cast when your Casts overlap.</li><li>Boons and Blessings: Increases to damage/effectiveness for: Anvil Ring (Hephaestus), Controlled Burn (Hestia), Sword Ring (Ares), Carnal Pleasure (Ares x Aphrodite), Shadow Pounce (Artemis), Life Tax (Hades), Last Gasp (Hades), and Fight Fight Fight (Echo).</li><li>Ares: Increased Plasma pickup range.</li><li>Success Rate (Hermes): Now affects Nurture of Hera (Selene x Hera).</li><li>Gigaros Dash (Hades): No longer staggers foes when dealing direct damage.</li><li>Life Tax (Hades): Restorative effect is no longer reduced by Vow of Scars (Oath).</li><li>Daedalus Hammer Upgrades:</li><li>Increased damage for Elephant Rockets (Coat - Shiva) and Chakra Collider (Coat - Shiva).</li></ul><h4>Foes &amp; Dangers:</h4><ul><li>Adjusted hitboxes for Unrivaled Prometheus (Heracles attacks) and Headmistress Hecate (flame attacks).</li><li>Phantom (Fields): Reduced effectiveness and removed the Life-drain effect from some attacks.</li></ul><h4>Crossroads &amp; Economy:</h4><ul><li>Crossroads Renewal: Many decorative items have reduced costs in Kudos. Excess Kudos already spent will be refunded.</li><li>Added Primordial Chaos theme to the Music Maker.</li><li>Crossroads Cauldron: Disintegration of Monstrosity--you are no longer required to cast this as soon as you can afford to.</li><li>Greatest Gift of Gaia: Reduced requirements for this to be revealed.</li><li>Keepsakes: Jeweled Pom (Hades &amp; Persephone)--bonus Hades blessing is no longer kept if you are not at the Fates' Whim; fixed an issue preventing it from granting Last Gasp (Hades).</li><li>Well of Charon: Yarn of Ariadne: Now also raises the chance of finding Duo Boons.</li><li>Mist Veil: Now restores Magick lost for any reason</li></ul><h4>Miscellaneous, bug fixes, and quality of life:</h4><ul><li>Special Encounters: Added a preview icon for Location exits leading to an Infernal Contract (after the True Ending), Nemesis can only show up once per night while battling through the Underworld, and Circe appears slightly more often.</li><li>Settings (New Options): Danger Pulse: New toggle to switch off the persistent flashing at critical Life levels. FPS Limit: New option to limit max fps while VSync is off.</li><li>Bug Fixes: Numerous fixes, including those for Argent Skull not firing reliably, various Boon and Keepsake interactions (e.g., Calling Card and Time Piece), collision issues, and visual/audio errors.</li></ul>

<p>"Anyone," she said. "I love that universe. I'm ready. Anytime."</p><p>Her love for the series runs deep. She's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-actor-jennifer-hale-says-the-tv-show-would-be-genius-to-do-this-one-thing/1100-6528707/" data-ref-id="1100-6528707">expressed support for the TV series</a> that's in the works, saying she'd love to appear in it in some capacity. She's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_JJLuJrPAg" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed some of her favorite lines from the games</a>, including a hilariously silly line from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mass-effect-2/" data-ref-id="5000-34111">Mass Effect 2</a>. She's even said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effects-original-cast-should-return-for-the-tv-series-shepard-voice-actor-jennifer-hale-says" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the original cast should return for the TV series</a>, but would welcome whatever BioWare ultimately decides to do. Hale holds a lot of adoration for both Mass Effect and FemShep, and as such, is calling on fans to let the Canadian developer know that they want her back.</p><p>"Everyone out there, the more you tell them what you want, maybe the likelier it is that it'll happen," she said.</p><p>Of course, it's all in BioWare's hands. Franchise veterans are working on the next Mass Effect game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-5s-development-team-is-made-up-of-veterans-bioware-reminds-fans/1100-6522139/" data-ref-id="1100-6522139">according to BioWare</a>, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-mass-effect-game-may-not-release-until-2029-report/1100-6519052/" data-ref-id="1100-6519052">reports suggest that it may not come out until 2029</a>. I guess that's a good thing, considering that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-5-wont-have-stylized-dragon-age-graphics-but-it-will-have-mature-tones/1100-6527443/" data-ref-id="1100-6527443">Mass Effect 5 will have a mature tone and less stylized graphics</a> than, say, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dragon-age-the-veilguard/" data-ref-id="5000-490222">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>.</p><p>It's worth mentioning that BioWare is a subsidiary of EA, which was recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-goes-private-in-55-billion-deal-from-saudi-arabia-jared-kushners-company-and-others/1100-6535078/" data-ref-id="1100-6535078">purchased by a consortium including Saudi Arabia and Donald Trump's son-in-law</a> for $55 billion. Following this sale, which is one of the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ea-electronic-arts-video-game-silver-lake-pif-d17dc7dd3412a990d2c0a6758aaa6900" rel="nofollow ">largest-ever private equity buyouts for any industry of all time</a>, there are concerns that BioWare could see some cuts under its new ownership, according to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bioware-staff-worried-about-studios-future/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming</a>.</p>
