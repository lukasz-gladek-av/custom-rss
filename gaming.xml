            <p>A lawsuit between Sony and a fired Bungie director is getting messy. Sony have revealed the text messages sent by the former director, which they say are proof of his "predatory behaviour" and justify their decision to dismiss him. Christopher Barrett was removed from his position last year <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-replace-marathon-director-amid-reports-of-creative-leadership-shake-up">in a dramatic reshuffle</a> and it was later revealed that the reasons included <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-reportedly-fired-marathon-reboot-director-chris-barrett-for-unwanted-and-inappropriate-messages-to-female-staff">alleged "inappropriate" and "unwanted" messages</a> to female staff at the studio. In response to the allegations, Barrett sued Bungie and parent company Sony for breach of contract and defamation, claiming that the investigation that led to his dismissal was a "sham". The real reason for his firing, he says, was to stop a big bonus payout of over $45 million. </p>
<p>But lo, the Streisand effect has been initiated. His lawsuit has invited Sony to roll up their sleeves and dip their arms into their big gritty bag of exhibits. Examples of the texts he allegedly sent to employees have been revealed in a court filing.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/830250465/Christopher-Barrett-v-Sony-Interactive-Entertainment-LLC-and-Bungie-Inc-2024-1285-No-97653544-97653546-Del-Ch-Feb-12-2025-1">128-page legal document</a> is basically a line-by-line response to all the claims Barrett is making in his lawsuit against his former company. It was first reported by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/sony-bungie-christopher-barrett-lawsuit-response">Stephen Totilo of Game File</a>, who's been following the case <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/christopher-barrett-sony-bungie-lawsuit-marathon">since the lawsuit began</a>. In the document Sony first repeat their claims against Barrett, citing the original investigation they did into his conduct.</p>
<blockquote>"The investigation revealed that Barrett's misconduct with each employee was consistent: he targeted a lower-level, female employee he wasn't working with directly, initially engaged in friendly conversation, and progressively pushed boundaries with the employee by making subtle references to her physical appearance or expressing his interest in her romantically. Barrett attempted to create an unprofessional level of intimacy with his victims. He requested to follow personal Instagram accounts and would express anger to the women if they failed to respond to his messages. He would bring up inappropriate topics like their body, their relationships, his marriage, or his desire to date them. He would demand that they participate in sexually charged games of "Truth or Dare" and "Ask Me Anything." He texted them at all hours of the day and night. He offered to buy them gifts. He often referenced his wealth and his ability to advance their careers.</blockquote>
<p>Sony then goes on to include specific examples of the texts Barrett allegedly sent to female employees, as well as behaviour they say he engaged in, such as calling female employees while drunk to ask who they were dating. Here's some of what's included in the document:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Barrett asked VICTIM 1 to play "Truth or Dare" over text message and inquired, "what do you think is your best and worst feature physically[?]" He later told her in a text message that she was "hot".</li>
<li>Despite VICTIM 1's explicit request in writing for Barrett to recognize "boundaries," he called her late at night while drunk and after keeping her on a FaceTime call for hours, moved down a dark hallway to his bedroom and suggestively told her, "I can't believe I am lying in bed talking to [VICTIM 1]." She abruptly hung up.</li>
<li>Barrett sent VICTIM 2 Instagram direct messages stating, "You are the holy grail. I hope you find a person worthy of your attention" and qualified it with, "I'm not hitting on you. I hope it doesn't feel like that. I'm married. But I can be honest. You are the .000001 and better be treated like that forever." When VICTIM 2 responded that her boyfriend treats her very well, Barrett responded, "He better[.] Cuz i would hit on you if he wasn't."</li>
<li>Barrett also sent VICTIM 2 an Instagram direct message asking, "You want to be worshipped, I think? Why are you against that actually happening?" And a few days later messaged VICTIM 2, "[w]hat are the steps one would have to take [to date you?] What's the strategy guide[?]"</li>
<li>Barrett similarly told VICTIM 3, "I hope [your boyfriend] doesn't mind I text you a lot" and "I just worry. Like I really enjoy texting you and talking. I don't want him to get the right idea." Later in the conversation, when VICTIM 3 told Barrett she was busy, Barrett stated, "I want your attention, so annoying."</li>
<li>In another Microsoft Teams exchange, Barrett asked VICTIM 4, "Are you still in PJ s?" and "[i]s it like a button down top and bottoms? Sweat pants? Lululemons?".</li>
<li>Just three weeks into VICTIM 5's tenure at Bungie, Barrett called her late in the evening, while drunk, and told her intimate details about his personal life and asked her about who she was dating and what her "type" was. He sent her a personal Instagram follow request to connect that night, which she did not accept.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Sony goes on to say that many of the women involved eventually reported these incidents to Human Resources, but were nonetheless afraid for their positions. </p>
<p>"Barrett's predatory behavior caused victims to seek guidance from other Bungie employees on how to manage Barrett's constant boundary-pushing given that he was a long-standing, senior member of the company," they say.

</p><p>"Some victims did tell Barrett to stop. But even in cases where he initially feigned compliance, Barrett promptly picked back up again with his disturbing behavior in his next communication."</p>
<p>All this essentially means that Sony is sticking to their decision to fire Barrett for reasons of "gross misconduct and gross negligence", which would cover them as terminating his employment "for Cause". </p>
<p>This is the part that Barrett disputes. He claims that he has been "scapegoat[ed]," "falsely" accused, and "defame[d]" all because Sony don't want to pay out a big bonus he says he is entitled to - a multi-million-dollar payout he is reportedly owed thanks to Sony's purchase of Bungie in 2022.</p>
<p>"Sony continues to disingenuously cherry pick text messages and alleged conversations," said Barrett's legal team in a message to Totilo at Game File. "[They] make unsupported and conclusory statements to defame Christopher and justify terminating him to avoid paying him what he was owed under his employment agreements. It is telling that Sony does not include the full text messages as exhibits, or the full content of these conversations, and nothing in Sony’s response provides a legitimate legal or factual basis to terminate Christopher for cause."</p>
<p>Barrett's lawyers argue that the company did not have cause to fire him, as he did not "engage in any financial improprieties" or "have or solicit any improper sexual relationships with his colleagues."</p>
<p>Sony calls this line of argument "outrageous considering the evidence".</p>
<p>"Hundreds of Barrett's own written statements and the direct testimony of his many victims will demonstrate his termination for Cause was justified and this lawsuit is meritless," they say in the document.</p>
<p>It is hard to know how legal cases such as this will shake out. Totilo notes the "aggressive" tactics of both parties, and comments that many cases involving such sums of money are eventually settled. </p>
<p>Bungie has been in the spotlight over such issues before. In 2021 they were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-ceo-apologises-after-damning-report-about-toxic-studio-culture">accused of a "toxic" studio culture</a> in which women and others did not feel safe or valued. A senior leader at the company called one woman "an unmanageable bitch", for example. Another senior leader allegedly made frequent racist remarks. The CEO of the company, Pete Parsons, apologised and promised changes to the studio, saying it was "clear we still have work ahead of us".</p>
<p>In related news, the studio has recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-seek-to-reassure-everyone-that-marathon-is-still-alive-by-saying-almost-nothing-about-it">sought to reassure fans</a> that their next game, an extraction shooter reboot of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a>, is still in production with new director Joe Ziegler having replaced Barrett. Though there hasn't been much news about the game since its reveal, and the studio has <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-layoffs-couldnt-be-avoided-even-if-destiny-2-the-final-shape-had-blockbuster-performance-says-report">since suffered from recent layoffs</a>. </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/twitch-cheating-low-severity-violation/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/twitch-thinks-cheating-in-games-is-a-%E2%80%98low-severity-violation%E2%80%99.1115289/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/twitch-cheating-low-severity-violation/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Twitch recently posted an update to its terms of service, outlining changes to the platform’s enforcement system. In this update, it was confirmed that violations will now ‘expire’, and the less severe the violation, the faster it’ll disappear from your account history. The most abhorrent violations will remain on your account for up to two years.</p>



<p>However, the policy update penned by Twitch Support also confirmed that the platform believes cheating in video games is an example of a ‘low severity violation’. As such, it will remove any trace of these incidents from your record, if you’ve faced punitive action, in as little as 90 days.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-getting-away-with-it">Getting Away With It</h2>



<p>Twitch’s <a href="https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/An-Update-to-our-Enforcement-System?language=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">enforcement update</a> came with a graphic that shows how things work on the platform.</p>



<p>Every account starts in ‘good standing’ with zero violations. If you’re caught cheating in a game, you’ll get a <strong>one-day </strong>suspension and the record will be marked against your account for 90 days. If you’re caught cheating <strong>again</strong>, you’ll get a <strong>three-day </strong>suspension and that 90-day threshold will reset and be pushed further out.</p>



<p>Following that 90-day window, you’ll be returned to ‘good standing’.</p>



<p>That means that you can be caught cheating multiple times, and as long as you serve your suspension, you’ll only have to wait three months before Twitch views you as a model citizen once again.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Is this justice?</figcaption></figure>







<p>Cheating is one of the most disruptive acts in modern gaming – and it has been a growing issue for years. Some games are borderline unplayable at times because of cheaters ruining everyone’s fun, and publishers and developers have taken ‘cheat makers’ to court and sought out damages in the tens of millions of dollars.</p>



<p>And many have been successful in their pursuits of justice.</p>



<p>In South Korea and China, you can face a fine or even jail time for manufacturing or using cheats in a game – but Twitch is banned in China and around a year ago, the company withdrew from South Korea.</p>



<p>As a lover of all things multiplayer, I find it bizarre that you can publicly cheat in a game on Twitch and a) face just a one-day suspension, and b) have your record scrubbed in 90 days.</p>



<p>What about those cheating in professional tournaments to win cash prizes? Should that just face a one-day suspension?</p>



<p>At the least, you’re standing firm as a testament to the slacking policies of the platform, but in the worst-case scenario, you’re letting others know where and how to cheat in popular multiplayer games. Many cheaters will use their streams to actively promote the sale of cheats, with some dastardly operators securing referral bonuses for pointing malicious gamers to cheating sites.</p>



<p>Do you think Twitch should come down harder on those caught cheating in games? Let us know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

R. Martin has issued the strongest tease yet that an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a> movie may come to pass, but has acknowledged a significant blocker to his potential involvement with it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Game of Thrones creator famously dreamed up the world and history of FromSoftware’s Elden Ring, which went on to become one of the best-selling games of 2022. FromSoftware and publisher Bandai Namco leaned heavily on Martin’s involvement in promotional material, and the game credits begin by saying the Elden Ring world was created by FromSoftware chief Hidetaki Miyazaki and George R. R. Martin.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, would George R. R. Martin be interested in coming back for a sequel to Elden Ring, if he’s asked? That’s the question IGN put to the man himself as part of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/events/fanfest">IGN Fan Fest 2025</a>. In his response, Martin sidestepped Elden Ring 2, but did drop a big hint that an Elden Ring movie could be in the works.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Well, I can't say too much about it, but there is some talk about making a movie out of Elden Ring,” Martin said.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/21/gettyimages-1472023146-1740134288274.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">George R. R. Martin has hinted that an Elden Ring movie may be in the works.

And indeed, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hidetaka-miyazaki-open-to-elden-ring-movie-if-a-very-strong-partner-were-to-step-in">FromSoftware president Hidetaka Miyazaki has said he’d be open to an adaptation of Elden Ring</a>, but only if a “very strong partner” were to come into play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I don’t see any reason to deny another interpretation or adaptation of Elden Ring, a movie for example,” explained Miyazaki in an interview with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/article/2024/jun/26/pushing-buttons-meeting-hidetaka-miyazaki" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>The Guardian</u></a>. “But I don’t think myself, or FromSoftware, have the knowledge or ability to produce something in a different medium.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So that’s where a very strong partner would come into play,” continued Miyazaki. “We’d have to build a lot of trust and agreement on whatever it is we’re trying to achieve, but there’s interest, for sure.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, speaking to IGN, George R. R. Martin acknowledged that there may be a significant blocker to any heavy involvement he may have with the Elden Ring movie: he’s still working on The Winds of Winter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We'll see if that [the Elden Ring movie] comes to pass and what the extent of my involvement was, I don't know,” he said. “I'm a few years behind with my latest book, so that also limits the amount of things that I can do.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans of George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire fantasy novels have long, long, <em>long, </em>awaited the planned sixth entry in the series, The Winds of Winter. But after more than a decade of delays, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/george-r-r-martin-isnt-sure-hell-ever-finish-the-winds-of-winter-but-its-still-a-priority">even Martin is acknowledging the possibility that it may never come to be</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In December, Martin said: “Unfortunately, I am 13 years late. Every time I say that, I’m [like], ‘How could I be 13 years late?’ I don’t know, it happens a day at a time.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But that’s still a priority," he continued. "A lot of people are already writing obituaries for me. [They’re saying] ‘Oh, he’ll never be finished.’ Maybe they’re right. I don’t know. I’m alive right now! I seem pretty vital!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's only the latest in what's been an increasingly bleak wait for The Winds of Winter, with the most recent entry in the series, A Dance With Dragons, publishing in 2011. That's the same year that HBO premiered the insanely popular TV series Game of Thrones, which is based on the A Song of Ice and Fire series and drew <em>a lot</em> more eyes to the world of Westeros.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Elden Ring, Martin explained his work on the game, telling IGN how he helped FromSoftware on worldbuilding.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“... when they came to me, FromSoftware, they wanted the world. They knew the action of Elden Ring that the players would get into would be in the ‘present.’ But something had created that present, had created that world. So where did that world come from? And I've done a lot of world building, most notably on Westeros and the backgrounds of A Song of Ice and Fire and Game of Thrones. And I like doing world building. So what had happened 5,000, 10,000 years before the current day action in Elden Ring that led them to that place? And I had some ideas about the magic and the runes. There was a lot about runes. And I worked it all out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It was interesting that the team flew in and we had a number of sessions and they would fly back and do their magic, and then they would come back here a couple months later and show me what they had, which was always amazing to see what they came up with.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Was everything Martin wrote used in the game, or is there more material that could be used in future installments?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yeah, I think especially when you're world building, there's always more that you actually see on the screen,” Martin replied.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And that's true of any of these big epic fantasies. I mean, you look at Tolkien and there are hundreds of pages of past history before you get to even the era of the Hobbit and dozens of kings and wars and things like that.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Amanda Edwards/WireImage.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>
Cosy Hobbit life sim Tales of the Shire: A Lord of the Rings Game has been delayed once again, this time until 29th July.
</p>
<p>
It's the second hold-up for the game after an earlier delay announced last year. Back in September 2024, developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cosy-hobbit-life-sim-tales-of-the-shire-delayed">Wētā Workshop said it expected the game to arrive in early 2025</a>. Now, there's another five months to wait.
</p>
<p>
A statement <a href="https://x.com/talesoftheshire/status/1892635375165731165">published today on the game's social media account</a> does not go into detail on why the game has been postponed once again, other than to say that Wētā Workshop wanted to ensure "every Hobbit, on every platform, can enjoy the same cosy experience".

<p>
It seems possible that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a>'s recent sale of Private Division, Tales of the Shire's original publisher, may have had some impact on the game's progress. But some Lord of the Rings fans have also raised questions about the game's quality level, based on previous trailers.
</p>
<p>
"We want this game to feel like a warm hug from Middle-earth," today's statement notes, "and we are making sure that no matter where you play, you'll feel right at home in The Shire. From foot-hair styles to the fluffiest cakes, every detail will be just right."
</p>
<p>
It's been reported that Tales of the Shire, alongside other Private Division games such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kerbal-space-program-2">Kerbal Space Program 2</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-annapurna-interactive-staff-reportedly-taking-over-private-division-portfolio-following-take-two-sale">will now be aided by staff members</a> who previously <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/annapurna-interactive-sees-exodus-of-entire-staff-as-negotiations-break-down">quit indie publisher Annapurna Interactive in a mass exodus</a> last year.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/21/play-the-gothic-1-remake-demo-with-steam-next-fest/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>THQ Nordic and Alkimia Interactive have announced that a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gothic-remake">Gothic 1 Remake</a> demo will feature as part of Steam Next Fest next week. The demo will be available from Monday 24th February at 6PM GMT.</p>
<p>This preview of the broader project will take players back to the Valley of the Mines in a faithful remake of the classic RPG. However, this is a standalone prologue that is separate from the main game. You won’t be playing as the Nameless Hero, but instead get to explore the Colony through the eyes of Nyras, a member of the Brotherhood of the Sleeper who plays a fairly significant role in the original’s story.</p>


<p>Nyras is a character that many will know from the original game, and playing as him in this prologue, he is a nobody, an inexperienced newcomer to this region. Through the self-contained prologue, you’ll see a slice of the Colony, get to experience the challenging combat, figuring how to survive through patience, skill and improving equipment.</p>
<p>This is a publicly playable build of a demo that has been previewed by some outlets over the last couple years – presumably Alkimia has brought some updates to this game to make it fit for public consumption.</p>
<p>Gothic has been in the works for quite some time. It was greenlit off the back of some canny marketing by THQ Nordic, first commissioning <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/12/14/gothic-remake-playable-teaser-steam-download/">a playable teaser</a> that was made and released in 2019 to show what a Gothic remake might be able to offer, and then gathering what ended up being<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/02/19/next-gen-gothic-remake-development-unambiguous-feedback/">&nbsp;“unambiguous feedback” from fans</a>. Off the back of this, they founded Alkimia Interactive in Barcelona specifically for the remake, and they’ve been plugging away at it ever since.</p>

<p>There’s obviously some real progress being made, and we had <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/02/get-a-deep-look-at-gothic-remakes-world-gameplay-and-story/">a deeper dive into the remake’s gameplay last summer</a>, though there’s still no sign of a release date. This playable demo is a nice touch, though we hope for a meatier reveal and announcement, perhaps at this year’s THQ Summer Showcase?</p>

            <p>Split Fiction will include crossplay for the first time across all platforms - PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC (Windows, Steam, Epic) - via the Friend's Pass function.</p>
<p>This means Hazelight's forthcoming co-op adventure will be playable by two players online across any platform with only one copy of the game required.</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/it-takes-two">It Takes Two</a> similarly included the Friend's Pass function, but players had to be on the same platform. Now, that's changed for Split Fiction.</p>

<p>As long as you own a copy of the game, you can invite any friend on any platform to join you online for free. The catch is that you both need EA accounts linked to your platform account in order to be friends.</p>
<p>Friend's Pass can also be used with "as many different friends as you want, one friend at a time", reads the <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/split-fiction/split-fiction/features/friends-pass-playstation">FAQ</a>, essentially meaning it's not a one time use code so as long as you own a copy of the game, you can share the experience with an infinite number of friends. The host player will also determine the starting point, meaning they can invite a different friend to continue playing (or restart the game).</p>
<p>A demo version of the game will also be playable for free across platforms using Friend's Pass, or in local couch co-op. It includes the first few levels of the game.</p>
<p>And, of course, the game will be fully playable offline in local co-op without using Friend's Pass.</p>
<p>Further, all progress made while playing using Friend's Pass will be carried over into the full game, whether you're the player joining someone else's game via the function, or you're playing the demo version.</p>
<p>However, Trophies and Achievements will only be unlocked by players that have purchased the full game - that would be the host only, and not the player joining for free.</p>
<p>Split Fiction is set for release on 6th March - it's a co-op only game about two authors whose sci-fi and fantasy worlds collide. It follows It Takes Two, which won Game of the Year at The Game Awards 2021 among other accolades.</p>
<p>"What developer Hazelight has essentially done here is build on everything it's done so well with its previous co-op games A Way Out and It Takes Two, and dialled up its ambitions even further," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-is-a-riot-and-its-use-of-a-meat-grinder-might-one-up-that-infamous-elephant-scene-from-it-takes-two">hands-on preview of Split Fiction</a> from Victoria.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-release-date-platforms-free-demo-editions-price/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Neople’s The First Berserker Khazan has sleeper-hit potential, and its 2025 release isn’t one to miss. Whether you want to know which platforms it’s on, how much it costs, or how to play its exclusive demo, we have everything you need to know before you become a berserker yourself.</p>



<p>2024 smashed it in the Soulslike department. FromSoftware delivered its long-awaited Shadow of the Erdtree DLC—Radahn still gives me nightmares—and Stellar Blade was more than stellar. Now, it’s time to look ahead to 2025. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-release-date-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The First Berserker Khazan</a> is the first hard-hitting heavyweight in the Soulslike division.</p>



<p>Khazan’s backstory is nearly as brutal and horrific as the punishing gameplay. But to see if this is the start of something special, I’m here to guide you through the title’s key tidbits before launch.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-the-first-berserker-khazan-come-out">When Does The First Berserker Khazan Come Out?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We’re hyped. Credit to Neople</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Prepare yourself for The First Berserker Khazan’s March 27 release date.</strong></p>



<p>Yes, the vengeance-hungry warrior graces screens in March. Not content with battling those who wronged him, <a href="https://khazan.nexon.com/en/main" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The First Berserker Khazan</a> also has to stave off the presence of other March 2025 games including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atomfall-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atomfall</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Split Fiction</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-first-berserker-khazan-platforms">The First Berserker Khazan Platforms</h2>



<p><strong>PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and PC users can prepare for The First Berserker Khazan launch.</strong></p>



<p>I’m afraid it’s bad news if I haven’t mentioned your platform. PS4 and Xbox One users have to miss out, as do Nintendo Switch owners. I keep questioning if any 2025 releases will get an eventual <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2</a> port. The console is supposed to be a million times more powerful (might be an exaggeration) and a future Switch 2 launch might not be out of the question.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-the-first-berserker-khazan-demo">How to Play The First Berserker Khazan Demo</h2>



<p><strong>Search for The First Berserker Khazan demo on PlayStation, Xbox, or PC, download it, and get playing.</strong></p>



<p>It’s honestly this simple. But here are some handy instructions to follow precisely if you’re struggling:</p>



<ol>
<li>Choose which platform you want to play The First Berserker Khazan demo on.</li>



<li>Go to the PlayStation Store, Microsoft Store, or Steam.</li>



<li>Search for <strong>The First Berserker Khazan</strong>.</li>



<li>Select the free demo.</li>



<li>Click to download it.</li>



<li>Once it’s ready, you can jump straight into the The First Berserker Khazan demo.</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-the-first-berserker-khazan-editions-amp-price">The First Berserker Khazan Editions &amp; Price</h2>



<p><strong>The First Berserker Khazan has two editions: Standard Edition ($59.99/£49.99) and Deluxe Edition ($69.99/£54.99).</strong></p>



<p>Neople is dispensing with luxuriousness where The First Berserker Khazan is concerned. It’s just a Standard or Deluxe Edition to pick from. Most games release with several editions, so this is a more straightforward selection for once.</p>



<hr>



<p>It’s not a full-price release, nor is it getting the hype of a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-gta-6-coming-out-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA 6</a> or even <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-assassins-creed-red-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>, but don’t sleep on The First Berserker Khazan. It looks brutal and bold. Do you think it could be this year’s Shadow of the Erdtree? Or is it another Soulslike clone? Leave your thoughts in the comments.</p>



<p>We have many other release date hubs for you to keep checking back in with: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lost-soul-aside-release-date-platforms-editions-and-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lost Soul Aside</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/killing-floor-3-release-date-platforms-editions-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Killing Floor 3</a>, <a href="https://www.talesoftheshire.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tales of the Shire A Lord of the Rings Game</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k25-release-date-platforms-editions-and-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WWE 2K25</a>.</p>

            <p>
The Epic Games Store for mobile's next free games are <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic">Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</a> and Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 2.
</p>
<p>
You can nab them without paying a penny now via the Epic Games Store app on Android devices, or on iOS if you live in the EU (but not here in the UK - thanks, Brexit.)
</p>
<p>
These titles are Epic's second set of freebies since it began rolling out the mobile store's free games program. The offer began last month, with Dungeons of the Endless: Apogee and Bloons TD6.
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Will you embrace the light, or fall to the dark side?  ☄️  Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic and Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II are available now for FREE on the Epic Games Store on Android worldwide and iOS (in the EU)!</p><p>Check out the full list of new games that… <a href="https://t.co/FOH5G1ba5V">pic.twitter.com/FOH5G1ba5V</a></p></div>— Epic Games Store (@EpicGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/EpicGames/status/1892610693792236031?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 20, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>
It's still early days for Epic's mobile storefront, though the company is currently investing in its future with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-unveils-bold-plan-to-pay-penalties-levied-by-apple-to-tempt-developers-onto-its-mobile-store">bold plan to pay penalties levied by Apple to tempt developers over</a>. The company also has big hopes to grow its third-party offering and launch the shop in more territories - including the UK and Japan - in the relatively near future.
</p>
<p>
Epic's mobile expansion plans are currently awaiting various challenges to Apple and Google's app store dominance. Here in the UK, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-set-to-pile-pressure-on-apple-and-google-app-store-dominance-as-fresh-investigation-launched">the CMA has announced it will use the recent Digital Markets, Competition and Consumer Act legislation as part of a fresh push to potentially limit their app store dominance</a>.
</p>
<p>
Other <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-i-and-ii-available-for-free-on-the-epic-games-store-on-mobile">recent additions to the Epic Games Store</a> on mobile include Cultist Simulator and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/machinarium">Machinarium</a> on iPhone, as well as Gigapocalypse on Android.

            <p>
Just when you thought it was safe to go back to the Airship library, Innersloth and Schell Games have announced a 3D version of popular social stealth sim <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/among-us">Among Us</a>. Or at least, they have taken the existing VR version and made it non-VR. It's a stab in the back for the Meta Questers, perhaps, but it's great news for me, a person who has only ever owned the launch model of the PS4's VR headset, and is currently using its box as a draft excluder.
</p>

<p>
Among Us 3D will get a demo in Steam Next Fest next week. Here's a teaser trailer full of jaunty music.
</p>
<figure>

</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OghjVHrRkoI" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>

<p>
"Experience the core Among Us gameplay you know and love -- tasks, sabotages, Emergency Meetings, and venting -- now in an extremely immersive, 3D environment where everything (yup, everything!) is close up and personal," explains <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3168600/Among_Us_3D/">the Steam page</a>. It'll support native proximity voice chat and crossplay functionality with VR users (but not the original Among Us game, unfortunately). You can expect "new and returning minigames" with first-person controls, and cosmetic customisation that makes use of a new Stardust currency. The Steam demo doesn't include all the core features - there's no crossplay with VR. 
</p>
<p>
After launch, they'll  be adding more modes, tasks, collaborations, hats and limited time events. So when is the full game launching? That's for Innersloth to know and you to wonder about until they spring up behind you and shove a release date through your guts.

			<p>Saber Interactive is officially making a new game based on one of Hasbro's big franchises. The news comes directly from Chris Cocks, formerly president of Wizards of the Coast and now CEO of parent company Hasbro (quote <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/02/20/hasbro-has-q4-2024-earnings-call-transcript/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via The Motley Fool</a>):</p>
<p><em>We have many new digital collaborations in the works, but I'm especially excited to announce this one today, being a personal fan of many of this team's games. Hasbro and Saber Interactive will be collaborating on an all-new video game partnership developed by the team behind 2024's megahit Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine 2, combining high octane single-player action and amazing multiplayer with Saber's Swarm Tech. This new AAA title, one of our tentpole IPs, is sure to be a hit.</em></p>
<p>Speculation is already running rampant about what it could be. Hasbro has several big franchises that could be adapted into a videogame: Transformers, G.I. Joe, Power Rangers, Dungeons and Dragons, and Magic: The Gathering, to name the most important ones. However, Transformers seems to be the most fitting for the developer behind the highly successful Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2. There's already a G.I. Joe game starring Snake Eyes in development at Wizards of the Coast-owned developer Atomic Arcade, after all, and Dungeons and Dragons already has its own lineup: a co-op game <a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-and-dragons-co-op-game-in-development-at-starbreeze-for-2026-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in development at Starbreeze</a> targeting a 2026 launch; a new game <a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-and-dragons-aaa-unreal-engine-5-from-dark-alliance-dev-invoke-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in development at Invoke</a>, formerly Tuque, developer of Dark Alliance; another game <a href="https://wccftech.com/dd-virtual-reality-game-announced-by-demeo-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in development at Demeo developer Resolution Games</a>, now announced as <a href="https://www.resolutiongames.com/battlemarked" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Demeo x Dungeons &amp; Dungeons: Battlemarked</a>; and another game that Chris Cocks had <a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-dragons-is-getting-another-videogame-while-hasbro-wont-finance-any-more-film-adaptations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mentioned</a> a few months ago.</p>
<p>Transformers fans, on the other hand, had to deal with the recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/splash-damage-ends-development-of-transformers-reactivate-lays-off-staff/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cancelation of Transformers: Reactivate at Splash Damage</a>. Plus, there's the fact that the studio's expertise seems much more suited to a shooter game rather than, say, a Magic: The Gathering game. Still, we'll have to wait and see. It might be a while before we learn more about this project.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Saber is also working on <a href="https://wccftech.com/turok-origins-is-an-upcoming-co-op-game-by-saber/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Turok: Origins</a>, a triple-A RPG based on Avatar: The Last Airbender, Jurassic Park Survival, and, of course, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-kotor-remake-is-alive-and-well-promises-saber-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake</a> that was once in the hands of Aspyr. If that sounds like too much work, it's worth reminding that Saber is a massive company with many offices across the globe and nearly 2,700 employees.</p>

            <p>Supergiant Games has confirmed it hasn't recast any actors for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a>, following accusations from the voice actor of Athena the studio is unwilling to utilise the SAG-AFTRA interim agreement.</p>
<p>The US actors' union is currently on strike due to concerns over the use of AI in the games industry, but an interim agreement is in place to ensure acting work can still continue until a full agreement is signed.</p>
<p>Marin Miller, the voice behind Athena in both Hades and Hades 2, has accused Supergiant of recasting the character because the studio "refused to flip to an interim".</p>

<p>"It's possible you may hear me get recast in a particular game that is very popular," they wrote on social media. "If I am, it was not because I stepped away from the character willingly. It's because the employer refused to flip to an interim."</p>
<p>And while they didn't explicitly mention Supergiant, their follow up post wasn't subtle: "It would be SUPER helpful if you wrote a GIANT email asking them to flip for their actors."</p>

</span></p><p>Supergiant has responded with a lengthy statement, confirming it has not re-cast any characters, but noted its games have not been subject to SAG-AFTRA contracts "for a variety of reasons".</p>
<p>"Voice talent has been integral to each of our games," the statement begins. "Recently, questions arose here about how we work with our voice talent, which we want to address."</p>
<p>Supergiant boasts it offers "the strongest AI protections in the industry to our talent, as we think their work is irreplaceable".</p>
<p>It continues: "Our games are intentionally made by human beings; no generative AI is being used in the creation of the voiceover, artwork, or any other content that goes into them.</p>
<p>"We have not re-cast any of our characters in Hades 2, and wish to keep working with each and every member of our wonderful cast.</p>
<p>"We have respected and will continue to respect any actor needing to pause work during the ongoing SAG-AFTRA video game strike. While none of our games have ever been subject to SAG-AFTRA contracts for a variety of reasons, we wish SAG-AFTRA the best in their negotiations to compel larger signatory studios to provide the kinds of protections we think actors deserve."</p>
<p>It's unclear what the reasons are for not using SAG-AFTRA contracts, though many of the voice actors from Hades 2 are either in-house staff or British (<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy 16</a>'s Ben Starr, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a>'s Colin Ryan, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>'s Amelia Tyler) and therefore not part of the US union. Or perhaps the studio believes its own protections are enough.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted Supergiant for more information.</p>

</span></p><p>In a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/marinmmiller.com/post/3likhkirnp22q">follow up thread</a>, Miller emphasised their reliance on SAG-AFTRA for protection, noting this is the seventh month of the strike. "SAG-AFTRA contracts are protected by their legal staff - I can't afford a lawyer without the union," they wrote.</p>
<p>"Clients keep asking me, 'If we include a no-AI rider, will you work non-union or on a 2020 agreement?' Will you be willing to cover the costs of my legal fees if you violate my agreement? Why are you refusing to sign a contract I can enforce?"</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/us-video-game-performers-are-striking-over-ongoing-ai-concerns">SAG-AFTRA strike began in July last year</a>, with AI usage the primary concern of the union.</p>
<p>"We're not going to consent to a contract that allows companies to abuse AI to the detriment of our members," SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher said in a statement. "Enough is enough. When these companies get serious about offering an agreement our members can live - and work - with, we will be here, ready to negotiate."</p>
<p>Audrey Cooling, a spokesperson for the video game producers that have signed the existing Interactive Media Agreement, responded: "We have already found common ground on 24 out of 25 proposals, including historic wage increases and additional safety provisions. Our offer is directly responsive to SAG-AFTRA's concerns and extends meaningful AI protections that include requiring consent and fair compensation to all performers working under the IMA. These terms are among the strongest in the entertainment industry."</p>
<p>At the start of the year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/negotiations-over-ai-are-still-holding-up-video-game-development-mass-effects-jennifer-hale-explains-why">Eurogamer spoke with celebrated voice actor Jennifer Hale</a> (<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a>, Bayonetta 3) about the strike and why it's taking so long to reach a resolution.</p>
<p>"It's a huge issue for all of us and the repercussions are vast," she says. "So to me, it makes sense that everyone needs to take their time. As performers - and we saw this in the writers strike and the theatrical contract strike - we're just the canary in the coal mine."</p>
<p>The news follows the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-second-major-update-adds-god-of-war-but-still-no-full-release-date">second major update to Hades 2</a> revealed yesterday, as the game remains in early access, without a full release date.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/among-us">Among Us</a> developer Innersloth has announced Among Us 3D for PC, with a Steam Next Fest demo set to debut next week.
</p>
<p>
This 3D, first-person version of the game isn't brand new, however. Virtual reality headset fans will notice this is very much Among Us VR without the VR.
</p>
<p>
Indeed, Among Us 3D features crossplay with Among Us VR (though not, unsurprisingly, with the original 2D game). Essentially, this new version of the VR version allows a much wider 'flatscreen' PC audience to join in.

</figure>
<p>
Otherwise, this is the Among Us you know and have probably played before, now with an additional dimension. The game caters for between four and 10 players, and of course lets you customise your bean with hats.
</p>
<p>A new Stardust currency will be introduced to let you acquire more cosmetic items for your bean. Post-launch, the game will add new modes, tasks, collaborations, and additional limited time events. As well as more hats.
</p>
<p>
There's no full release date for Among Us 3D yet, and no word of it appearing outside of PC at all. Still, if you're interested, and if you're a Steam user, you should probably keep an eye on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3168600/Among_Us_3D/">Steam page</a> for when its demo arrives as part of Steam Next Fest in just a couple of days.

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/21/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-hotfix-1-1-2-patch-notes-crash-bug-fixes/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-hotfix-1-1-2-won%E2%80%99t-crash-when-spamming-keys-at-the-eula.1115217/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/21/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-hotfix-1-1-2-patch-notes-crash-bug-fixes/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Warhorse Studios has released a new <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a> patch, with hotfix 1.1.2 targeting a clutch of crash bugs so the game won’t keel over when “looking at certain locked doors”, “interacting with a cart” or when “spamming keys on the EULA screen”.</p>
<p>I think spamming keys at the EULA is pretty much universal gamer behaviour, because who’s got time in their finite lives to actually read that legalese gibberish? But once you actually get into the game, looking at doors of all kinds and interacting with carts are both pretty integral to the immersive medieval experience that KCD2 provides.</p>


<p>I’m poking a little bit of fun, of course, and it’s always good to see developers stamping out the odd little bugs and crashes that inevitably remain in games after release. Warhorse has plenty plans for more support with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/21/kingdom-come-deliverance-2s-roadmap-includes-updates-and-future-expansions/">three major questline expansions coming through the rest of 2025</a>.</p>
<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 launched at the start of February to plenty of praise from critics – see <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/03/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review/">our KCD2 review here</a> – and players alike, continuing down the immersive RPG style of the original. The game has already turned a profit <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1771300/view/542223437984170029">on its way to 2 million sales</a>, and the positive word of mouth could see that number keep on climbing, even in an absolutely stacked start to the year with big game releases.</p>
<p>Here’s the KCD2 Hotfix 1.1.2 patch notes:</p>

<p><strong>Fortuna&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bozhena and Pavlena will no longer report the player for crimes during the quest.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The King’s Gambit&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The quest interactor for wine will no longer disappear, allowing players to continue pouring wine for the guests.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Combat</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the crossbow aiming zoom on ultrawide resolutions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Platform-specific fixes</strong></p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p><strong>PROS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Improved the issue with rewards sometimes requiring game restart to be awarded.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Stability</strong></p>
<ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/21/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-update-3-adds-better-path-tracing-on-pc/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> Update 3 has been released, and while there’s a huge swathe of bug fixes made throughout the game, the new features are all focussed on PC hardware support, improved path tracing, and broader availability of path tracing in the game.</p>
<p>With the recent releases of Nvidia’s GeForce 50 series cards and DLSS 4, this has now been integrated into Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, introducing the new transformer-based model for upscaling and ray-reconstruction, and up to 4x multi-frame generation. For AMD and Intel, AMD FSR 3.1 (with frame gen) is now integrated, and so is Intel XESS 1.4.</p>


<p>The game relies on certain ray-tracing effects for lighting and ambient occlusion across the board, but up until now <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/09/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-launch-day-update-adds-full-ray-tracing-on-pc/">the path tracing option</a> (described as ‘Full Ray Tracing’) has been limited to Nvidia GPUs that are more capable of getting playable performance out of it. MachineGames has now loosened the reigns on this, so AMD and Intel GPU owners can enable path tracing and enjoy what some might call <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2014/10/09/assassins-creed-unity-devs-say-30fps-is-more-cinematic-and-feels-better/">more cinematic performance</a>…</p>
<p>Could this hint at a path tracing mode for the PS5 release of the game that’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/20/indiana-jones-is-coming-to-ps5-but-only-after-xbox-and-pc-december-release/">expected this spring</a>, taking advantage of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>? Probably not, but if it happens, I’m going to say “I told you so!”</p>
<p>Here’s the full patch notes (beware of spoilers through the bug fixes, though).</p>

<h2>NEW FEATURES</h2>
<h3>NVIDIA DLSS 4</h3>
<p>Update 3 brings support for NVIDIA DLSS 4: a suite of rendering technologies that boosts framerates, increases performance, and improves image quality! – Players using supported NVIDIA hardware can enable Multi Frame Generation (3x, 4x) using the new transformer-based model – Ray Reconstruction increases the clarity and stability of ray-traced images – DLAA and DLSS Super Resolution have also been updated to the transformer-based model. These options when enabled enhance native and upscaled image quality, respectively</p>
<h3>Ray-Traced Local Lights</h3>
<p>For players who have Path Tracing enabled, this update includes a new option for ray-traced shadows to include all light sources, which significantly increases the quality of shadows in interior locations. (Players can also choose to keep the previous setting, which provides ray-traced shadows from the sun only.)</p>
<h3>Path Tracing (Full Ray Tracing) Support for AMD and Intel Graphics Cards</h3>
<p>This update brings Path Tracing to supported Intel and AMD GPUs. To use Path Tracing, your Intel or AMD graphics card must support Hardware Ray Tracing and have at least 16GB of VRAM. Please make sure to download the latest drivers from your GPU manufacturer! Note that in foliage-dense locations, such as Sukhothai, reducing Vegetation Animation Quality below the “Ultra” settings can reduce the occasional shadow “popping” that may be seen on all graphics cards using Path Tracing.</p>
<h3>FSR 3.1, including Frame Generation</h3>
<p>Update 3 adds support for AMD FSR 3.1 upscaling and frame generation technology.</p>
<h3>Intel XESS 1.4</h3>
<p>Update 3 also adds support for Intel XESS 1.4 upscaling.</p>
<h3>Quality of Life Updates</h3>
<ul>
<li>Repair kits can now also be used by selecting them directly from the inventory (Rather than only by selecting your broken weapon or tool!)</li>
</ul>
<h2>BUG FIXES — MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD!</h2>
<h3>General</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where players would be unable to use ladders, squeeze through walls, or climb vines in Sukhothai; particularly during the Blessed Pearl mission</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that could prevent players from picking up certain medicine bottles in the Vatican</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that could temporarily stop you from being able to punch or block if you had picked up an item while the game was saving</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the camera could be stuck in third person when backing out of certain third-person interactions</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the player and enemies might take damage while walking through an open doorway after restarting a checkpoint</li>
<li>Fixed issue where notes might clip through the front of the screen when inspecting them</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where players could accidentally drop their Camera or Lighter while inspecting items for purchase</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that could make items disappear if players tried to pick up objects while vaulting over objects</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where inspectable items could be lost if picked up at the same moment an enemy punched you</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that could make the “Restricted Area” HUD marker to be offset after restarting a checkpoint</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where camera shake would permanently occur when revisiting Gizeh</li>

<li>Fixed an issue where Gina would repeat her lines from the ambush (“That was too close”) while you are in the boat. Please note this will, unfortunately, not correct the issue for players who are currently experiencing the bug, but it will prevent it from happening again</li>
<li>Improvements to combat and stealth music transitions, to make them more seamless</li>
<li>Added sound for heavyweight enemies breaking out of a clinch</li>
<li>Raised the volume of the enemy mounted machineguns in Sukhothai hotel shootout</li>

<p>Details about Cliffhanger’s upcoming Black Panther game have surfaced online thanks to a popular leaker, and it seems players will be able to try out characters like T’Challa, Killmonger, Shuri and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new information about Cliffhanger’s Black Panther game comes from the popular Call of Duty leaker TheGhostOfHope. Their latest post on <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1892746064505246088" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) provides players with exclusive details on the upcoming game, such as character choice, combat details, POV, exploration, narrative aspects, etc.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The details reveal that the upcoming Black Panther game will allow players to choose their protagonist, which varies from T’Challa to M’Baku, Azari, Shuri, Killmonger, and more. Each Black Panther will have unique weapons, armour, and gadgets. Regarding combat, players can expect “authentic African Martial Arts mixed with Superhuman strength/agility” along with tech.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regarding exploration, the upcoming Black Panther game will feature cities, savannahs, and other locations where players will experience different cultures and interact with new characters. The game will feature an over-the-shoulder POV. Lastly, Black Panther’s story will react to your choices and actions, providing players with “unique stories, missions &amp; dynamics” in return.</p>



<p>The Black Panther game was announced by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-black-panther/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA in 2023</a>, with Cliffhanger Games developing the AAA title. Monolith’s Kevin Stephens is leading the project, and the team includes veterans from top franchises like Halo Infinite, God of War, Call of Duty, and others.&nbsp;A job listing from last year confirmed an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-panther-game-open-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open-world setting</a> for the game.</p>



<p>In other news, Marvel Rivals has crossed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-hits-40-million-players-within-3-months/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">40 million players</a> in three months. Also, NetEase has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netease-releases-statement-on-marvel-rivals-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released a statement</a> on the recent layoffs. What are your thoughts on the new details about the Black Panther game?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/21/among-us-3d-is-among-us-vr-without-the-vr-steam-next-fest-demo-incoming/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Innersloth and Schell Games have revealed an un-VR-ified version of Among Us VR. Among Us 3D is coming to PC via Steam with a Steam Next Fest demo coming next week.</p>
<p><iframe title="Among Us 3D ???? Teaser Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UYMaaMTgxa4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In the fullness of time, Among Us 3D will be a flatscreen counterpart to Among Us VR, coming with cross-play between the two 3D adaptations of the hit social deduction game. In turn, it is very much like the original 2D Among Us… but in three dimensions. The game can be played with 4-10 players, all running around completing tasks on the map until a murdered body is discovered, calling an Emergency Meeting to try and determine who the imposter is, and eject the into space. Of course, playing either in VR or 3D makes this all much closer and more personal…</p>
<p>The Steam Next Fest demo is more limited than the full Among Us 3D release will be, and will not support all features or game modes. So there’s no crossplay or additional cosmetics, until the full release comes down the pipe.</p>
<p>Here’s the feature breakdown from the Steam listing:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Native Proximity Voice Chat</strong> — Yap with your friends directly in-game. No need for additional third-party platforms!</li>
<li><strong>New and Returning Minigames</strong> —&nbsp; Experience the tasks you know and love, along with some new ones. Now, with first-person controls.</li>
<li><strong>Crossplay Functionality —</strong> Join lobbies with other VR<i> </i>players! (<i>Note: <strong>The game is NOT compatible with the original </strong></i><strong>Among Us <i>game</i></strong><i>. Sorry, beans.</i>)</li>
<li><strong>Customize Your Beansona </strong>— Expand your wardrobe of hats, gloves, and skins with an endless number of cosmetic customization combinations!</li>
</ul>
<p>After Among Us became one of the breakout hits of 2020, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/12/10/among-us-is-getting-vr/">Innersloth partnered with Schell Games to produce Among Us VR</a>, launching in 2022. It’s a great fit conceptually for VR, adding more tactile minigames, the isolation of running around doing tasks, while trying to be aware of your surroundings and spot suspicious behaviour. But VR games have often been adapted back to flatscreen, and now it’s Among Us’ turn to make that return trip. The 2D original game will surely remain the most popular version of Among Us, but a 3D counterpart is sure to pick up an audience of its own, especially with VR cross-play.</p>

		<p>Tales of the Shire: <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-lord-of-the-rings">A Lord of the Rings</a> game has been delayed again, being pushed back from March to a new 29th July 2025 release date. The cosy Hobbit life sim is coming to PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch, and Netflix gaming.</p>
<p>Weta Workshop announced the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/tales-of-the-shire">Tales of the Shire</a> delay on a place we ain’t linking to these days:</p>


<p>Dear Fellow Hobbits,</p>
<p>A good Hobbit feast takes time, and so does <a title="Series > Tales of [10 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/tales-of">Tales of</a> the Shire! We’re taking a little longer to ensure that every Hobbit, on every platform, can enjoy the same cozy experience. The game will now launch on July 29, 2025.</p>
<p>We want this game to feel like a warm hug from Middle-earth, and we are making sure that no matter where you play, you’ll feel right at home in The Shire. From foot-hair styles to the fluffiest cakes, every detail will be just right.</p>

<p>We appreciate your patience and cannot wait for you to experience life in The Shire this summer. In the meantime, arrange the table, polish your silver and get ready for a feast fit for a Hobbit!</p>
<p>Looking forward to welcoming you to Bywater.</p>
<p>—From the folks at Weta Workshop Game Studio</p>
<p>Tales of the Shire allows players to create their own Hobbit, who lives in Bywater and can establish their own life. As time passes in Bywater, other Hobbits will come to ask your Hobbit for help on matters. Additionally, you can do all the cosy things a Hobbit’s life should consist of, including growing your own vegetables, going fishing, trading items with neighbours, and cooking up meals. You can wander around Bywater visiting other Hobbits and going to the shop, or venture a bit further out to forage in the fields for supplies.</p>
<p>Originally <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/22/tales-of-the-shire-is-a-cosy-life-sim-set-in-the-lord-of-the-rings-universe/">announced</a> and expected to launch in 2024, Tales of the Shire has now had multiple delays. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/14/cosy-hobbit-life-sim-tales-of-the-shire-delayed-to-2025/">A rough 2025 window</a> was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/23/tales-of-the-shire-gets-a-new-march-25th-release-date/">narrowed to March 2025</a>, but clearly Weta need more time to realise this cosy take on fantasy world.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-new-rumor-set-in-hammerfell-and-high-rock-featuring-naval-combat-ship-building-and-more/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-elder-scrolls-vi-new-rumor-set-in-hammerfell-and-high-rock-featuring-naval-combat-ship-building-and-more.1115199/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-new-rumor-set-in-hammerfell-and-high-rock-featuring-naval-combat-ship-building-and-more/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The second The Elder Scrolls VI news item of the week is a rarity, to be sure. After the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-can-get-you-into-the-game-as-an-npc-for-a-meager-10-5k-and-upward/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> of Bethesda's silent auction to work with the highest bidder on adding a non-player character (NPC) to the game, though, we have a much juicier rumor from extas1s on the game itself.</p>
<p>The leaker <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SY3Udvjn1Eo&amp;pp=ygUHZXh0YXMxcw%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> info from a colleague who heard that major technical improvements will be made to the Creation Engine 2 seen in Starfield. These improvements could possibly reduce or eliminate load times between zones in an attempt to make the game feel more immersive. Needless to say, this would be a major boon to Bethesda's games, which have always had to deal with this shortcoming.</p>
<p>In terms of setting, the rumor confirms previous speculations that the game will take place in both Hammerfell and High Rock, the homes of the Redguards and Bretons, respectively. Interestingly, according to the source, The Elder Scrolls VI could feature between twelve and thirteen major cities, which would be a major step up from Skyrim, where there are only four or five that could really be considered that way.</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the most intriguing details reported is that the game will feature naval exploration, combat, and shipbuilding. This would be a transformed version of what we saw in Starfield, although of course, naval exploration and combat in the actual sea instead of space would be very different. Likewise, we might see the return of another feature seen in Starfield but originally introduced with Fallout 4: Settlements. Again, this would be expanded to allow players to build and customize villages and fortresses.</p>
<p>The character progression is said to be completely freeform, with improvements to the magic and melee combat systems. Lastly, dragons would be featured prominently, not only through boss encounters but also in the story.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most unlikely part of the rumor is that we could see a teaser for The Elder Scrolls VI as early as this June, presumably at the Xbox Game Showcase, alongside the reveal of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-rumors-intensify-as-details-on-the-improvements-emerge-in-new-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored Oblivion remaster/remake</a>. This seems really farfetched, to be honest. Bethesda is known for only showing their games relatively close to release, and it's nowhere near time for that. Starfield only <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-the-elder-space-scrolls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> in September 2023, so realistically, The Elder Scrolls VI won't be released before 2027.</p>
<p>Anyway, what do you think of these details? Would you be happy if they were confirmed? Let us know in the comments.</p>

<p>Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater is, without any doubt, one of the best games in the entire series. It debuted on PlayStation 2 way back in 2004, and since then, it has remained a cult classic title, the subject of many memes, and the target of re-releases and remasters. It features a collection of boss fights, each one as memorable as the other, and all of them unique in their way. </p>



<p>In this list, I’m breaking down all the Metal Gear Solid 3 boss fights, ranking them in order of how awesome they are to behold.</p>



<hr>







<p>It’s mostly subjective, right? For one man’s trash, there’s another man’s treasure – and that’s the same thing with these boss fights. They’re all special in their way, but some of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/metal-gear-solid/">Metal Gear Solid</a> 3 boss fights are so iconic that they’ll stick in our minds forever.</p>



<h3 id="h-9-the-pain">9. The Pain</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Pain is the first member of ‘Cobra’ that we get to fight in MGS3: Snake Eater. As such, his fight is relatively plain and easy to overcome, and his abilities are rather weak and not all that impressive. He can control bees – that’s about it. </p>



<h3 id="h-8-the-shagohod">8. The Shagohod</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>You wouldn’t think that going up against an enormous, nuclear-capable tank would be a boring boss fight, but that’s just what it is. It’s memorable because you’re fighting something so massive, but it’s an on-rails scene followed by a repetitive mechanism that sees you bring the behemoth to its knees relatively quickly.</p>







<h3 id="h-7-the-sorrow">7. The Sorrow</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Sorrow’s battle is one of the cleverest Metal Gear Solid 3 boss fights, as it’s built around how you’ve played the game up until that point. If you’ve killed lots of enemies, your battle here will be ‘longed out’, but if you’re on a no-kill run, it’ll be over quickly. It rewards users with a nice camo suit, but ultimately, this fight is a walking simulator – but a smart one.</p>



<h3 id="h-6-ocelot">6. Ocelot</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Ocelot is cool – he’s one of the best Metal Gear Solid characters of all time and a memorable one at that. He and Naked Snake clash three times in Snake Eater, but the most exciting fight with him is his first one, when he is using his dual revolvers across a crevice – it’s the scene from which a few memes surfaced over the years. </p>







<h3 id="h-5-the-end">5. The End</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Fighting The End can either be an intense slog riddled with jumpscares or it can be the easiest battle in the world. Originally, users could trick the game, setting the time/date on their PlayStation 2 forward by a week once they’ve met The End, and he’d die in-game of old age… Clever, right? Otherwise, players could take part in a thrilling cat-and-mouse sniper battle across several regions of the game.</p>



<h3 id="h-4-the-fear">4. The Fear</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Fear lives up to his name by basically offering up the creepiest Metal Gear Solid 3 boss fight in the game. He’s a strange, fork-tongued man who can dislocate his limbs at will, scramble up trees like a spider, and strike at Naked Snake with a crossbow in relative silence. With his remarkable camouflage, players are left to rely on sounds to track him, and he leaves traps everywhere to trip Snake up.</p>



<h3 id="h-3-the-fury">3. The Fury</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Fury is a phenomenal boss that fights the player in a suffocating battle backed up by an overwhelming flamethrower and a whole lot of anger. He’s not insanely difficult to kill, but he can devastate the player very quickly in the close-knit, phobia-inducing environment in which the fight takes place. At the end of the fight, he supernovates and explodes in a brutal, cataclysmic eruption.</p>



<h3 id="h-2-colonel-volgin">2. Colonel Volgin</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>As the big baddy in Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, Colonel Volgin makes for a fantastic opponent. There are plenty of secret tricks the player can use to turn the tide of battle, but his abilities alone make his face-off one of the best Metal Gear Solid 3 boss fights in the game. He’s a powerful fighter with electromagnetic and lightning powers, and visually, he’s one of the most impressive bosses in Metal Gear history.</p>







<h3 id="h-1-the-boss">1. The Boss</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>If there’s a more emotional boss battle in gaming, I don’t know what it is. At the very end of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, Naked Snake must fight his mentor – The Boss. She means a huge amount to Snake, but still, he must do away with her, and that means an intense battle between the master and the apprentice must take place. It doesn’t help that the soundtrack to this fight is incredible and the setting is nothing short of beautiful. It’s such a dramatic battle, it’s the best Metal Gear Solid 3 boss fight on record.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sony Being Sued For ‘Artificially High Prices’ on PlayStation Store]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/sony-playstation-store-lawsuit-artificially-high/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-being-sued-for-%E2%80%98artificially-high-prices%E2%80%99-on-playstation-store.1115181/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/sony-playstation-store-lawsuit-artificially-high/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It has been revealed that a Dutch consumer group has filed a class action lawsuit against Sony. The organisation – Massaschade &amp; Consument – alleges that Sony is keeping prices on the PlayStation Store ‘artificially high’ and is abusing a position of power by preventing players from buying digital versions of PS4 and PS5 games elsewhere.</p>



<p>The class action lawsuit joins others that have surfaced recently in Portugal and the United Kingdom, and this particular suit is exclusively reserved for residents of the Netherlands.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-you-re-paying-too-much-for-playstation-games">‘You’re Paying Too Much for PlayStation Games’</h2>



<p>The class action lawsuit, which was discovered first by ‘<a href="https://tweakers.net/nieuws/231990/nederlandse-stichting-start-massaclaim-tegen-sony-om-prijzen-playstation-store.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tweakers</a>‘, states clearly in the headline that ‘you’re paying too much for PlayStation games’. The suit has dubbed the alleged overpayments ‘Sony Tax’, and it stresses that all PlayStation gamers in the Netherlands have a right to compensation.</p>



<p>On February 17, the legal body wrote to Sony to ‘hold it liable to the abuse of its dominant position and its further unlawful conduct in relation to the PlayStation 4 and 5.’</p>



<p>Netherlands residents <a href="https://www.massaschadeconsument.nl/collectieve-acties/playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">can register</a> as part of the class action lawsuit for free by completing a simple form. The only requirement is that you’ve made a digital purchase via the PlayStation Store at some point since November 29, 2013. You must also be at least eight years old.</p>



<p>In a statement on the site promoting the class action lawsuit, it was explained what Sony is doing wrong:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The gaming industry is now bigger than the film, TV and music industries combined. Sony, as the manufacturer of the world’s best-selling console, is one of the most powerful – if not the most powerful – players in this market. And with such power comes responsibility. In the EU, it is illegal for large companies to abuse their position to make more profit at the expense of consumers. Yet Sony does not fully comply with these rules.</p>



<p>When you buy a digital game or in-game content, Sony ensures that this can only be done via its own PlayStation Store. Sony keeps the market for itself in this way and can keep the prices artificially high. As a result, you pay more, without getting anything extra in return. This is also called the <strong>‘Sony Tax’.</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>In November 2023, Sony faced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-being-sued-5-billion-class-action/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a whopping £5 billion class action lawsuit</a> in the United Kingdom for this very same reason. That case was kicked off in 2022, but the most recent documentation about the lawsuit was published midway through 2024, and the results of the proceedings are unclear.</p>



<p>Do you think Sony has an issue with PlayStation Store prices? Let us know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> is offline right now, but fortunately it's not because anything is wrong. Quite the opposite, in fact--Fortnite is down because of routine scheduled maintenance that Epic does with every update. In this case, the update is a big one: the launch of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-6-season-2-start-date-theme-battle-pass-leaks-and-rumors/1100-6529339/" data-ref-id="1100-6529339">Fortnite battle royale Chapter 6 Season 2</a>, featuring major changes to the island, piles of new weapons and gadgets, and the arrival of Sub-Zero from Mortal Kombat.</p><p>Chapter 6 got off to quite a bang during Season 1, as Fortnite introduced the permanent OG mode with its own separate battle pass, and also the Counter-Strike-esque Ballistic mode. In January, the season ramped up once more with the addition of the player-controlled Godzilla boss and the arrival of Hatsune Miku in Festival. But all things must come to an end--we had our fun with the ridiculous Typhoon Blade, but now it's time to move on to less civilized weapons, like the big drill weapon we saw in the trailer.</p><h2><strong>Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 2 start time</strong></h2><p>When the servers come back up, it'll be Lawless season, which is all about committing armed robbery. That's right, it's Fortnite's fourth heist-themed season. But where the past seasons like this had more of a classy bent, Lawless season is going to be more in the vein of Grand Theft Auto--mayhem is the name of the game here.</p><p>Since we're already in downtime, the wait shouldn't be too long. Fortnite went offline at 2 AM ET/11 PM PT, and season updates typically take somewhere in the ballpark of 4-7 hours. If all goes well, you could be fragging away in Crime City by 6 AM PT / 9 AM ET. But don't take that as a given--when Chapter 5 Season 2 launched a year ago, something went wrong, and Fortnite stayed offline until the evening. But that was a very unusual case. Most seasons launch between 4 AM - 7 AM PT / 7 AM - 10 AM ET.</p><p>Every new battle royale season dramatically changes the gameplay meta, and Season 2 will not be an exception. This crime-fueled season will add a new urban location, Crime City, as well as a bundle of new tools, like timed explosives, sticky grenades, and a rocket drill, that will help you steal gold and whatever else you can find. For more on what you can expect in Season 2, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-6-season-2-start-date-theme-battle-pass-leaks-and-rumors/1100-6529339/" data-ref-id="1100-6529339">check out our rundown here</a>.</p>

An updated version of the PC demo is also available. <span id="more-945607"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via PLAYISM:</p><blockquote><p><strong>■ About the Game</strong></p><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>Metal Bringer is the second game in the Bringer series, and this time, the setting is completely different—in this game, you fight in a sci-fi world with androids and giant robots in horde-based combat that’s even more satisfying than the last game all while enjoying an in-depth character customization system.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li><strong>Highly Customizable Player Characters and Arms</strong> – Build and control android soldiers called “Labor,” or have them pilot giant machines called “Arms.” Each and every Labor and Arms you build is highly customizable. You can change the color and appearance of their features, or swap out parts to change their fighting styles.</li><li><strong>Effortlessly Wipe Out Hordes of Enemies</strong> – Labor can be strengthened by installing different types of apps. App disks can be obtained by defeating enemies, but you lose all installed apps when you fall in battle. However, by analyzing an app’s data at a shop, you can use it when you customize your next Labor, allowing you to perform better each run until you can freely trample all over your opponents with ease.</li><li><strong>Obtain Enemy Arms Parts on the Go</strong> – Even the most powerful Arms will eventually wear down, but when that happens, you can use Arms parts left behind by the enemy. What’s more, you can analyze the blueprints of powerful Arms parts over the course of the game, which unlocks various customization options. Find out what kind of gear suits you best to build the ideal mech.</li><li><strong>Ray Tracing and Ever-Changing Music</strong> – This game uses the same retro art style as <a title="Games > Samurai Bringer [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/samurai-bringer">Samurai Bringer</a>, and just like Samurai Bringer, it also implements a real time pixel art generating system, and will also feature the newest raytracing technology for beautifully lit environments. The music too is made with the newest technology, as it is played in real time and changes according to how your fights are playing out.</li><li><strong>All-Star Art Team</strong> – The protagonist Suria and the keyart were designed by Suzuhito Yasuda, and on the writing team, we have Sami Shinosaki on board! The pixel art portraits for Suria are drawn by illustrator kutsuwa.<ul><li><strong>Suzuhito Yasuda</strong> – Illustrator, manga artist, and character designer for multiple popular games and media, such as <em>Durarara!!</em> and the <em><a title="Series > Shin Megami Tensei [95 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/shin-megami-tensei">Shin Megami Tensei</a>: Devil Survivor</em> series. Creator of the ongoing manga series <em>Bootsleg</em> and <em>Yozakura <a title="Games > Quartet" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/quartet">Quartet</a></em> (serialized in Monthly Shonen Sirius).</li><li><strong>Sami Shinosaki</strong> – Novelist. Known for the novelizations of the <em>Armored Core</em> and <em>Fire Emblem</em> series.</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>■ About the New Demo</strong></p><p>When we released the first Metal Bringer demo back in October 2024 for the Steam Next Fest, it received a “Mostly Positive” rating on Steam. Ever since, we’ve improved and polished the demo based on user feedback, and this new demo has been overhauled to provide an even better experience.</p><p>Whether you’ve already played the old demo, or if this is your first time hearing of it, please give the new demo a try, and we hope you’ll enjoy it!</p><p>Note: As we will continue to improve the full game based on feedback received from the demo, demo progress will not be saved. Demo save data will not carry over to the full game.</p><ul><li><strong>Improved Tutorial</strong> – The tutorials have been expanded, and we’ve adjusted the timing of when tutorials are displayed relative to player progression, making it easier to understand the game’s system as you play. Gameplay tutorials can also be accessed at any time by opening the Control Guide from the pause menu.</li><li><strong>Balancing Changes</strong> – We’ve adjusted various aspects of the gameplay such as the difficulty curve and the player character’s initial parameters, as well as optimized the lock-on systems and default input config. This should make the game easier to play from the get-go even with your character’s initially weak abilities.</li><li><strong>User Interface Changes</strong> – We’ve changed the user interface of the Labor and Arms assembly menu, making it possible for players to compare the specs of weapons and Arms Gear while assembling a new unit. We have also changed the on-screen map and indicators for easier viewing.</li><li><strong>New Story Elements</strong> – The demo only contains a small part of the story, but we have added a large number of story elements to the demo, including conversations with enemy Labor and events that reveal more about the game’s world. We hope this will allow players to learn more about the world of Metal Bringer and have a more immersive experience.</li><li><strong>Miscellaneous Changes</strong> – We’ve also made other small improvements to many aspects of the game, such as improving the shop system, adding the ability to withdraw D-Chips in the field, improving the map functionality, and adding new apps and OS tuning options. Please try out the demo to see what it has to offer!</li></ul><p><strong>Demo-Exclusive Modes</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Newbie</strong> – Power up and customize your Labor with apps as you learn the basic game mechanics and play through the beginning of the story. Your Labor will start out weak, but keep growing stronger to defeat a boss within the time limit!</li><li><strong>Extreme</strong> – Use Labor and Arms that have already been strengthened to a certain extent to take on mid-game battles. Choose whatever kind of Labor, weapon, and Arms you like to overpower the boss!</li></ul><p>Extreme Mode is unlocked from the title screen after you watch the opening scene and roll out on an investigation for the first time in Newbie Mode.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><strong>English</strong></p><p><iframe title="Metal Bringer - Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lx_i5VMEF3I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Japanese</strong></p><p><iframe title="『メタルブリンガー』発売日発表トレーラー" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mX5zaxf2KU0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

They represent s​even identity groups​: Asian, Black, 2SLGBTQIA+, Latinx/Hispanic, family of all kinds, women and gender minorities​, and interfaith.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Now, in February, that text has been removed, and replaced with:</p><blockquote><p>All employees are welcome to create or join Employee Resource Groups (ERGs), which are voluntary employee-led groups mentored by executive sponsors.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Other sections, like employee training pages mentioning "Diversity and Inclusion”, have also been edited to delete certain wording, while whole pages, like those discussing executive salary bonuses tied to diversity accomplishments, "have been removed from the website entirely", according to <em>404</em>.</p><p>While these appear to have had little effect on the company's internal operations--staff speaking to <em>404 </em>say nothing has changed in terms of the ERGs or internal messaging about diversity--it's still a chilling sight to see a media company, one that employs an international workforce of diverse people, making such a clearly submissive gesture to an increasingly authoritarian government that, with a hatred of the media as one of its core tenets, will not give half a shit about gestures.</p><p><a href="https://www.404media.co/ziff-davis-dei-commitment-websites/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">You can see detailed examples of the changes at <em>404</em></a>, where you should also subscribe so you can read more of their <em>excellent </em>work.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/humane-ai-sad-trombone"><h3>How’s That AI Future Looking?</h3></a><p>The Humane AI pin died on the way back to its home planet</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/atelier-yumia-the-alchemist-of-memories-the-envisioned-land-might-be-the-series-coziest-jrpg-yet-hands-on-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">After over two dozen mainline games, I can only imagine how difficult it must be to innovate and stay relevant in an era where a great game is coming out every few weeks, but that’s exactly what KOEI TECMO aims to do with the next entry in its long-running Atelier JRPG series, Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories and the Envisioned Land. After spending over six hours gathering resources, doing Sailor Moon-esque magical dancing rituals, and riding around on a motorbike, I’m inclined to believe they’ll pull off just that, yet again. With more engaging combat, improved visuals, more convenient crafting, and an entirely new building system that lets you put your own personal touch on the world, there’s quite a bit to be optimistic about, even if what I saw of the story and characters was, at least so far in the opening hours, pretty boilerplate stuff for the genre.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve played any of the recent Atelier games, then you probably won’t be shocked by Atelier Yumia at first glance. All three of the pillars that have been around since its conception are still alive and well: exploration, where you run around collecting resources and solving puzzles; combat, where you fight baddens with a party chock-full of pretty anime friends, and synthesis, where you combine your hard-won resources into alchemical creations that make you stronger. But each has been given a substantial overhaul (not to mention a serious facelift) that breathes new life into a familiar formula.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat seems to be getting the biggest rework, with action-based systems that let you perfect parry, dodge out of the way, and switch to different range bands depending on whether you’d like to thwack enemies in melee or take them down from a distance. At lower levels, combat seemed fairly undemanding, as I was able to just unload every ability I had, swap to other characters to do the same, then repeat it all again, ending most encounters in a matter of seconds, but later on (and especially when I wasn’t properly leveled) I seriously got rinsed if I wasn’t paying attention to enemy attack patterns and working on my timing. It never got especially challenging so long as I was properly leveled, but it was nice to see a less passive combat system that I couldn’t just steamroll through while on autopilot.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Combat seems to be getting the biggest rework.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Exploration also had some improvements, like having a gun to stun enemies and collect resources at a distance, ziplines that help you navigate the map more easily once you find and activate both sides of the line, and, crucially, a badass motorcycle for you to speed around on that makes getting around much easier. Finally, there’s Synthesis, which in typically Atelier fashion is so dang complicated, you could spend quite a bit of time customizing and min-maxing every aspect of your gear and crafting new items and attacks to use in battle. Or, if you don’t have the patience like me, you can just hit “auto mode” and it’ll automatically optimize all of it for you. Not that I don’t enjoy this aspect of the series, but it’s certainly nice to have the option of leaping back into the action quickly for times where I wasn’t in the mood to tinker.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Atelier Yumia also shakes things up by adding a fourth fairly significant activity to the list of things to do as you explore and level up: the ability to build and customize settlements throughout the world map. That’s right – Atelier Yumia seems to be leaning into the cozy craze, so now you can have a little bit of Animal Crossing or Sims with your JRPG by constructing your fantasy cottage on a patch of land and spending some quality downtime with your party members. I was only able to dabble in this a bit, given the constraint of the resources available to me in the early part of the story, but I could definitely see myself sinking quite a bit of time into taming the wilds with an elaborately decorated home.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With all Atelier has going for it, I will say that it did very little to make itself stand out in terms of story. The characters and foreshadowing of the undoubtedly epic and convoluted story that starts to develop in the opening hours aren’t bad by any means, but at least so far everything has been quite predictable and retreads a lot of ground we’ve seen from JRPGs of the past. This is especially true of the characters I met during my explorations, like the ditzy by wholesome Isla and the stoic and no-nonsense Viktor, both of whom I feel like I’ve seen half a hundred times already. But this is the beginning of a JRPG, so in all likelihood it’s just going to take a while for the story to start rolling or for characters to show their true colors to any level of satisfaction, leaving plenty of opportunity for my concerns to disappear given more time.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I would be remiss if I didn’t mention that Atelier Yumia marks the first time the series will appear on the Xbox platform, and as a Westerner who would quite like more JRPGs to be readily available, that’s pretty awesome to see. Achievement unlocked!</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The option to romance NPC characters in RPGs has been around for a long time, and even recent titles like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review-whats-old-is-new-again/1900-6418333/" data-ref-id="1900-6418333">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a> offer that feature to players. However, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/avowed-review-too-close-to-the-sun/1900-6418335/" data-ref-id="1900-6418335">Avowed</a> is bucking that trend by almost completely removing players' ability to court their companions. According to Avowed director Carrie Patel, she made the decision to downplay romance because she felt it takes away from the experience of playing the game.</p><p>While appearing on IGN's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FB9qwiskL18&amp;list=PL99PCYdTX-vcBZW5aQAHlTHZr08eO4Vnj&amp;index=1&amp;pp=iAQB" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unlocked</a> podcast, Patel revealed that she believes the romantic options in RPGs "undermine that core experience" and practically invite players to focus more on the romance than on the story or even the characters themselves. Instead, Patel favored a more natural form of bonding with the player's companions that doesn't end with two characters in bed.</p><p>"My hope with players and their companion relationships in Avowed is that they would feel natural, and players would get out of them exactly what they want and exactly as much as they put in," said Patel. She added that it was supposed to be like "you're getting to know some new friends."</p><p>That decision may make Avowed an outlier in the genre, especially since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/baldurs-gate-3-review-let-freedom-reign/1900-6418131/" data-ref-id="1900-6418131">Baldur's Gate 3</a> had so many romantic options to choose from. Thus far, Xbox Game Studios and Obsidian Entertainment haven't announced how many copies Avowed has sold since its release on February 18. The game received <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-companions-wont-nag-you-as-much-about-getting-better-armor-after-day-one-patch/1100-6529570/" data-ref-id="1100-6529570">a day-one patch earlier this week</a> to address some of the issues found in it. The developers have previously explained why Avowed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-not-being-open-world-is-a-good-thing-devs-say/1100-6529022/" data-ref-id="1100-6529022">isn't an open-world game</a>, but fortunately there is still <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-is-full-of-discoveries-and-the-freedom-to-find-them-or-not/1100-6527918/" data-ref-id="1100-6527918">a lot of territory that can be explored</a>.</p><p>Avowed is available on Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass, and subscribers to those services <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-members-can-upgrade-to-avoweds-90-premium-edition-for-a-fraction-of-the-price/1100-6529257/" data-ref-id="1100-6529257">have an option to upgrade to the premium version</a> at a greatly reduced cost.</p>
