              <p><span>Over the years </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-spotlight-story-vendetta-cinematic-new-heroes-2000665327"><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span>’s heroes</span></a><span>, which once included characters of various ages and (sometimes) shapes and sizes, have largely started conforming to a particular trend. Nowadays, a lot of its heroes are what most people would consider conventionally attractive, young, and ripe for dressing up in crossover skins. Why is this? Well, some fans theorize that it’s for the obvious draw that comes with putting hot people in your game, but Blizzard says there’s actually a little more to it than that.</span></p>  <p><span>In an interview with </span><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/yes-overwatch-characters-have-been-getting-sexier-but-not-for-the-obvious-reason/1100-6537888/"><i><span>GameSpot</span></i></a><span>, </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>senior producer Kenny Hudson was asked about whether or not this trend has taken hold of the game’s hero roster, with even four of its five upcoming heroes seeming to fit the bill as the game heads into its revamp next week with </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-cinematic-doomfist-vendetta-death-reign-talon-2000665013"><span>a new Season One</span></a><span>. According to him, it’s because such characters make designing skins easier, as opposed to doing so for characters like the robot-piloting hamster Wrecking Ball, which puts the team in “crisis” mode.</span></p>

 <p><span>“Something that we kind of look into when we’re doing our heroes is how can we make them unique, but still give them a good platform, proportionally, height, scale proportion to not only build cosmetics for them and future-proof things, but to stop the technical hurdles of other things,” Hudson said. “So, one of the things that really helps with that is if you give longer limbs, taller legs, a bigger core, it actually makes it easier for our artists to physically put new geometry on those models. And so, that’s how it kind of turns out.”</span></p> <p><span>Art director Dion Rogers gave us a similar answer when we asked </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-collab-skins-mercy-kiriko-juno-lucio-sanrio-2000665321"><span>why some characters get more skins than others</span></a><span>, saying that some of the collaboration skins the team designed were just easier to put on characters like Mercy or Kiriko. However, the team is hoping that that will be changing in 2026 and it can get back to more “oddball” heroes.</span></p>

 <p><span>“Now we’re in this realm where we can make more Jetpack Cats because we’ve learned all these lessons,” Hudson said.</span></p> <p><span>After </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-name-change-season-21-cinematic-spotlight-2000665046"><span>dropping the </span><i><span>2 </span></i><span>from its name</span></a><span>, </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>is getting a bit of a reboot next week on February 10, with a new season, story content, and five new heroes all dropping on day one.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>One of the creators behind <em>Doom</em> and one of the lead developers directing the franchise today replied to a terminally ill fan’s touching post about how he’s spending his final weeks alive playing <em>Doom Eternal</em> on a PS5 in a hospital room.</p> <p>On January 31, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/1qsei9w/my_days_are_nearing_and_my_local_hospital_allowed/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=post_title&amp;embed_host_url=https://kotaku.com/wp/wp-admin/post.php">Wanderingrader123 posted a sad but powerful story to Reddit</a> explaining that he has been battling Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma cancer since 2022. However, his situation hasn’t improved, and doctors say he possibly only has weeks to live. The Toronto hospital he is in offered to fulfill any request he had during his remaining time, and he asked if you could play <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-doom-dark-ages-review-is-it-good-xbox-ps5-game-pass-1851779839">2025’s <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em></a><em>,</em> saying he’s been a fan of the series since 2016, and the reboot and sequel, <em>Doom Eternal</em>, have helped him through some “tough times.” However, due to “financial issues” he has been unable to play through <em>Dark Ages.</em> Thankfully, the hospital got him a PS5 and a copy of the game, and he’s currently ripping and tearing his way through it.</p>

 <p>“I may not live to see the upcoming DLC, but I am nonetheless happy to finally play the game in my own hands,” said Wanderingrader123. “To the developers of ID Software, thank you for bringing such a beautiful piece of art that not only brought the FPS genre to its roots, but also revitalize and reinvented the wheel that no other game could. Not only that, but thank you for crafting such an awesome series for a fan like me.”</p>   <p>His post and story caught the attention of id game director Hugo Martin, who has served as the lead developer on the recent <em>Doom</em> games, including<em> Dark Ages.</em></p>

 <p>“Thank you so much for your support and know that all of id salutes you brother,” replied Martin on Reddit. “I tell the team all the time, people care about our games, we have to put the same amount of care into making them. It has been the honor of our professional lives making these past three games for fans like you. To make the Slayer feel STRONG in <em>DOOM</em>, we infuse him with all the attributes of a true old school hero: we give him strength, courage and heart… we make him like you. RIP AND TEAR, my friend. You are the real Slayer.”</p>

 <p>Wanderingrader123’s bittersweet post also caught the attention of John Romero himself, one of the original developers who helped create <em>Doom</em> and id Software back in the 1990s.</p> <p>“I am so moved and honored that you carried <em>DOOM</em> with you for a decade and chose to live in <em>DOOM</em> as your journey nears its end,” posted Romero. “You are the definition of bravery and courage. You are the reason <em>DOOM</em> exists.”</p> <p>“When we made <em>DOOM</em>, we wanted to create a world where you felt powerful even in the face of overwhelming odds. Knowing that it has been a companion to you, something familiar, something steady, something alive, means more to me than I can properly put into words. You are not alone in that hospital room. You are standing in a place millions of us have stood, fighting. Every enemy, every level, every moment matters because you do. Thank you for sharing this part of your life with us. Thank you for bringing <em>DOOM</em> with you. Rip and tear—with love and respect.”</p>

 <p>Beyond these <em>Doom</em> devs, the wider <em>Doom</em> community replied to Wanderingrader123’s post, sharing words of encouragement and commending the poster for his bravery.&nbsp; The outpouring of love and support led to Wanderingrader123 responding. Here’s his full reply:</p> <blockquote><p>“I want to thank you all for the kind support you have given over in the past 24 hours. I’ll admit, I was very hesitant and reluctant even to make such a post due to the nature of my condition. No amount of words can describe the overwhelming kindness you have given me since I posted. Not only from the fans but to also the developers as well. I have recieved massive amounts of DMs, which I am incredibly grateful of, though, I won’t be able to get through most. Still, I am grateful nonetheless. It is an extreme privilege to be in a welcoming community such as r/<em>Doom</em> and be able to share this post. I am currently having a blast beating up demons with the flail.”</p> <p>“And for people wondering, I am actually in the Toronto General Hospital in Downtown, Toronto, Ontario. But for the sake of both my privacy and my family, I will not divulge my location further than that. Please and thank you for respecting my privacy, as well as the massive support. I will use the time that I have left to not only enjoy myself but to also spend time with my family and friends. Thank you again, everyone!”</p></blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>ProbablyMonsters, the studio behind last year's <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/storm-lancers">Storm Lancers</a>, has revealed Nekome: Nazi Hunter, a third-person action game where – you guessed it – you kill a lot of nazis. The game's release date and playable platforms remain to be announced, but if the idea of getting revenge against nazi soldiers during World War II sounds like a great time, it's a game you might want to keep an eye on.&nbsp;</p><p>"In Nekome: Nazi Hunter, players step into the role of Vano Nastasu, a young Romani man consumed by grief after the brutal murder of his family by nazi soldiers," a press release reads. "The game follows Vano's transformation from hunter to hunter as he embarks on a violent personal odyssey of revenge across war-torn Europe."&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Check out the Nekome: Nazi Hunter announcement trailer below:&nbsp;</strong></p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cfi7rGaz3gg"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cfi7rGaz3gg" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>ProbablyMonsters says its game approaches the Second World War from a personal perspective, as you play as Vano, a man not trying to end the war (though I imagine he'd like to do that), but set on exacting revenge on every nazi he comes across. To do so, players will "scout enemy routes, plan their assaults, and strike with precision in a mix of stealth and brutal, up-close combat." If the trailer above is any indication, the combat is indeed brutal, violent, and bloody.&nbsp;</p><p>The studio says Nekome: Nazi Hunter's visuals are inspired by grindhouse cinema and that the game features visceral combat, complete with grounded finishing moves. Though the announcement trailer is short, the screenshots below might give you a better look at what to expect in the game:&nbsp;</p><p>More information about Nekome: Nazi Hunter will be released at GDC next month.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>What do you think of Nekome: Nazi Hunter's reveal?

              <p>Nintendo investors are taking <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>‘s sales struggle hard.<em> Maybe Black Myth: Wukong</em> coming to Switch 2 can turn things around. And who is left to lead <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>? It’s another edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news, rumors, and culture. I’m still bummed about <a href="https://kotaku.com/outer-worlds-2-avowed-obsidian-rpgs-sales-outer-worlds-3-2000665352">yesterday’s report that <em>The Outer Worlds</em> franchise</a> is essentially on ice after last year’s entry struggled to sell. It’s an exceptionally solid immersive sim RPG that feels like it’s on the verge of being something truly special. But those <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-microsoft-price-hike-game-pass-layoffs-new-console-2000638546">30-percent profit margins</a> on games given away for free on Game Pass are a killer.</p> <h2>Nintendo gets hammered</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Many Japanese gaming companies' stocks took a big hit in the Japanese stock market today! via <a href="https://twitter.com/serkantoto?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@serkantoto</a> </p> <p>• Nintendo -12.3%<br>• Capcom -9.1%<br>• Konami -7.7%<br>• Koei Tecmo -6.3%<br>• Sony -4.2%<br>• Kadokawa (FromSoftware parent) -3.9%<br>• Square Enix -3.4%<br>• Bandai Namco -3.4%<br>•… <a href="https://t.co/tnJuY2cZHG">https://t.co/tnJuY2cZHG</a> <a href="https://t.co/WxWBGrA4hq">pic.twitter.com/WxWBGrA4hq</a></p> <p>— Genki✨ (@Genki_JPN) <a href="https://twitter.com/Genki_JPN/status/2019025986139148481?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 4, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The Mario maker’s share price in Japan dropped 11 percent this week over worse-than-expected profitability despite the Switch 2 continuing to be a launch-year juggernaut. Fans might think the concerns stem from questions about the new device’s mixed year-one lineup, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-04/nintendo-dives-10-after-disappointing-profit-spurs-margin-fears">but <em>Bloomberg</em> reports</a> that it comes down to worries about increasing production costs and pressure from U.S. tariffs.</p>

 <p>But it’s not the only video game stock getting crushed. Many publishers continue to be down days after Google’s new Genie AI tool rollout <a href="https://kotaku.com/video-game-stocks-down-take-two-gta-nintendo-roblox-unity-google-ai-game-maker-2000664594">sent share prices spiraling</a>. While Nintendo is the hardest hit, Capcom and Konami are all suffering as well, not to mention Roblox, Unity, and even Take-Two in the U.S.</p> <h2>Another <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> veteran is out</h2> <p>Luc Couture has been a level designer on the stealth action franchise since the beginning, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-veteran-designer-leaves-ubisoft-two-decades/"><em>Insider Gaming</em> reports</a>. “Today was my last day at Ubisoft Montreal,”&nbsp;he wrote <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7424588173462183936/">on LinkedIn</a>.&nbsp;“It’s been an incredible journey that lasted more than 20 years….During that time, I have learned a lot about game development, relationships and myself. I even met my wife and mother of my children because of Ubisoft colleague…so how blessed am I….right? But I was recently in need for some change. So that’s why I will soon pivot to tackling new challenges as part of a smaller studio with other veterans. Times are exciting.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Last week, <strong>Blizzard Entertainment</strong> announced a flurry of showcase events, one for each of its major titles: <a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzard-announces-showcases-for-world-of-warcraft-diablo-hearthstone-and-overwatch-all-within-the-next-two-weeks/"><strong>World of Warcraft, Overwatch 2, Hearthstone</strong>, and <strong>Diablo IV</strong></a>. The World of Warcraft showcase happened at the end of last week, with Blizzard digging into its <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-roadmap-housing-blizzcon-2026/">World of Warcraft roadmap for 2026</a></strong>. Today, it followed up with the <strong>Overwatch Spotlight,</strong> announcing <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24246206/overwatch-spotlight-the-reign-of-talon-begins/">what to expect for the coming year</a>, and a significant change to the game going forward: it's no longer called <strong>Overwatch 2</strong>, and will instead just be called '<strong>Overwatch</strong>' once again.</p>



<p>Towards the end of the 35-minute spotlight, Overwatch game director <strong>Aaron Keller</strong> began to explain the decision to drop the '2' from the game's title by saying, "<em>Overwatch is a living universe that keeps growing, keeps surprising, and keeps bringing players together from around the world. This team is focused on continually delivering these great experiences for years to come</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>And with that, we realized, Overwatch is a game that transcends any single number. So moving forward,</em> <em><strong>we're dropping the '2,' and continuing simply as Overwatch</strong>.</em>"</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Overwatch Spotlight | Premieres Feb 4 at 10am PST" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/moRmc0a8NI8?start=1875&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>It's a tangible change indicating how the team at Blizzard is looking to reinvent and overhaul the game, though that is, of course, coming with more than just a change to the name. The game will introduce <strong>10 new heroes</strong> over the course of 2026, as it kicks off a new, <strong>annual story arc</strong> that will start with a new <strong>Season 1</strong> next week on <strong>February 10, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>The opening story event is the <strong>Reign of Talon</strong>, which was introduced with a cinematic at the top of the spotlight, where Vendetta defeated Doomfist to take what was rightfully hers. The story for Reign of Talon will be told through upcoming hero trailers, animated comics, in-game events, map updates and short stories released by the team in the coming year. This is also the new storytelling structure that Blizzard will continue with moving forward.</p>



<p>"<em>For the first time ever, we're telling an annual story with a beginning, middle, and end</em>," said Keller during the Spotlight. "<em>A story that evolves across all six seasons of the year before a new Season 1 launches the next chapter in 2027. This is going to be epic</em>."</p>



<p>Out of the 10 new heroes that'll be joining the game across 2026, <strong>five of them will arrive in Season 1</strong>. Those five heroes are: <strong>Domina (Tank), Emre (Damage), Mizuki (Support), Anran (Damage), </strong>and <strong>Jetpack Cat (Support)</strong>. The new season will also make changes to the core roles of the game, with Tank, Damage, and Support heroes now all categorized into sub-classes within their main class role.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Overwatch-2026-Season-1-Heroes.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Overwatch 2026 Season 1 Heroes, from left to right: Jetpack Cat, Anran, Emre, Mizuki, Domina. Image credit: Blizzard Entertainment</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Tanks will include <strong>Brusier, Initiator, </strong>and <strong>Stalwart</strong> sub-classes. A Brusier Tank (Mauga, Orisa, Roadhog, Zarya) receives reduced critical damage and gains movement speed when their health is at critical levels. An Initiator Tank (D.Va, Doomfist, Winston, Wrecking Ball) reclaims some of its health while staying airborne. Lastly, a Stalwart Tank (Domina, Hazard, Junker Queen, Ramattra, Reinhardt, Sigma) has reduced knockback and slows.</p>



<p>Damage heroes are split into four sub-classes: <strong>Sharpshooter, Flanker, Specialist,</strong> and <strong>Recon</strong>. Sharpshooters (Ashe, Cassidy, Hanzo, Sojourn, Widowmaker) get their movement ability cooldowns reduced with critical hits. Flankers (Anran, Genji, Reaper, Tracer, Vendetta, Venture) get more health from using a health pack. Specialists (Bastion, Emre, Junkrat, Mei, Solider 76, Symmetra, Torbjorn) get their reload speed briefly increased after a kill, and Recon heroes (Echo, Freja, Pharah, Sombra) will be able to detect enemies through walls after you damage them and they have less than half their health.</p>



<p>Finally, Support heroes are broken into three sub-classes: <strong>Tactician, Medic,</strong> and <strong>Survivor</strong>. Tacticians (Ana, Baptiste, Jetpack Cat, Lucio, Zenyatta) gain excess ultimate charge that carries over even after using their ultimate ability. Medics (Kiriko, Lifeweaver, Mercy, Moira) heal themselves while also healing others with their weapons, and Survivors (Brigitte, Illari, Juna, Mizuki, Wuyang) activate passive health regeneration when using their movement abilities.</p>



<p>Season 1 will also introduce a new Conquest Meta Event, where players take sides fighting for either Overwatch or Talon, completing missions that tie into the lore of the game, with the rewards from the event going to whichever side was able to complete more missions. You'll be able to switch sides after completing your current faction's weekly pass.</p>



<p>The UI/UX overhaul is the other major change that'll be introduced with Season 1, with Blizzard hoping the new look will "<em>restore some personality and hero-centric vibes while in-game</em>."</p>

<p>Lastly, the new season will also include new mythic skins, <a href="https://wccftech.com/overwatch-2-x-street-fighter-6-kicks-off-today-bringing-new-skins-signature-special-moves-as-emotes-and-more/">collaborations,</a> and other cosmetics, with the first collaboration of 2026 bringing <strong>Hello Kitty</strong> into Overwatch. As for when Season 2 will kick off, the roadmap shared for the year has its arrival pinned for somewhere during <strong>Spring 2026</strong>, with a new hero to be introduced, the arrival of the <strong>Nintendo Switch 2 </strong>version, and likely more than a few celebratory events planned around the <strong>10-year anniversary</strong> of Overwatch.</p>

              <p><span>Motoaki Furukawa, the former Konami composer behind the likes of </span><i><span>Policenauts</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Snatcher </span></i><span>and the Nintendo 64 version of </span><i><span>Castlevania</span></i><span>, and Pixel Co., a small Nintendo Switch-focused Japanese dev team, have lost their respective legal battles against each other regarding the abandoned crowdsourced shoot ‘em up </span><i><span>Steam Pilots</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><i><span>Steam Pilots</span></i><span> was crowdfunded via Japanese crowdfunding site Makuake through two separate campaigns, both of which were created in 2019. The two campaigns managed to raise a combined 11,022,700 yen. This amounts to roughly $70,000 USD today, but was closer to $90,000 in 2019.</span></p>

 <p><span>In January 2022, Pixel Co. director Hidekuni Sasaki revealed in a </span><a href="https://x.com/pixel_japan/status/1478369068273266688"><span>post on X</span></a><span> that it was ceasing development on </span><i><span>Steam Pilots</span></i><span>, after allegedly not having received any form of payment in the two years they’d worked on the project. </span><a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/20220105-8183/"><span>According to a representative</span></a><span> at Makuake, the total amount from both crowdfunding campaigns had been fully passed to Furukawa at this stage. Two months after Sasaki’s initial statement, Furukawa announced through </span><i><span>Steam Pilots’ </span></i><span>second Makuake page that a second developer had been brought on to replace Pixel Co.</span></p>   <p><span>From there, a legal battle ensued. Pixel Co. launched a suit against Furukawa in March 2022, seeking to recoup its lost development costs. Furukawa launched a countersuit of his own in 2023, in which he sought compensation for damages and alleged emotional distress caused by Pixel Co.’s CEO.</span></p>

 <p><span>As detailed in a report by </span><a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/japanese-game-company-and-ex-konami-composer-lose-lawsuits-against-each-other-after-collapse-of-crowdfunded-project/"><i><span>Automaton</span></i></a><span>, this all came to a head on January 30 when a Japanese court ruled that neither party would receive compensation for their alleged damages. However, Pixel Co.’s president has been ordered to pay Furukawa 40,000 yen (roughly $2,600) following his emotional distress lawsuit.</span></p>

 <p><span>In a </span><a href="https://x.com/pixel_japan/status/2017206252775076062"><span>post on X</span></a><span>, Pixel Co. stated that they find the ruling “to be deeply regrettable,” and that they believe the outcome “has the potential to cause serious disadvantages for the entire game industry.” Pixel Co. signed off by stating, “Regarding our future course of action, we will make an announcement at a later date. That is all.”</span></p> <p>But while <em>Steam Pilots</em> is dead, out of the wreckage of that retro shoot ’em up was born<em> Bounty Sisters</em>, <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/07/bounty-sisters-is-a-promising-new-shoot-em-up-from-the-wreckage-of-crowdfunding-disaster-steam-pilots">a very similar game</a> that came to Switch in Japan just a couple of months ago.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/liberty-prime-alpha-fallout-season-two-explained/</link>
            <guid>1425871</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’ve just finished season two of the Fallout television show, you might have a few questions spinning around your head. Most critically, you might be wondering what Liberty Prime Alpha is and why it’s so important to those in the Fallout universe. This behemoth character was ‘introduced’ in the mid-credits sequence of the Fallout TV show’s second season finale, and it has some fans confused.</p>



<p>In case you’re unaware, Liberty Prime is the name of an enormous robot character in the Fallout universe, made most iconic in 2008’s Fallout 3 when it stormed into battle against the Enclave. It was seen again in 2015’s Fallout 4, but has lived in the shadows ever since.</p>



<p>But what’s <strong>Liberty Prime Alpha?</strong></p>







<h2 id="h-fallout-s-liberty-prime-alpha-is-coming">Fallout’s Liberty Prime Alpha is Coming</h2>



<p>In the closing seconds of the season two finale of Fallout, we saw blueprints for Liberty Prime Alpha, a towering robot that the Brotherhood of Steel, now led by ‘Quintus the Destroyer’, intends to build.</p>



<p>Those familiar with Fallout will instantly recognize Liberty Prime, but Liberty Prime <strong>Alpha </strong>is an entirely new construct, seen for the first time as the second season wrapped.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Liberty Prime Alpha could be the bgiger brother of this</figcaption></figure>







<p>It’s assumed that Quintus, who was betrayed by Knight Maximus in the second season of the show, will attempt to build Liberty Prime Alpha, but his intended target is unclear. Liberty Prime is an utter wrecking machine, so Liberty Prime Alpha should be borderline apocalyptic, no pun intended.</p>



<p>It’s unclear where the blueprints for Liberty Prime Alpha came from, as Maximus’ friend Dane approached Quintus with them as the mid-credits sequence played out. At that point, Area 51, the home of the Knights of San Fernando, was the site of an exploding civil war between various chapters of the Brotherhood of Steel, one of Fallout’s oldest and most recognizable factions.</p>



<p>The most likely explanation is that the blueprints were somewhere <strong>in </strong>Area 51, and that was one of the driving reasons for Quintus to relocate his chapter there and try to align with the other faction bodies.</p>







<p>Whatever happens in season three of Fallout, we might see the creation of one of the biggest robots the franchise has ever seen. Are you excited? Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

With the big update coming on February 10, players will get five new heroes (with five more coming over the rest of the season), a number of quality of life updates, new in-game events, and later this spring, an upgrade option for Nintendo Switch 2 players specifically.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Announced during today's Overwatch Spotlight 2026, it was revealed that a Nintendo Switch 2 Edition of Overwatch 2 is finally on its way later this spring. We didn't get any real details as to what the release was going to entail as of yet. Overwatch 2 is already on the Nintendo Switch and thus playable on Switch 2, but it's just the regular edition, and a Switch 2 would presumably have some upgrades attached.

It's all just Overwatch now as the game enters a "new, story-driven era" with a year-long narrative, 10 new heroes, and a major overhaul.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Announced today at the Overwatch Spotlight, Blizzard revealed its first year-long storyline, entitled "The Reign of Talon". As it sounds, the plot is going to focus on the antagonistic faction Talon as it takes over around the world, while Overwatch continues to fight back. In-game events, hero trailers, animated comics, short stories, and map updates will tell a story across six seasons rolled out throughout the entire year, beginning with the launch of five new heroes on February 10 as Season 1 begins. On the Talon side, new heroes will include Domina (tank), Emre (damage), and Mizuki (support), and on Overwatch we'll get Anran (damage) and Jetpack Cat (support). More heroes will join in the future, with a new hero added in each of Season 2-6 to come. A new story arc is planned to begin with another Season 1 in 2027.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Overwatch "The Reign of Talon" New Hero Images</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Other updates include a new Meta Event called Conquest, where players choose to align with either Overwatch or Talon over five weeks to compete for rewards including lootboxes, skins, and titles. We'll also be seeing a major UI and UX overhaul with a new hero lobby and a promise of faster navigation. And we're also getting a Hello Kitty-themed in-game event from February 10-23.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/03/spotlight-2026-roadmap-1770137812637.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Amid all of this, Blizzard is officially dropping the "2" from Overwatch 2, and referring to it going forward just as Overwatch. As a press release explains: "Overwatch is more than just a digit: it's a living universe that keeps growing, keeps surprising, and keeps bringing players together from around the world. This year marks a huge turning point in how the development team envisions the future of Overwatch, so we are officially dropping '2' and moving forward as 'Overwatch'."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The newly-dubbed "Overwatch" will also be getting an upgraded Nintendo Switch 2 edition in the spring (both the original Overwatch and Overwatch 2 are currently available on Nintendo Switch, and thus Switch 2, but do not have dedicated Switch 2 upgraded versions).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's no surprise that Blizzard might want to wipe the slate clean from the struggle that has been Overwatch 2. The sequel/revamp of 2016's popular hero shooter Overwatch <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-blizzard-apologizes-for-shaky-launch-promises-fixes-for-queues-and-more">stumbled out of the gate</a>, and while it saw a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-has-reached-over-25-million-players-in-its-first-10-days-35-million-in-its-first-month">massive surge of players at the start</a>, those numbers <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-engagement-and-player-investment-is-declining-activision-blizzard-admits">dropped in the following year</a>.

The fact remains that Overwatch 2 has never quite lived up to the hype levels of its predecessor, Overwatch, and this could be an attempt on Blizzard's part to regain some of that glory - especially by focusing so much on story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

      <p>Long-rumored cuts hit The Washington Post this morning, seeing the paper <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/media/washington-post-layoffs-sports-rcna257354?ref=aftermath.site"><u>axe</u></a> its sports and books sections and “Post Reports” podcast, drastically shrink both local and international coverage, and lay off what so far is reported to be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/business/media/washington-post-layoffs.html?ref=aftermath.site"><u>30%</u></a> of its staff. It’s a terrible day for the paper, and for journalism broadly, and absolutely none of it had to happen.&nbsp;</p><p>The cuts were announced via a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/benmullin.bsky.social/post/3mdzqnj7zi22r?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Zoom call</u></a> this morning, with executive editor Matt Murray instructing staff to stay home rather than come to the office. According to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/maxtani.bsky.social/post/3me22xvoxjs2h?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Max Tani</u></a>, Murray said the cuts were to position the paper “to become more essential to people's lives, and what is becoming a more crowded, competitive and complicated media landscape, and after some years when, candidly, the Post has had struggles to do that." After the meeting, staff were informed whether they still had jobs via email.&nbsp;</p><p>(Aftermath co-founder Nathan Grayson and I were both previously employed at The Washington Post, and our desk, Launcher, was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/washington-post-is-closing-launcher-its-highly-regarded-video-game-website?ref=aftermath.site"><u>shuttered during layoffs</u></a> in 2023.)</p><p>The Post’s struggles were certainly not caused by the staff of the paper themselves, who consistently put out good, important work in the endlessly trying circumstances of both the world at large and journalism specifically. They were certainly not caused by a lack of money, in the most essential sense; staffers have been <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2026/01/fearing-major-layoffs-current-and-former-posties-rally-around-savethepost-campaign/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>appealing for weeks</u></a> to owner Jeff Bezos, who could fund the paper forever if he felt like it, to stop the cuts.&nbsp;</p><p>Having a billionaire owner does not, of course, equate to a healthy business. The Post has been shedding subscribers since the decision to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/media/2024/10/29/washington-post-cancellations-number/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>pull an endorsement</u></a> of Kamala Harris in 2024, and continued to be in freefall as the outlet’s <a href="https://www.avclub.com/washington-post-subscriber-loss-opinion?ref=aftermath.site"><u>opinion section </u></a>was directed to swing right. Half-baked directives like the “<a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/07/22/washington-post-third-newsroom?ref=aftermath.site"><u>third newsroom</u></a>” came and went, and staff fled the paper in droves as they saw the writing on the wall. Murray and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/07/30/nx-s1-5055648/washington-post-will-lewis-phone-hacking-scandal?ref=aftermath.site"><u>scandal-ridden</u></a> publisher Will Lewis may have come in with a mandate to turn things around, but if anything have dug the hole deeper. (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/herbscribner.bsky.social/post/3me24qpgb2c2n?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Axios</u></a> reports that Lewis wasn’t even on this morning’s call.)</p><p>If Murray’s goal is for WaPo to become “more essential” to readers’ lives, less diversified coverage doesn’t seem like the way to do it. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2026/02/04/nx-s1-5699328/washington-post-layoffs-jobs-bezos?ref=aftermath.site"><u>NPR</u></a> writes that “Now the <em>Post </em>appears poised to become primarily a federal paper, seeking to appeal almost exclusively to readers interested in issues about the U.S. government, with an emphasis on national security and American politics.”&nbsp;</p><p>This is certainly a top interest of readers of the Post, and a beat it made its name on during Trump’s first term and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/interactive/2022/timeline-watergate-scandal-revelations/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>before</u></a>. But as many Post staffers pointed out in their <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/brianstelter.bsky.social/post/3mdkxym5gqc2y?ref=aftermath.site"><u>calls to Bezos</u></a> in the weeks leading up to today’s layoffs, no beat exists in a <a href="https://aftermath.site/star-reporter-talent-pr-washington-post/"><u>vacuum</u></a>: Desks shrunk or axed today, like sports and metro, provide essential knowledge and context for government and politics coverage, particularly when your local reporting covers the nation’s political hub of DC. You can’t cut some desks and assume the others will be fine; you can’t assume the paper can just do more with less, the favorite refrain of every media owner.</p><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/washpostcomms/status/2019071299667063211?ref=aftermath.site"><u>message to staff</u></a> today, Murray highlighted a declining number of stories as one problem necessitating today’s cuts, writing that the paper’s “daily story output has substantially fallen in the last five years.” He also wrote that “we too often write from one perspective, for one slice of the audience.”&nbsp;</p><p>How the solution to these problems is <em>less </em>coverage, more narrowly focused, isn’t clear, but it’s hard to take any of today’s cuts and their half-assed justifications with any kind of good faith. It’s hard not to see this as Bezos, bored or maybe even actively hostile to the paper he <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2026/feb/02/jeff-bezos-destroy-washington-post?ref=aftermath.site"><u>once supported</u></a>, either intentionally trying to destroy it, or attempting to defang it to curry favor with Trump.</p><p>All of this is personal for me, as it is for <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2026/02/washington-post-layoffs-bezos/685872/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>others</u></a> who’ve written about today’s bloodbath. I spent a day shy of a year at the Post, coming in to run a desk that was closed three months after my hire, and two months after I moved to DC for the job after over 20 years in New York. In a show of something like decency, which I did appreciate even if I wasn’t very good at expressing it, I was moved to another department rather than getting laid off with my team, and I spent a miserable season struggling to climb the stairs to where the bulk of the journalists sat without having to cry in the bathroom afterward because I wanted so badly to be sitting up there with them. But even at my own personal worst, I was awestruck by the people around me and the efforts they made so naturally to give me chances to shine: Slack messages from other desks asking for expertise on games or trans issues, meetings with teams eager to collaborate with my new team, opportunities to help lead an employee resource group or attend staff-led skill shares or just go on a lunchtime bike ride to visit the cherry blossoms at Hains Point.&nbsp;</p><p>I found the Post to be an astonishingly collaborative newsroom, where my colleagues seemed to want me there even if executives didn’t, where bosses and peers made far more effort than I deserved to meet me where I was. People shared stories of their own career setbacks and told me the Post was a place where I could bounce back, where opportunities could be open to me if I stuck it out. Even though I eventually decided to leave to start Aftermath, I still feel an admiration for and allegiance to the Post that sometimes feels unearned for the amount of time I actually spent there.</p><p>So it’s hard for me to see the big picture of today’s layoffs when they have so many specific names and faces attached, when I know first-hand how much better the people affected today deserve. That Lewis and Murray and Bezos–if Bezos is even paying attention–could look at all these people and their work and their kindness and their dedication and decide the paper would be better off without them is unthinkable to me, but I’ve long given up on trying to understand how media executives think.&nbsp;</p><p>An outlet with the talent the Post has on hand, with the resources Bezos is able to pour into it, should not be doing layoffs of this scope and scale. Not just because, essentially, it doesn’t <em>need </em>to, but because any decision-maker who’s risen to the position of calling these shots should be smart enough to look at the paper and recognize that the value of the thing they have comes from its abundance: the various desks and experts and coverage areas that all work together to make the paper what it is. A lesser paper is not going to win more subscribers or bring the company more money. A narrow focus on a particular conception of politics, at a time when Trump and his ilk are using every avenue possible–<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/02/politics/kennedy-center-trump-renovations?ref=aftermath.site"><u>the arts</u></a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/03/trump-administration-coalie-mascot-fossil-fuels?ref=aftermath.site"><u>the environment</u></a>, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/16/politics/trump-great-health-care-bill-details?ref=aftermath.site"><u>healthcare</u></a>, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/17/state-department-secret-playbook-sports-trump-00735496?ref=aftermath.site"><u>sports</u></a>, and more–to foster their agenda will not serve readers or stand up to power. It’s just going to make the Post’s coverage worse, and its staff more overworked and unhappy, and the paper less relevant to readers who need a robust free press.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Maybe this is what Bezos wants. It’s certainly what Trump and his administration want. Not just a worse paper, but a worse environment for journalism as a whole, with fewer jobs, less coverage to draw from, a shorter horizon to picture as young journalists imagine what their careers could be.&nbsp;</p><p>Immiseration is one of the ruling class’ most powerful tools these days, and that feels like the only logic today’s layoffs have. They make the public less informed, and silence current and would-be journalists without the need for <a href="https://theconversation.com/trump-lawsuits-seek-to-muzzle-media-posing-serious-threat-to-free-press-272850?ref=aftermath.site"><u>lawsuits</u></a> and <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/video/newsfeed/2026/2/4/trump-hits-out-at-reporter-for-question-on-epstein-survivors?ref=aftermath.site"><u>insults</u></a>. Today’s cuts feel like a PR move as much as a corporate one, a reminder of the <a href="https://aftermath.site/jeffrey-epstein-files-kotick-thiel-xbox-rockstar/" rel="noreferrer">power of the rich</a>, who can make worse so many lives without having to <em>do </em>anything, without even having to acknowledge it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It’s hard not to talk about the Post like it’s dead, though of course it’s not. I have every confidence the people remaining will do the best work possible with what they have in front of them, because they believe their audience deserves it, even if their executives and owner don’t. But it simply doesn’t have to be like this, not for a paper owned by one of the world’s richest men, and not for a journalism industry that’s more essential than ever.</p>

            <guid>1425835</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Last year’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/jurassic-world-rebirth-review-is-it-good-reboot-jp-film-1851785757"><em>Jurassic World Rebirth</em> was a totally fine</a>, but not very memorable<em> Jurassic Park</em> sequel. That’s been most of what we’ve gotten from the dinosaur-filled franchise over the last decade or so. But if, like me, you crave something better, something more like the original books and film, then you should check out an ongoing YouTube series that is one of my favorite things on the internet.</p> <p>YouTuber Ali Awada has been making animated <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/jurassic-park-jurassic-world-rebirth-movies-ranked-1851776876">Jurassic Park</a></em> videos since 2023. And while some of his earlier attempts weren’t highly polished, with choppy animations and weird edits, they showed that the creator understood how to produce scary videos using the world of <em>Jurassic Park</em>. And Awada’s most recent <em>Jurassic Park</em> series is a massive improvement over that past work.</p>

  <p><a href="https://youtu.be/GFuDk8PB1KU?list=PLEaHBaexswf_orH4auAn5hXD1TXhJbSYx"><em>Muldoon’s Logs</em></a> is an ongoing found-footage-like VHS horror series made up of 12- to 20-minute-long videos from the point of view of <em>Jurassic Park</em> game warden and khaki shorts lover Robert Muldoon. You know, the guy who gets eaten by a raptor in the first movie after saying, “Clever girl.” In Awada’s series, we get to see what Muldoon was up to before the movie, as he helped run the park and manage its dinos.</p> <p>Each installment features Muldoon checking on various dinosaurs while dealing with a mystery involving rogue velociraptors that keep causing problems. Where these raptors come from, how they got into different parts of the park, and who is to blame are questions the series has been teasing for weeks now with each new upload. And I’m hooked.</p>

 <p><em>Muldoon’s Logs</em> aren’t the scariest YouTube videos around, but instead are more of a slow burn. You get a lot of time to just chill with Muldoon as he interacts with the dinos or investigates different scenarios. This builds the tension as you know something bad or scary is going to happen before the video ends. And when that happens, like a raptor appearing where it shouldn’t or a T-Rex chase, it’s exciting and tense.</p>

  <p><em>Muldoon’s Logs</em> are a great example of how <em>Jurassic Park</em> can be the perfect franchise for horror-adjacent projects and movies, something the franchise proper doesn’t do enough of. Dinosaurs stalking around is creepy stuff, and Awada taps into that, with the VHS aesthetic helping to hide some of the limitations while also making it all feel more real. I hope the upcoming horror game <a href="https://kotaku.com/finally-we-got-some-new-gameplay-of-that-scary-looking-jurassic-park-game-2000617830"><em>Jurassic Park Survival</em></a> is as scary or scarier than <em>Muldoon’s Logs.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>And for <em>Jurassic Park</em> lore nerds, you’ll enjoy all the large and small references to the movies, games, and books, including characters from the Telltale <em>Jurassic Park</em> game being name-dropped and Awada skillfully explaining why the Dilophosaur is so different in the novel compared to the film. In fact, something I really appreciate about <em>Muldoon’s Logs</em> is how often the writing reminds me of the technical, science-heavy dialogue found in Michael Crichton’s original books.</p>

 <p>If you’e a <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-best-worst-and-weirdest-jurassic-park-games-1826918812"><em>Jurassic Park</em></a> fan and/or someone who enjoys VHS found-footage horror, <em>Muldoon’s Logs</em> are perfect for popping on at night in a dark room and getting lost in a creepy, tense atmosphere.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/blizzard-entertainment/" id="87642">Blizzard </a>confirms <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/overwatch/" id="197">Overwatch </a>will drop the “2,” launching a year-long Reign of Talon story arc with new heroes and seasons through 2026.</p>



<p>During the Overwatch Spotlight on February 4, Blizzard announced that not only are they launching the first year-long story for Overwatch with the “Reign of Talon” plot, but moving forward, the game would simply be known as Overwatch again. Season one of the new format begins on February 10. This arc will run through 2026, with five additional seasons, after which a new story arc will begin with season 1 in 2027.</p>



<p>Along with the new season will come the launch of five new heroes. Three of the heroes will be Talon-aligned: Domina, a tank hero; Emre, a damage hero; and Mizuki, a support hero. There will also be two Overwatch-aligned heroes: Anran (damage) and Jetpack Cat (support).</p>

<h2 id="h-the-reason-for-the-shift-away-from-overwatch-2-explained">The Reason for the Shift Away From Overwatch 2 Explained</h2>



<p>In a press release, the Overwatch team explained that they’re dropping the “2” from the game title because they believe the game is more than a number or an expansion; it’s a living universe, and this year marks a turning point in development.</p>



<p>“This year marks a huge turning point in how the development team envisions the future of Overwatch, so we are officially dropping the ‘2’ and moving forward as Overwatch,” they said.</p>



<p>Overwatch officially became Overwatch 2 in 2022, shifting to a 5v5 PVP-style game. In May 2023, Blizzard canceled planned hero missions for the game, which were to have RPG-style skill trees. The cancellation was due to the risk of diverting too many development resources from the live service game. </p>







<p>Now, the game again shifts focus and makes a new attempt to reach more players while still giving current players something to look forward to.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Overwatch 2 Ditches The Number In Huge Overhaul, Switch 2 Version Announced]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/overwatch-2-ditches-the-number-in-huge-overhaul-switch-2-version-announced</link>
            <guid>1425808</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Big changes are coming to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/overwatch">Overwatch 2</a> <em>very</em> soon, with a brand new season dropping on 10th February. But the biggest change comes in the form of a new name.</p>
<p>Announced <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24246206/overwatch-spotlight-the-reign-of-talon-begins/">today</a> during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Sgnn72e9Y">Overwatch 2026 spotlight</a>, the game's director Aaron Keller announced that Overwatch 2 is ditching the number, meaning it'll simply be known as <strong>Overwatch</strong> now.</p>
<p>But the 2 is still important, <em>because</em> Blizzard's hero shooter is in fact coming to Switch 2 later this year. We don't have a date just yet — <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/overwatch-proper-switch-2-version-coming">Eurogamer</a> has reportedly been told around mid-April — but the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/overwatch">Switch 2 version</a> will be launching alongside Season 2.</p>
<p>Season 1, called <strong>The Reign of Talon</strong>, was unveiled today and arrives next week, and it aims to kick of a yearlong, multi-faceted story that'll last six seasons. Ten new heroes will be coming to the game in 2026, with five of them coming when Season 1 lands.</p>
<p>The first five heroes are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Domina</strong>, a 'poke' tank who focuses on long-range attacks and zone play.</li>
<li><strong>Emre</strong>, a damage-dealer who focuses on fast run-and-gun gunplay</li>
<li><strong>Mizuki</strong>, a support unit who is mysterious and focuses on close-quarters gameplay</li>
<li><strong>Anran</strong>, a second damage-dealer who can manipulate fire with her fan-like weapons — you'll be able to test Anran out with a Hero Trial from 5th February.</li>
<li><strong>Jetpack Cat</strong>, a support-unit and maybe the best Overwatch character ever. Yes. (she's fast and reactive)</li>
</ul>
<p>The remaining five will be revealed later.</p>


<p>Other changes coming to the game include new sub-roles and passives for each class, a Conquest meta event that runs for five weeks, yearly competitive updates, an complete UI refresh, changes to Stadium, a Sanrio collaboration, and tons of new cinematics, in-game events, and comics to help flesh out the story.</p>
<p>We're really just picking out a few things here, and we can't overstate just how much the team seem to be changing things up, You can read about everything coming to Overwatch in more detail over on the <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24246206/overwatch-spotlight-the-reign-of-talon-begins/">official Overwatch website</a>.</p>

<p>So, while Season 1 drops next week, we'll have to wait a bit longer for a fully-fresh Overwatch experience on Switch 2. The Switch 1 version isn't exactly the ideal way to play the game, either, and like many others, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/overwatch-2">we were disappointed with it</a> when it launched in 2022.</p>
<p>These updates, though? They sound like a big step in the right direction</p>

<p>Posting on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/margaretkrohn_i-waited-until-today-to-share-this-because-activity-7424559850921279489-9q_T?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAANxzosB8Nu3u0E3e0D-T9TYAyXUCoJsByM">LinkedIn</a>, former director of communications Margaret Krohn has written a longer account of this week's job losses, beginning with the comment that “Intrepid Studios has shut down in a way that I did not expect.” </p>
<p>Krohn writes that she was informed by people up the ladder that Intrepid would lay off 100 people on 28th January. The next day, Krohn shared this info in secrecy with her Game Services team. “I told them that changes were coming, that I did not yet know who would be affected, and that I wished I had more certainty to offer," she recalls. "I could not live with myself if I did not give them advance notice - these are people who deserve to be treated like human beings.”</p>
<p>On January 30th, having gotten confirmation of who would be affected, Krohn spoke individually with members of her team. “Those who were staying began working on ways to move forward,” she continues. “Even those who knew they would be leaving offered their support”. </p><p>But then, on 31st January, “we were all informed via a confusing email that we would be laid off, along with a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification] notice.” Despite the WARN notice, Krohn says that “none of us are receiving our final paychecks, the 60 days notice and pay outlined under the WARN Act, PTO payouts, or other compensation owed”.</p>
<p>You can read about the WARN act <a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/layoffs/warn">on the US government website</a>. According to an accompanying brochure, an employee who qualifies for protection under the act “must receive a written notice 60 days before the date of a mass layoff or plant closing” and is otherwise entitled “to seek damages for back pay and benefits for up to 60 days, depending on how many days’ notice you actually received”. </p>
<p>Krohn has a few words for players of Ashes Of Creation, writing that “the entire development team was working extremely hard, pulling long hours, and wishes with all our hearts that we could give you Ashes of Creation. There are no words that fully express how sorry we are that this journey ended this way. You should pursue a refund, you deserve it.”</p>
<p>There’s ambiguity about whether Ashes Of Creation players are in a position to seek refunds. According to the original 2017 Kickstarter pitch, backers were entitled to one if the game never made it to release. The game did come out in Steam early access this December, attracting mixed reactions. There’s a lot of speculation that Intrepid rushed out an unfinished version simply to avoid that Kickstarter refund provision. </p><p>Other players are suspicious of creative director Steven Sharif, who left the company shortly before the mass layoffs, after allegedly disagreeing with Intrepid’s board. It’s not clear who Intrepid’s board members are (I’ve made a few enquiries), and some players have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AshesofCreation/comments/1qsm3r2/the_board_composed_of_me_and_my_husband/">pounced on the fact</a> that only Sharif and his husband are listed as company officers in a California state filing from December 2025. Is Sharif blaming his own mishandling of Intrepid on a fantasy board? The counterargument there is that the document in question doesn’t require companies to list every board member.</p>
<p>Krohn has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AshesofCreation/comments/1qv4e9n/comment/o3f5n02/">addressed some of these claims on Reddit</a>, with the caveat that “I was just the person running marketing, communications, social, CS, etc. I had departments that I was focused on.  I was not privy to senior C-level leadership information.” Regarding Sharif, she <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AshesofCreation/comments/1qv4e9n/comment/o3fhhw6/?context=3">writes</a> that "[f]rom my experience, Steven was always kind, generous, and looked out for us. This has been heartbreaking.”</p>
<p>Following the layoff reports, Steam quietly removed Ashes Of Creation from sale. I’ll ask what remains of Intrepid for comment on Krohn’s allegations about final pay and notice periods. Best of luck to the devs affected.</p>

<p>Keen to learn more about the origins of this title and Sasaki's influence on its final form, I was lucky enough to speak to <strong>Quanah Sugiyama</strong> (4PGP Project Manager at publisher <a href="https://3goo.co.jp/company-profile-eng/">3goo</a>), <strong>Jonathan Marolle</strong> (Game Director at developer <a href="http://www.visionreelle.fr/">Vision Reelle</a>) and even the great man himself, <strong>Kenji Sasaki</strong> (Project Advisor).</p>

<p><strong>Nintendo Life: Can you give us some background on your team's racing game pedigree? What notable titles have the core team worked on previously?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Quanah Sugiyama:</strong> As a publisher, 3goo brings extensive experience in marketing and releasing racing games in Japan, including acclaimed franchises such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/gear_club_unlimited">Gear.Club Unlimited</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/wrc_10_the_official_game">WRC</a>. Our portfolio spans a wide range of racing genres—from hardcore simulation titles like <strong>Rennsport</strong> to open-world experiences such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/test_drive_unlimited_solar_crown">Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, our director, Jonathan, is a veteran developer with over 20 years of experience in racing game development, having worked on major franchises including Test Drive Unlimited, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/crew">The Crew</a>, and Gear.Club Unlimited. With this combined expertise in development, publishing, and global racing franchises, we are highly confident in our ability to both create and successfully bring racing games to market.</p>
<p><strong>Nintendo Life: F1-based racers come in all shapes and sizes, with some going for intense realism while others are more arcade-like. Where does 4PGP sit on this scale, and what titles have inspired it directly?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Quanah Sugiyama:</strong> From a gameplay standpoint, 4PGP firmly embraces its arcade roots. The controls are simple and intuitive, complemented by a turbo system for instant bursts of speed. At the same time, it is designed to deliver a true formula racing experience, where success depends on well-timed braking, precise steering, and learning the optimal racing line.</p>

<p>Visually, we aimed for a careful balance. The game captures the sleek, high-speed look of real formula cars while adding a colourful, approachable style. We made sure not to lean too far into a cartoonish look, as to keep the “coolness” factor of formula racing intact.</p>
<p><strong>Nintendo Life: You're clearly aiming at offering an accessible, family-friendly experience with 4PGP, but how are you making sure it will be challenging enough to tempt genre veterans?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Quanah Sugiyama:</strong> Just like our favourite classic arcade racers, 4PGP follows the timeless philosophy of “easy to pick up and play, yet challenging to master.” Players begin on lower difficulty settings, where top speeds are reduced, and the handling is more forgiving, allowing anyone to jump in and have fun immediately.</p>
<p>At higher difficulty levels, though, the game becomes far more demanding: cars are significantly faster, rivals more aggressive, and even a small mistake can cost you the entire race. Truly mastering the game requires learning each track inside and out, maintaining focus throughout intense twists and turns, and skillfully managing both tyre wear and the turbo gauge.</p>
<p><strong>Nintendo Life: You've gone for classic '90s liveries for many of the included cars. What made you pick this era of F1 in particular?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jonathan Marolle:</strong> In the world of motorsports, some cars are truly timeless. Across generations, they are instantly recognisable—even to those who aren’t racing fans or lifelong petrolheads—thanks to their legendary liveries and unmistakable silhouettes. The drivers who piloted these machines became icons in their own right, known around the world by people of all ages, similar to Hollywood actors or pop stars.</p>
<p>This golden era fits the game perfectly. It captures the spirit of 1990s arcade racing, celebrating iconic cars that everyone knows and remembers. On a personal level, these machines hold a special place for me—I genuinely love them, and that passion is woven directly into the game.</p>
<p><strong>Nintendo Life: For players raised on, say, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, what would you say 4PGP offers that makes it worth a look?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jonathan Marolle</strong><strong>:</strong> Mario Kart 8 and Mario Kart World are incredible games. I play them every week with my sons, and they’re always a blast. But when you’re looking for intense racing with real cars, there’s simply nothing quite like that available today. 4PGP aims to fill that gap. It delivers the instant fun, accessibility, and competitive challenge of a kart racer, but set in the world of motorsport, designed from the ground up for four players.</p>

<p>Also, speaking as someone who was once a child himself, I know that kids don’t like being treated like kids. So, giving them the option to race cool, semi-realistic cars, rather than go-kart-type vehicles geared towards a younger demographic, is something I think younger generations will really appreciate.</p>
<p><strong>Nintendo Life: What has it been like working with a genre legend like Kenji Sasaki, and how deep has his involvement been with the game? Did Sasaki-san demand any sweeping changes to the game at any point during its development period, for example, and was he involved from the very beginning?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Quanah Sugiyama:</strong> Sasaki-san has been on board with us since the project formally kicked off, providing invaluable insight across a wide range of areas, including UX, graphics, controls, game balance, and music, which helped make the game feel like an authentic 1990s arcade racer. While we had prototypes prior to his involvement with the racing mechanics, tracks and vehicles fleshed out, the UI, HUD, and overall colour scheme underwent major reworking under his supervision.</p>
<p><strong>Nintendo Life: How did Tomoyuki Kawamura become involved, and what has it been like working with him on the game's music? Did he simply offer compositions of his own, or did you make suggestions based on his previous work in titles like Sega Rally and Virtua Racing?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Quanah Sugiyama:</strong> Kawamura-san was introduced to us by Sasaki-san. The two have worked together with on many projects, and Sasaki-san felt he would be the perfect composer for the aforementioned authenticity we were trying to capture. While we didn’t intend to directly imitate the soundtrack of any specific past title, Sasaki-san did advise us that Kawamura-san had previously worked on Sega’s INDY 500, which had a tone similar to what we were looking for, and encouraged him to draw on his memories from that period for composition.</p>
<p><strong>Nintendo Life: What aspect of 4PGP has been the hardest to get right?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jonathan Marolle</strong><strong>:</strong> Frame rate was the biggest technical challenge on Nintendo Switch. Maintaining a smooth 60 fps with four players, in both handheld and docked modes, was essential to support the fast-paced gameplay that defines arcade racing games of this era. At the same time, a great deal of effort went into making 4PGP feel technically authentic, particularly in areas such as the physics engine and graphics. In the 1990s, hardware limitations forced developers to rely on clever tricks and simplified physics to convey the motion of cars, while early 3D arcade boards were unable to render large numbers of textured polygons. I intentionally embraced the same approach to capture the essence of what made those games so fun and accessible, adopting similar constraints—low-poly models, a limited number of low-resolution textures, and the absence of filtering or advanced post-processing—to recreate that distinctive look and feel.</p>
<p><strong>Nintendo Life: What element of the game do you think players are going to be most surprised by?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jonathan Marolle</strong><strong>:</strong> I think players will be most surprised by just how smooth and immediate the game feels. Like a classic arcade experience, you can jump in and be racing within seconds—we’ve reduced loading time to basically nothing, and there is hardly any downtime between races; the pace is relentless.</p>

<p>On top of that, the performance is rock solid. The game runs flawlessly at 60 fps on both Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2, even with four players, with no frame-rate drops. The Nintendo Switch 2 Edition pushes things even further, offering 120 fps/Full HD and 60 fps/4K settings. The combination of instant access, smooth performance, and high visual fidelity makes the game feel incredibly responsive—and that’s something players won’t expect until they experience it firsthand.</p>
<p><strong>Nintendo Life: What are the key differences between the Switch and Switch 2 versions of the game?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Quanah Sugiyama:</strong> As Jonathan mentioned in the aforementioned question, the frame rate and resolution have improved dramatically. The other major feature is support for the Switch 2’s GameShare feature. With this, up to four players can play locally or online on their own devices, using only one copy of the game. It’s a great way to share the fun with friends near and far.</p>
<p><strong>Nintendo Life: What has it been like factoring in Switch 2 features, like 120fps and GameChat?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Quanah Sugiyama:</strong> GameShare, being a brand-new feature on the Nintendo Switch 2, was quite the challenge to develop for.</p>
<p>As one Nintendo Switch 2 system would have to render up to four screens at once, we had to strike the perfect balance in optimisation, where the game can run at a decent speed without sacrificing the fps and resolution too much.</p>
<p>Audio was another challenge we faced, as the game had to generate different sound effects (acceleration, braking, crashing, etc.) for each player’s vehicle on separate devices when streaming. With a traditional setup, all of the sound effects would be playing on all of the players’ devices at once, so finding a workaround was crucial.</p>
<p>For 120 fps, the implementation was quite simple, as the Switch version was already very well-optimised, running at a constant 60 fps despite the technical limitations of the system.</p>
<p><strong>Nintendo Life: <strong>Sasaki</strong>-san, what did you think when you were first approached about contributing to 4PGP?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kenji Sasaki:</strong> To offer some background, I first met Nicolas, the CEO of 3goo, nearly 30 years ago when he was a correspondent for <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/features/yes-it-was-elitist-and-no-that-wasnt-a-bad-thing-edge-alumni-on-why-the-mag-is-still-going-strong-over-30-years-on">EDGE magazine</a> and interviewing me during the development of Sega Rally. I still remember being caught off guard by his sharp questions and very specific requests regarding racing and driving games—I even found myself at a loss for words at times.</p>
<p>After that, we would meet occasionally every few years, and I followed his career as he went on to found 3goo and publish numerous racing titles, so I had always hoped that we might have the opportunity to work together someday. When he eventually approached me about serving as a special advisor on 4PGP, I was genuinely delighted to receive the offer.</p>
<p><strong>Nintendo Life: How have your previous games influenced your input into 4PGP? What lessons would you say your career has taught you when it comes to offering advice and input on this style of game?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kenji Sasaki:</strong> Since 4PGP’s goal was to [recreate] the kind of fun found in 1990s arcade racing games on modern hardware, I took time to break down what made the games I’ve worked on so enjoyable and identify the elements that really stood out.</p>
<figure data-uuid="39802e30990ad"><a title="&quot;Kids Don't Like Being Treated Like Kids&quot; - How 4PGP Is Harnessing The Power Of Sega Rally's Director To Challenge Mario Kart 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/39802e30990ad/kids-dont-like-being-treated-like-kids-how-4pgp-is-harnessing-the-power-of-sega-rallys-director-to-challenge-mario-kart-8.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: 3goo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Although the development schedule limited what could be achieved in a short time, my goal was to bring as much of that “era-specific atmosphere” into 4PGP as possible. With that in mind, I provided advice and direction on visual creation and selection, as well as the overall construction of elements like the background music, to help the game capture the feel of those classic arcade racers.</p>
<p><strong>Nintendo Life: What aspects did you have the most influence over during 4PGP's development?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kenji Sasaki:</strong> The key elements I focused on were the sense of pacing, the background music, and the overall visual atmosphere that evokes 1990s arcade games. Including things like menu and game flow design, we focused on making the experience easy to understand and ensuring the game progressed at a fast, satisfying tempo. I also tried to keep my advice tightly focused on the most important points, with the goal of improving the feel of the game when played and giving players a stronger sense of responsiveness and satisfaction.</p>
<p><strong>Nintendo Life: What was it like working with Tomoyuki Kawamura again?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kenji Sasaki:</strong> Kawamura and I have collaborated on game development many times over the past 30-plus years, and I consider him a true brother-in-arms from our days in the trenches of arcade game development. Because of that shared history, he understands my intentions instinctively, which made our collaboration extremely smooth and effortless.</p>
<p><strong>Nintendo Life: Many modern racing games aim for realism over accessibility. What advantage do you feel arcade-style racers offer over 'serious' simulations?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kenji Sasaki:</strong> I think the clear advantage is being able to enjoy the game casually and intuitively in a typical home play environment. With racing simulators, standard consoles and devices often can’t convey enough information, which can make them feel difficult or intimidating for general players. Using large, immersive displays, motion-based cabinets, or VR can make the experience extremely realistic and intuitive to control, but realistically speaking, not many players have access to that kind of setup yet.</p>
<figure data-uuid="bd7b04034287a"><a title="&quot;Kids Don't Like Being Treated Like Kids&quot; - How 4PGP Is Harnessing The Power Of Sega Rally's Director To Challenge Mario Kart 9" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bd7b04034287a/kids-dont-like-being-treated-like-kids-how-4pgp-is-harnessing-the-power-of-sega-rallys-director-to-challenge-mario-kart-9.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: 3goo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Nintendo Life: 4PGP's feature set appears to place it in competition with family-friendly racers like Mario Kart and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Sonic Racing</a>. What does the game offer that those titles lack?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kenji Sasaki:</strong> I think there are people who have trouble connecting with the cute, highly stylised characters and overtly comical presentation often found in those titles. For players who want a more serious racing atmosphere but feel that full-fledged racing simulators are a bit too demanding or inaccessible, I think there’s room for a game like 4PGP to fill that gap and meet that demand.</p>
<p><strong>Nintendo Life: 4PGP is an original title. Would you like to see studios like 3goo given the chance to work with some of the famous arcade properties you helped create during the '90s?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kenji Sasaki:</strong> I don’t place much importance on specific IPs or brands. As long as we can create a game we truly want to make—and one that players are looking for—I’m open to any style or approach. I would love to make another rally game, though.</p>
<p><strong>Nintendo Life: Do you see yourself contributing to more games in the future?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kenji Sasaki:</strong> Of course, I’d like to remain actively involved. If there is demand, I would love to work on commercial titles, but there are also more personal projects and ideas that I would like to challenge myself with developing.</p>
