          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">I walked out of my Summer Game Fest 2025 demo for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mixtape/" data-ref-id="5000-631968">Mixtape</a> beaming like an idiot, a smile stuck on my face. I can't think of a game that has ever vibed as hard as Mixtape does. Beethoven &amp; Dinosaur's debut, The Artful Escape, was a vibes game, too. Light on traditional gameplay mechanics and basically lacking any fail states, it instead leaned into aesthetics, mood, and tone. It was more of a feeling than a traditional game, but I loved it for that.</p><p dir="ltr">There are lots of vibes games, like Unpacking, Night in the Woods, and Firewatch, to name a few. I love a good vibes game, and Mixtape, the next game from the team behind The Artful Escape, feels like it could be the ultimate example. I played about 30 minutes of Mixtape and saw what you might call a few levels of the game, which plays like a '90s-set coming-of-age story but is meant to feel "sorta like channel-surfing [old-school] MTV at 3 AM," developer Johnny Galvatron told me.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6TQF6eJa3Y" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/F6TQF6eJa3Y" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">In Mixtape, you play a group of three high-school pals on the cusp of graduating and looking to make it to a party on the beach to cap off their childhood. The party is going to rule if they can just get there, and each figurative step toward that end goal is played out to a different song that collectively makes up one of the best licensed soundtracks I've ever heard in a video game. Joy Division, The Cure, The Smashing Pumpkins, and many more bring so much life to this game. Something about the joining of gaming and music has always been incredibly powerful to me, and Mixtape's way of bringing these things together sincerely blew my mind.</p><p dir="ltr">It's not that the gameplay side of Mixtape is especially intricate. But it's always changing. The main mechanic seems like it'll be what you may have seen in the trailer: coasting downhill in a skateboard, dodging cars, flipping off cops, and stopping to sneak a couple of beers out of your house. But the game toys with not just this format--like a later level in which I led the police on a high-speed chase in a careening shopping cart--but also cleverly gamifies the group's friendship and experiences in other ways. I laughed out loud when I was hit with a French-kissing minigame, where each joystick controlled one tongue, and I was free to mash and swirl the tongues together in what is sure to become a viral moment.</p><p dir="ltr">In a later scene, the teens were driving to a fast food restaurant and blasting music along the way, turning the moment into an interactive headbanging mechanic in which you'd move to the music and rock out with your buddies. There's no penalty for doing it poorly, and seemingly no demand you do it at all. Mixtape is largely on rails in a sense, in that it's paced to play out nearly the same no matter how much you toy with the world in these fleeting but emotionally impactful ways. For instance, you do need to French kiss for a bit, but even then, you can keep it going much longer if you want to, long after the prompt tells you "that's enough."</p><p dir="ltr">Mixtape is a hard game to describe. If you're not one to find music especially moving or important, you surely won't find the gameplay moments carry you through to having the same euphoric experience I and many others had at SGF--I've been hearing a lot of people call it their game of the show. However, if you're like me, and you have some mushy nostalgia for the '90s, a romantic view of bands like The Cure, and a willingness to let an experience be something quite unlike a traditional video game, you'll likely come to the same conclusion I have: Mixtape is transcendent.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Obviously, it's personal preference, but Nintendo GameCube has one of the most smile-inducing system startup sequences with its purple cubes rolling around to a catchy tune. Thankfully, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/">Switch 2</a> owners can experience this delightful moment every time they open the GameCube app with one simple trick: holding the left stick in any direction.</p><p dir="ltr">The GameCube library is new to the Nintendo Classics collection with the introduction of Switch 2, though accessing it does require subscribing to the premium Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack tier ($50 annually for an individual, $80 for a family). As such, the regular bootup for the app just showcases the purple GameCube controller overlaid on a red background, similar to the Nintendo 64 or NES apps.</p>

<p dir="ltr">But moving and holding the left stick while jumping into the GameCube app transports you back to the early 2000s with the original startup sequence. It's a fun secret that injects you with nostalgic goodness or introduces you to how certain consoles used to greet players when turning them on. Now, keep in mind, only the left stick unlocks this Easter egg. Fiddling with the right stick didn't work.</p><p dir="ltr">At launch, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-gamecube-game-coming-to-switch-2s-switch-online-library/2900-6400/#7">the GameCube library on Switch 2</a> consists of The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker, F-Zero GX, and Soulcalibur II. Looking ahead, Nintendo is expected to add titles like Super Mario Sunshine, Pokemon XD: Gale of Darkness, and Luigi's Mansion.</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo is also selling <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-nintendo-switch-online-gamecube-controller-supports-gyro-controls/1100-6532159/">a GameCube controller for Switch 2 that has its own fun surprise</a>. The controller actually has gyroscope functionality, something that can be utilized in Splatoon 2 and 3--among other games. This is on top of the controller also adding <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-set-up-gamechat-on-switch-2/1100-6532152/">a C button for GameChat</a>, as well as Home and Capture buttons.</p><p dir="ltr">Switch 2 is available now and costs $450.

<p>We must admit, when Atari announced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/adventure_of_samsara">Adventure of Samsara</a> over the weekend, it took us a good couple of minutes to realise it was officially linked to the classic 2600 game <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/atari2600/adventure">Adventure</a>.</p>
<p>Watching the trailer, the overall look and feel of the game didn't really form any connections in our mind, but then the title came up and we thought <em>"heh, Adventure of Samsara from Atari, that's kinda like the original Adventure"</em>. Slumped in chairs after caning the Switch 2 for a few days, the penny finally dropped.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>820k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Adventure of Samsara is, according to Atari, a completely new game set in the world of Adventure. In other words, then, it's neither a sequel not a remake. It is, however, a metroidvania, kinda like what the company did with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/yars_rising">Yars Rising</a> in 2024.</p>
<p>Developed by indie studio Ilex Games, Adventure of Samsara will see you traverse 10 unique biomes with gameplay reminiscent of classic Prince of Persia titles. And, of course, for those who recovered the Enchanted Chalice and perhaps discovered Warren Robinett's hidden room in the original 1980 game, there will be plenty of curious easter eggs to discover.</p>
<p>Here's a look at the key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>- Metroidvania Exploration</strong> – Explore 10 unique biomes, from frozen wastes to industrial labs, each filled with distinct enemies, hazards and hidden upgrades.</p>
<p>- <strong>Classic Gameplay Feel</strong> – With classic gameplay and twisted 2D pixel art, <em>Adventure of Samsara</em> evokes the timeless feel of games like <em>Prince of Persia</em> (1989) while offering something entirely new.</p>
<p>- <strong>Original Worldbuilding</strong> – Immerse yourself in an expansive, interdimensional fantasy world with a deep, spiritual lore.</p>
<p>- <strong>Adventure Easter Eggs</strong> – The game features nods to the original <em>Adventure</em>, with familiar structures, enemies, and references that reward both new and returning players.</p>
<p>- <strong>Collectibles</strong> – Hidden collectibles boost health, mana, damage, and flasks, while dozens of augments let players customize their playstyle.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There's no date for Adventure of Samsara yet beyond the current 2025 window, but we'll let you know as soon as we hear more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/chromagun-2-dye-hard-is-more-of-same-but-zanier-stil<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>ChromaGun 2: Dye Hard</em> is the latest of the <em>ChromaGun </em>color puzzle games from PM Studios. After the initial title's success, the ChromaGun is back once again to test players with their memory of basic color matching.</p>

<p>I got a chance to sit down and play 30 minutes of <em>ChromaGun </em>at Summer Game Fest. The demo opened with the standard fair for anyone familiar with these kinds of portal-like titles. In a testing facility you’ll be enticed to pick up the <em>ChromaGun</em>, getting just a single color at first your aim.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/chromagun-2_-dye-hard-color-matching.jpg?itok=bV6Ejzv4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/chromagun-2_-dye-hard-color-matching.jpg?itok=xjZLSO9I 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Your aim is to progress through a series of puzzle rooms that get more and more challenging as you go. The main way you progress is by successfully moving floating spheres around rooms. The way that you move them is by creating wall and ceiling panels of the same color.</p>

<p>A yellow sphere will be attracted to a yellow wall tile. This works when the switch you need the sphere to be on is located right under a tile. If the switch is between wall tiles then you may need to daisy chain it between two, in that case the sphere will move to an equidistant location between the two tiles.</p>

<h2>How Do You Make Purple Again?</h2>

<p>Adding further complication, different wall tiles and spheres will not just come in the primary colors – yellow, blue, and red – but also in Secondary colors. Forcing you to have to remember something basic like if you want your Blue Sphere to head towards the Purple wall tile then you’ll have to shoot your Sphere with the color Red.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/chromagun-2_-dye-hard-corrupted-world.jpg?itok=07o-J9jk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/chromagun-2_-dye-hard-corrupted-world.jpg?itok=7-UIL5Xx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The first few puzzle rooms were as I expected, the growing mechanics of colors and tiles creeping. While there was no strict tutorial,&nbsp;<em>ChromaGun 2</em> did a good job to slowly layer mechanics.</p>

<p>A core theme within <em>ChromaGun 2</em>, something I learned as I leapt from a ledge straight into a portal was that ChromaGun’s ‘worlds’ are all based on alternate realities where you might trade out the sterile white walls and right angles, for curved structures, a visual filter that makes it look like you’re playing the game as a classic comic book, and the last ‘world’ I entered before I finished my time was a barnyard settings.</p>

<h2>Weird Worlds</h2>

<p>Each zone has a unique style that makes it easy to check where you are at any point, but didn’t vary too much in terms of gameplay. Regardless, it was an interesting reskin of what you’d expect to see in a game about completing tests.</p>

<p>Each zone additionally has a different robotic/AI voice as your tested who is confused upon your arrival, but interacts with you with a different personality.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/chromagun-2_-dye-hard-farm-world.jpg?itok=GbfCK8L0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/chromagun-2_-dye-hard-farm-world.jpg?itok=MhD5Ookt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>It almost felt like the sensibilities and gameplay loop of a title like <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d83c794b-2afb-46a0-9fe3-9d31dddf1911" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/portal-2-tale-of-two-female-icons" rel="nofollow"><em>Portal </em></a>got crossed somehow with the zaniness and unexpected theming of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e24d6996-dfd0-49b8-a6cc-139f750f2975" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/psychonauts-2-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Psychonauts</em></a>.</p>

<p>If you’re a fan of the original ChromaGun title, or you’re into the idea of a puzzle game that leans heavily into color shifting and matching then this will likely be a title that you’ll want to keep an eye on. There’s a lot of times where you see a game attempt to totally reinvent itself between iterations, but if you’re good at what you do is that totally necessary?</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/directive-8020-enhances-gameplay-putting-stealth-and-scares-in-players-hands</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/directive-8020-enhances-gameplay-putting-the-stealth-and-scares-in-players-hands.1213629/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/directive-8020-enhances-gameplay-putting-stealth-and-scares-in-players-hands<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I've been a massive fan of Supermassive games since <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="8b369c29-3d2f-4f8f-ae11-ac3c77f5e39e" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/until-dawn-2024-review-new-faces-old-blood" rel="nofollow"><em>Until Dawn</em></a> and with every new title iterating on gameplay, scares, and ways to experience the horror with my friends, I was very excited to sit down and get my hands on a small portion of <em>Directive 8020</em> and talk with Executive Producer Dan McDonald.</p>

<p>My gameplay demo began with a tense but hopeful conversation between a new astronaut Young talking with her mission direction Stafford. During the conversation there are hints about the declining state of the world, how Young's father died four years prior, and that they would be ready to head to the stars once again to visit a planet that could inhabit life.</p>

<p>McDonald explained to me that this mission is one to visit and gather information about this new planet and how it might be habitable. The plan is to just fly by, but one thing leads to another and the crew needed to land.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/directive-8020-overgrowth.jpg?itok=0XygnpiC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/directive-8020-overgrowth.jpg?itok=CdMIy7TV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>After watching the cutscene, a discussion that McDonald said would continue to be flashed back to over the course of the story, the gameplay demo leapt ahead to Chapter 6 of the 8 Chapter story.</p>

<h2>Friends Or Enemies You Can't Trust</h2>

<p>Two Astronauts, Sermon and Stafford, were in the hydroponics lab aboard the spaceship. Canisters were broken and a strange organism was growing over them. From the darkness a humanoid figure steps forward, a perfect clone of one of the Astronauts until his face ripples unsettlingly.</p>

<p>Attacked by not just one, but two clones (one of which shapeshifts into a horrific alien creature), I was in control. Playing as Sermon, I was skulking around the service tunnels underneeth the main hydroponics area. The giant hunter seeking me out, I was able to try to crouch walking by it to make my escape.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/directive-8020-turning-point-choice.jpg?itok=Yee7Fz8D 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/directive-8020-turning-point-choice.jpg?itok=VF41BBmD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Failing that I was thrown into a QTE, quickly mashing the X button I was able to turn my stun baton on the creature and get away while it writhed in pain. The Stun Baton was a multi-use weapon with a brief recharge (luckily, it charged again in time before I needed it once more).</p>

<p>In these tunnels, there were also other options to distract or make my way past the creature. Running was an option, but McDonald also showed me that there were a variety of interactable objects that could take the Hunter's attention as well as a radar system that allows the player to briefly see the creature through walls.</p>

<p>Shortly after escaping, the two astronauts returned to the rest of the crew with a new fear that one of the party members was not what they seemed.</p>

<p>While the horror of other Dark Pictures games from Supermassive have been about a very recognizable foe, the thought of an enemy that could be one of the players (even one being played by a character) is a fantastic approach to horror. As well as being inspired by <em>The Thing</em> McDonald highlighted other sources such as <em>Event Horizon, Alien</em>, and specifically called out the purples and greens to add that eerie <em>Color Out Of Space</em> vibe to the game.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/directive-8020-attacked-human.jpg?itok=hxF3x39z 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/directive-8020-attacked-human.jpg?itok=xTUXMC1m 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>While I didn't see too much, what I did see spoke wonders about the game. After getting to play through the game and understand more of the tense nature of the plot I got to talk with McDonald more about gameplay elements, multiplayer, and how the shift away from only walking and reactions to active stealth and combat will remain accessible to all skill levels.</p>

<h2>An Overall Upgrade</h2>

<p>In terms of gameplay all of the movement has been overhauled to align with a more traditional 3rd person horror title. McDonald highlighted the experiences working on <em>Devil In Me</em>, specifically the clamber mechanic, with how they could continue to reshape their movement.</p>

<p>It's not just movement related to stealth that's been improved either as changes have also been made to allow for more puzzle systems to be used in the game.</p>

<p>Highlighting a few of the choices that were made over the course of gameplay McDonald pulled up a detailed path showing where events you encounter are intended, and where they can split. He explained that with every choice you make you can then easily revert back to the choice right before.</p>

<p>They wanted to make sure that anyone playing the game could play it in a linear fashion, or they could go back through and retry choices over and over again to get the whole scope of the game without needing to replay it from scratch.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/directive-8020-05.jpg?itok=HNamyInN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/directive-8020-05.jpg?itok=2bwgkU8c 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Another important change was that instead of building the game for a three act structure, like a movie, instead each chapter followed the structure of a TV show episode. Understanding that as their games were becoming larger and more involved, it would be harder for players to complete them in a single sitting. By swapping to an episodic structure there are more places for players to conclude a single session, but be excited to pick up when the story continues.</p>

<h2>Accessible To Everyone, No Matter Your Skill Level</h2>

<p>The last important piece of information that I got about <em>Directive 8020</em> was that Movie Night mode is not only returning but has been improved. Movie Night, a mode where each character in the story can be assigned to a different player in your party, now functions not only with local play but over the internet, creating a fun group experience.</p>

<p>Additionally, while the game was becoming more mechanically complex in Movie Night mode you can adjust the difficulty and accessibility per player. This means someone who is familiar with video games and the Dark Pictures games can have normal QTE timing and stealth modes, while the senses of the Hunter can be turned down for a player less familiar with the controls.</p>

<p>As a game series that I love to play with friends of all different skill levels I was so happy to hear that a custom experience could be created to allow for everyone to have just as fun a time.</p>

<p><em>Directive 8020</em> is certainly one of the most anticipated releases for me coming out to Summer Game Fest and with the developments to the gameplay, and the understanding of the audience and wanting to include as many players as possible the team at Supermassive have really demonstrated an understanding for fans of their games.</p>

We see less than two minutes of the upcoming vehicular carnage, but we learn a bit more about what to expect from the new season and how closely it may connect to the video game franchise.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197580" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="GameStop Doubles Down On Crypto With Massive Bitcoin Purchase As Stores Close" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="88" data-playlist="197580,197576,197567" data-current="197580"><div><p>GameStop Doubles Down On Crypto With Massive Bitcoin Purchase As Stores Close</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197580/197580_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197580/197580_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197580/197580_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23101.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Even in the short clip, we get some (literal) blasts from <em>Twisted Metal</em> past. Roach Coach’s exterminator van from <em>Twisted Metal 4</em> is seen firing bullets from under a giant roach atop its roof. After last season’s finale showed a tournament photo of Mr. Grimm, one of the longest-running characters in <em>Twisted Metal</em> history, we finally get to see the soul-stealing biker in action, weaving around missiles being launched at him by a sadistically euphoric Sweet Tooth (brought to life with the physicality of Joe Seanoa, aka Samoa Joe, and the voice of Will Arnett). But, for me, none of those appearances elicit more nostalgia than seeing just quick glimpses of the half-man, half-murder vehicle, Axel, appearing in War Wheel form. There are no close-ups of the fan-favorite killing machine, but we do see him navigating those gigantic wheels around in ways we haven’t seen since <em>Twisted Metal</em>’s heyday.</p><p>According to the video’s description, John (Anthony Mackie) will reunite with his long-lost sister, Dollface (Tiana Okoye), who, in the first season, we learn is the leader of a group of female vigilantes known as “The Dolls.” Unfortunately, the reunion isn’t featured in this short clip of the new season, so we’ll have to wait for that show-shifting meeting when the second season of <em>Twisted Metal</em> premieres July 31.</p><p>Until then, rewatch the clip and rejoice in the fact that this is probably not even a fraction of the action we’ll likely be blessed with in less than a month.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

As a matter of fact, <strong>you can use any USB-C camera on the Nintendo Switch 2</strong>, which means that you may already have a perfectly viable webcam lying around your house! But if you’ve been looking around the net, you’ve probably noticed two very popular Nintendo Switch 2 cameras have been getting a lot of attention: The official Nintendo Switch 2 Camera and the HORI Piranha Plant camera.</p><h2 id="h723936"><a id=""></a>Official Nintendo Switch 2 Camera</h2><p>It’s not all that surprising that one of the best camera options for the Nintendo Switch 2 comes directly from Nintendo itself. The aptly-titled Nintendo Switch 2 Camera is a feature-filled choice at a fairly reasonable price of $55, and it’s probably the overall smartest choice of camera for the console for most folks.</p><p>The Official Nintendo Switch 2 Camera offers a sleek form factor, a wide viewing range that can accommodate multiple people in one room, and an all-black aesthetic that helps it blend into an entertainment space. There’s even a privacy shutter for safety when the camera is not in use. </p><p>Toss in a moderately crisp 1080p resolution, and you’ve got yourself a somewhat modern-feeling camera to use during GameChat sessions. While a modern high-end webcam is undeniably going to offer better video quality, this little guy is likely cheaper while still being more than enough for casual chats and Mario Party fun!</p><h2 id="h723937"><a id=""></a>HORI Piranha Plant Camera</h2><p>The HORI Piranha Plant Camera is actually licensed by Nintendo, which explains why it’s rocking such a cool piranha plant aesthetic. Unlike the more low-key, professional vibe of the official camera, this awesome-looking piece of tech plays into the universal love of Nintendo.</p><p>The HORI Piranha Plant Camera kind of manages to make itself fun to use. For instance, it’s genuinely cool that you can bend the piranha plant’s neck to get the right angle you need, blending functionality and cuteness into a single feature. Oh, and its privacy shutter is achieved by literally closing the mouth. Quirky!</p><p><strong>Unfortunately, while the intriguing visual design and versatility of this device are excellent, its 480p resolution is shockingly poor for a camera in 2025</strong>. As such, <strong>it’s honestly best suited for kids or non-enthusiasts who don’t care as much about picture quality</strong>. It’s kind of a bummer, too, because it sure is a cool little device.</p><h2 id="h723938"><a id=""></a>Which should you buy?</h2><p>As you can see, each of these two popular Nintendo Switch 2 cameras offers its own pros and cons. The one you should buy depends on what you need for GameChat. If you’re an older enthusiast who plans to spend a lot of time in GameChat sessions with friends and wants a camera with solid video quality and a slim, sleek form factor, the Official Nintendo Switch 2 Camera is your best bet. If you’re a younger gamer, or video quality is secondary to you, the fun and silly nature of the HORI Piranha Plant Camera is undeniably appealing. </p><p>Whichever one you pick, remember to use the privacy shutter when you pick your nose. Or don’t. I don’t really care what you do. How you deal with your rhinotillexomania is your business.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/jurassic-world-evolution-3-lets-you-channel-your-inner-john-hammond.1213602/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/jurassic-world-evolution-3-lets-you-channel-your-inner-john-hammond<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I never stopped thinking about wanting to repeat all of John Hammond's mistakes since the first time I saw him make them in 1993's Jurassic Park. And I've had many opportunities to do so in various park-builder games in the decades since, ranging all the way from pretty disappointing to pretty great. The latest, Jurassic World Evolution 3, is looking to deliver more features than we've ever seen in a dinosaur park management game before. And at least for my part, you had me at [insert signature T-Rex roar in your mind's eye here].</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The thing that's always bugged me about the previous Jurassic World Evolution games is that they seemed a bit stripped-down compared to what Frontier has shown us is possible with their sister franchises, Planet Zoo and Planet Coaster. So the thing I'm most excited about with Evolution 3 is that it seems like we're finally getting the full Frontier feature set in a Jurassic game.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You can build your own hotels, gift shops, and staff buildings by snapping together tons of resizable and re-colorable props. You can reshape the terrain at will, make your own functional waterfalls, and even create dinosaur enclosures that use natural rock formations instead of electric fences as part of the perimeter. The devs want everything you build to feel like it still belongs in the Jurassic franchise, so the props and such are a bit more grounded-looking than what you might see in Planet Coaster 2. But for the first time, it doesn't feel like they're compromising at all on the sandbox elements that make their other games great for the sake of being a licensed game.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>LIFE FINDS A WAY</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The other major addition here is the inclusion of dinosaur breeding and baby dinosaurs for the first time. While the previous games in the series relied on artificial fertilization and incubation of eggs, Evolution 3 will actually allow you to clone fertile dinosaurs, place dinosaur nests, and even selectively crossbreed for specific skins, stats, and personality traits. And this, of course, comes with the addition of juvenile models for all of the more than 80 species included in the base game. On top of this, adult males and females will now exhibit varying levels of sexual dimorphism, like male triceratops having larger frills, meaning there will be more than 240 distinct dino and prehistoric reptile models in total.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This will introduce new challenges to manage within your enclosures, too. For instance, Frontier told us a male T-rex will not have any interest in coexisting with other adult males, though large groups of females can put up with each other. This will vary somewhat from species to species, as they have different social dynamics with each other and with other species. It even matters for breeding, since some species will only nest if they're out of view of pesky humans and don't have any other species around.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>A male T-rex will not have any interest in coexisting with other adult males, though large groups of females can put up with each other.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Evolution 3 will also be taking us to a variety of different worldwide locations that are new to the series, including the mountains of Japan and the Mediterranean island of Malta. They not only feature their own distinct plant life and terrain, but also building sets and props that can add a little bit of global flair to your park. The ones we saw included an East Asian-themed set, an Alpine European-themed set, a set based on the original Jurassic Park films with a kitschy jungle aesthetic, and one based on the newer Jurassic World films that looks more modern and shiny.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we won't be fighting with the climate in different biomes the same way as in Planet Zoo, each one will feature different clients in the campaign mode that want you to focus on different objectives. Some might be interested in simply selling as many tickets and luxury hotel rooms as possible, while others lean more into conservation and science.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>CHANGING WORLD</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">All the while we'll be working with the Dinosaur Integration Network, or DIN. To be honest, the newer films are mostly just a big mushy blob in my head, but I think the idea is that dinosaurs just live in the wild now and we're trying to learn how to coexist with them instead of putting them back in cages. It's whatever. The originals are still the ones that matter to me, and it sounds like we'll be fully able to build a dinosaur theme park in the spirit of the original films.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But there also seems to be something sinister going on with a secretive group who doesn't like DIN and might cause trouble at your park, based on an ominous moment in the trailer. And that could be interesting, too. In previous games, tropical storms and equipment malfunctions could lead to dinosaurs breaking out and running rampant. But the first book and film were about a human saboteur causing a massive disaster, so that feels in the spirit of the franchise for me as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you are worried about your dinos going for a stroll and choosing to have the kind of snack that's going to require you to pay out millions to their family, there are some new tools for that as well. You won't be warned automatically, for instance, if a fence is in poor shape or being attacked by a hangry carnotaurus. For that, you'll need security cameras with full coverage along the length of the fence, allowing you to be notified as soon as there's a problem. And if the cameras go down, well, I hope you have good lawyers.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>OPEN FOR BUSINESS</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">At the end of the day, you don't have to work particularly hard to get me excited about a new dinosaur park management game. Especially one with the in-depth customization tools Frontier has become known for. Watching a baby triceratops play in the grass is adorable. I don't care who you are. And the breeding mechanics open up a lot of long-term possibilities for making not just the parks I want, but the kinds of dinosaurs I want, too. As a paleontology nerd who's a bit bummed the designs in the Jurassic franchise are a bit stuck in the 90s, I asked if I could breed my raptors to have feathers, but the devs were a bit tight-lipped about that. I guess we can hope.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Jurassic World Evolution 3 will be coming to Playstation 5, Xbox, and PC on October 21.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/tony-hawk-pro-skater-3-4-director-ninja-turtle-ign-live-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">After the success of the Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 remake, more classic games in the beloved franchise are set to get revamped with the impending release of Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4. At IGN Live, the game’s director, Kurt Tillmanns, was on hand to talk about what this collection has to offer in terms of mixing new and old elements - including one bright green new inclusion in the form of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle's resident party dude, Michaelangelo. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Said Tillmans, about including such an offbeat and notable new skater on the roster, “It was awesome working with Nickelodeon on getting Mikey in here. We were super passionate. Everyone who gets an opportunity to be part of a Tony Hawk game is just incredibly gracious and excited to be a part of it. They're wonderful collaborators. You know, we took great pride in building him for the game. He's also got three turtle-themed special tricks in the game that you can get when you unlock him, and you can equip those onto any other skater in the game. So, that's a ton of fun by itself!”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When it came to adding a two-minute timer element to this version of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4, Tillmans remarked, “We’re rebuilding two of the best games of all time from the ground up. And we wanted this to be one game. It's got the concept from two awesome games, but it really is one game. So that means that Tony Hawk 3 is going to get some features and things that Tony Hawk 4 had and Tony Hawk 4, along with the classic goals that you remember, is going to be able to be played with a two-minute timer. That timer can actually be extended up to an hour for people who want to play more at their own pace. We've also got all of the classic game modes returning, so you can skate around in the four parks and free skate single session or speed run and continue to do things at your own pace in those modes.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tillmans said he was excited by the online play aspect of the game because he felt, for Iron Galaxy, “That is the heritage of our studio. So, we are extremely excited to be bringing this game to seven platforms. We’ve got both PlayStations, both Xboxes, both Switches, and three PC stores. And not only that, we are going to feature cross-play across every single platform. So that's huge. This game is coming to the widest audience, to the widest player base that any Tony Hawk game has ever had."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Asked about developing the Switch 2 version of the game, Tillmans laughed, “I mean, honestly, what's one other platform when we’re already doing six, right? As soon as we knew that we were going to be in the window and it was going to be possible for us to be able to support it, we just jumped at the opportunity.” As for the performance of the game on the new console, he noted, “We're going to run at 60 FPS on Switch 2 on every park, so it's going to be amazing performance.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The soundtracks have always been a big part of the Tony Hawk games, and Tillmans said that for the remake of Pro Skater 3 + 4, “We have a ton of people who are just super passionate about the soundtrack. Obviously, when you start making a Tony Hawk game, that's one of the things that people are most excited about. We take it very seriously. Tony Hawk himself has a lot of opinions about the soundtrack and he probably knows more about the music that skaters are listening to than anyone else in the world, so we obviously hold his opinion in high esteem."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for what it was like working with Hawk himself, Tillmans said, “He’s an awesome collaborator. He's great to work with. He takes this being kind of the lexicon for skating very seriously. He plays the game frequently and he will often tell us, ‘Hey, think this trick name is now called something else. Let me check with some people.’ And he will make sure that the trick list, which has been updated from 1 + 2, represents the language and the verbiage that skaters are using today."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Regarding the new skate parks the game includes, Tillmans said, “It’s a huge honor for us to be able to add, for the first time in over 10 years, three brand new parks into a Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater game. The game is going to feature the water park, the movie studio, and the pinball park. And the pinball park is super exciting. It fits in with that kind of park, like Roswell or Area 51 and Skater Heaven, where only Tony Hawk games could really take the skater into these fantastical places..” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Tillmans explained, “When we come up with ideas for these parks, we think about the types of things that might be a forbidden place for a skater to go and skate, like a shut down water park that really fulfills that skater fantasy. And also those fantastic places, like a pinball park where the skater is actually like the size of a pinball in the machine skating around. The ball will ping pong around everywhere and wipe you out. And if you look up, there's actually a giant Tony Hawk playing the pinball machine that you're in. Then he'll react when you bail and cover his eyes. It's great."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, now that Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1-4 have gotten the remake treatment, should we expect the fifth game, Tony Hawk’s Underground, next? When asked that question, Tillmans remained mostly tightlipped, but he let it be known the interest is certainly there, replying “We’re focused on shipping [3 + 4]. I'm getting text messages right now from people working on the game. So we want to ship this game. We can't wait to get 3 + 4 out to the audience. Beyond that, we would absolutely love to keep working on this.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 - Before and After Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 will be released on July 11, 2025, and you can check <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-first-impressions-of-the-remake">our first impressions of the remake right here.</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Remakes and remasters are very much an 'in' thing at the moment, and while it's no surprise that we would eventually see what are arguably two of the best entries in the Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater series make their way to modern platforms, I definitely didn't expect this package to be as robust of a remake as it's shaping up to be," Our previewer, Nick Maillet said.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The next Call of Duty installment was announced over the weekend, along with its release platforms: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops">Call of Duty: Black Ops</a> 7 is slated to debut across Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PS4, and PC.</p>
<p>Black Ops 7's omission of a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-launch-day-live">Switch 2</a> release (at least presently) from the launch platform line-up has raised some eyebrows due to the fact that, back in 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-and-nintendo-sign-binding-10-year-agreement-for-call-of-duty">Microsoft announced a deal with Nintendo to bring Call of Duty to its platforms</a> on "the same day as Xbox, with full feature and content parity".</p>
<p>However, while for now there is no word of a Switch 2 release for Black Ops 7, the team is "committed" to bringing the Call of Duty series to Nintendo, Activision has told Eurogamer.</p>

<p>In a statement shared with Eurogamer, Activision confirmed: "We're committed to getting the franchise on Switch. Both teams [are] working on it. Will share details when ready."</p>
<p>On its release, Black Ops 7 will be able to be played solo or with friends "in a thrilling and innovative" co-op campaign, while also having the series' "signature" multiplayer experience. This will include new maps and more from Zombies.</p>
<p>The upcoming game is being helmed by Treyarch and Raven Software, with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-announced-promises-to-be-most-mind-bending-black-ops-ever">developers promising the "most mind-bending" Black Ops release yet</a>. It stars Heroes and Gilmore Girls' Milo Ventimiglia as David Mason.</p>
<p>We can expect further details on Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 later this summer, the team has said, so stay tuned for more.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<figure><a title="usb-c" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/01cca1554615b/usb-c.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Now, I'm not entirely sure how much you take and use screenshots on your Nintendo Switch or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-guide-ultimate-resource">Switch 2</a> consoles, but let me tell you, I take tons and I use even more. So connecting to a Switch to my laptop via USB has become my go-to way to get my game shots up and ready for scrutiny where I need them.</p>
<p>So, you'll understand, I'm sure, my sadness in finding that you can only transfer data such as screenshots betwixt Switch 2 and PC using the bottom of two USB-C connections whilst using this option. What this leads to, dear friends, is a tragic situation, as you can see in my (terrible) photos, where the Switch 2 needs to be set lying down at an angle as it can no longer sit upright properly. The horror.</p>
<p>Indeed, using the top slot sees you greeted with an easy-to-miss message that, no, you'll need to use the bottom slot.</p>

<p>We're sure there's a perfectly valid reason. It's a shame, though, as if the top USB-C allowed it, I could look approximately 76% tidier (and thusly cooler) being able to do all this with my Switch 2 on its stand all nice and proper. But oh no. Well, not yet, anyway. Maybe Mario or one of those Nintendo big shots will see this and get it sorted.</p>
<p>Of course, there <em>are</em> easier ways to get your pics off your Switch, especially by just uploading screens to your phone, which works fine in most cases, so it's not a big issue. Simply open up your album, choose a shot and upload to your phone. But if I did it this way, well, I wouldn't have anything to complain about, would I?</p>
<p>You can also, if you are hip and trendy, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Support/Nintendo-Switch-2/How-to-Upload-Screenshots-and-Videos-from-Nintendo-Switch-2-to-the-Nintendo-Switch-App-2843767.html#:~:text=You%20can%20set%20up%20your,enable%20or%20disable%20this%20feature.">use the Nintendo Switch app to automatically upload all of your screenshots</a>, without the need to stress at all. Again, where would I be for articles if I used these more modern techniques, I ask you?</p>
<p>In this case, all you need to do (besides having the app installed) is to go to your Album, select the cog on the bottom left of the screen, then select your user icon to head into Upload settings and turn on auto uploads. Hey, it turns out I <em>was</em> doing it a really dumb way, after all.</p>

<p>It's an ancient art form, though, this unnecessary grumbling about new things, you understand. Surely you've noticed something about the console that's irked you? Magnets too strong? Screen too big? Games too good? Come on, there must be something!</p>

"There's just naturally barriers like contracts, relationships and approval rights" said Paulson in reference to the process of working with external licensors.

He said one major goal at the studio will be to attract new players not just through the lineup of Invincible characters, but also a "tag" system that gives players tools to break out of complex enemy combos by swapping characters. "There's other fighting games where it can be a 'slideshow' the minute you get touched," he said, referring to how successful combos are difficult to break out of in games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Street Fighter 6</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He rattled off a number of other features meant to create more interactivity between the two players, inevitably taking a breath and realizing he was about to start a GDC talk on fighting game design.

			<p>Back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/live-action-zelda-movie-officially-in-production-nintendo-confirms/">November 2023</a>, Nintendo confirmed that its next adventure in adapting its games into films would be with a live-action Legend of Zelda movie, and earlier this year, we learned that it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/zelda-live-action-movie-slated-for-march-26-2027/">due to arrive in theaters on March 26, 2027.</a></p>
<p>Today, however, Nintendo's president, Shigeru Miyamoto took to <a href="https://x.com/Nintendo/status/1932075231885382103">the company's official X account</a> to announce that the Zelda movie has been delayed by a few weeks, pushing its release date from March 26, 2027, to&nbsp;<strong>May 7, 2027.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><em>"This is Miyamoto,</em>" he began in his statement. "<em>For production reasons, we are changing the release date of the live-action film for The Legend of Zelda to May 7, 2027. It will be some weeks later than the release timing we originally announced, and we will take the extra time to make the film as good as it can be. Thank you for your patience</em>."</p>
<blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:ztr6gxfe2hahquvewmupf4wa/app.bsky.feed.post/3lr6lkg6svn2s" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreig6be2vjn62qy2zyw4tz2xsrn4rps3kz7ar4xrssjrazm3zmznfki">
<p>宮本です。「ゼルダの伝説」の実写映画は、制作上の都合により、全世界の劇場公開日を2027年5月7日に変更します。これまでお伝えしていたタイミングよりも、少し遅くなってしまいますが、十分な時間をとって、良いものに仕上げたいと思います。もう少しだけ時間をください。</p>
<p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:ztr6gxfe2hahquvewmupf4wa?ref_src=embed">任天堂【非公式】 (@nintendo-japan-bot.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:ztr6gxfe2hahquvewmupf4wa/post/3lr6lkg6svn2s?ref_src=embed">2025-06-09T14:00:05.000Z</a></p></blockquote>

<p>While it's nice to get an update on the release date of the film, even if it is a delay, it's definitely not the update that those eagerly anticipating the movie's release have been hoping for.</p>
<p>There's still plenty of time for these announcements, but since Nintendo confirmed the film has been in production, the question on everyone's minds has been who will be playing Link and Zelda. Casting isn't set in stone, but there have at least been <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2025/05/30/the-legend-of-zelda-movie-may-land-a-perfectly-cast-princess-per-report/">rumblings</a> lately that Hunter Schafer has been tapped to play Zelda, while it's still anyone's guess as to who will unmute the series protagonist.</p>

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dying-light-the-beast/" data-ref-id="5000-640462">Dying Light: The Beast</a> was once going to be an expansion to the main game, but it grew to be so big that developer Techland eventually spun it off into a standalone experience. It's not Dying Light 3, but the team told me it feels The Beast is the best version of what the Dying Light series has been since it debuted a decade ago. I played 30 minutes of The Beast during Summer Game Fest Play Days 2025, and though its story still seems to be a comic-booky saga I struggle to get invested in, I'm definitely on board for some of what's it's bringing--and bringing back--to the series.</p><p dir="ltr">My demo started just before nightfall, and if you know Dying Light, you know it's not so easy to survive when the sun goes down. The new map in The Beast features a lot of forest area, which I really liked playing in. A developer told me the game is meant to be scarier than before, and the signature parkour gameplay has actually been dialed back a little bit to match The Beast protagonist Kyle Crane's canon abilities. He can't jump quite as far as Dying Light 2: Stay Human's Aiden Caldwell, which grounds the game a bit, even as so much of it remains over-the-top.</p><p dir="ltr">Crane is a fan-favorite protagonist from the first game and returns to this one on a revenge mission, chasing down the man who ruined his life. The story in these games resonates with a great number of its fans, but I've not counted myself among them. I don't expect The Beast to change that, but the series has always achieved its core gameplay goals, and that aspect seems well in place once more.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4509291-dyinglight1.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4509291" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4509291-dyinglight1.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4509291"></a><figcaption>The Beast is set many years after the events of the first Dying Light, and Crane still has a bone to pick.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4509291-dyinglight1.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">One change is the return of guns, which have never been (and still won't be) in abundant supply. But because Crane will encounter some heavily armed soldiers at times, players will be able to take their weapons, like an assault rifle, shotgun, and--totally new to the series--a flamethrower that worked well as a room-clearing tool.</p><p dir="ltr">Driving is back, too, which Techland previously introduced in Dying Light: The Following, an expansion for the original Dying Light. Instead of the buggy featured in the expansion, I drove a hefty pick-up truck, which helped me quickly transport some materials I needed for a mission. This was much better than lugging them by hand, and the driving mechanics felt great. I learned Techland used to make rally racing games before Dying Light, and the same designer in charge of those mechanics is still at Techland today and helped bring the driving gameplay to life in Dying Light: The Beast. Driving was a lot of fun, and though the map will sometimes naturally restrict where players can drive, the opportunities to do so don't feel like missing the point despite the series' emphasis on running and parkour moves.</p><p dir="ltr">One of the Dying Light's great strengths has always been the open-endedness of navigating its world. The parkour makes the landscape your playground, and I got to mess with multiple strategies for problem-solving in one encounter. Spotting some armed guards up ahead, I sneakily dashed away to scale a nearby building, dodging zombies at the ground level. When I reached the top, I pulled out a decoy grenade and sent the undead horde toward the guards. As they cut into each other's numbers, I crept onward toward my objective. Up ahead, more guards rested atop the building, and it was here I leaned into the game's best combat maneuver: the dropkick.</p><p dir="ltr">I said I haven't always enjoyed the series' comic-booky side, but here, I was all too pleased to missile-dropkick anyone and everyone who stood in my way. Like the I Think You Should Leave sketch in which Tim Robinson's character refuses to stop fake-pouring water on his colleague during a work seminar, I sensed the dev accompanying me on my demo was astounded at how committed to the move I was. My melee weapons didn't degrade, my ammo was plentiful, all because I just couldn't stop dropkicking every face I saw, be it grossly mushy or tactically masked.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4509305-tp34zuby.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4509305" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4509305-tp34zuby.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4509305"></a><figcaption>The game's visuals still depict dueling aesthetics of grime and shine.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4509305-tp34zuby.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">I played the second game like this at times, too. The physics of the move is too satisfying to ignore. It's just too much fun. I know I was sort of defying how the demo was expected to go, but I've played a lot of Dying Light over the years, so I felt like I could take this moment and really indulge my base desires: dropkicking every ambulating humanoid I encountered like prime Dolph Ziggler.</p><p dir="ltr">"If you kill that guy, you'll get his gun," the dev told me before I dropkicked the armed soldier off of a roof.</p><p dir="ltr">"The bow and arrow is a one-shot if you hit them in the head," he later said, hinting I should give it a whirl, before I unequipped it and launched several guys into a vent with my feet.</p><p dir="ltr">"Now that you've enhanced the axe, it'll immediately jump to your level. It was a Level 6 weapon, but you're Level 9, so enhancing it has made it a Level 9. We wanted players to be able to take their favorite weapons with them throughout the game if they really find one they love," he explained. "I see," I replied, before I pocketed it and dropkicked several more zombies into a wall.</p><p dir="ltr">I apologized, but the move is simply too good, I said. He seemed to get it.</p><p dir="ltr">Dying Light: The Beast benefits from years of updates to Dying Light 2, while also pulling in elements from the first that Techland wanted to revisit. This mix of old and new feels like it's going to make the 20-hour game (40 to 60 for completionists) well worth it if you're already invested in the series. I'm looking forward to driving more, exploring a new, scarier environment, and testing the weapon enhancement system in those rare moments when I elect to do anything other than Roddy Piper the undead in every street, rooftop, and forest I run through.</p>

<figure><a title="Switch 2 Pro Controller" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ef69b31de3c5d/switch-2-pro-controller.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Despite some gripes with the D-pad, it was tough to imagine how Nintendo might improve on the Switch Pro Controller until we finally got our hands on the new one. And while it's a pricey upgrade and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/video-do-you-even-need-a-pro-controller-for-the-switch-2">one that you might want to put off</a> if you've got a perfectly functioning Switch 1 version, the Pro Controller 2 is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-a-new-benchmark-in-comfort-and-design">a very nice bit of kit</a>.</p>
<p>As you'd expect, industrious gamers have been dismantling the console and its accessories since launch, and <a href="https://gametraderzero.com/blogs/news/switch-2-pro-controller-tear-down-what-s-new-inside-nintendo-s-new-controller">GameTraderZero</a> has taken the new pad apart to see what makes it tick and how easy it will be to repair should something go wrong.</p>
<p>Giving us a good look at the innards, it appears that Nintendo turned to <a href="https://tech.alpsalpine.com/e/products-info/components/">Alps Alpine</a> (a Japanese company that specialises in automotive and consumer electronic components such as switches) to supply the sticks for this pad - or at least some of them.</p>
<p>As pointed out by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ninpatentswatch.bsky.social/post/3lr5z4ewo622v">Nintendo Patents Watch</a>, you can see the back of the stick module bearing the manufacturer's name and what appears to be a custom stick design for the Switch 2 controller.</p>

<p>Perhaps most excitingly for people who like to repair, mod, or just fiddle with their gear, GameTraderZero points out that the design used means replacement is possible without the need to fetch the soldering iron. Hurrah!</p>
<p>However, they also point out that "more intricate internal design" of the pad and other factors make it more complicated to disassemble compared to the old version. If you've played Welcome Tour, Nintendo details the challenges of moulding the new pad in such a way that your hand wouldn't rest on grooves which would collect everyday grime and dust.</p>
<p>The intense interest in the Switch 2's analog(ue) sticks stems from the infamous '<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/joy--con-drift">Joy-Con drift</a>' issues that plagued the Switch 1's controllers. Teardowns of the new Joy-Con reveal <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/random-switch-2-owners-are-already-stripping-down-joy-con-to-check-the-stick-tech">sticks that look quite similar to the last-gen version</a>, too, although <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/the-end-of-joy-con-stick-drift-the-switch-2s-controllers-have-been-redesigned-from-the-ground-up">Nintendo says</a> they've been totally redesigned.</p>
<p>While the Pro Controller didn't suffer in the same way, it's nice to see <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/the-switch-2-sticks-might-not-be-hall-effect-but-they-feel-fantastic">these smooth-feeling upgrades</a> in the latest 'Pro' pad. Hopefully, they'll stand the test of time.</p>

			<p>One of the final events for Summer Game Fest 2025 was solely focused on Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, a <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-will-join-geoff-keighley-to-host-a-death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-game-premiere-during-summer-game-fest/">'game premiere</a>' that featured a panel hosted by Geoff Keighley, with the panel featuring Hideo Kojima, Shioli Kutsuna, Troy Baker, and Woodkid.</p>
<p>The panel discussed multiple aspects of the coming game, with Woodkid digging into aspects of writing music for the game, while Baker and Kutsuna spoke about the characters they play in the game and working with Kojima as actors, in between short clips of cutscenes from the game being debuted.</p>
<p>But the highlight of the show was the live demo, during which a member of the Kojima Productions development team played bits of the game's early hours on a PlayStation 5 Pro while Kojima narrated what was going on.</p>
<p><iframe title="DEATH STRANDING 2: ON THE BEACH - Game Premiere - Orpheum Theatre - June 8, 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZpqSt2sirRI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is almost here, with the game set to release on June 26, 2025, so the panel was consistently cautious about not revealing too much. That said, a live gameplay demo is something that we rarely see in today's era of digital presentations, compared to when E3 was in full swing. Even though we've already seen a lot of Kojima Productions' next game, the live demo was a welcome showcase of what's to come later this month when it launches on PS5.</p>
<p>This game premiere was also the kick-off event for what will be a worldwide touring show, which will head to Australia, Japan, France, England, Korea, Taiwan, China, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, and Italy, between now and November 2025.</p>
<p>Full details and dates on the tour <a href="https://www.kojimaproductions.jp/en/death-stranding-world-strand-tour-2?dm_i=74N0,2ARDF,2EYVRT,6HFOC,1#m-scroll-target">are still to come,</a> and it'll be interesting to see if this panel is any indication as to what those attending the show in a few months can expect.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/thick-as-thieves-preview-spiritual-successor-to-classic<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>What’s a good heist without high stakes? <em>Thick as Thieves</em> aims to up the ante with its PVPVE, competitive thievery. From Warren Specter’s studio, OtherSide Entertainment, this game has much potential.</p>

<p>We got a chance to see <em>Thick as Thieves</em> in action during a hands-off demonstration at Summer Game Fest 2025. Unfortunately, we were only able to see the single-player aspect of Thick as Thieves, since the venue’s internet decided to stop working.</p>

<p>Despite this, Director of Product Michael Fitch says that despite very much being a multiplayer game, the PVE aspect much also be important. So yes, you can play <em>Thick as Thieves</em> by yourself if you so choose.</p>



<h2>Pick Your Poison</h2>

<p>First things first: pick your character. Each character in <em>Thick as Thieves</em> has their own abilities; essentially, they each have one killer advantage.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Spider, for instance, is quite mobile and is equipped with tools like a grappling hook to get on top of roofs and other obstacles. The Chameleon, on the other hand, can take the form of an NPC.</p>



<p>The Chameleon, in particular, sounds quite intriguing, as his playstyle revolves around subterfuge and trickery by trying to mimic the habits of an NPC.</p>

<p>Whatever the case, at the start of every match, each thief is assigned the same job by the Thieves Guild. The objective is to obtain a special book, which is purportedly hidden in a manor. We don’t know much beyond that, which is why collecting clues is crucial.</p>



<h2>Making Garrett Proud</h2>

<p>This does hearken back to games like <em>Thief</em> where you’d have to collect clues scattered around the environment to eventually find your way to the target. Indeed, <em>Thick as Thieves </em>is described as a spiritual successor to <em>Thief</em>, so you can expect it to share similar gameplay elements like reading those notes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Eventually, we find out how to obtain the book. The way in which you find your target piece of loot will change from game to game, so there is a degree of unpredictability here.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Grabbing the target will start a timer that alerts other thieves that someone has the item and are working their way to the exit. This is where, presumably, most players will come out of the woodwork and try to fight you.</p>



<h2><em>Thick as Thieves&nbsp;</em>Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>I wish I could have seen more of the multiplayer aspect, because that’s really at the heart of <em>Thick as Thieves’</em> gameplay. It simply doesn’t seem quite as exciting with one player.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And that’s related to another concern of mine: the game’s longevity. Immersive sims are already a niche genre, and <em>Thick as Thieves </em>will depend on a healthy audience. I just don’t know if that audience is there, but I really hope it is.</p>

<p>But, with minds like Warren Specter behind <em>Thick as Thieves</em>, I have faith in the project. Should it gather the numbers needed to thrive, this title has potential to create a lot of long-lasting memories.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/682594/asus-rog-ally-x-price-hike-legion-go-s-steam-deck-oled-supply<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>The first third-party SteamOS handheld, the Lenovo Legion Go S, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338028/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-windows">was supposed to cost $499</a>. The Asus ROG Ally X became <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24204770/asus-rog-ally-x-review-handheld-gaming-pc">the best Windows gaming handheld</a> at a $799 sticker price. But ahead of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/676901/nintendo-switch-2-launch-here">Nintendo Switch 2’s launch</a> on June 5th and Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682009/microsoft-asus-rog-xbox-ally-devices-new-windows-xbox-experience">Xbox Ally announcement</a> on June 8th, Asus and Lenovo’s handhelds suddenly cost $100 more than originally promised in the US.</p></div><p>And, separately, Valve has temporarily stopped selling the $649 1TB model of its Steam Deck OLED in the US and Canada, citing unspecified supply chain constraints:</p><div><blockquote><p>Steam Deck OLED 1TB models are temporarily out-of-stock in the US and Canada as we adapt to recent supply chain constraints. We anticipate being back in stock by end of summer, and currently expect prices will remain the same. We’ll update here as soon as we have more clarity on what the timeline ultimately looks like.</p></blockquote></div><p>Mind you, the $549 512GB Steam Deck OLED is the model I’d recommend anyhow. But combined with the fact that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/3/24311944/msi-claw-7-ai-plus-8-ai-plus-lunar-lake-32gb-ram-gaming-pc-handhelds">the Intel-powered MSI Claw AI 8 Plus</a> also got a $100 price hike shortly after launch, it feels like Windows makers are no longer meaningfully competing with the the Steam Deck or Switch 2, and I’m beginning to wonder if Microsoft will be able to do so when the Xbox Ally launches later this year.</p><p>It’s not clear if Trump’s trade war with China is responsible for any of these specific price changes, though it seems likely in the case of the Asus ROG Ally X. The $800 handheld now starts at $900 at Best Buy in the US, but still costs the equivalent of $800 <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.ca%2Fen-ca%2Fproduct%2Fasus-rog-ally-x-7-1080p-touch-gaming-console-amd-ryzen-z1-extreme-24gb-ram-1tb-ssd-win-11-xbox-gamepass%2F17944483" rel="sponsored">at Best Buy Canada</a>, and hasn’t gone up in price in Mexico either.</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Sean Hollister/The Verge</cite></p></div><p>Asus would not tell us why the price has gone up, or even confirm the price increase to <em>The Verge</em>, after repeated emails.</p><p>Lenovo, meanwhile, raised its prices on the entry-level Legion Go S with SteamOS twice before it put the handheld on sale May 25th. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/638729/lenovo-legion-go-s-steamos-price-increase">It told us about</a> the first $50 price increase in March, and quietly raised the price another $50 before launch.</p><p>As a result, the $599 Legion Go S now costs $50 more than its closest competitor, the $549 Steam Deck OLED, which makes Lenovo’s handheld a more difficult pick than it otherwise could have been. While the SteamOS version is much improved over the Windows one, it’s not a clear winner over the Steam Deck in performance, battery life, screen quality, or comfort in my tests.</p><p>I plan to have a full review of the SteamOS version of the Legion Go S soon, now that I’ve tested both the Z2 Go and Z1 Extreme configs. I still would <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/617613/lenovo-legion-go-s-review-feels-good-plays-bad">not recommend buying the Windows Z2 Go version</a>, which has been discounted down to the same $599. In case you’re wondering, MSI still has not sent <em>The Verge</em> an MSI Claw 8 AI Plus for review, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24105991/msi-claw-review">after I warned readers</a> not to buy its disappointing predecessor, and the company no longer answers my emails.</p><p>If these prices all seem too high for you, there is one deal I keep seeing anecdotally: apparently, some retailers are offering YMMV closeout deals as low as $349 on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24088011/lenovo-legion-go-review">the original Lenovo Legion Go</a> with detachable controllers. I found it bulky and uncomfortable to hold, and a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338044/lenovos-officially-making-a-legion-go-2-too">sequel is on the way</a>, but it’s more interesting at that price, and its Z1 Extreme chip makes it more powerful than any Z2 Go handheld.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
