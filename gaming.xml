			<p>Hideo Kojima was as surprised as anyone learning this week that he was offered to develop a video game project based on the Matrix franchise, as no one ever told him such a conversation took place between the Wachowskis and Konami.</p>



<p>Earlier today, the legendary game designer and creator of the Metal Gear and Death Stranding series clarified<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-matrix-creators-wanted-kojima-make-a-game-on-the-ip-konami-refused/"> the statements made a few days ago by Christopher Bergstresser</a>, the Senior Vice President of Strategic Planning and business Development at Konami between 1996 and 2002. </p>



<p>In his post on <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1983390844037009907">X</a>, Kojima-san confirmed that, back in 1999, he and the Wachowskis exchanged emails as mutual fans, and later met when they traveled to Japan to promote the original Matrix movie for its Japanese release. Kojima-san believes he met them three times, but the offer never came up in any of the conversations he had during these meetings.</p>



<p>"<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">At that time, I was already extremely busy with MGS2 and probably couldn’t have accepted the offer right away. But if someone had told me, maybe there could’ve been a way to make it work,</em>" Hideo Kojima concluded.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I was surprised to see on social media that the Wachowski sisters had “offered me a Matrix game project!” back in 1999. In all these 26 years, no one ever told me such a conversation had taken place. At the time, we were mutual fans and exchanged emails. The Matrix hadn’t been… <a href="https://t.co/4P10P9eEfT">pic.twitter.com/4P10P9eEfT</a></p>— HIDEO_KOJIMA (@HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN) <a href="https://twitter.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1983390844037009907?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 29, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>It is a real shame a Matrix video game project developed by Hideo Kojima never came to be, if the offer had indeed been made, as it would have been a match made in even. Although the franchise's popularity is not what it was in the early 2000s, such a game project would have incredible potential even today, as none of the games based on the franchise have captured what makes it special.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-fbc-firebreak-financials-q3-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/remedy-already-looks-to-be-moving-away-from-fbc-firebreak.1338061/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Alan Wake&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Control&nbsp;</em>developer Remedy Entertainment has posted its financial results for the third quarter of its 2025-26 fiscal year, and there's a pretty clear indication in the report that the studio is moving on from&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em>.</p>

<p>In an official Remedy <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/?publicationId=34fb39e4-7860-4bea-9485-4f29745db2e6" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a>, new interim CEO&nbsp;Markus Mäki, who stepped in to replace departing exec Tero Virtala <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-ceo-tero-virtala-steps-down" rel="nofollow">just last week</a>, says that the company has "moved development resources [from&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em>]&nbsp;to [its] other in-development titles".</p>

<p>Mäki does say that Remedy intends to "respect [its] communicated roadmap" for the game, so at the very least, you can expect the promised updates on said roadmap to arrive in a timely fashion. After that, though, it seems likely Remedy is done with the game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fbc-firebreak-remedy-q3-financials.jpg?itok=abA-jMPi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fbc-firebreak-remedy-q3-financials.jpg?itok=mzZnct5d 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>has resulted in a pretty rotten few months for Remedy.</figcaption></figure><p>Despite this, however,&nbsp;Mäki says that Remedy has "also found positive sides" to&nbsp;the launch of&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em>. He says that the studio's "first multiplayer product launch was technically successful in a cross-platform environment", and that the game's release has helped Remedy's publishing team gain experience.</p>

<p>It hasn't been a great few months for Remedy, though. The aforementioned financial report shows that revenue is down a whopping 32% on last year's Q3, although&nbsp;Mäki says that's because the studio received development fees for&nbsp;<em>Control 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-annapurna-control-2-tv-movies" rel="nofollow">from publisher Annapurna</a> during this period.</p>

<p>Additionally, Remedy made an operating loss of €16.4 million this quarter, compared to a profit of €2.4 million during the same period last year. It's safe to say that&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>has rather scuppered Remedy's third quarter this year, and its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fbc-firebreak-breakpoint-update" rel="nofollow">major Breakpoint update in September</a> hasn't helped much.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, development on&nbsp;<em>Control 2&nbsp;</em>and the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Max Payne&nbsp;</em>remakes continues,&nbsp;Mäki says, and the projects are "progressing according to plan".</p>




<p>It may well be a while before we hear anything more from Remedy regarding these projects, but hopefully, we'll learn what&nbsp;<em>Control 2&nbsp;</em>and the&nbsp;<em>Max Payne&nbsp;</em>remakes look like in the coming months. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-world-development-ending-amazon-layoffs</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-world-development-ending-as-amazon-suffers-layoffs.1338058/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Amazon Games has announced that development on its PvP-focused MMORPG&nbsp;<em>New World&nbsp;</em>is coming to an end, and that the game's tenth season will serve as its final major update.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.newworld.com/en-us/news/articles/update-on-new-world?tag=updates" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">statement</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>New World&nbsp;</em>website, Amazon says that after <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-world-launch-500k-players-queue-times" rel="nofollow">four years</a> of supporting the MMORPG, it is "no longer sustainable to continue supporting the game with new content updates", hence the halt to development.</p>

<p>Despite that, however, the servers won't be going down; you'll still be able to play&nbsp;<em>New World&nbsp;</em>"through 2026" at the very least, although that naturally doesn't mean the servers will continue to be available after next year.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/new-world-development-ending-amazon-party.jpg?itok=hi3xdHbZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/new-world-development-ending-amazon-party.jpg?itok=WNw-Ie5G 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>New World&nbsp;</em>won't be getting any more big updates.</figcaption></figure><p>In an accompanying FAQ, Amazon says that it will "provide more details on what to expect in the coming months" with regards to how long&nbsp;<em>New World</em>'s servers will remain available, and that "a minimum of six months' notice" will be provided before any big changes are made.</p>

<p>In-game currency and purchases are also remaining active, and you'll still be able to buy and play the game on each platform (although the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1063730/New_World_Aeternum/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam page</a> no longer provides the option to purchase <em>New World</em>), as well as downloading it via PlayStation Plus "until further notice".</p>

<p>While development is ending, bug fixes and support will continue, and "world bosses, bonus weeks, and some seasonal events" will stay in rotation as well, although there won't be any more holiday events in&nbsp;<em>New World</em>.</p>

<p><em>New World&nbsp;</em>was released back in 2021 to a rather inauspicious beginning; it was plagued by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-world-is-bricking-gigabyte-rtx-30-series-gpus" rel="nofollow">technical issues</a>, farming <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/amazon-to-crack-down-on-new-world-farming-bots" rel="nofollow">bots</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/game-breaking-new-world-invincibility-exploit-discovered" rel="nofollow">game-breaking bugs</a> from day one, and updates intended to fix problems would often introduce entirely new ones.</p>




<p>In 2024,&nbsp;<em>New World&nbsp;</em>was relaunched with a brand new title,&nbsp;<em>New World: Aeternum</em>, a relaunch that also saw the game arriving on consoles. It was also a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-world-review-bomb-relaunch" rel="nofollow">particularly unpopular move</a> among the game's PC player base, many of whom felt abandoned by Amazon despite their love for the original game.</p>

<p>News of the game entering maintenance mode also comes as Amazon is hit by sweeping layoffs, with thousands of employees <a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/amazon-layoffs-14000-corporate-employees-citing-ai-1236563297/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">losing their jobs</a> amid a push towards AI. The gaming division has also pledged to halt a "significant amount" of its first-party AAA game development.</p>

<p>Amazon isn't exiting the gaming space entirely, though; earlier this month, it was announced that streaming service Luna would be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/amazon-luna-rework-later-this-year" rel="nofollow">getting a major overhaul</a> to refocus on party gaming, although the rebrand will still offer access to many core audience-focused titles as well.</p>

<p>For the time being, you can still check out&nbsp;<em>New World&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/new-world-aeternum/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/new-world-aeternum/9NPZJNVGHZ3P" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and if you already own the game on PC, you can play it there as well. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

<p>Chances are, you’ve had the Advance Ticket sitting idly in your Pokémon TCG Pocket inventory for the best part of a year. The mysterious item has left everyone confused, but not anymore. </p>



<p>It’s been 12 months since <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pockets-card-dex-registration-update-will-arrive-next-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> launched. The free-to-play card-collecting and pack-opening feast has provided daily joy, and this is thanks to numerous new card sets, features, and fun battling. Something more Unown than the Pokémon itself is the Advance Ticket—which is about to be redeemed. </p>



<h2 id="h-advance-ticket-purposes-revealed-for-pokemon-tcg-pocket">Advance Ticket Purposes Revealed For Pokémon TCG Pocket</h2>



<figure><figcaption>New focus. Image via The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>A random draw is set to take place very soon, which will see very Pokemon TCG Pocket users with an Advanced Ticket be rewarded for their patience with a set number of Hourglasses.</p>



<p>“We’ll be holding a drawing for players, so please make sure to check your Gifts in-game to see your rewards,” said the official X page.</p>



<p>The random draw will happen at 11 PM PDT on October 29, and the prizes are divided into three different potential outcomes:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>1st Prize:</strong> 1,200 Pack Hourglasses for 100 lucky winners.</li>



<li><strong>2nd Prize:</strong> 120 Pack Hourglasses for 10,000 lucky winners.</li>



<li><strong>3rd Prize:</strong> 24 Pack Hourglasses for all players.</li>
</ul>



<p>Whatever the result, if you have the Advanced Ticket in your possession, you are guaranteed to get some Pack Hourglasses. Obviously, we’d all love to be the recipient of 2nd Prize, let alone 1st Prize.</p>



<p>Interestingly, according to the small print, even if you don’t have the Advance Ticket: “The 3rd prize will also be distributed to players with no advance ticket.”</p>

<figure data-uuid="f77e8d5ceb611"><a title="Monster Hunter Wilds / Rise" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f77e8d5ceb611/monster-hunter-wilds-rise.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Capcom has today shared its latest <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/pdf/explanation/2025/2nd/explanation_2025_2nd_01.pdf">financial results</a> for Q2 of FY2025/26, and the software sales numbers have left us rubbing our eyes and pulling a double take — is that the four-year-old <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/monster_hunter_rise">Monster Hunter Rise</a> putting up more new sales than <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/monster_hunter_wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>?</p>
<p>The answer is yes, yes it is. As noted by our friends over at <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/10/monster-hunter-wilds-doing-so-badly-thats-its-been-outsold-by-mh-rise-devil-may-cry-5">Push Square</a>, there's a rather amusing wrinkle in the studio's Digital Contents Unit Sales Ranking this time around. Series newbie Monster Hunter Wilds — which shifted <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/03/monster-hunter-wilds-smashes-capcom-record-with-10-million-units-sold">10 million units</a> in its record-breaking opening weeks, let's not forget — is at the bottom of the pile with 637,000 sales in the first half of the fiscal year, while Rise is one spot above it with 643,000 sales.</p>
<p>That might not be a huge gap on paper, but it's exacerbated when we look at Q2 in isolation. Of those 637,000 sales, 477,000 came in <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/pdf/explanation/2025/1st/explanation_2025_1st_01.pdf">Q1</a>, meaning Wilds only shifted an additional 160,000 copies in the months since. Rise, on the flip side, managed 254,000 sales in the same period — a slight decline from the 389,000 sold in Q1, but what do you expect, it's <em>four years old</em>.</p>
<figure data-uuid="4065e85c9a446"><a title="Capcom Q2 FY2025 Unit Sales" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4065e85c9a446/capcom-q2-fy2025-unit-sales.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/pdf/explanation/2025/2nd/explanation_2025_2nd_01.pdf">Capcom</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>As you can see, the two Monster Hunters sit firmly at the bottom of the pile, outsold by the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> (which put up 547,000 sales in Q2) and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-village-gold-edition">Resident Evil Village</a>, which actually sold the most units in Q2 (643,000), despite still falling behind <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/devil_may_cry_5">Devil May Cry 5</a> on the fiscal year as a whole.</p>
<p>Of course, there are a bunch of reasons why Wilds might be falling behind Rise, despite being the <em>much</em> newer of the two — the latter's availability on more platforms and readily available bonus content, for example — but it's still kind of crazy to see how much the sales have dropped off after Capcom's stellar launch earlier this year.</p>
<p>You'll notice that a bunch of the titles in the above list will be making their way to Switch 2 before the fiscal year is up (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-7-biohazard-gold-edition">Resident Evil VII</a> and Village will join <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Requiem</a> on the hybrid on 27th February), so it'll be interesting to see what that does to the total unit sales. Outside of that, we'll be keeping our fingers crossed for news of mainline MonHun coming our way at some point in the future.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s</span></a><span> endgame is pretty hectic, so by the time you reach the post-game, you might be overstimulated and overlook some of the ways things have changed in your home base of Hotel Z. There’s an entirely missable epilogue of sorts for a character that even gives you a free Pokémon with ties to someone from </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-best-worst-games-ranked-red-blue-scarlet-violet-1849984595"><i><span>Pokémon X </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Y</span></i></a><span>. We’ll start with a spoiler-free explanation of where to go and what to look for, then we’ll dive into the details.</span></p> <p><span>As soon as you beat the final boss, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-credits-npc-dialogue-school-kid-2000638839"><span>the credits roll</span></a><span>, and when you’re finally given back control of your character, you’ll find a Poké Ball sitting on the table in your hotel room. It’s entirely possible to miss and walk right past it because </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>doesn’t direct your attention to it, but this Poké Ball contains a Pokémon you’ve already met on your journey, and a note from an old friend. Now that you know where to go, let’s unpack this.</span></p>

  <p><span>The Poké Ball has AZ’s Lucario, which you used much earlier in the game to learn how to use Mega Evolution. But this Lucario wasn’t always AZ’s. The 3000-year-old war criminal (who has never done anything wrong in his life) was gifted this fighting/steel monster by “a certain trainer” who hoped it would be able to keep him safe in Lumiose City. If you examine Lucario’s stats, you’ll see its original trainer is listed as Korrina. If you don’t know or remember who that is, Korrina is the fighting-type gym leader in </span><i><span>Pokémon X </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Y</span></i><span>. She also gave the player a Lucario in those games as well. While Korrina doesn’t actually appear in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, she’s still indirectly helping the player out.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Alongside Lucario’s Poké Ball, you’ll find a letter from AZ written before his passing. In it, he reflects on his 3000 years, including when he originally received his partner Floette, the Kalos War thousands of years prior that led to the events of </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, the first time he saw a Pokémon undergo Mega Evolution, and when he saw the “dark day” fall over Galar, the region in </span><i><span>Pokémon Sword </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Shield</span></i><span>. This is in reference to what is colloquially known as the Darkest Day, in which a Legendary Pokémon called Eternatus caused the Pokémon of the region to undergo forced Dynamax transformations, which turn Pokémon into kaiju-like giants. The monsters nearly destroyed the region, but the entire event came to an end when the two Kings of Galar defeated Eternatus. The event was “recreated” in </span><i><span>Sword </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Shield</span></i><span>, but AZ was alive for the original one.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>By itself, this might just seem like a bit of extra world-building, but given that we know through </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-leak-generation-10-wind-wave-galar-legends-mmo-2000635337"><span>the Teraleak</span></a><span> that the next </span><i><span>Legends</span></i><span> game may be a historical Galar game, AZ might appear in a future game, despite his death in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>. Even if we never knew anything about the leaks, this line would likely have sparked speculation that the next </span><i><span>Legends</span></i><span> game would go back to the past like </span><i><span>Legends: Arceus</span></i><span>. It feels like Game Freak is still solidifying what the </span><i><span>Legends</span></i><span> moniker means, and if it keeps bouncing around the timeline like this, maybe the subseries will just be a place for the team to experiment and fill in lore gaps without any hard rules.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-25-244hz-gaming-monitor-at-record-low-now-costs-the-same-as-a-budget-display-2000639677</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’re approaching the holidays fairly fast, but the big holiday sales events like Black Friday and Cyber Monday are still a month away. Luckily, you can still find some good opportunities to save even right now. If you’re a PC gamer in the market for a new primary or secondary monitor, now’s a great time to jump on it because Amazon has the <strong>Samsung Odyssey G4 gaming monitor</strong> on sale for 29% off: It’s <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5081/">normally listed at $280, but the discount has it knocked down in price by $80, bringing what you have to pay down to an even $200</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5081/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>This 25-inch monitor from Samsung is capable of delivering a clear depth of colors in a 1080p FHD resolution. It’s got a fast response time of just 1ms with a smooth refresh rate of 240Hz. The screen eliminates lag and will make any game that relies on fast inputs and quick reaction times a dream to play. That pogo platforming section in Hunter’s March from <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> can be significantly easier on a better monitor.</p>
<p>The monitor has NVIDIA G-SYNC which is able to keep your GPU and panel synchronized. What this does is eliminate choppiness, screen-lag, and image tears. AMD FreeSync Premium can also help to ensure better stability and a stutter-free gameplay experience.</p>
<p>With this monitor, you can connect your PC or gaming console over either of the two HDMI inputs or through the DisplayPort input. If you have multiple sources connected to your Samsung Odyssey G4 display, the monitor can auto-detect when a new source signal is plugged in or turned on, changing the input over so you don’t have to manually. Get into the action faster.</p>



<h2>Optimal Viewing</h2>
<p>This Samsung monitor is built with an ergonomic stand which can be raised and lowered to your liking. Tilt the angle of the screen toward or away from you to find the optimal viewing for how and where you are seated or standing at your desk. The screen can even be rotated to go either horizontal or vertical. This makes for a wondering secondary monitor. Keeping you main screen horizontal front and center is ideal for longer gaming sessions so you neck is always straight as your facing forward. Then you can have a second monitor positioned to the side of it vertically. This is great for Discord, Slack, or any kind of message apps so you can see more of the conversation at once.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>When it launched in 2017, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild received near-universal acclaim, including a <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/the_legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild/b/switch/archive/2017/03/02/game-informer-the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-switch-review.aspx">10 out of 10 from <em>Game Informer</em></a> and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2018/01/04/game-informers-best-of-2017-awards.aspx">Game of the Year honors</a>. Nintendo has announced a partnership with Laced Records, a gaming-focused record label, to bring the beautiful and, at times, emotional soundtrack from one of the most beloved games of the 21st century to vinyl next year. This release marks one of the first major Nintendo titles to receive an official vinyl release outside of Japan.&nbsp;</p><p>The vinyl soundtrack release is available in a double-LP set or an expanded 8-LP box set. Each version is available in standard black vinyl or a special limited-edition colored variant: The double-LP comes in blue and white, while the 8-LP box set features blue and gold splatters on white discs. The double-LP releases feature 34 select tracks, including "Overworld (Day)," "Great Fairy Fountain," and "Hyrule Castle." Meanwhile, the 8-LP releases include 130 tracks, and each disc is sequenced around a theme from Breath of the Wild, such as exploration, freeing the Divine Beasts, and discovering Shrines. All the tracks have been remastered for vinyl, aiming to provide the best translation of the work of composers Manaka Kataoka, Yasuaki Iwata, Hajime Wakai, and Soshi Abe.</p><p>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild vinyl soundtrack collection arrives on June 19, 2026, with pre-orders available today. The limited-edition blue versions will be available exclusively through Laced Records, the My Nintendo Store, Nintendo New York, and Nintendo San Francisco, while the standard-edition black vinyl versions will be available at select retailers.</p><hr><p><em><span>Do you have any game soundtracks on vinyl?

			<p>The PlayStation Portal handheld system may be about to get a highly-requested feature soon, judging from a PS App leak.</p>



<p>Over on the <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaystationPortal/comments/1ohdvol/streaming_owned_games_imminent/">PlayStation Portal official subreddit</a>, user GetTheWetsOn shared a screenshot captured from the PS App of the Deliver at All Costs store page, which seemingly confirms that cloud streaming of purchased digital games could be coming to the PlayStation Portal for PS Plus Premium subscribers. The user also stated that the same confirmation, which has since been removed, could be found on the Dead Space remake store page.</p>



<p>While there's no indication this new PlayStation Portal streaming option is indeed coming, its confirmation on the store pages of two different games is unlikely to be a mistake, so there's a high chance it will eventually arrive on the system. </p>



<p>Ever since the system's release and its surprising popularity, Sony has repeatedly iterated that the company is looking into <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-portal-cloud-streaming/">expanding the system's functionality</a>. Allowing streaming of owned digital PlayStation games without having to download them first on their home system would be the perfect way to do so.</p>



<p>The PlayStation Portal is a Remote Play focused handheld device which launched back in 2023 worldwide. While not the successor of the PlayStation Vita many have been expecting for a long time, the system does what it does exceptionally well. You can learn more about it by checking out Kai's<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-portal-remote-play-device/"> review.</a></p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/life-is-strange">Life is Strange</a> developers Don't Nod have revealed that they're working on a new narrative game based around a "major IP" in partnership with Netflix. The game'll be developed at Don't Nod's Montreal studio, with the chilling-based streaming service set to publish it.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This deal was announced via Don't Nod's <a href="https://www.dontnod-bourse.com/en/financial-information/press-releases/?ID=ACTUS-0-94850">latest financial results</a>, which detail how they've done in the first half of the 2025 fiscal year. CEO Oskar Guilbert characterised the first six months of this year as having seen "solid revenue growth", though the company's total operating revenue of €13.9 million was down by 5% compared to the first half of 2024. A "performance plan" they've enacted after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/life-is-strange-developers-dont-nod-hit-with-more-layoffs">a rough period</a> - which saw staff laid off, games put on pause, and Guilbert himself accused of "catastrophic management" by the French union STJV - is expected to start paying larger dividends soon.</p>
<p>This deal with Netflix is cited as a "key milestone" in that effort to turn things around. "The project finances the Montreal studio and aligns with the Group's strategy to secure its resources and strengthen its ability to evolve in an increasingly competitive and selective market," Don't Nod say in addition to blowing their own storytelling trumpet.</p>
<p>There's no indication of which Netflix show might be getting the game treatment, but the socials have very much begun to fill with 'Life is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stranger-things">Stranger Things</a>' jokes. Personally, I think it'll be an adaptation of Victoria Beckham's fashion documentary which also rewinds back Lost Records-style to her and David's heyday in the 90s and early 2000s. Either that or something about a serial killer. Or maybe Wednesday Addams is going to make a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1543830/The_Addams_Family_Mansion_Mayhem/">less party-centric</a> return to the gamisphere.</p>
<p>Until we find out, give <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lost-records-bloom-rage-tape-1-bloom-review%3EGraham's%20review">Graham's review</a> of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lost-records-bloom-and-rage">Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</a>'s first tape a re-read. It made him ask important questions:</p>
<blockquote>Is it possible that this video game of Young Adult tropes and teenage girl protagonists just isn't meant for me? I have a few rebuttals to that idea. For one, hey, this game also contains the tired 40-something version of those characters, which I obviously find deeply relatable. I was also a kid in the '90s and feel a growing nostalgia for Hey Arnold! and my Nintendo 64. I bet I'd love Yellowjackets, and I own a Rainbow Rowell novel and one day I might even read it, but really I just think that good writing can transcend demographics.</blockquote>
<p>You'll always be a young adult to me, former bossman.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dji-liquidates-its-mic-mini-at-a-record-low-noise-cancelling-and-hq-audio-now-cost-peanuts-2000639685</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dji-liquidates-its-mic-mini-at-a-record-low-noise-cancelling-and-hq-audio-now-cost-peanuts.1337992/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Shooting high-quality video with exceptional vibrancy and just the right angles is just half the story. You need clean audio to get the message, excitement and even frustration across. Most cameras out there have built-in microphones but they are not always enough: If you want that professional audio that cuts through background chatter and reaches with exceptional clarity, it might be time <strong>for a proper wireless mic system</strong>.</p>
<p>DJI – one of our favorite go-to brands for cameras – also has a solid lineup of wireless microphones and we just spotted an option going for less. The DJI Mic Mini, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5079/">which typically retails for $119, is now going for just $74 at Amazon, after a generous 38% discount</a>. It’s the lowest price we’ve seen in the past 30 days; even Prime Day didn’t bring it this low. We recommend grabbing it sooner rather than later, as the offer might wrap up anytime now.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5079/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Impressive Range With Two Noise Cancellation Modes</h2>
<p>This setup gives you two transmitters and one receiver, so it’s perfect for when you’re shooting with more than one user. Each transmitter is small, lightweight, and can be worn/clipped easily. It doesn’t feel bulky or look unpleasant on camera. Despite its tiny size, it offers a maximum transmission range of 400 meters for stronger signals both indoors and outdoors. Recording in those busy streets and jam-packed cafeterias won’t be a problem, ever again.</p>
<p>You’re also getting two noise cancellation modes; basic and strong. The basic mode is ideal for relatively quieter environments, like your home, while the strong mode is more appropriate for noisier settings. It also comes with an automatic limiting feature that reduces volume spikes and maintains a consistent tone; your audience won’t be hit with an unexpected jumpscare mid-video.</p>



<p>Battery-wise, you’re looking at up to 10 hours of operating time on both the transmitters and the receiver. This is more than enough for longer shoots, and you can even go a couple of days without plugging them in. The DJI Mic Mini also plays well with a wide range of devices. Even without the receiver, you can pair the transmittor with DJI devices like the Osmo Pocket 3 and Osmo Action 5 Pro.</p>
<p>In the box, you’ll find two transmitters, one receiver, a mobile adapter, a camera audio cable, clip magnets, windscreens, a charging dock, and a carrying pouch. Keep in mind that the offer might end soon, so it’s best to grab it fast.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/do-you-need-battlefield-6-to-play-redsec/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/do-you-need-battlefield-6-to-play-redsec-how-to-play-battlefield-redsec-battle-royale.1337986/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield REDSEC offers several new ways to play Battlefield 6. It arrived after Battlefield 6’s launch, just like Warzone did after MW 2019, and we’re here to let you know if you can play for free, and if so, how.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6 launched with a campaign and multiplayer. Throw in Portal, and you’ve got yourself a pretty meaty bundle. However, we always knew EA and Battlefield Studios had more ideas up their sleeves. This materialized on October 28 with the launch of Battlefield 6’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-redsec-review-br-warzone-coded/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">REDSEC</a>.</p>



<p>It came bundled with battle royale (no <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-redsec-battle-royale-solo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Solo mode</a>, though) and the hot new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gauntlet-mode-battlefield-6-redsec-battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gauntlet</a> playlist. Let’s see if you need Battlefield 6 to play it, though. </p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-redsec-without-owning-battlefield-6">Can You Play REDSEC Without Owning Battlefield 6?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Plenty to enjoy for free. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Yes, you can play Battlefield: REDSEC for free without needing to own a full, paid copy of Battlefield 6.</strong></p>



<p>Just like Call of Duty and Warzone, REDSEC is an independent release separate from Battlefield 6. This means you can enjoy a premium Battlefield 6 experience without needing to pay a single penny. If you want to, you can buy Battlefield 6 from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/battlefield-6-amazon-us/">Amazon</a>!</p>



<p>All BR modes are free-to-play, as is Gauntlet Mode. We’re sure REDSEC will add new features and modes over the coming months and years as well. Has there ever been a better time to be a Battlefield fan?</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-battlefield-redsec">How To Play Battlefield REDSEC</h2>



<p><strong>To play Battlefield REDSEC, you need to go into your relevant storefront, download it, wait for it to install, and you can jump straight into EA’s free-to-play Battlefield experience.</strong></p>



<p>For an easy breakdown of what to do, check out these simple instructions:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the PlayStation Store, Microsoft Store, or Steam.</li>



<li>Search for <strong>Battlefield REDSEC</strong>.</li>



<li>Click on the game.</li>



<li>Choose to download <strong>Battlefield REDSEC</strong>.</li>



<li>Wait for the download to complete.</li>



<li>Once it’s ready, you can now boot up REDSEC and play it for free!</li>
</ol>



<p>There was speculation that REDSEC was going to be free, but only for players who already own Battlefield 6—technically making it not free. However, this is a smart decision on EA’s part and should do a lot to help both Battlefield 6 and REDSEC have a long battery life.</p>



<p>Let us know if you’ve had a chance to play REDSEC yet. Can you not get enough of Gauntlet? Or is the allure of battle royale still proving to be too much?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon is walking away from making new content from its MMO, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/new-world-aeternum">New World</a>, amid huge layoffs affecting 14,000 roles at the company. Now, there is concern over the status of its The Lord of the Rings MMO.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yesterday, October 28, Amazon confirmed cuts affecting an eye-watering 14,000 roles. It’s one of the biggest round of layoffs the tech giant has ever seen, and comes at a time when other companies in the tech sector, such as Microsoft and Meta, have made similarly huge cuts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It also comes at a time when Amazon is performing well. So why are they happening? AI, basically. In <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/amazon-workforce-reduction" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a note to employees</a>, Beth Galetti, Senior Vice President of People Experience and Technology at Amazon, said:</p><blockquote>Some may ask why we’re reducing roles when the company is performing well. Across our businesses, we're delivering great customer experiences every day, innovating at a rapid rate, and producing strong business results. What we need to remember is that the world is changing quickly. This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones). We’re convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">What does this all mean for Amazon’s gaming business? According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-28/amazon-makes-significant-cuts-in-video-game-division" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg</a>, nothing good. There are “significant” cuts coming to Amazon’s video game operation, which will reduce development work and layoff staff mainly in its Irvine and San Diego offices.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The New World changes are a part of that, and while the game will remain online during 2026, this is basically the beginning of the end for once hugely popular MMO. Let’s remember, New World was a rare hit for Amazon in the video game space, and followed multiple flops that resulted in game and studio closures. The MMO set in an alternate 1600s America saw huge player numbers on Steam, with a whopping 913,634 peak concurrents on Valve's platform back in 2021. Player numbers have significantly declined since that peak, however.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bloomberg said Amazon is cutting back especially on MMOs, but will continue to develop Amazon Games Montreal’s strategy March of Giants, its new Tomb Raider game in the works at Crystal Dynamics, and "casual and AI-focused games" for its cloud gaming service Luna. UK studio Maverick Games will continue to work on its racing game, too. Amazon Games also continues to publish externally developed games such as Lost Ark and Throne &amp; Liberty in western markets.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon is also working on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-lord-of-the-rings-mmo">an in-house The Lord of the Rings MMO</a>, although we haven’t heard much about it since <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lord-of-the-rings-mmo-coming-from-new-world-developer-amazon-games">it was announced in 2023</a>. In August last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-games-still-seeking-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-christoph-hartmann-interview">Amazon Games boss Christoph Hartmann told IGN</a> the company had 10 games in development and was negotiating "a couple more." These include Tomb Raider and The Lord of the Rings MMO, as well as the new driving game from the former developers behind Forza Horizon.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Tomb Raider Review Ever</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On The Lord of the Rings MMO, however, Hartmann insisted it was still early days. "We're still trying to find the hook, find that idea of what it is because we don't just want to go and do the same thing over," Hartmann said at the time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"While it's tempting sometimes with an existing IP, that's not the point of doing it. You've got to find a fresh twist, and we're still, I think, in that period where we really want to find out what could be the hook, what could be the thing which is different to all the other games out there. So it's a little bit early.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has asked Amazon for an update on The Lord of the Rings MMO.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also plenty of questions around Tomb Raider, which has been caught up in the mire around the Embracer Group. Hartmann mostly waved off those concerns, saying that developer Crystal Dynamics is "fairly sheltered from everything going on with Embracer."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"People obviously look at what the parent company is doing, but it never impacted on resources, never led to any changes on management for them, so they're fine. I mean, doing a new Tomb Raider, the bar is so high. The longer you go, the expectation goes higher, so it's a huge, huge task, but things are progressing. I mean, there's some really great ideas here," Hartmann said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Obviously, we're not going to share any with you even if we would love to, but things are going well, things are moving forward. And from what I could tell, Crystal was pretty sheltered, because also when you look before...they went through a couple of ownership changes anyway before, it's not brand new for them."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crystal-dynamics-lays-off-more-following-perfect-dark-cancelation">Crystal Dynamics recently laid off a number of workers following Microsoft’s cancelation of the Perfect Dark reboot</a>. At the time, the studio insisted Tomb Raider was still in development and unaffected by the decision.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Crystal Dynamics was originally brought in to revitalize Perfect Dark after struggles getting the project moving with former co-developer, Certain Affinity. Crystal was later acquired by the Embracer Group in 2022, at which time the studio was revealed to have 273 employees across its Austin, Bellevue, and San Mateo offices. Crystal laid off 10 people in 2023, and laid off 17 more people earlier this year. It's unclear how many remain now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"I get there is a debate about that…"</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth"><u>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</u></a> director Naoki Hamaguchi is once again championing the infamous "yellow paint" to guide players, saying "there is definitely a need" for it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Using yellow paint on ledges and walls to indicates a traversable area in a video game has been a hot topic among players ever since its rise in popularity in the likes of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/11/13/uncharted-drakes-fortune-review"><u>Uncharted on PlayStation 3</u></a>. Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth uses this tactic too, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-sparks-yellow-paint-debate-once-again"><u>players sharing their thoughts on it</u></a> and leaving Hamaguchi himself surprised about the debate it stirred at the time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a new interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/final-fantasy/oh-no-the-yellow-paint-debate-is-back-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-director-says-there-is-definitely-a-need-for-that-kind-of-thing-and-the-only-real-question-is-about-how-its-done/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>GamesRadar+</u></a>, Hamaguchi said he understood there are some people who don't want or need the yellow paint, but insisted that it was necessary.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I get there is a debate about that, whether that fits with that world or not, whether some people want it, some people don't," Hamaguchi said. "I think as a game, there is definitely a need for that kind of thing in a lot of ways. I think obviously different developers experiment, try different things about what works best, what fits best, the right way of doing that in their game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The need to guide players around from from a gameplay perspective and show them what can be done, what they need to do, there is definitely times where that is needed," he added. "So I think obviously there is more of a debate about how it's done, what level and what works. And there'll still be people who say, 'No, that doesn't fit at all. We don't like that.' That's fine, but I think there is definitely a need there, and it's something that is definitely worth looking at."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When the yellow paint debate kicked off with Rebirth last year, some said they didn't like how in-your-face the hand-holding was not just in Final Fantasy 7 Remake, but modern video games. Others, however, pointed out that it could be helpful, and was an important accessibility feature. Developers, too, weighed in, with some highlighting how in playtests and focus groups, players sometimes struggle to work out where to go, get frustrated, and quit playing altogether. Because of this, somewhat obvious and sometimes unrealistic visual clues are needed to help point players in the right direction. And some have pointed out that video games have featured visual clues for exploration and progression for decades now.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">With discussion around the yellow paint in FF7R, who remembers the options red/green arrows plus giant pointer available in the original FF7? <a href="https://t.co/qMLnKh3rGw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/qMLnKh3rGw</a></p>— John Linneman @dark1x.bsky.social (@dark1x) <a href="https://twitter.com/dark1x/status/1756686944178676036?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 11, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Based on Hamaguchi's comments, perhaps fans can expect the yellow paint to return for Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3.

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> received both its Season One update yesterday, as well as the Redsec battle royale mode in a massive content update for the popular military FPS. Not everyone is happy though.</p>
<p>While many are having a good time with the update, others are dejected due to the influx of microtransactions, relatively colourful cosmetics, and weekly battle pass challenges that can push players towards the battle royale mode they may not be interested in. It seems like Battlefield 6, which has largely been sailing smoothly since launch, has hit turbulent weather.</p>
<p>Starting with the battle pass, you progress through it via BP points, which are earned <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oio6d7/dear_dice_if_i_wanted_to_play_a_terrible/">through the completion of weekly challenges</a> as well as XP gained through playing. These points unlock tiers of the battle pass, filled with cosmetics, boosts, and currency rewards.</p>

<p>These challenges previously could be completed in any mode for the most part, aside from a few specific challenges for certain unlockables. However these battle pass challenges can force players to jump into the battle royale. They can be rerolled, but if you reroll and land on battle royale challenges, you're stuck with them.</p>
<p>These cosmetics are <em>largely</em> thematic with the military aesthetic of Battlefield 6, such as various digital camouflages. However these have rubbed some players the wrong way, especially, those that found the authentic look of the classes at launch appealing.</p>
<p>The battle pass also isn't simply offered in a free and paid form. Players can buy separate bundles that provide different rewards. There's the Season One Starter pack, the Season One Advanced Pack, the Rogue Ops pack, and the Season One Pro Pack. Then there are the skins added to the in-game store itself, which must be bought with Battlefield coins.</p><p>It's a sharp turn away from the more pure FPS experience people have been playing in droves this month, and what seemed to tempt people to the game as they tire of the uber-capitalist trudge that Call of Duty has become.</p>

<p>New sets in Pokémon TCG Pocket have been a regular occurrence since the title first released, but Mega Rising is a big moment for the title as it introduces the mechanic of Mega Evolution, adding further complexity to deck building to consider.</p>



<p>For all the release details of the Mega Rising set, check out our guide below.</p>

<p><strong>TCG Pocket’s B1 Mega Rising set will be released on Thursday, October 30, as confirmed by the trailer for the new set.</strong></p>



<p>The launch of the set marks the start of the second year of Pokémon TCG Pocket with the start of ‘B’ sets, though it’s not clear at this stage exactly how that will shake up the meta and what restrictions, if any, will be in place for cards.</p>



<p>There’s still time to get your hands on Pack Hourglasses ahead of the release of the set, and it’s worth taking every opportunity you can ahead of the release.</p>

<p><strong>The Mega Rising set in Pokémon TCG Pocket</strong> <strong>is headlined by the introduction of Mega Evolutions, following the release of Pokémon Legends: Z-A and Mega Evolutions returning in the physical TCG.</strong></p>



<p>Ahead of release, the full set list has been <a href="https://www.serebii.net/tcgpocket/megarising/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">detailed by Serebii</a>, featuring Mega Pinsir, Mega Blaziken, Mega Gyarados, and Mega Altaria amongst the cards.

<figure data-uuid="7add030a48a3d"><a title="The Binding of Isaac: Repentance+ 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7add030a48a3d/the-binding-of-isaac-repentanceplus-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nicalis</em></figcaption></figure><p>Publisher Nicalis and developer Edmund McMillan have announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/binding-of-isaac-repentanceplus">The Binding of Isaac: Repentance+</a> will be heading to the Switch 2 in <strong>Q1 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>The release will boast the full game alongside key expansions and improvements, plus full cooperative play via online connection. If that's not enough, Repentance+ will also benefit from a full physical release, so no Game-Key Card here, folks.</p>

<p>Pre-orders are available now via the <a href="https://store.nicalis.com/products/repplus?variant=46804993999105">official Nicalis store</a>, though we'll be honest, we felt a bit of minor bit of whiplash at the <strong>£54</strong> asking price. It's not horrendous, but it's also not what we'd call 'affordable'.</p>
<p>Now let's check out the key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Online play in all game modes, including daily runs, Greed mode, and challenges.<br>
- Extensive preference filters when hosting or searching for online matches.<br>
- Emote wheel and voice chat for online communication.<br>
- New “Item Descriptions” option reveals the full functionality of items you’ve previously collected.<br>
- New leaderboards for online play.<br>
- Over 700 different items to collect.<br>
- More than 300 enemy types and bosses.<br>
- Multiple difficulty settings, game modes, branching paths and endings to discover.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Chances are this one will almost certainly be available digitally, so we'll be sure to provide more updates, including its price, as soon as we can.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/new-world-gets-killed-off-amazon-just-as-people-were-returning/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It was practically a given following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-video-game-division-hit-significant-cuts-amid-mass-14000-layoff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcement of the mass layoffs at Amazon Game Studios</a>, but we now have confirmation that New World, the MMORPG developed by the team based in Irvine, California, is effectively on life support.</p>



<p>Amazon has clarified that Season 10: Nighthaven, which launched earlier this month, will be the last content update because further development 'is not sustainable'. The servers are, however, guaranteed to remain up throughout December 31, 2026 at the least. Complete closure of the servers will likely follow shortly after that date, although Amazon said it will notify players at least six months before that happens.</p>



<p>For now, the game and its in-game currency remain purchasable on all platforms, and New World also remains playable on PlayStation 5 for PlayStation Plus subscribers at the Extra and Premium tiers. Again, when that changes, Amazon will send a notice.</p>



<p>The MMORPG was the first big project financed by Amazon as part of its gaming initiative. <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-game-studios-reveals-breakaway-new-world-crucible-at-twitchcon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It was originally revealed at TwitchCon 2016</a> alongside the MOBA Breakway and the third-person shooter game Crucible, which however were canceled before or shortly after their launch.</p>



<p>New World, on the other hand, kept going, albeit with a few delays. The original vision was for a sandbox-style PvP focused MMORPG, but the team pivoted to a more traditional PvE game with dungeons and story missions while still retained some PvP elements from the previous design.</p>



<p>As someone who followed the game throughout its entire development and then spent a couple of hundred hours playing it, I can say that this confusing design was among the game's biggest failures. While a lot of people were hyped for its release in September 2021 as the first Western-made AAA MMORPG to launch since 2014's The Elder Scrolls Online, leading to a strong debut that <a href="https://wccftech.com/jeff-bezos-praises-amazon-games-for-its-first-success-with-new-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got even Jeff Bezos praising the team</a>, it became immediately clear that there wasn't nearly enough PvE content to keep PvE players interested. On the other hand, the PvP limitations (optional flagging, no looting, etc.) that were introduced to cater to those PvE players ensured that even the PvP niche was not satisfied.</p>



<p>The game could only keep me and my guild interested for two months before boredom inevitably set in. Overall, players left in droves. To their credit, the developers started working on more PvE content, as evidenced by the following updates, the Rise of the Angry Earth expansion, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-aeternum-officially-launches-today-on-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-and-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">last year's Aeternum rebrand and console launch</a>.</p>



<p>However, it was simply not enough to turn the tide. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-horror-themed-nighthaven-looks-good-players-eager-dive-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">final attempt with Season 10: Nighthaven</a> actually caught the interest of MMO fans, allowing the game to rebound and bringing back long server queues, but it was probably too little, too late at that point, as Amazon had already decided to close down the project.</p>



<p>So far, Amazon has not clarified what will happen to The Lord of the Rings MMO project, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-once-again-in-production-at-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was revived two years ago</a>. It is most likely dead, too, but we have asked for an official statement on the matter.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/new-world">New World</a> has seen its last content update, with Amazon Games confirming their development of the MMO is winding down. The game's servers will be staying online in the short term. This news follows mass layoffs at Amazon, with over 14,000 roles reportedly being affected across the company and the gaming division seeing "significant" cuts.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>These layoffs were initially reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-28/amazon-makes-significant-cuts-in-video-game-division">Bloomberg</a>. Amazon haven't confirmed exactly how many staff in its video game arm have been affected by the layoffs, though New World developers Amazon Games Orange County have seen "significant" cuts.</p>
<p>What has <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/amazon-games-layoffs-halt-aaa-development-1236563508/">been made 100% clear</a> by Amazon vice president of audio, Twitch and games Steve Boom is that these layoffs are seeing the company move away from heavy investment into MMOs, with recently re-launched cloud service Amazon Luna being doubled down on. The company will plough on with some of the other games it's got in the works or is publishing, such as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-next-tomb-raider-will-be-published-by-amazon-games">a new Tomb Raider from Crystal Dynamics</a>, strategy game March of the Giants, and an unannounced racer from Maverick Games.</p>
<p>That brings us to New World and a <a href="https://www.newworld.com/en-us/news/articles/update-on-new-world?tag=updates">news post</a> published by Amazon Games late yesterday. "After four years of steady content updates and a major new console release, we've reached a point where it is no longer sustainable to continue supporting the game with new content updates," it reads. "The recently launched Season 10 and Nighthaven update will serve as the final content release for New World on PC and consoles."</p><p>While it won't be getting any more additions alongside essential bug fixes, the MMO won't disappear overnight. Amazon Games plan to keep its servers running "through 2026" and say they'll provide at least six months notice before making any changes that render the game unplayable. In the meantime, New World's Nighthaven and Rise of the Angry Earth updates are being dished out for free on PC. You can also still buy and use in-game currency like Marks of Fortune for the moment, but no refunds'll be offered on any you've already bought.</p>
<p>"Players of Aeternum: Your dedication and enthusiasm have made this New World adventure an unforgettable journey," the post concludes. "We're deeply grateful for every moment you've spent helping build this extraordinary world alongside us. It has been an honor to share Aeternum with you, thank you for helping make this game something truly special."</p>
<p>Solidarity to everyone affected by Amazon's mass layoffs.</p>

              <p>If I try to think of brands that appeal to everyone across all ages and gender, the one that pops into my mind front and center has got to be LEGO. Whether you’re a kid or just a kid at heart, there is joy to be found in building a LEGO set. Assembling LEGO bricks piece by piece, can be a mindful, rewarding, and enjoyable activity. Then by the send of it, you have some cool <em>Star Wars</em> or <em>Marvel</em> toy to play with or display on your shelf.</p>
<p>The only catch is that LEGO sets can get pretty pricey, and when they do actually go on sale, it’s usually not by a lot or it sells out almost immediately. That’s what when a big sale does kick in, it’s hard to pass it up. Right now, this LEGO Star Wars Ahsoka Tano set depicting the duel on Peridea has dropped in price:&nbsp;With the 40% off, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5078/">you end up saving $22 as the price comes down to just $33 (down from $55) for a limited time</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5078/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>From the <em>Star Wars: Ahsoka</em> Season 1 Finale</h2>
<p>There are too many Star Wars LEGO sets to count, and even a small handful depicting scenes from the recent Disney Plus show <em>Star Wars: Ahsoka</em>. This set portrays <strong>Ahsoka Tano’s duel on Peridea against Grand Admiral Thrawn’s army</strong> from the final episode of the show’s first season.</p>



<p>The <strong>382-piece set designed for ages eight and up</strong> includes five minifigures of characters from the show: We have <strong>Ahsoka Tano, Grand Admiral Thrawn, Morgan Elsbeth, Ezra Bridger and a Night Trooper</strong>. The buildable brick platform they fight on features three built-in turntables which can spin each minifigure allowing you to recreate their dynamic battle. You can even reenact Ezra’s leap off the platform with the launchpad.</p>
<p>The LEGO Builder app can help make the build even easier. View each step with a 3D digital version so you can get a better look at some of those weird angles that don’t print well in the instruction booklet. You can zoom in and rotate the model around even bookmark your progress so you can walkaway and come back later to complete your build.</p>
<p>Right now, the LEGO Star Wars Ahsoka Tano’s Duel on Peridea is discounted down to its lowest price yet of just $33.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>It’s been nearly two weeks since Microsoft, a multi-trillion dollar company, shipped <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/799698/xbox-ally-x-review-asus-microsoft-full-screen-experience">a $600 handheld “Xbox”</a> that can’t be relied on to sleep, wake, or hold a charge while asleep in my tests. Neither Microsoft nor Asus would admit there’s a problem with the white Xbox Ally or offer a timeline to fix it after repeated requests by <em>The Verge</em>. (Asus tells me it needs more time to test.)</p><p>But if you want your white Asus handheld to start working reliably, you <em>could</em> do what I did: I installed the latest build <a href="https://bazzite.gg/">of Bazzite</a>, a SteamOS-like, Linux-based operating system that works properly with gamepad controls, and sleeps like a dream. I didn’t need to hibernate or shut down once this past weekend as I blazed through hours of <em>Silksong</em> and finally triumphed in a tough boss fight.</p><p>Did I mention Bazzite runs most of my Windows games <em>substantially faster </em>than Windows?</p><div><h2>Bazzite vs. Windows vs. Deck OLED</h2><table><thead><tr><th><h3>Game and power mode</h3></th><th><h3>Xbox Ally (Bazzite)</h3></th><th><h3>Xbox Ally (Win 11)</h3></th><th><h3>Bazzite vs. Windows</h3></th><th><h3>Steam Deck OLED</h3></th><th><h3>Xbox Ally X (Z2E)</h3></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077, 15-watt TDP</td><td>48</td><td>39</td><td>23.08%</td><td>50</td><td>51</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>53</td><td>41</td><td>29.27%</td><td></td><td>69</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>73</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>75</td></tr><tr><td>35-watt TDP</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>75</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>54</td><td>43</td><td>25.58%</td><td>50</td><td>77</td></tr><tr><td>DX: Mankind Divided, 15-watt TDP</td><td>67</td><td>55</td><td>21.82%</td><td>64</td><td>75</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>72</td><td>58</td><td>24.14%</td><td></td><td>92</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>93</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>93</td></tr><tr><td>35-watt TDP</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>93</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>72</td><td>58</td><td>24.14%</td><td>64</td><td>106</td></tr><tr><td>Returnal, 15-watt TDP</td><td>20</td><td>24</td><td>-16.67%</td><td>25</td><td>42</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>21</td><td>26</td><td>-19.23%</td><td></td><td>47</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>51</td></tr><tr><td>35-watt TDP</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>21</td><td>26</td><td>-19.23%</td><td>25</td><td>51</td></tr><tr><td>Shadow of the Tomb Raider, 15-watt TDP</td><td>59</td><td>51</td><td>15.69%</td><td>60</td><td>68</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>63</td><td>55</td><td>14.55%</td><td></td><td>75</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>76</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>77</td></tr><tr><td>35-watt TDP</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>76</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>64</td><td>55</td><td>16.36%</td><td>60</td><td>83</td></tr><tr><td>HZD Remastered, 15-watt TDP</td><td>33</td><td>26</td><td>26.92%</td><td>34</td><td>29</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>36</td><td>27</td><td>33.33%</td><td></td><td>31</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>31</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>31</td></tr><tr><td>35-watt TDP</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>31</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>36</td><td>27</td><td>33.33%</td><td>34</td><td>32</td></tr></tbody></table><div><p><figcaption><em>Average framerates at 720p low, save </em>Cyberpunk 2077 <em>at 720p Steam Deck preset.

With Bazzite, the same device runs up to 30 percent faster than with Windows, and beats the Steam Deck in all but one of my gaming benchmarks. Several reviewera say the black Xbox Ally X, which doesn’t have as many sleep issues, gets a similar Bazzite speed boost.</p><p>It’s not just games that feel faster: Steam is a far more responsive interface without the bloat of Windows lurking under the hood. It feels like an entirely different handheld. With Bazzite, I can use it like I use a Nintendo Switch, simply pressing the power button whenever I want to pause a game, then picking up exactly where I left off hours or days later.</p><p>It’s faster to launch games, faster to wake from sleep; I also almost never need to touch the screen and leave fingerprints, something that still eludes Microsoft’s latest attempt at gamepad-controlled Windows.</p><div id=":R4ibcrij96:"><div><p><figcaption>Even the Ally’s buttons are less confusing under Bazzite.

(Yes, I’m on the unstable build, since that’s the version that fixed sleep first.)</em></figcaption></p></div><p>I won’t get into all the details because I don’t want to sound like a broken record — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/30/24329005/bazzite-asus-rog-ally-x-steam-os-editorial">last December, I already wrote how Bazzite turned the previous ROG Ally X</a> (not to be confused with the Xbox Ally X) into the best handheld of 2024. And once again, I’ll admit I see no battery life advantage for Bazzite over Windows — occasionally, I even see Bazzite draining a watt more than Microsoft’s OS.</p><p>But it is <em>such a repudiation of Windows</em> that Microsoft’s first “Xbox” handheld, the one with a version of Windows that was supposed to reduce the bloat and fix performance and sleep modes, built by a multi-trillion dollar company, is so effortlessly beaten by the efforts of a few Linux programmers standing atop the shoulders of the roughly 300-person Valve and the broader Linux community.</p><p>Bazzite had a problem getting the white Xbox Ally to sleep too, at first. When I installed it on October 19th, pressing the power button put the system into a state where it wouldn’t wake up again; I needed to hard-reset every time. But that’s because Bazzite’s developers <em>didn’t </em>yet have an Xbox Ally. Two days after programmer Antheas Kapenekakis obtained the hardware and consulted with two contacts at AMD, the three fixed it — and got the Xbox Ally’s programable RGB joystick lights working in Linux, too.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Bazzite and its built-in Handheld Daemon let you control the Ally’s TDP, buttons, and lighting with just a couple presses.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>To give you some idea of just how unreliable the vanilla Xbox Ally is right now, I tested two of them last week, one with “Modern Standby Assist” and “Extreme Standby” turned on, the other off. I applied every update available, checked their batteries regularly, and monitored whenever they woke up.</p><p>Both repeatedly woke up all by themselves at seemingly random intervals, just sitting on my desk, then usually put themselves back to sleep. The deeper sleeper lost 10 percent of its battery life after 12 hours, the other lost 23 percent. (The latter needed to be woken up twice in a row for the gamepad to continue working.)</p><p>But after another 12 hours, I found both handhelds only had 30 percent battery remaining. I’m not sure what happened to one, but the other had clearly tried to apply a Windows Update when it should have been asleep. Separately, I also saw both Windows units refuse to wake from sleep, requiring a hard reset before they would come back to life again. Some Redditors have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxAlly/comments/1obltnp/anyone_else_having_these_issues/">also reported</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxAlly/comments/1obka7w/xbox_ally_x_sleepwake_help/">that issue</a> with both versions of the Xbox Ally, as well as the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxAlly/comments/1oamybz/battery_drain_overnight/">surprise battery drain</a>.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Even though it’s so much better with Bazzite, I hope Microsoft fixes Windows soon.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Microsoft declined our request for an interview about the future of the Xbox Ally or a timeline on fixes, but VP of Windows product management Anshul Rawat provided this statement to <em>The Verge</em>:</p><div><blockquote><p>Windows and Xbox teams are aware of the challenges a limited number of players have experienced and are actively working to refine sleep and wake reliability. We’ve identified a small set of issues and initial fixes will be rolling out soon. Optimizing Windows, the most flexible OS in the world, for a range of devices and screen sizes across PCs and the cloud is an ongoing journey. As we work with our partners to provide a great experience on gaming handhelds, community feedback plays an important role in shaping these improvements for all players.</p></blockquote></div><p>We’ve asked Microsoft what it means by “limited number of players” and “rolling out soon.”</p><p>If I had bought an Xbox Ally myself, I’m not sure I’d wait for Microsoft to figure it out. At a minimum, I <a href="https://docs.bazzite.gg/General/Installation_Guide/dual_boot_setup_guide/">would dual-boot</a>, occasionally swapping back to Windows to get new BIOS updates.</p><p>There are many lingering misconceptions about Linux gaming, like how it supposedly provides less choice than Windows, doesn’t offer game stores other than Steam, doesn’t play as many games, runs those games poorly by comparison. With some exceptions — mostly games with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/31/24284644/apex-legends-loses-linux-steam-deck-support-anti-cheat">advanced anti-cheat solutions</a> — they’re not true.</p><p>You can sideload games from the Epic Games Store, from Battle.net, from Ubisoft and GOG and more, and the Linux community’s efforts mean many aging PC games that have issues running on Windows run fine on Linux. <a href="https://www.protondb.com/">ProtonDB</a> helps you check if your favs are among them.</p><p><em>Photos by Sean Hollister / The Verge</em></p><p><em>Correction: An earlier version of this story mislabeled Handheld Daemon as Handheld Companion.</em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/807711/xbox-ally-sleep-fail-bazzite-fix-performance]]></content:encoded>
