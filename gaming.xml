            <p>
Naughty Dog's Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet won't launch before 2027, according to one of gaming's more credible distributors of gossip and speculation. That's fine, because they haven't announced the sci-fi action-adventure for PC yet. Here's the reveal trailer again, in case you missed it.

<p>
The aforesaid "credible distributor of gossip and speculation" is Jason Schreier, author of whole entire books of insider journalism - he's been <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-studios-ot45-game-of-the-year-edition.1093518/page-284#post-137487981">spilling the beans on Resetera</a>. I have recently become aware of this "book" phenomenon. My understanding is that a "book" is a jailbroken iPad consisting of pounded cobwebs that must be physically gripped and "turned" using Wiimote-style gyroscopic finger inputs.</p>
<p>Journalism contained by books tends to undergo more stringent fact-checking and, as such, enjoys a higher status than the traditional video game information vehicle of a salacious username on Reddit that was accidentally right about one of 12 "leaks" three years ago, and has been duly promoted to internet Cassandra. What I am laboriously saying is that I trust Schreier the Bookman rather more than user TurboJackoff69 who once correctly predicted the coming of rightward-sloping laptop vents. Oh yeah, and Schreier also writes for Bloomberg. They're pretty credible too.
</p>
<p>
Intergalactic is set thousands of years in the future, and casts you as a bounty hunter stranded on a forgotten planet full of ancient religion and blade-o-bots. It's been in development since 2020, and apparently takes inspiration from Akira and Cowboy Bebop, which are a bit "chalk and cheese" as anime influences go. I mean, Bebop has darker moments, but it's not quite doing experiments on psychic children, is it.  
</p>
<p>
Anyway, a key goal of Intergalactic is making the player feel lost and alone, which is great news for those of us who feared that Naughty Dog might pivot back to Drakish quipfire after all the sexy heartache of The Last Of Us.</p>
<p>"I really want you to be lost in a place that you're really confused about what happened here, [about] who are the people here, what was their history," Neil Druckmann <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJUab499PVA">told</a> 28 Days Later director Alex Garland earlier this month (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-the-hate-directed-at-the-last-of-us-part-2-naughty-dog-boss-says-next-game-about-the-entirely-uncontroversial-topics-of-faith-and-religion">Eurogamer</a>). Player character Jordan A. Mun doesn't even have any friends to banter with, though I personally wouldn't rule out Naughty Dog introducing a robot pal. Perhaps you'll talk to it about matters of faith. In my experience, it's harder to do top bantz when there's religion involved. 
</p>
<p>
It has taken Naughty Dog five long years to bring The Last Of Us: Part 2 to PC - look out for it on 3rd April. It seems likely that Intergalactic will be a key PS6 launch game - as such, I wouldn't be surprised if it takes even longer to escape consoledom. Still, Sony launched <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> on PC and PS5 simultaneously and that made a heck of a lot of money. Perhaps when 2027 swings around they'll be more open to the idea of a same-day release.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

If you’re an anime enthusiast as well, you may have had your eye on <em>AI Limit</em>, which costs only $35. This may leave you wondering how long of a journey the game offers and whether it’s worth investing in.

Yes, this is partially because it poses a hell of a challenge (meaning you’ll die a lot), but it’s also packed with just as many locations and bosses as many far more expensive games in the soulslike genre. </p><p>Because of the difficulty, especially in regards to the many bosses you’ll encounter, how long it takes you to finish the game will be somewhat skill-dependent. However, <strong>an average playthrough is likely to take around 20 hours</strong>. This includes reaching the final boss without completing every side-quest or searching every nook and cranny.</p><p>But completionists can certainly get more from the game, especially those looking to score every achievement it has to offer. You’ll need to complete a rather large selection of cryptic NPC quests, including some that interweave and are dependent on one another. Additionally, you’ll have to obtain every weapon and spell, as well as see all three unique endings. </p><p>With all of that in mind<strong>, fully completing <em>AI Limit</em> absolutely requires multiple playthroughs via NG+, which allows you to carry over your level and weapons to a fresh run of the game</strong>. By doing this, you’ll be able to go back through and grab any missed weapons, spells, NPC quests, and so on. More importantly, you’ll be able to set yourself up for different endings. <strong>Doing all of this can easily net you upwards of 40 hours worth of gameplay in <em>AI Limit</em></strong>. </p><p>Again, how much time you ultimately get out of <em>AI Limit</em> will depend at least partially on your skill level and whether you reference any guides for helping you find any particularly well-hidden secrets. But either way, there’s quite a lot of soulslike goodness to enjoy in this anime-infused adventure!</p><hr><p><br><em>AI Limit</em> is available now for PS5 and PC.  </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Brawl through the streets of New York City all the way to the depths of the Negative Zone to foil Annihilus’ vow to spread death across the cosmos.</blockquote><blockquote>Choose and control your own team of two characters while tagging between them mid-fight with the innovative Cosmic Swap system, capitalizing on distinct superpowers and special attacks to create unique team-ups and dish out devastating damage. Unlock stellar powerups and rewards while experimenting with different duos and bash through a fantastic collection of locales and nemeses from the Marvel universe. Marvel Cosmic Invasion’s action includes a range of accessibility features, empowering the whole family to be Super Heroes (or villains), and supports four-player drop-in/drop-out local and online co-op with crossplay.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">For more, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-march-2025-everything-announced">everything announced at Nintendo Direct March 2025</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

So you may encounter wild Pokemon that you can capture or battle when you're just wandering around Lumiose City.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">More importantly, we learned a bit more about the cryptic tease at the end of the last Z-A trailer. At night, Lumiose City's streets are flooded with trainers battling in a tournament called the "Z-A Royale". You begin in the tournament at rank Z, and work your way up to rank A, with the promise of having a "wish granted" if you succeed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With this feature, we got a look at more trainer battles, including the ability to "surprise attack" other trainers from behind to get an advantage in battle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokemon Legends: Z-A was first announced at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-pokemon-game-pokemon-presents-2024">last year's Pokemon Presents</a>, with a cinematic trailer showing off a futuristic<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-legends-z-a-wont-let-players-explore-all-of-kalos"> Lumiose City</a>. At the time, we were given very few details: just that it would be coming to Nintendo Switch this year, and some light Pokemon teases. We have since <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-first-trailer-reveals-rooftop-running-gameplay-and-late-2025-release-window">gotten a longer look at the game</a> in a Pokemon Direct earlier this year, including seeing many of the Pokemon that will be available, a number of new characters, and the protagonist running all over the rooftops.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since then, fans have been piecing together little hints from the trailer and their own experiences with  <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-legends-arceus-review">Pokemon Legends: Arceus</a> and its unique spin on the Pokemon formula. While we can expect Legends: Z-A to have some similarities with Arceus, we're hoping it's a little more polished than both it and Scarlet and Violet when it launches later this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can catch up on everything from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-march-2025-everything-announced">today's Nintendo Direct right here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

Announced during Nintendo Direct March 2025, Rhythm Heaven Groove is set to launch on Nintendo Switch in 2026.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Rhythm Heaven's last appearance was almost a decade ago back in 2016 with Rhythm Heaven: Megamix, which similarly showed up on the 3DS riiiight as the console was starting to wind down. Megamix featured 70 returning games and 30 brand new games, and until now was the best and most comprehensive place to play Rhythm Heaven. The series itself has long been beloved for its fun, intuitive rhythm mini-games and delightful original music by Japanese singer Tsunku and Nintendo composer Masami Yone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Notably, Tsunku was listed on the Rhythm Heaven Groove splash screen as returning to compose once again. Tsunku <a href="https://www.vgmonline.net/rhythm-heaven-music-producer-tsunku-recovering-from-cancer/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced in 2014</a> that he had laryngeal cancer, and underwent surgery to have his vocal cords removed. He has since stepped away from a number of his past projects, so his return for Rhythm Heaven is a hopeful sign that he may be doing better and is still up for crafting the excellent music that makes Rhythm Heaven as good as it is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-march-2025-everything-announced">everything announced at Nintendo Direct March 2025</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/pillars-of-eternity-is-getting-turn-based-combat-all-but-demanding-replays/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<h2>More than just rolling for initiative</h2>
<p>Obsidian <a href="https://fextralife.com/pillars-of-eternity-2-deadfire-turn-based-combat-mechanics-explained/">added a turn-based mode</a> to&nbsp;<em>Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire</em> in patch 4.1, roughly eight months after the game's initial release. Designer Josh Sawyer, who worked on&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate II&nbsp;</em>and directed&nbsp;both&nbsp;<em>PoE</em> games, said in a 2023<a href="https://toucharcade.com/2023/10/18/pentiment-anniversary-interview-josh-sawyer-on-hi%5B%E2%80%A6%5Ding-a-potential-pillars-of-eternity-3-rpg-mechanics-and-more/"> interview with Touch Arcade</a> that the real-time systems in the <em>PoE</em>&nbsp;games were largely a concession to the old-school CRPG fans that crowdfunded both games.</p>
<p>Turn-based was Sawyer's stated preference, and he thinks <em>Baldur's Gate 3</em> largely put an end to the debate in modern times:</p>
<blockquote><p>I just think it’s easier to design more intricate combats. I like games with a lot of stats, obviously. (He laughs). But the problem with real time with pause is that it’s honestly very difficult for people to actually parse all of that information, and one of the things I’ve heard a lot from people who’ve played <em>Deadfire</em> in turn based, is that there were things about the game like the affliction and inspiration system that they didn’t really understand very clearly until they played it in turn based.</p></blockquote>
<p>But both&nbsp;<em>Pillars&nbsp;</em>games were designed with real-time combat in mind, such that, even with his appreciation for the turn-based addition to&nbsp;<em>PoE 2</em>, Sawyer knows "the game wasn't designed for it," he told Touch Arcade. This is almost certainly going to be the case, too, for the original&nbsp;<em>PoE</em>, but there could be lessons learned from&nbsp;<em>PoE 2</em>'s transformation to apply. Other games from that era might also lure folks like me back, though perhaps they, too, have a density of encounters and maps that just can't cut it for turn-based.</p>
<p>Beyond this notably big "patch" coming to the original&nbsp;<em>PoE</em>, the 10th anniversary patch should make it easier for Mac and Linux (through Proton) users to stay up to date on bug fixes, and for players on GOG and Epic to get Kickstarter rewards and achievements. Lots of audio and visual effects were fixed up, along with a whole heap of mechanical and combat fixes.</p>

                <p>Despite everything, Undertale is now 10 years old. To celebrate the momentous occasion, a one-night-only orchestral concert, The Determination Symphony, has been announced. Those looking to <a href="http://www.eventimapollo.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">purchase tickets</a> for the exclusive event--which will take place at London's Eventim Apollo on June 22, 2025--can do so starting tomorrow, March 28, at 6 AM ET.</p><p>According to the event's press release, the concert will run for approximately two hours and will encompass Undertale's 10-year history, taking fans on a journey from "the initial fall at Mount Ebott, and leading them through Froggit Village, the Snowdin Temple, Temmie Village, and so much more." Accompanying this adventure is a 25-piece orchestra that will be performing developer Toby Fox's original music, which has received unending praise and critical-acclaim throughout the past decade. This praise includes that given in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/undertale-review-nintendo-switch-update/1900-6416315/" data-ref-id="1900-6416315">Undertale review</a>, in which we wrote, "Undertale's soundtrack has timeless appeal and is great at evoking emotions."</p><p>Lambert Jackson Productions, the London-based studio behind the Oliver award-nominated play Cruise, will be heading production for The Determination Symphony. The event is scheduled to take place at the Eventim Apollo (formerly the Hammersmith Apollo), one of London's premiere theaters.</p><p>In other Undertale news, the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/undertale-sees-new-peak-for-steam-concurrent-players-nearly-a-decade-after-launching/1100-6530156/" data-ref-id="1100-6530156">recently broke its own Steam record</a> for concurrent players.

Last October, Fox confirmed that Undertale follow-up Deltarune's next chapters will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/deltarune-chapters-3-and-4-will-definitely-be-released-in-2025-toby-fox-says/1100-6527507/" data-ref-id="1100-6527507">released some time in 2025</a>.

<p>The new entry in the Rhythm Heaven series is sticking to some very familiar ideas for the series. This is all about pressing buttons at just the right time, matching the specific beat that the game is giving you with some quirkily animated scenes as you get things right (or a little bit wrong).</p>
<p>The first new game since <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/10/28/rhythm-paradise-megamix-review/">Rhythm Heaven Megamix</a> in 2015 (which was a bit of a best of collection for 3DS), Rhythm Heaven Groove will continue the series’ traditional partnerships with Nintendo and TNX co-developing.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream – Nintendo Direct 3.27.2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dvo1V7DWYsA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>And then there’s Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream, bringing your Mii out of semi-retirement and sending them off to an idyllic seaside town to go about their lives, hanging out with other Miis and completing certain tasks to earn rewards. There’s also some thoroughly weird moments, like the dream sequence with a giant Mii running along to interrupt a dream – it looks like we’ll still get to experience Mii dreams here, and it’s a neat tie in with the game’s subtitle.</p>

<p>After the original game on DS, Tomodachi Life was an off-beat hit for the Nintendo 3DS in 2013. There were other Mii-based spin-offs like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/miitomo">Miitomo</a> on mobile and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/miitopia">Miitopia</a>, but the main Tomodachi Life experience is now being revived after well over a decade.<sup id="cite_ref-65"></sup></p>
<p>I guess Miis are still going to be relevant for a few more years, as well…</p>

A few months on from releasing into early access, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/greedfall-2">Greedfall 2: The Dying World</a> has received its first major update, and it certainly seems like a fairly big one. First up, there's a whole new region to explore called "Olima, City of Stars", and I'm going to go out on a limb here and assume that it has nothing to do with that guy from Pikmin. Its name actually comes from the fact there's a big ole observatory to be found there, though what that entails, you'll have to find out for yourself.
</p>

<p>
There's also a new companion arriving with this update, Safia, an "anti-imperialist… seasoned explorer". Not played any <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/greedfall">Greedfall</a> myself, but I'm always down for taking down empires. Rifles seem to be her whole shtick, assisting you in battle with them, and there's an implication that you can learn how to use them yourself from her.

<p>
This update also comes with a place called the Hub, located on your own ship ("not a boat" developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/spiders">Spiders</a> makes sure to point out, for some reason), once you've acquired one anyway. While on the Hub you can get ready for your next journey, have a natter with companions, and there's also plans to allow you to buy materials from merchants, view romance scenes (wink wink), and more further down the line.
</p>
<p>
Combat has supposedly seen some improvements now too, in a few different ways overall it's looking smoother, faster, and a bit cleaner too. Spiders offered a more detailed look at how combat has changed <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1997660/announcements/detail/543352686106378873?snr=1_5_9_">earlier this week</a>.
</p>
<p>
On top of all of that there's a new disguise system, more regional quests, newly introduced companion quests, a higher level cap, a respec consumable, refreshed UI, and just a whole bunch of bug fixes. Happy Greedfalling!

Why is he now in, of all things, a deep cut 2D fighter from Japanese arcade gaming’s past? It’s probably not just because the developers one day saw players in the <em>Fatal Fury </em>community having fun and decided to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/PsychoSWeasel/status/1837901224298889454&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/PsychoSWeasel/status/1837901224298889454" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">turn those meme dreams into reality</a></span>. </p><p>Ronaldo plays for Al Nassr FC  after agreeing to take leave of Europe and help sportswash Saudi Arabia’s bad human rights record in exchange for over $200 million. Al Nassr FC is 75 percent owned by the Saudi royal investment fund which also happens to have a 96 percent controlling stake in<em> Fatal Fury</em> makers SNK. <br></p><p>“We’re not a political company or anything like that, so it doesn’t affect us in any way,” SNK designer and producer  Yasuyuki Oda said of the Saudi investment when questioned&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/snk-lead-insists-saudi-arabia-sale-will-have-no-effect-on-the-games-we-make/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/snk-lead-insists-saudi-arabia-sale-will-have-no-effect-on-the-games-we-make/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">by<em> VGC</em></a></span> back in 2022. “It has no–<em>no</em>–effect on our creative output.

		<p>The rhythm-loving armies of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/patapon">Patapon</a> are marching forth again, as Patapon 1+2 Replay will remaster the PSP classics for Nintendo Switch, PS5 and PC on 11th July.</p>
<p><iframe title="PATAPON 1+2 REPLAY – Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ojtnxA61V6Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This is great news for fans of the cult classic rhythm-action games, but there’s a twist. This pair of PlayStation Portable classics are being published on Switch, not by Sony, but by Bandai Namco instead. The new remasters are being developed by SAS Co. Ltd, who I cannot find any details about.</p>
<p>Combining the first two Patapon games into one bundle (though sadly not Patapon 3), you’re cast as a god looking down on the silhouetted tribe of the Patapon. Having been driven from their home by the Zigoton, you will take control and help guide them back to their rightful place by beating a war drum in certain rhythms to command your troops, telling them to march forward, attack, defend and more. Combine that with unlocking and commanding different units, and you’ll have to overcome monsters in the wild, assault Zigoton fortresses and more. Sticking to the beat with your button presses consistently enough, and your army will enter a FEVER! and boost their fervent abilities.</p>
<p>New for this remastered collection are some difficulty settings – Normal, Easy and Hard – adjustments for button timing to help with input lag, and a constant command display, so you don’t have to remember the specific commands.</p>

<p>Originally developed by Japan Studio – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/02/25/report-playstations-japan-studio-is-being-wound-down-but-astros-playroom-developer-asobi-team-will-survive/">which Sony shut down in the last couple years</a> – the games were a pretty much essential part of the PSP library. Sony revisited the games with a remaster of the original in 2017 and the sequel in 2020, both for PS4, but the game’s natural home really is on a handheld, if you ask me.</p>
<p>“As special as it was ten years ago,” Dom said in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/08/07/patapon-remastered-review/">our 2017 review</a>, “Patapon Remastered is a glorious example of when art, music and gameplay coalesce into something far more intoxicating than its sum parts would have you expect.”</p>
<p>Here’s hoping this Replay bundle gives <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/02/05/patapon-2-remastered-review/">the second game a little more love and attention</a>, though.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Patapon fans might like to revisit the early games, but if you want something actually new, the original creators are working on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/16/patapons-legacy-will-continue-when-ratatan-arrives-in-2025/">Ratatan</a>, which is also due out later this year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/27/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-april-2nd-best-buy/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>A hastily deleted <a href="https://blog.bestbuy.ca/video-games/nintendo-switch-2-announced-launching-in-2025">blog post</a> by Best Buy Canada has stated that pre-orders for the Nintendo Switch 2 console will go live on April 2nd 2025, a date that was tipped by various punters a few days ago. Nintendo have not officially announced anything and as the post was removed rather quickly it does suggest that Best Buy announced things a little too early.&nbsp; However, the date is the same as next week’s Switch 2 Direct so put on your surprised face when they announce it during the show.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo Switch 2 – First-look trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WxLUf2kRQRE?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The teaser trailer is pretty abstract, showing lots of comparison bits and bobs for how the console has changed in comparison to the original Switch. It’s all black, for one thing, with just a pop of neon blue and neon red on the inner cap of the analogue sti cks, but all-black Joy-Con. It shows the added USB-C port on the top of the console alongside the bottom, the new kick stand design that runs the full width, the enlarged Joy-Con with new magnetic snap attachment mechanism, and with a mysterious new button on the right Joy-Con. The console shares the same hybrid approach as the original Switch with detachable Joy-Con for docked or tabletop play.</p>
<p>The one game teased during this video was Mario Kart 9.</p>

<p>Nintendo reconfirmed that it will have backward compatibility to Nintendo Switch games, both digital and cartridge. Some games might not be fully compatible or supported on Switch 2 with more details coming at a later date.</p>
<div>
<p>There’s been leaks about the console’s hardware specs, revealing the Nvidia chipset that is set to replace the Tegra X1 within the original Switch to be a modified Tegra T239. There’s also been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R1p1LjHME8">a big discussion over Nintendo’s upscaling patent</a>, suggestions about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Switch/comments/1hx0wge/switch_2_skus_found_in_system_today/">the use of MicroSD Express for SSD-like read speeds</a>, and just last week at CES, accessories manufacturer&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/Numerama/status/1876817276143378586">Genki rocked up to the show with a full suite of bits and bobs for the new console</a>, even&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-breaks-silence-on-this-weeks-switch-2-leaks">prompting Nintendo’s lawyers to visit, </a>though Genki state they’ve never signed an NDA or actually seen an official Switch 2.</p>
</div>
<p>Currently, the console does not have a release date but we would assume that if they are going to start taking pre-orders, the release date will be announced at the same time.</p>

		<p>Super Rare Originals and developer Pixel Reign have announced Moros Protocol, a retro-styled sci-fi FPS roguelite that will be coming to PC later this year.</p>
<p><iframe title="Moros Protocol | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/As49-2YisCY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Waking up aboard a battleship heading to war, you quickly discover that the ship has been taken over by monsters that have killed pretty much all the crew. With your AI companion Ody-6, you have to try time and again to fight back those beasts and save the ship.</p>
<p>What immediately stands out about the game is the visual style. There’s some common ground with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/29/system-shock-remake-review/">the System Shock remake</a> or <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/23/warhammer-40k-boltgun-review/">Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun</a> in that the world is rendered in 3D, but a retro aesthetic is applied by having heavily pixellated textures. Combined with some hefty neon glow and bloom, and it’s an aesthetic that still stands out. It’s built on a custom renderer to really capture the desired look.</p>


<p>As a roguelite that’s inspired by the speed of classic shooters, there’s plenty of weapons in the game, from SMGs and pistols through to swords and flamethrowers, and you’ll often be rewarded by opening chests to get new weapons or find augments to boost your particular playstyle.</p>
<p>Each run will offer you the chance to choose your own path through a branching design, either playing it safe to progress, or risk it for a better upgrade or weapon. After each run ends – by death or otherwise – you can upgrade your abilities more permanently to help on future attempts.&nbsp;<b></b></p>
<p>Another nice tweak is that you can get a buddy to join you with support for drop-in co-op for two players.<b></b></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Post-Apocalyptic Deckbuilder As We Descend Delayed Until May]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/as-we-descend-delayed-may</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/post-apocalyptic-deckbuilder-as-we-descend-delayed-until-may.1146729/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/as-we-descend-delayed-may<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Roguelike deckbuilder&nbsp;<em>As We Descend&nbsp;</em>has been delayed until May, but a concrete release date for the game has been revealed, so it won't be too much longer until you get to play it.</p>

<p>Back in February, it was announced that&nbsp;<em>As We Descend&nbsp;</em>would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/as-we-descend-early-access-release-date" rel="nofollow">arrive in Early Access in March</a>, but Kevin Chang, director of developer Box Dragon, says the game needs "a little more time in the oven" before it's ready.</p>

<p>As a sweetener, though, the game's demo, which is currently available on Steam, has been localized into 11 languages, including French, German, and Ukrainian, so more folks around the world can check it out before deciding to make a purchase.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/as-we-descend-delayed-early-access-combat.jpg?itok=kVMREYIL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/as-we-descend-delayed-early-access-combat.jpg?itok=v-FI3MAM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Deckbuilder&nbsp;<em>As We Descend&nbsp;</em>is landing a little later than anticipated.</figcaption></figure><p>Chang says Box Dragon has "big plans" for&nbsp;<em>As We Descend</em>, and that now is the "perfect time" to try the game out if you haven't already done so. He goes on to say that the game's Early Access launch is "just the beginning".</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>As We Descend</em>, it's a roguelike deckbuilder set in a post-apocalyptic world "where resources are scarce and monsters threaten humanity’s very existence". Well, it wouldn't be much of a post-apocalyptic world without life-threatening danger.</p>

<p>Gameplay-wise,&nbsp;<em>As We Descend&nbsp;</em>is split between its card-battling combat and its diplomacy systems, which will see you building relationships with key figures in order to stave off crises and make critical alliances.</p>

<p>According to Box Dragon, you can expect&nbsp;<em>As We Descend</em>'s setting to offer a "desperate city that evolves and crumbles in unique ways based on the player’s decisions", so it sounds like you'll need to be careful what you choose during conversations.</p>




<p><em>As We Descend&nbsp;</em>is coming to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1769830/As_We_Descend/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a> on May 28th, and a demo is available to try out right now if you want to see whether the game is your cup of (presumably poisoned) tea or not.</p>
