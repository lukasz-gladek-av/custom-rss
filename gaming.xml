            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I remember being blown away by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd32M4-muA">the 2024 reveal trailer</a> for <em>Possessor(s)</em>, the new game from <em>Hyper Light Drifter</em> developer Heart Machine. The trailer features a striking art design, where an animated 2D character explores and fights in side-scrolling environments with gorgeous 3D backgrounds, and it’s all set to moody, powerful music. The final game, which came out this month, wasn’t quite as awe-inspiring as that initial trailer made it seem, and I almost quit it — but I’m really glad I saw it to the end.</p><p>In <em>Possessor(s)</em>, you play as Luca, a girl who is possessed by Rehm, a demon from another realm. After a catastrophe strikes, Rehm saves Luca’s life by creating legs for her — but from then on, Luca serves as a host for Rhem, meaning they can talk to each other all the time and occasionally see into each other’s memories. The two have a contentious relationship. They bicker <em>constantly</em>, which sometimes made them difficult for me to care about. But over the course of the game, their relationship evolves as they come to understand more about each other and the worlds they came from.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Luca (left) and Rhem (right).</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Heart Machine describes <em>Possessor(s)</em> as a “fast-paced action side scroller,” but this is a <em>Metroid</em>- or <em>Castlevania</em>-style game through and through. You’ll explore an interconnected world with distinct zones, spend a lot of time looking at the map to try and find the next path to explore, and collect helpful traversal upgrades like a wall run to help you access new areas. Very early on, you’ll pick up a whip, and it serves double duty as an exploration tool to cross large gaps and a key weapon in battle.</p><p>Fights are <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/platformer/smash-bros-meets-metroidvania-in-possessor-s-heart-machines-new-side-scrolling-opus/">inspired by</a> platform fighters like <em>Super Smash Bros.</em>, meaning they’re fast-paced and crunchy, and you’ll take on enemies with weapons inspired by regular things you might have around your house. My usual strategy consisted of whaling on enemies up close with a large baseball bat, shocking them with an electric blast from a cellphone to create space, and flinging demonic silverware across rooms to hit faraway targets. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/667900/doom-the-dark-ages-clair-obscur-expedition-33-parry-season">Parrying</a> is a key part of fights, too.</p><p>Early on, though, <em>Possessor(s)</em> was <em>very</em> tough. Regular enemies hit hard, and if you lose focus for just a second or get caught in an unlucky combo, you can die without any time to react. Dying sends you back to the <em>Possessor(s)</em> equivalent of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonfire_(Dark_Souls)"><em>Dark Souls</em> bonfires</a>, but the return trips to where you died can be long, arduous, and filled with danger. (The game also uses a <em>Souls</em>-like flask system, swapping flasks for painkillers to let you recover health.)</p><p>Usually, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22150718/demons-souls-remake-ps5-playstation-5-sony-game-of-the-year-2020">I like that kind of challenge</a>, but something about <em>Possessor(s)</em>’s level and enemy design often made the early game feel more frustrating than fun for me. I also got <em>very</em> lost after the first few hours, exploring way more of the map than I needed to because I couldn’t figure out how to get past some mysterious walls with glowy cracks on them. I contemplated putting down the game for good.</p><p>However, after finally learning how to open those walls (use the whip!), getting a few health and painkiller upgrades, and seeing more nuance to Luca and Rhem’s relationship, I started to enjoy the game much more. I finally settled into the satisfying <em>Metroid</em> loop of exploring a new area, finding a new upgrade, using that to get to the next boss, getting the next MacGuffin, and then doing it all over again in the next zone.</p><p><em>Possessor(s)</em> didn’t possess me in the way that I expected it might. Based on my initial impressions, the game seemed cooked in a lab to appeal to my exact tastes. I just needed to have some patience. The game culminated in a final level that really put my skills to the test and a striking battlefield for the final boss. As I watched the credits roll, I realized it had all finally evoked some of those feelings I had watching the game’s first trailer.</p><p><sup>Possessor(s)</sup><em><sup> is out now on PC and PS5.</sup></em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/821117/possessors-review-pc-ps5]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-season-1-release-maps-zombies/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-ops-7-season-1%E2%80%94release-period-all-new-maps-zombies-content-more.1354684/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Season 1 begins another 12-month content crusade. New maps, guns, game modes, Operators, events, and all the usual hullabaloo that comes with a new CoD season. We have the latest Black Ops 7 Season 1 release information, as well as the known S1 content.</p>



<p>You could argue that this hasn’t been the most hyped CoD in history—<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-day-one-steam-numbers-compare-badly-to-battlefield-6-and-arc-raiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam player numbers</a> would agree. Nevertheless, thousands of players have dived into Black Ops 7, meaning that Season 1 will have its fair share of recruits. If you want to know when <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-season-one-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BLOPS 7 Season 1</a> starts, read on for the crucial pointers.</p>







<p>Also, if you haven’t picked up the game yet, or you intend to, we have the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/black-ops-7-loaded-xbox-pc/">cheapest way to buy Black Ops 7</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-expected-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-season-1-release-date">Expected Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Season 1 Release Date</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Run for it. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>We expect Black Ops 7 Season 1 to kick off on December 4, because it coincides with the end of Black Ops 6 Season 6—Signaling the transition from Black Ops 6’s seasonal content ending and Black Ops 7’s beginning.</strong></p>



<p>If you’ve been in the live-service loop before, you know the drill. Once a previous season ends, the next one begins. BLOPS 7 has a brief period between launch and Season 1 called the ‘preseason’.</p>







<p>We know for sure that the legendary <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nuketown-black-ops-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nuketown map</a> is a big addition in the preseason period. Once we cross this barrier, it’s time to move on to Season 1. Treyarch is likely to confirm the Season 1 start date in the coming days, but don’t be surprised to see December 4 as the official start date!</p>



<h2 id="h-expected-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-season-1-start-time">Expected Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Season 1 Start Time</h2>



<p><strong>Again, based on existing data, Black Ops 7 Season 1 onlookers can expect the new season to begin around 9 AM PT.</strong></p>



<p>This is a simple case of deduction using the end of the Black Ops 6 Season 6 Battle Pass. It’s what happens with all Call of Duty seasons, and we expect Season 1 to be no different.</p>



<p>If this isn’t the case, we’ll update this hub and let you know of any confirmed times, delays, or changes.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-black-ops-7-season-1-multiplayer-amp-zombies-content">All Black Ops 7 Season 1 Multiplayer &amp; Zombies Content</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A lot to take in. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Season 1 introduces a whopping 7 multiplayer maps, 7 weapons, remastered content, new multiplayer modes, new LTMs, Holiday season content, and 3 new Zombies maps.</strong></p>



<p>Where do we begin? Let’s start with the Zombies content to mix it up.</p>



<h3 id="h-new-black-ops-7-season-1-zombies-content">New Black Ops 7 Season 1 Zombies Content</h3>



<p>The Season 1 roadmap has confirmed that <strong>Astra Malorum</strong> is a new round-based Zombies map—to add to Ashes of the Damned—and there will also be two additional Survival maps.</p>



<p>We’ve covered all of this and more in our complete <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-7-zombies-maps-survival-dead-ops/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7 Zombies hub</a>.</p>



<p>Zombies fans will be satiated with flesh and fun for the foreseeable future, at least. Knowing Treyarch, there is probably the odd surprise here and there you’ll need to uncover!</p>



<h3 id="h-new-black-ops-7-season-1-multiplayer-content">New Black Ops 7 Season 1 Multiplayer Content</h3>



<p>The main course for most is the multiplayer content. A lot of maps are currently locked in for Season 1, adding to the 18 multiplayer maps that launched with the base game.</p>



<p>Here’s every confirmed map for Season 1 already:</p>



<ul>
<li>Fate</li>



<li>Meltdown</li>



<li>Nuketown (Technically a preseason map)</li>



<li>Odysseus</li>



<li>Standoff (Remaster)</li>



<li>Utopia</li>



<li>Yakei</li>
</ul>



<p>Additionally, 7 “new &amp; fan-favorite weapons” are coming—including the <strong>Maddox</strong> from Black Ops 4—and we don’t quite know what the new game modes and extras entail.</p>



<p>Treyarch will reveal all when the time is right. Stay tuned for more updates on Season 1.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Season 01 of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackOps7?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BlackOps7</a> will be the biggest post-launch content drop in our history, and we're just getting started. Get your first look in our new Dev Talk:</p><p>✅ 7 signature 6v6 maps<br>✅ 7 new &amp; fan-favorite weapons (Maddox! 😍)<br>✅ 3 Zombies maps<br>✅ S01 remasters confirmed<br>✅ MP… <a href="https://t.co/VoKWLqycLW">pic.twitter.com/VoKWLqycLW</a></p></div>— Treyarch (@Treyarch) <a href="https://twitter.com/Treyarch/status/1981421047376465996?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 23, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>There’s no doubt that Treyarch is starting strong with Season 1. It’s being touted as the biggest season ever, and you can see why. There’s much more to come, and it’s the first of several BLOPS 7 seasons throughout the year.

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/hitman-absolution</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mini-review-hitman-absolution-switch-a-decent-port-of-the-series-black-sheep.1354669/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hitman_absolution">Hitman: Absolution</a> is widely regarded as the ‘black sheep’ of the series thanks to its focus on cinematic storytelling over player freedom. This is very much still the case with this fresh release on Switch from Feral Interactive, but now that original developer IO Interactive has righted the ship with the excellent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hitman-world-of-assassination-signature-edition">World of Assassination</a> trilogy, it’s much easier to look back on Absolution and better appreciate it for what it is – kind of like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_6">Resident Evil 6</a>.</p>
<p>Does that mean it’s perfect? No, far from it. But it’s a fascinating detour for Agent 47 that still provides ample fun while laying foundations for later titles, including the upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/007-first-light">007 First Light</a>.</p>
<p>Like previous entries, Absolution requires you to locate your targets and dispatch them with as little fuss as possible (while constantly evading the <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/po-po">po-po</a>). Nailing a high stealth rating is what it’s all about, but if you prefer to go in guns blazing, that’s an option. Otherwise, sneaky little ‘accidents’ are often the best course of action, and you can activate Instinct Mode to highlight enemies, items, and traps to help formulate a plan.</p>
<p>Disguises let you access areas that might otherwise be off-limits, but many of the guards can see through your outfits (not literally, cheeky) and discover your true identity. Instinct Mode comes into play here too, so by holding down ‘R’ while in an enemy's line of sight, you can make yourself inconspicuous enough to slip by.</p>
<p>Unlike World of Assassination, Instinct Mode is finite. Relying on it too much will deplete your supplies. Taking out guards and completing challenges will replenish it, but I advise using it sparingly and instead rely on your own senses to scope out opportunities; it’s much more fun that way.</p>
<p>Levels are overall smaller and more compact than what you might be used to. IO Interactive focuses a lot more on telling a coherent story, and it shows in the structure. In other Hitman titles, you’d spend a lot of time walking out in the open and blending into your surroundings, but in Absolution, sneaking around and hiding behind cover is generally more advisable thanks to the close-quarters environments.</p>
<p>This frustrated a lot of folks back in 2012, and the game was widely criticised for its overall linearity when compared to earlier entries. This hasn’t changed, but there’s still a decent amount of options available when deciding how to approach your targets. Know what you’re getting yourself into and you’ll have a good time.</p>
<p>Performance is exactly what I imagined it would be. You’re looking at 30fps with a few minor hitches here and there, particularly in dense crowds. Textures and assets have also been scaled back considerably, but it’s still a handsome game regardless, and the accompanying music is consistently great.</p>
<p>Feral has promised a free Switch 2 upgrade in 2026 along with an extra Contracts Mode, so if you’re happy to wait until then, then by all means do so. But Hitman: Absolution on Switch is solid, flaws and all.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/hitman-absolution]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lenovos-15-inch-512gb-laptop-is-nearly-free-amazon-cuts-prices-by-78-and-wants-it-all-gone-2000644589</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lenovo%E2%80%99s-15-inch-512gb-laptop-is-nearly-free-amazon-cuts-prices-by-78-and-wants-it-all-gone.1354666/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Picking a new laptop isn’t easy these days. With endless options flooding the market, most of us tend to stick to reliable brands and Lenovo remains one of the few that never disappoints. Right now, one of its most complete models, the Lenovo <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5601/">IdeaPad Slim 3 with a 15.3‑inch FHD+ display, Intel Core i5 processor, 16GB DDR5 RAM and 512GB PCIe SSD, is down to an all‑time low of $549 from $2,499</a>, now 78% off.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5601/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Power, Speed, and Everyday Practicality</h2>
<p>The Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 is built for the kind of multitasking modern life demands. The <strong>13th‑gen Intel Core i5‑13420H chip delivers eight cores</strong> (four Performance + four Efficiency cores) and twelve threads which means you can run multiple professional apps, stream media, and browse with dozens of tabs open – all without slowdown. Its turbo frequency reaches 4.6 GHz, giving the extra power burst needed for quick data crunchingor content creation sessions.</p>
<p>Storage also gets a serious boost thanks to the 512 GB PCIe SSD: That’s enough space for a full library of files, photos and software, while keeping boot and loading times near‑instant. It’s the kind of performance jump that makes going back to a traditional hard drive nearly impossible. You only need to lift the lid and the system wakes instantly, ready for work or play.</p>



<p>Then there’s the display: a <strong>15.3‑inch WUXGA panel (1920 × 1200) with a 16:10 aspect ratio for extra vertical room</strong>. It’s crisp, bright at 300 nits, and features an anti‑glare coating that keeps reflections minimal even under strong lighting. The narrow bezels make the entire setup look modern, while the 45 percent NTSC color coverage produces consistent tones for everyday use. Whether you’re streaming shows or reviewing presentations, the wide‑angle IPS screen ensures what you see is both vibrant and fatigue‑free.</p>
<p>The IdeaPad Slim 3 features Wi‑Fi 6 for faster and more reliable wireless performance and Bluetooth 5.2 for low‑latency peripheral pairing. Its generous port selection makes life easier: two USB‑A ports, one USB‑C with Power Delivery and DisplayPort support, an HDMI output, a 3.5 mm audio jack, an SD card reader, and of course the power connector. That means no annoying dongle juggling when you want to plug in a mouse, transfer photos or connect to an external monitor.</p>



<p>This 15‑inch Lenovo is slimmer than the previous generation by around 10%. At roughly 4 pounds, it strikes the right balance between portability and sturdiness. The hinge feels solid but light enough to open with one hand, and the full‑size keyboard with number pad makes typing comfortable even during long sessions of data entry or writing. Lenovo always manages to hit that sweet spot between form and function and this one’s a perfect example.</p>
<p>Daily usability shines through small, thoughtful touches like efficient cooling that keeps fan noise low and the Copilot key on the keyboard, giving instant access to Microsoft’s AI assistant. That’s a rare feature for a laptop in this price category, and it aligns perfectly with the growing shift toward AI‑enhanced productivity.</p>
<p>Whether you’re browsing the web, managing spreadsheets or taking Zoom calls, the IdeaPad Slim 3 stays responsive and cool through it all. Its battery performance comfortably lasts through a full workday with light productivity mixed with streaming. Pair that with <strong>fast charging and you’re back to 50% in roughly 30 minutes</strong> using any modern USB‑C charger.</p>
<p>If you’ve been looking for a reliable daily driver, the IdeaPad Slim 3 is about as balanced as it gets. Amazon discounts come and go but this one feels special.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[This Pair of Magnetic Wireless Chargers Costs Peanuts, Now Cheaper Than an Apple Charging Cable]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-pair-of-magnetic-wireless-chargers-costs-peanuts-now-cheaper-than-an-apple-charging-cable-2000644584</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-pair-of-magnetic-wireless-chargers-costs-peanuts-now-cheaper-than-an-apple-charging-cable.1354663/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Owning a MagSafe compatible charger is one of those small luxuries that makes daily life feel smooth: no cables, no fumbling, just drop your phone and watch it charge. The only catch? Normally, buying a single official one costs almost as much as a wired charger and cable combined. But this early Black Friday deal flips that logic upside down. Right now on Amazon, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5600/">the Anker Zolo magnetic wireless charger 2-pack is selling for just $25, down from $39</a>. That’s <strong>cheaper than what Apple charges for a single USB-C cable</strong>, and you’re getting two fast wireless pads that work brilliantly with the latest iPhones and AirPods.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5600/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Fast, Cool Convenient Charging for Daily Use</h2>
<p>Magnetic chargers have become a staple among iPhone owners due to the ease they deliver. Instead of searching behind the nightstand for your cable, you just snap your phone onto the charging pad, and it locks in place every time. The Anker Zolo pads use <strong>Qi2 certified technology to deliver up to 15 watts of fast charging</strong> which is sufficient to bring an iPhone 17 Pro Max up to 20 percent in just 19 minutes when combined with a 20W or higher wall adapter.</p>



<p>What makes this a great everyday charger is the smart protection system inside. Anker’s ActiveShield 2.0 monitors<strong> temperature levels more than 8 million times a day</strong>, and automatically adjusts power flow to prevent overheating. That means your phone or earbuds stay cool even during overnight charging, while the battery’s long‑term health remains protected. It’s the kind of detail most people never think about, but it’s crucial if you charge your phone daily and want it to still perform like new next year.</p>



<p>Each pad comes with a <strong>5‑foot cable</strong>&nbsp;which is much longer than most standard chargers-giving you more freedom to move your phone while it’s powering up. You can easily FaceTime, scroll, or stream with the cable stretched comfortably across your couch or desktop, sans that tight, awkward pull that short cords create. If you’ve ever tried texting while your phone’s plugged into a short 3‑foot charger, you know the difference those extra inches make.</p>
<p>The compact form factor makes these chargers great for travel, too. They fit easily into a laptop sleeve or small pouch and come with a handy cable tie that keeps everything neat. Toss one in your backpack for the office and leave the other on your nightstand-no need to keep reconnecting cables or worrying about frayed connectors. The simplicity of dropping your phone on the pad and walking away quickly becomes addictive.</p>



<p>While each Anker Zolo pad works well enough on its own as a charger, and gets two in one set makes it feel like an instant home upgrade. Keep one beside your bed and one on your desk, or place them side by side for family use so that there’s always one handy. Even if you never give much thought to chargers, this deal is of the sort you’ll be appreciative of daily: a little convenience that makes life with technology smoother in subtle ways.</p>
<p>What’s also impressive at this price is how Anker didn’t strip away support or design to make it cheaper. The build feels premium, the surface has enough grip to keep devices in place, and the magnets snap precisely where they should. <strong>Coming in at under $13 per pad</strong>, the value here borders on absurd when compared to single‑charger prices from other brands.</p>

<p>Where Winds Meet has finally launched worldwide after a long period of only being available in China, and if you’re keen to restart your journey at any point, we’ve got the details on whether you can delete your character.</p>



<p>Where Winds Meet launched globally on November 14, 2025, after months of being exclusively available within China, and there’s a staggering amount of content to dig through in the Wuxia open-world adventure.</p>



<p>Regular RPG players will be well accustomed to starting over with a new character, which often requires choosing to delete your progress, and there are some limitations in Where Winds Meet, as we’ve explained here.</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-delete-your-character-in-where-winds-meet">Can You Delete Your Character in Where Winds Meet?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Limited options. Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There is no option to delete your character in Where Winds Meet, unfortunately, so the process to start again is more lengthy.</strong></p>



<p>While you can customize your character freely at any time from the pause menu, though some customizations, like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-winds-meet-change-hair-color/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">changing hair color</a>, require specific items, you can’t choose to wipe clean and start again with a click of the button.</p>



<p>Instead, the only way to start over is to create a new account in the game, and the only way to delete a character, as a result, is by deleting your account.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-delete-your-account-in-where-winds-meet">How to Delete Your Account in Where Winds Meet</h2>



<p><strong>If you want to delete your account, and therefore your character, in Where Winds Meet, the process is fairly straightforward.</strong></p>



<p>However, it does require creating a new account in the game if you want to start your journey again, and you will lose everything you have earned. </p>







<p>Due to this, some in-game rewards may not be able to be claimed again, if they have already been revealed on your account. While you may be able to redeem them again with a new account, you may be stuck if the redemption is tied to your email address—unless you use an alternative.</p>



<p>Here’s the step-by-step process of how to delete your account in where Winds Meet.</p>



<ol>
<li>Open the game through the launcher.</li>



<li>In the log-in screen, select the profile icon on the left-hand side to open log-in credentials.</li>



<li>Click on the ‘Account Deletion’ option.</li>



<li>On the webpage that pops up, click the checkbox to agree to the conditions stated, and click ‘Next.’</li>



<li>Click ‘Confirm’ on the pop-up that appears.</li>



<li>Fill in the steps to verify account ownership, and add your contact email.</li>



<li>Click ‘Yes’ on the next pop-up.</li>



<li>On the final page, check the box for the agreement, and hit ‘Submit’ to delete your account.</li>
</ol>

            <p>Bungie has settled a copyright lawsuit with writer Matthew Martineau after he alleged the studio had used elements of his work in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>, including its Red War plot and the Curse of Osiris expansion.</p>
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/destiny-2-red-war-lawsuit-ends-bungie-full-settlement-author/">The Game Post</a>, the case has now been settled, although the terms of that settlement - including any conditions or compensation - have not been made public.</p>
<p>Bungie <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2s-unpopular-removal-of-older-game-content-now-hampering-bungies-ability-to-defend-plagiarism-lawsuit">unsuccessfully tried to dismiss the lawsuit - which alleged it plagiarised elements of Destiny 2's original campaign from a story Martineau posted online</a> - back in May, but a US federal judge ruled that the lawsuit should continue as Bungie had been unable to provide satisfactory evidence to have the case tossed out. That evidence could have been a working copy of Destiny 2 featuring the game's original story campaign, but this - alongside many other, older parts of the game - are no longer playable, having been excised and relegated to Bungie's controversial content "vault".</p>
<p>"A settlement conference was conducted on this date before the undersigned Magistrate Judge," the filing reads. "Negotiations were successful and resulted in the settlement of all claims. The Court thanks counsel and the parties for their efforts in bringing this matter to an amicable resolution."</p>
<p>Parties have sixty days to contest the decision and proceed to court, but as it stands, "all parties have firmly agreed upon a compromise".</p>
<p>It follows a difficult year for the embattled studio, which has been accused of plagiarism across both its Marathon and Destiny 2 brands, and was forced earlier this year to admit that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-admits-marathon-includes-artwork-used-without-permission">an external artist's work had been used within upcoming game Marathon without consent</a>. This wasn't the first time Bungie has faced claims of using artists' work without permission, with multiple instances coming to light regarding designs for Destiny 2.</p><p>It's also facing a $200m "wrongful dismissal" lawsuit from Destiny 2 and Marathon reboot director Christopher Barrett. Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-responds-to-marathon-reboot-directors-200m-wrongful-dismissal-lawsuit-alleges-disturbing-communications-with-female-employees">Sony responded by detailing Barrett's alleged 'disturbing communications' with female subordinates</a> - including "sexually charged games of 'Truth or Dare'".</p>
<p>Earlier this week we learned <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2-hasnt-reached-sonys-expectations-following-36bn-bungie-acquisition-admits-cfo">Destiny 2 had not reached expectations</a> following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-buying-bungie-for-usd3-6bn">Sony's $3.6bn acquisition</a> of Bungie. In its latest earnings report, Sony recorded a loss in profit in its games segment due to "impairment losses against a portion of Bungie, Inc.'s intangible and other assets in connection with Destiny 2."</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-tiny-gadget-lets-you-connect-your-bluetooth-headphones-to-the-planes-screen-and-it-costs-pennies-2000644579</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-tiny-gadget-lets-you-connect-your-bluetooth-headphones-to-the-plane%E2%80%99s-screen-and-it-costs-pennies.1354642/</guid>

              <p>If you’ve ever been stuck<strong> on a long flight watching a movie with those cheap wired earbuds the airline hands out</strong>, you’ll understand why small Bluetooth transmitters exist. The <em>Ugreen</em> airplane Bluetooth 6.0 transmitter solves one of the most annoying travel problems: letting you use your own wireless headphones with the in‑flight entertainment system. Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5599/">it’s down to an all‑time low price of $18, down from its usual $27 on Amazon</a>. It’s the kind of tiny gadget that instantly makes travel more comfortable and feels like a small luxury upgrade.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5599/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A Game‑Changer for Travel</h2>
<p>What’s so clever about this little adapter is that it turns <strong>almost any traditional audio source into a wireless one</strong>. Plug it into the headphone jack on the plane seat, the TV in your hotel room or even an old car stereo, and you can connect your Bluetooth earbuds or headset in seconds. No tangled wires, no adapters dangling from your seat — just your own choice of headphones and clear sound.</p>



<p>The connection quality is surprisingly solid for something this small. <strong>Due to Bluetooth 6.0, pairing happens almost instantly</strong> and the range extends up to 10 meters — that’s enough to move freely in a living room or even stroll across a hotel suite without losing the signal. The newer Bluetooth spec also cuts down the annoying audio delay that used to make videos and games slightly out of sync.</p>



<p>What’s more, the Ugreen unit <strong>holds up to 18 hours of use in receiver mode and 16 hours in transmission mode</strong>&nbsp;which will easily cover a full day of travel, including layovers and entertainment before landing. You can charge it during use if needed, but in practice, most users say it goes days between charges. For frequent flyers, that’s the difference between a gadget you need to babysit and one you can forget about until the next trip.</p>



<p>But what really makes this adapter flexible is its two‑in‑one design: In TX or transmit mode, it streams audio from non-Bluetooth devices such as airline seats, TVs, or older gaming consoles, directly to wireless headphones. In RX or receive mode, meanwhile, the device does the opposite, turning wired speakers or car stereos into Bluetooth receivers. You can stream music from your phone to your old home speakers or plug it into a car AUX port for instant wireless audio playback.</p>
<p>Even better, the Ugreen transmitter is able to <strong>pair with two pairs of headphones simultaneously</strong>. So if you’re traveling with a friend or partner, both of you can watch the same movie from the plane’s screen without bothering to split a pair of wired earbuds. It’s a simple feature, but one that genuinely makes those long flights more enjoyable. The built‑in microphone is another nice touch – if you’re using it in receiver mode with your phone, you can answer calls hands‑free without disconnecting.</p>
<p>At this price, it’s hard to think of another gadget that adds this much comfort to travel and everyday listening. The build quality is solid, the functionality is well thought out, and it covers so many small annoyances that accumulate over time. It’s the kind of item that costs very little yet quietly changes how you travel and listen. And considering this $18 deal is the lowest it’s ever gone on Amazon, it might be one of those rare impulse buys that pays off immediately.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nuketown-black-ops-7/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/when-is-nuketown-coming-to-black-ops-7-release-date-explained.1354639/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 has one of the biggest launch offerings of maps in history. Despite this, players are still desperate for Nuketown to arrive to make Camo challenges easier and create anarchy, and we have its Black Ops 7 release date.</p>



<p>Nuketown is arguably the most famous CoD map, other than maybe Rust. Its iconic nuclear testing ground setup immediately became a fan-favorite, and its popularity only grew with easter eggs. There’s the mannequin easter egg, and the fact that you can drive an RC-XD from one end of the map to the other OUTSIDE the confines of the map!</p>







<p>There are other reasons why Nuketown is so beloved. If you’re desperate to see the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-day-one-steam-numbers-compare-badly-to-battlefield-6-and-arc-raiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7</a> mockup, we’ve got Nuketown’s release date and what to expect.</p>



<h2 id="h-nuketown-map-release-date-in-black-ops-7">Nuketown Map Release Date In Black Ops 7</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It won’t look like this, but still. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Nuketown arrives in Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 on November 20, coming as part of the preseason content.</strong></p>



<p>Shipment and Nuketown usually drop in Season 1 of a new CoD title. However, Treyarch knows what players like, and they like a nasty shootout on Nuketown. It’s great for weapon boosting because of its size, it’s a kill-haven because of the Scorestreaks potential, and it’s also the perfect map to expedite the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-multiplayer-camo-challenges/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiplayer camo</a> grind process.</p>







<p>A Call of Duty <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-multiplayer-maps-modes-launch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog</a> discussed the game’s launch maps. It has a lot of them, as we’ve said, but it made it clear to comment on Nuketown:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Prior to Season 01, where&nbsp;Black Ops 7&nbsp;will be delivering the largest number of new and returning 6v6 maps in&nbsp;Call of Duty history, expect 16 signature 6v6 Multiplayer maps to be available at launch, along with two larger-scale Skirmish Maps, <strong>and the arrival of Nuketown 2025 in the Preseason on November 20, just after launch.</strong>“</p>
</blockquote>



<p>You’ve only got a few days to wait for Nuketown. Then we can unpack any new and returning easter eggs on the map. If you’ve still not got it yet, here’s where you can <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/black-ops-7-loaded-xbox-pc/">buy Black Ops 7 for very cheap</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-didn-t-nuketown-launch-with-black-ops-7">Why Didn’t Nuketown Launch With Black Ops 7?</h2>



<p><strong>The reason Nuketown didn’t launch with Black Ops 7 is presumably so that players would try out and experience the rest of the game’s maps first.</strong></p>



<p>If you don’t know, the camo grind is a <em>big </em>deal for many players. It’s the lifeblood of a year-long Call of Duty journey. Plus, for Black Ops 7—and Warzone—purposes, leveling up guns is important.</p>



<p>An easier way to do this is with smaller maps, featuring more kill opportunities, more points scored, and more XP. Players tend to gravitate to Nuketown and Shipment each year to get this done, and will focus on newer, smaller maps: Look at Stakeout in Black Ops 6 as a prime example.</p>



<p>We’d wager Treyarch wanted some love and attention for the new maps in Black Ops 7 before a majority of the player base makes themselves comfortable in Nuketown for the next few weeks!</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arena-breakout-infinite-team-mock-escape-from-tarkov/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arena-breakout-team-mocks-escape-from-tarkov-in-deleted-social-post.1354636/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a recent post on social media, the team behind Arena Breakout: Infinite, once accused of plagiarising Escape from Tarkov, has mocked Battlestate Games’ 1.0 launch of the spearhead extraction shooter. The post poked fun at Escape from Tarkov’s ongoing server issues, but shortly after being published, it was removed by MoreFun’s social media team.</p>



<p>The comments under the post were scathing, with many slamming Arena Breakout: Infinite’s lacklustre platform, dwindling player base, and lack of any real impact on the genre.</p>







<h2 id="h-abi-takes-on-bsg-in-x-post">ABI Takes on BSG in X Post</h2>



<p>Arena Breakout: Infinite launched on Steam two months ago, ‘beating Tarkov to the punch’ and pulling in new players, with the game peaking at around 66,000 players on the platform. In the minutes since Escape from Tarkov debuted on Steam, a peak of 21,000 players was secured <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-1-0-launch-servers-cooked/">amidst launch issues</a> preventing many from accessing the game.</p>



<p>In a now-deleted post on social media, Arena Breakout: Infinite mocked Escape from Tarkov’s server concerns:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Within minutes, the post had been removed, likely under the weight of all the comments ripping into MoreFun Studios and Arena Breakout: Infinite. One user wrote, ‘I like your game, but this constant slamming of Tarkov on Twitter is shameful and puts your game in a bad light.’ Another wrote, ‘ABI community is so focused on being better than Tarkov, it’s a total joke.’</p>



<p>Another fetched receipts from Twitch, calling up some viewership figures: ‘Look at the Twitch figures – 300k people still prefer to sit watching a menu vs. 3,000 playing ABI.’</p>







<p>Arena Breakout: Infinite came under fire in 2024 when <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-dev-arena-plagiarism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlestate Games accused MoreFun Studios</a> of ripping off assets and plagiarising Escape from Tarkov. I caught up with MoreFun Studios at Gamescom to grill them on that very topic.</p>



<p>Escape from Tarkov’s 1.0 launch is a phenomenal milestone for the Russian developer. It marks the end of ten years of painstaking development that has reshaped the face of the extraction shooter genre over and over again.</p>



<p>Do you think Arena Breakout: Infinite’s team was right to make a joke at Battlestate Games’ expense? Let me know your thoughts on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <p>Capcom's Pragamata has popped up on the South Korean classification board's website.</p>
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gematsu.com/post/3m5l5wetmus2z">Gematsu</a>, the "action adventure" game - which doesn't currently have a release date - has been rated as suited for players aged 12 and up due to its "mild violence".</p>

<p>Pragmata was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcoms-next-gen-project-pragamata-wont-launch-until-2022">once planned for a 2022 release</a>, having been originally revealed in 2020, and was delayed several times <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcoms-pragmata-coming-2026-developer-promises">until this summer's State of Play</a> confirmed we'll see it sometime in 2026.</p>
<p>Grasshopper Manufacture's action game Romeo is a Dead Man has also been <a href="https://www.grac.or.kr/Statistics/Popup/Pop_ReasonInfo.aspx?f0d05826089a46822d078e3eb6681337a6c813a6a053e8e5ec12581d53453bb0">rated</a>, although I don't suppose it'll come as much surprise that the "ultra-violent" title with "various weapons, frequent large amounts of blood, various expressions of bodily harm, use of vulgar profanity and vulgar language" has been rated as "not for minors". It too has yet to confirm a specific release date.</p>
<p>"The result is a fascinating mix that was only better in its more difficult and more thought-provoking proper hands-on than it was in the two previous proof-of-concept style demos," Alex wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pragmatas-unique-action-and-puzzle-blend-may-grab-the-headlines-but-as-its-creators-explain-its-secret-sauce-is-all-about-rhythm-1">Eurogamer's Pragmata preview</a>. </p>
<p>"Seeing the full 'loop' of Pragmata laid bare has cemented its place in my list of most anticipated games for 2026."</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/samsung-quietly-unloads-its-t9-4tb-ssds-on-amazon-now-selling-at-a-new-all-time-low.1354609/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The ultimate luxury for anyone juggling big files&nbsp;: <strong>SSDs are faster, quieter, and far more reliable than the old-school hard drives</strong> we all grew up with. Of course, that performance usually comes with a pretty steep price. But not today: Samsung <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4947/">just dropped its sleek T9 Portable SSD 4TB to a new all‑time low of $299, down from $399 on Amazon</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4947/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Speed and Stability</h2>
<p>And that’s exactly what tech enthusiasts like most about SSDs: the speed. The T9 doesn’t just deliver: it dominates <strong>with sequential read and write speeds of up to 2,000 MB/s</strong>. That means heavy 4K videos, raw photos, or huge design projects pop up in seconds instead of minutes. For creators, gamers, and students managing several devices, it’s a serious timesaver without the dreaded transfer delays. Better yet, those speeds stay constant during long tasks-no throttling midway through some big job.</p>



<p>Inside, Samsung marries its <strong>trusted V‑NAND flash memory with a USB 3.2 Gen 2×2 interface</strong> to ensure top performance on modern hardware setups. And unlike older drives that overheat under pressure, <strong>the T9 stays really cool</strong> thanks to its Dynamic Thermal Guard. It automatically regulates temperature to prevent overheating, keeping everything stable even during hours of high‑intensity use.</p>



<p>Durability is another area where Samsung didn’t cut corners: The <strong>T9 has a rugged, textured casing</strong> that helps withstand drops and scratches, making it safe to toss into a laptop bag or camera kit. It’s built for travel, jammed workdays, and unpredictable coffee-shop setups. The design is practical yet premium, with rounded corners and a matte black finish that feels as polished as the tech inside.</p>
<p>Compatibility, meanwhile, couldn’t be easier. The <strong>T9 connects easily to Windows PCs, Macs, game consoles</strong> and even newer smartphones like the iPhone 17 Pro, which now supports direct 4K ProRes video capture directly to the drive. For content creators shooting high‑resolution footage, that alone can justify the purchase. That means no more running out of internal storage mid‑recording and no more waiting for files to move before editing begins.</p>
<p>Making long‑term ownership even smoother is the inclusion of Samsung’s <em>Magician Software</em> suite: It automatically handles firmware updates, security management, and health monitoring in the background, so that performance stays optimal without requiring manual tinkering. Encryption options keep sensitive documents protected if the drive is lost or stolen, while regular checks help to prevent data degradation over time.</p>



<p>And it’s even more exciting because<strong> Samsung is the number-one flash memory brand in the world</strong>. But still, the main reason this model gets attention right now is the price dro: Seeing a 4TB drive of this quality dip below the $300 mark is borderline unheard of. It essentially makes high‑speed, professional grade storage accessible to regular consumers.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kirby-air-riders-release-date-explained%E2%80%94exact-release-date-start-times-confirmed.1354606/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s quite fun for something like Kirby Air Riders to be coming out in 2025, and we’ve got its full release date details, as well as news on its start times and when you can properly wait for the chequered flag to drop.</p>



<p>When you think of racing games on Nintendo Switch, you default to Mario Kart, without question. You might have to rethink this impulse with the launch of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kirby-air-riders-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kirby Air Riders</a>. It’s an unexpected sequel over 20 years in the making, and Kirby has decided to take to the track after a trip through a Forbidden Kingdom.</p>







<p>For all your much-needed Kirby Air Riders release information, you’ve come to the right place.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-kirby-air-riders-coming-out">When Is Kirby Air Riders Coming Out?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Bombs away. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Kirby Air Riders is expected to release on November 20, barring any last-minute delays or complications.</strong></p>



<p>Switch 2 owners can get suited up and drive off on November 20. Nintendo games are usually very reliable, where release dates due to the company’s persistence in perfection. You never know in this day and age, so brace yourself for any late red flags to interrupt your plans.</p>







<p>You can play the game early, too, through the Kirby Air Riders Global Test Ride demo. It gives you a final chance to try out the game before launch, which will likely boost the game’s sales.</p>



<p>It’s expected there won’t be much DLC, and there might not be another sequel. So, expect a very full and jam-packed Kirby Air Riders to keep you occupied for a while.</p>



<h2 id="h-kirby-air-riders-start-times">Kirby Air Riders Start Times</h2>



<p><strong>Like most Nintendo first-party games, we expect Kirby Air Riders to be added to the eShop at 7 AM PT on November 20. This is when you can download, install, and play Kirby Air Riders.</strong></p>



<p>This information comes from Nintendo itself. Again, not everything is iron-clad, and there could be some changes. We’d say to go on the assumption that the time is accurate.</p>



<p>That said, here are the Kirby Air Riders release dates and times in key regions.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Kirby Air Riders Release Times &amp; Dates</th></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">7:00 AM—November 20</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">9:00 AM—November 20</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">10:00 AM—November 20</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Grenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">3:00 PM—November 20</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">New Zealand Daylight Time (NZDT)</td><td data-align="center">4:00 AM—November 21</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

            <title><![CDATA[The Steam Machine feels like the TV gaming PC I’ve always wanted]]></title>
            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/818606/valve-steam-machine-tv-gaming-pc-wanted</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-steam-machine-feels-like-the-tv-gaming-pc-i%E2%80%99ve-always-wanted.1354600/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The morning of Monday, October 27th, I started my workweek by asking my colleagues at <em>The Verge </em>for advice on buying a gaming PC. I wanted a small, portable, and semi-powerful machine that could easily sit beneath my living room TV and occasionally move over to my desk to play games or even use for work. My dream was to find something as easy to use as the Steam Deck, which has become my primary gaming device due to its simplicity and massive catalog of PC games.</p><p>Just two days later, I walked into Valve’s headquarters and was introduced to the new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/818111/valve-steam-machine-hands-on-preview-specs-announcement">Steam Machine</a>, a gaming PC and console hybrid. It checked basically every box I was looking for.</p><p>The Steam Machine is a 6-inch cube that will comfortably fit into my small entertainment center in the corner of my living room and on my small office desk I’ve squeezed into the bedroom. Valve says its AMD GPU is more than six times as powerful than the Steam Deck, which should be great for me since most of my gaming time is spent playing less graphically intensive indies. It runs SteamOS, which I already love on a big screen when docking my Steam Deck.</p><p>There are some fun perks for the gadget nerd in me, too. The Steam Machine has a customizable LED bar that Valve says will be able to show you things like the status of downloads, which sounds perfect if I want to keep an eye on when I can play my next game while watching a show on a different TV input. It supports Valve’s customizable new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/815061/valve-steam-controller-hands-on-deck-frame-machine">Steam Controller</a> and has a dedicated antenna that offers a low-latency connection for up to four of the gamepads. And because the Steam Machine is a Linux PC, I can also do whatever the heck I want with it — I’m even thinking about installing Windows so I can dual-boot and play games that aren’t on Linux <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/31/24284644/apex-legends-loses-linux-steam-deck-support-anti-cheat">due to anti-cheat</a>, like <em>Fortnite</em>.</p><p>Best of all, the Steam Machine should just work with my quickly growing collection of Steam games. The Steam Deck has totally converted me to the benefits of the Steam ecosystem, like a huge catalog of games to play, a library that follows me across devices and platforms, and cloud saves and multiplayer that aren’t gated behind a monthly fee. And because, like the Steam Deck, the Steam Machine has a microSD card slot, I’ll be able to save games to a microSD card and swap them between the two devices, almost like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/818602/valve-steam-deck-machine-frame-microsd-card-game-cartridges">a souped-up game cartridge</a>.</p><p>Prior to seeing the Steam Machine, I was weighing choices like using the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/761025/framework-desktop-bazzite-linux-steam-machine-pc-game-console-impressions">Framework Desktop</a> (promising, and a handle is an option!), getting <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22295181/best-gaming-laptop#csm3NI">a good gaming laptop</a> (the most portable, but potentially very expensive), or just sourcing parts and building the PC myself (intimidating for <s>a </s><em><s>Verge</s></em><s> reporter</s> me, a DIY newb). But these options aren’t as compelling as a first-party Steam Machine: I want something that is great for TV gaming, as reliable as my Steam Deck, and requires minimal fuss on my end — with an active toddler running around the house, time is a major commodity!</p><p>With the Steam Deck, Valve made PC gaming much more palatable to console crowds by (mostly) being something that just works. Verified games don’t need much fiddling to play great, many less-optimized games can be playable with graphics tweaks or by customizing your controls, and table stakes like a functional UI and reliable sleep and wake are all there. And it’s all wrapped up in a comfortable, ergonomic handheld. If Valve can bring that same console-like experience to a living room device, it would open up the best of PC gaming to even more people.</p><p>Valve is set to launch the Steam Machine sometime next year. It hasn’t said how much it will cost, but instead of shopping for Black Friday deals on some kind of other gaming PC, I think I’m going to save that money for the Steam Machine instead.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/818606/valve-steam-machine-tv-gaming-pc-wanted]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/poll-have-you-had-issues-with-the-ethernet-port-on-switch-2s-dock</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/poll-have-you-had-issues-with-the-ethernet-port-on-switch-2s-dock.1354582/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="61ffe6b0cd8e7"><a title="Nintendo Switch 2 Dock" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/61ffe6b0cd8e7/nintendo-switch-2-dock.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Since the introduction of the OLED model, there's been an Ethernet port built into the dock of Nintendo's flagship Switch, and that continued this year with Switch 2. If you're after the fastest download speeds or you play competitive online games while docked to your TV, you may benefit from wiring up your dock to your router directly.</p>
<p>However, since launch back in June, we've seen reports of players having issues with wired internet connections. Some point to the Realtek port as the culprit, others think it's a specific firmware or software glitch, or a USB-C-related handshake issue where something periodically goes awry. But whatever the reason, there seems to be a group for whom Switch 2's Ethernet port just isn't functioning correctly.</p>
<p>Asking around the NL office, it's blank faces, (un)fortunately. Either a wireless connection is sufficient and we haven't ever bothered wiring up the dock, or we just haven't experienced any issues.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/forums/nintendo-switch-2/ethernet_port_on_switch_2_docks_failing_for_many_people">our forums</a> and <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/some-switch-2-ethernet-docks-are-malfunctioning.14103/">the wider internet</a> are filled with people who have had issues. Some have sent their docks back to Nintendo with varying degrees of success; others have found that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1l6q47u/comment/n1rse3p">connecting their phones via a USB cable</a> somehow resets the chip and managed to get their Ethernet back up and running, if only temporarily.</p>

<p>Naturally, Nintendo has its error codes and <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68592">related pages</a>, but assuming that using a different Ethernet cable doesn't solve your problem, opening up a report ticket with Nintendo is the only option they're offering.</p>
<p>Obviously, this issue will be frustrating if it impacts you, but we're keen to get a sense of just how many people this is affecting. As with any electronic device, there'll be a percentage of failures or manufacturing faults that crop up that'll need attention, and with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/switch-2-sells-over-10-million-units-nintendo-increases-forecast-even-further">10.36 million people</a> (and counting) picking up a Switch 2 in the first few months, there are bound to be some malfunctioning units - but how widespread is the problem?</p>
<p>Let us know in the poll below if you've experienced any issues with a wired internet connection - and if / how you've solved the problem.</p>

		<p>I’ve come down with some kind of malady this weekend, presumably from all the shared spaces that I had on trains to and from Paris a few days ago. That’s making the prospect of battling through the rest of the Black Ops 7 campaign a bit of a tricky one to psyche myself up for, so I’ve booted up Metroid Prime Remastered to get into the groove ahead of Metroid Prime 4. It’s really rather good with the modern controls.</p>
<h2>In the News This Week</h2>
<p>There was a State of Play this week, which brought a bunch of trailers and announcements, but the biggest news of all came from Valve:</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-dual-port-fast-charger-pack-sells-for-peanuts-amazon-prices-each-unit-five-times-lower-than-apple-2000644466</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-dual-port-fast-charger-pack-sells-for-peanuts-amazon-prices-each-unit-five-times-lower-than-apple.1354573/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple’s official 20W USB-C charger is a $19 single-port affair that doesn’t include any cables in the box. Anker’s solution flips that equation entirely, with two chargers <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3718/">sporting dual-ports apiece, plus two included USB-C cables, all for just $12 on Amazon right now</a>. That’s down from the regular $18 price and an all-time low for this bundle. You’re essentially getting five times the charging capability for less than what Apple charges for their basic single-port adapter, and you won’t need to hunt down cables separately since Anker includes <strong>two 5-foot USB-C to USB-C cables</strong> in the package.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3718/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Dual-Port Flexibility Changes Your Charging Setup</h2>
<p>Each charger <strong>has both a USB-C and a USB-A port,</strong> each of which works simultaneously, enabling you to charge two devices from a single wall outlet. The maximum output of 20W is intelligently split when you charge two devices simultaneously, though when charging just one device through the USB-C port, you get the full 20W for fast charging speeds. This dual-port design is very convenient, especially for traveling when hotel rooms never seem to have enough outlets, or when everyone in your family has a different device that they need to charge in the same area.</p>



<p>This means the 20W of power delivery through <strong>USB-C charges an iPhone from zero to 50 percent in roughly 30 minutes</strong> – just like Apple’s own fast chargers-and it works across iPhone 15, 16 and 17 series models, iPad Pro, and other USB-C devices that support Power Delivery protocol. For comparison, it would take older 5W chargers, which used to ship with iPhones, nearly two hours to reach that same 50 percent charge level.</p>



<p>Anker designed these chargers with compact form factors that <strong>keep them from blocking adjacent outlets on power strips or wall plates</strong>. The foldable prongs on the US version further make them more travel-friendly by removing the sharp edges that can snag on clothing or scratch other items in your bag. About the size of Apple’s standard charger, these easily slip into a laptop bag, purse, or jacket pocket without adding bulk.</p>
<p>The included safety features address common charging concerns through Anker’s proprietary protection system. Overvoltage protection prevents power surges or inconsistent electrical supplies from causing any damage and thus is important during international travels or when one has to use the electrical systems of older buildings. Monitoring temperature control means this charger will not overheat during a long session and can throttle power output in case temperatures rise above safe thresholds. Short-circuit protection provides protection against wiring faults that may otherwise damage connected devices.</p>
<p>Those <strong>two included 5-foot USB-C to USB-C cables add a considerable value</strong> as quality USB-C cables usually cost $10-$15 each if you buy them separately. This 5-foot length is long enough to use your device comfortably while charging, unlike those frustratingly short 3-foot cables that make you sit right next to the outlet. These cables support the full 20W power delivery which means you are not bottlenecking the charging speed through some inferior cable.</p>
<p>That comes to $6 per complete charging setup when you buy two dual-port chargers plus two cables for $12, which is less than a third of what Apple asks for its base single-port adapter before cables. It gets even better because, with Apple, you would have to purchase the cables separately which will easily push the price tag north of $25 per charging setup if you were buying from Apple.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-day-one-steam-numbers-compare-badly-to-battlefield-6-and-arc-raiders/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-ops-7-day-one-steam-numbers-compare-badly-to-battlefield-6-and-arc-raiders.1354567/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The first full day of Black Ops 7 is behind us. Its reception has been fairly mixed so far, but one thing that’s not up for debate is how Black Ops 7 has performed on Steam, especially compared to other big-time shooters right now, such as Battlefield 6 and ARC Raiders.</p>



<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7’s release means Treyarch has had back-to-back launches. Black Ops 6 was quite the success, but Black Ops 7 isn’t being as warmly received. Criticism has come its way due to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/activision-responds-black-ops-7-ai-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI Claims</a> and the fact that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/you-cant-pause-the-black-ops-7-campaign-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you can’t pause the Black Ops 7 campaign, ever</a>.</p>







<p>With so many eyes on Battlefield 6 and ARC Raiders, it’s fair to say Black Ops 7 isn’t the shooter in the spotlight like it wants to be.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-falls-way-short-of-arc-raiders-amp-battlefield-6-on-steam">Black Ops 7 Falls Way Short Of ARC Raiders &amp; Battlefield 6 On Steam</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A good start for some. Credit to Embark Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>Let’s break this down for you. According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>, Battlefield hit a 24-hour release day peak of <strong>747,440 players</strong>, whereas ARC Raiders managed a more than respectable <strong>264,673</strong>.</p>



<p>Black Ops 7 is part of the whole ‘Call of Duty’ banner under SteamDB, making its numbers slightly inflated if anything. However, its 24-hour launch peak on November 14 hit a high of <strong>86,652 players</strong>.</p>







<p>It’s bad enough if you compare ARC Raider and Black Ops 7. When you do a direct comparison between Battlefield 6 and Black Ops 7, you need to stop the count! Worryingly for CoD, Battlefield 6 is still regularly hitting 200-250K, and ARC Raiders is growing stronger—consistently breaking 300K.</p>



<p>It’s expected that the weekend might give Black Ops 7 a boost, but it remains to be seen by how much. Even with Season 1 expected to be the biggest ever, for a franchise that regularly scoops the award for best-selling game of the year, this year might be a rude awakening for Call of Duty.</p>



<p>Have you bought Black Ops 7? Or are you on either the Battlefield 6 or ARC Raiders hype train this year?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Given the history and prestige of The Legend of Zelda, a proper movie is something that’s needed. There’s also the biggest weight of expectation imaginable on its shoulders. So, anyone desperate for details on The Legend of Zelda movie might be interested to know that the first footage has reportedly leaked.</p>



<p>In 2023, we finally learned that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-legend-of-zelda-is-finally-getting-a-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Legend of Zelda was getting a movie</a>. It received a release date soon after, but it was inevitably <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-delays-the-legend-of-zelda-live-action-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed</a>—as all things are. After wondering where the movie had gone, it was rumored that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-legend-of-zelda-movie-filming-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">movie had seemingly started filming</a> in November 2025. Not long after, secret footage surfaced.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-legend-of-zelda-movie-video-leaks-appear-online">The Legend of Zelda Movie Video Leaks Appear Online</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s a tough ask. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>Instagram account <a href="https://www.instagram.com/josh.and.pine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">josh.and.pine</a> has shared several videos supposedly showing the first The Legend of Zelda Movie set leaks.</p>



<p>The video shows Link on set (in full Green Tunic) speaking to the crew. Soon after, we cut to the actress playing Zelda—and it also reveals that she’s wearing a blue outfit closer to the Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom look. A horse is being prepared, and it’s clearly wearing a patch with the classic Zelda logo in the middle of it.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DRCDMlDDq-q/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="14"></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>If that wasn’t enough to whet your appetite, another leak from what appears to be the sme set has also been revealed. This time, it looks like an actual scene is taking place. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tonyolsenfilm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">tonyolsenfilm</a> shared the other video, and it’s an extension of the first clip, only this time Zelda is briefly looking around before speaking to another Hylian.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DRCALkNk0Nl/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="14"></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>There have been some suggestions that the footage is AI. However, the action isn’t consistent with the usual AI tropes, such as scenery inconsistencies, the weird AI effect some videos have, and there aren’t any abnormal occurrences in the footage. This could also be a setup leak to promote the film and gain publicity through alleged leaks.</p>







<p>Either way, unless we hear otherwise, this does look like the first-ever The Legend of Zelda Movie footage. The costumes look good—although this incarnation of Zelda might upset some fans—and we know that filming is likely underway!</p>



<p>Let us know what you think of the videos. Are you excited to see what a full-length, live-action The Legend of Zelda Movie looks like?

            <title><![CDATA[How Long to Beat Call of Duty: Black Ops 7? Game Length And Missions List]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-campaign-length-mission-list/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-long-to-beat-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-game-length-and-missions-list.1354549/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is available to the world and, with a new game mode unlocking after completion of the campaign, it’s natural to ask about the length and how many missions there are to complete—and we have the answer.</p>



<p>Black Ops 7 makes some big changes to the campaign this year, introducing four-player co-op and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-campaign-camo-challenges/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exclusive Camos to unlock</a>, giving players more to dig out from the experience.</p>



<p>If you’re wondering what the full length of the Black Ops 7 campaign is and want to know how many missions there are to churn through, we’ve got all the details.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-long-to-beat-call-of-duty-black-ops-7">How Long to beat Call of Duty: Black Ops 7?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Big names. Image via Activsion</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Full completion of the main story in the Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 campaign takes around five hours to complete, though this can be longer.</strong></p>



<p>If you are playing the campaign solo, completion time will be longer as progress will be harder and therefore slower. If you want to blitz through the campaign as quickly as possible, it’s highly recommended that you gather a squad to help push through the hordes of enemies more quickly.</p>



<p>Campaign completion will also take longer if you’re hunting down all of the Intel scattered in the game, or if you’re farming for the exclusive Camos. If you’re doing the latter, however, I recommend you hold off until you complete the campaign and unlock the Endgame mode.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-many-missions-in-black-ops-7-co-op-campaign">How Many Missions in Black Ops 7 Co-Op Campaign?</h2>



<p><strong>There are 11 total missions in the Black Ops 7 Co-Op Campaign, not including the Endgame mode, which you will be automatically entered into for the first time when the campaign is complete.</strong></p>



<p>Each mission is unlocked periodically, fleshing out the main story, though it’s a bit of a fever trip jumping to different locations and years, so don’t worry if you’re struggling to keep up.</p>



<p>Many of the missions begin in an open-world environment in Avalon, but there are markers to follow so you won’t get lost.</p>



<p>A full list of the missions in the Black Ops 7 campaign is below:</p>



<ol>
<li>Exposure</li>



<li>Inside</li>



<li>Distortion</li>



<li>Escalation</li>



<li>Disruption</li>



<li>Collapse</li>



<li>Fracture</li>



<li>Quarantine</li>

<figure data-uuid="1752ef6450e0d"><a title="The Legend of Zelda" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1752ef6450e0d/the-legend-of-zelda.large.jpg"></a></figure><p>If you can turn your attention away from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-release-date-cast-trailers-everything-we-know-so-far"><strong>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</strong></a> for one moment, it seems we might have the very first leak from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/legend-of-zelda-movie-release-date-cast-everything-we-know-about-the-live-action-zelda-film"><strong>The Legend of Zelda Movie</strong></a> set.</p>
<p>While very little has been revealed about the film so far, it was confirmed earlier this month that the live-action is officially <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/the-legend-of-zelda-movie-is-now-in-production-in-new-zealand">"in production" in New Zealand</a>. Now, in an update this week, footage has supposedly emerged of the production, including some clips featuring cast members and the film crew.</p>
<p>This is where this rumour possibly enters <strong>spoiler territory</strong>, so if you don't want any surprises ahead of official updates, navigate away from this page now. Right, with the spoiler warning out of the way, the first video that's been uploaded on Instagram shows two characters in a forest, surrounded by horses (with one horse equipped with some gear featuring what looks to be the Hylian Crest).</p>

<p>The first actor is believed to be Bo Bragason as Zelda, who is dressed in an outfit that looks similar to her clothing in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Breath of the Wild</a>, and the second actor (who we haven't heard about up until now) is apparently the Aussie and Tibetan actress Dichen Lachman, known for her current role in the Apple TV+ exclusive, Severance. She's also previously worked with director Wes Ball on Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes.</p>
<p>As for who she is playing? Based on the footage, fans are already convinced she'll be Impa. Long-time Zelda players will know Impa is a recurring character in the Zelda series, who has been depicted as the bodyguard and mentor of the Princess.</p>
<p>The second scene doing the rounds looks to feature an older version of the series' protagonist Link in his green tunic, which he has appeared in across multiple games, including titles such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/legend_of_zelda_ocarina_of_time">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/legend_of_zelda_twilight_princess_hd">Twilight Princess</a>. The footage in this upload even shows him putting on a cloak, and some fans think his horse Epona is also on display in the other clip.</p>

<p>We'd be surprised if the original clips stay up if they are the real deal. Of course, for now, it's probably best to treat this supposed leak as a rumour, but we will say the footage certainly looks the part, and casting someone from across the ditch (<em>aka Australia</em>) would check out, given the location of the production.</p>
<p>Apart from Zelda's casting, the only other actor officially confirmed for the Legend of Zelda Movie is Benjamin Evan Ainsworth as Link. As for the story, some basic <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/the-legend-of-zelda-movie-is-now-in-production-in-new-zealand">descriptions have popped up online</a>, but that's about it. This live-action film is currently scheduled to arrive in cinemas in <strong>May 2027</strong>, and you can find out more about it in our guide here on Nintendo Life.</p>

<p>After 60 hours, I am still maining BALL x PIT. I had a peek into the leaderboards, and have got dragged into those! 😆 Am in the top 30 for the first two levels. It is fun watching the chaos as you get stronger and stronger, and I would like to see how far things can be pushed. So Absolum and Trails In The Sky will have to wait for now! Have a great weekend, guys, and please take great care of yourselves out there!</p></section>

<p>I finally beat Star Wars Outlaws during the week! I still have a ton of side content to explore, but after pouring in 60-70 hours into it, I feel like I can break from it for now. I really enjoyed this on the Switch 2, which means I'm in the market for a new Switch 2 game! Trying to wait for the holiday season to see if Cyberpunk goes on sale, or any other games I have on my wishlist.</p><p>In the meantime, I started Paper Mario TTYD, wish I never played previously. Actually, its my first Paper Mario game. Ive been enjoying it so far, and could be primer for my eventual playthrough of Xenoblade Chronicles X.</p><p>No ROG Ally X games at the moment that have hooked me. Played a little bit of Kingdom Hearts, but there seems to be some game issues specific to the ROG, so I bounced off of that, and I played a little Quantum Break, which I enjoyed a bit more, but I didn't feel in the mood for a game like that right now.</p></section>

<p>I'm a few hours into Lunar 1 and will try to beat it before Octopath Traveler 0 releases in december. Played through the prologue demo and i'm really looking forward to it.</p>
<p>Last couple of days i finally got hooked into Hades 2. Played it every once in a while since it released but put it on the side for other games. Things are opening up and incantations brewing.</p>
<p>Currently transfering games to my PS2 HDD so i might also play some Chulip or Conflict Desert Storm</p>

<p>That's funny, last week I actually started replaying <strong>Resident Evil 5</strong> as well, for the first time since I played it back on the PS3 around when the Gold edition released. This time however I'm playing it on online co-op with a friend, the co-op experience is making the game so much better. We're already in the tribal area, hopefully we can get some more game time this weekend.</p>
<p>For my main solo playthrough I'm replaying <strong>Fire Emblem Fates Conquest</strong>, I have my share of issues with the game but I'm quite enjoying the intricately designed maps and trying out some characters which I never really gave the time of day to, most notably Odin who I understand has redeemed himself in a big way in the game's later years, the simple act of getting him a Nosferatu tome turns him from a low damage liability into a tank. I've made it through into the midgame, just got Xander in the last map and the main characters have for the most part been rounded up, next up should be the absolute nightmare that is the Ninja dungeon chapter, I'm both looking and not looking forward to that.</p>

<p>I have been playing Oracle of Ages for the first time, through NSO, and I'm thoroughly enjoying it. I've needed some help with a couple of dungeon puzzles, as my puzzle solving abilities have waned, as has my patience for them, but that's alright. In the past I'd be annoyed at myself for using guides, not any more... I'm looking forward to playing Seasons next. I have read that's more combat focused.</p>
<p>The classic filter for the GB/ GBC games looks very nice. Has that recently been improved as I don't remember it looking as nice as that before?</p>

<p>On Switch:</p>
<p><strong><u>The Legend of Zelda</u></strong><br>
Completed the sixth dungeon. Currently at 14 hearts.</p>
<hr>
<p>On other platforms:</p>
<p><strong><u>1000xRESIST</u></strong><br>
Completed Chapter 2.</p>
<p><strong><u>Assassin's Creed Shadows</u></strong><br>
Just assassinated the second Onryo with Naoe and completed Amagasaki Castle. Currently level 9. I'm usually a massive AC fan but not feeling it with Shadows just yet. The inability to control the day/night cycle is also annoying AF.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/users/Eduard_Brenton" data-username="Eduard_Brenton" rel="nofollow">@Eduard_Brenton</a> Which Shinobi, the Sega Ages version? Love it, I've spent far more hours with that than one would expect to spend with the original Shinobi. I like playing for a high score, trying to get through a stage without using Shurikens for the bonus points at the end. It's rock hard to do though.</p></section>

<p>I just played through RE5 last month on Switch 1. It performed well enough there but I tried out Mercenaries mode on Switch 2 and wow... MUCH smoother! I am now playing RE6. The framerate really tanks on Switch 1 so I am playing this one exclusively on Switch 2. It runs like a dream there.</p></section>

<p>This weekend feels like a turning point in my gaming year. I finally closed the book on my playthrough of Hogwarts Legacy, ending at 96% completion and 145 hours. It was the right place to stop. I didn’t want to burn out on a world I had come to love so deeply. And Professor Weasley’s “well done, indeed” upon reviewing my Field Guide progress was all the validation I needed. A marvelous journey, start to finish. Here’s hoping for the eventual release of the planned sequel on Switch 2 in the not-too-distant future.</p><p>In happier surprises, Hello Kitty Island Adventure dropped its Nintendo Switch 2 Edition upgrade without warning, and I bought the $9.99 upgrade instantly. The game looks noticeably crisper and runs more smoothly on the newer hardware, even if the occasional stutter still intrudes. Mostly I’m thrilled that the Hello Kitty rug in Dear Daniel’s apartment has finally stopped flickering in and out of the astral plane. A blessing.</p><p>I’m heading to Miami Beach for the next several days, so my gaming will match the setting. I plan to revisit Donkey Kong Bananza and give it another chance, now that I’m in the right mindset for something tropical and energetic. The same thing happened with me and Super Mario Odyssey years ago. I bounced off at first, came back later, realized how brilliant it was, and chased down every Power Moon in sight (and not in sight). I’m hoping Bananza will click in the same way.</p><p>Happy gaming, everyone!</p></section>

<p>This weekend has brought a few more hybrid ports backlog boosters to consider in terms of storage juggling and session inclusions, from No Place Like Home, Necrosmith and Spells &amp; Secrets to Loop8, Dragon: Marked for Death and Trinity Trigger... wait, scratch that, it was <strong>supposed</strong> to bring all these before eShop seemingly went south with payment processing last night, registering free grabs like the new Azuma/SoS DLC as usual but yielding error messages upon any attempt to add funds or even try changing the long saved payment card - which, incidentally, has led to bloat- er, boosting my Deck backlog with Ys 1/2 and Planet Centauri instead as a test of the same card's general functionality and potential bank hijinks. Seeing as two spare accounts on both sides of the pond (hailing way back to when I still used that approach for region-exclusive games instead of adjusting the main acc's country) are also failing to add the card info, I can narrow this nuisance down to the Ninty side but all the dedicated help pages and social media posts offer nothing more tangible than "keep trying your luck later".🙄😆</p>
<p>What's a nerd to do during the allocatable gaming time, then? Sink into the already amassed stuff that was always in the cards besides anything new, of course. Xillia and Graces, Yumia and Marie, Persona 4 and 5, Xenoblades and Castlevanias galore, aforementioned Azuma and other sim RPGs like Portia/Deadcraft/Harvestella, recently initiated playthroughs like Ball x Pit, Tinkertown or Railgrade and the long ongoing ones like Puyo Puyo Tetris, Saints Row 4 or Borderlands 2... all of that with possible intermissions on other platforms, be it Cyberpunk and Chibi-Robo on NS2, Payback and Fallout 3 on Deck (I'll have to see of I can cram Planet Centauri in, but Adol will certainly have to wait until I'm done with Ys Origin), Gravity Rush and Valentia on the handheld consoles, Phantom X and Resonance Solstice on the phone... so, not counting the aforelamented but hopefully fleeting FWPs, business as usual.</p>

<p>TOTK. It didn’t appeal to me at all when it first came out; the assembly mechanic, the massive open world, it just seemed too much game and I wanted something more contained. For no particular reason, a couple of months ago I changed my tune and jumped in, and boy oh boy, I’m glad I did. What a masterpiece. I know I’m preaching to the choir here, but in case there’s one more human being out there who needs convincing, this is an experience not to be missed.</p></section>

<p>Think I’m close to finishing Tiny Lands 2 which has been excellent, hoping this will receive DLC like the first game. Next up I’m aiming to try the Octopath Traveler 0 demo which may lead me to the full game and another time sponge… Happy gaming all!</p></section>

<p>I’m going to be playing move furniture back into my living room and my daughter’s room after finishing painting and installing floors. I threw my sofa away, so when I do hook my consoles back up… I have nowhere to sit. I will be playing “search for a new sofa” after that. I’d like to say I’ll be settling down to play Yotei, but I don’t quite know if I’ll have time. All I can guarantee is that, in the absence of having my console games to play while I move stuff, Balatro on my phone will say hi.</p></section>

<p>Before I get to what I'll be playing this weekend, I have to mention that after putting Silksong down for a month due to The Last Judge, I came back to it on my day off to myself and I FINALLY beat it. I just needed a couple of important tools to do it (if anyone is struggling, get the Tacks and the Threepin. They work wonders, so you can mostly focus on fighting without the use of them adding too much to think about. I just threw all my tacks on the ground and spammed my pins at the end. Combined with poison, and they saved my soul on this fight). It felt SO good to take down after all of that time. The thought of thay fight haunted me for a month while I switched to playing Crow Country and Steamworld Heist II instead.</p><p>With that in mind, I think Silksong will be something I pick at on the side while I play a main game. Right now, I'm on episode 4 of Heretic (from the Heretic + Hexen pack). I never got to try this one out, and even though its very similar to Doom (just with magic spells instead of weapons), I'm having a blast with it. I might even try starting up Ninja Gaiden Ragebound this weekend, since I'll be wrapping up Heretic soon.</p></section>

<p>This weekend my time is spent obsessing on <strong>Hades 2</strong>. I played this quite a bit when it released on the Switch, but I got burned out during the 20-hour mark and took a lengthy break. I’m now 50+ hours deep and won’t be pausing any time soon.</p>
<p>It may sound embarrassing, but I have yet to complete a single run, but I’m okay with that due to its rich story strong narrative and characters. It’s truly astonishing that this game can have so much content. I’ve yet to encounter a single repeated line of dialogue between character interactions, and each person is fully developed, with excellent voice acting to provide an extra layer of immersion.</p>
<p>To simply put, Hades 2 is easily going into my pantheon of exceptional games, possibly in the top five. I’m not sure how Supergiant exceeded expectations, but they are a master of their craft. Every game they make is top tier, and better than the last. I can’t wait to see their next project. Until then, welcome to the GoTY discussion my indie darling.</p>
<p>And I’m now patiently waiting for one of my most anticipated games in years: <strong>Demonschool</strong>. Only a few more days to go.</p>

I'll probably also let my younger sister play more with my supervision.<br><strong>PS4</strong>:<br><strong>Super Neptunia RPG</strong>: all of my party members are now in the early 40s in terms of level. I'm just grinding experience and doing a few sidequests before moving on with the story. Current number of trophies: 21</p></section>

<p>I'm just continuing to be fascinated and amazed playing stuff at 300fps. I decided to try out my old laptop with this cheap new 300hz monitor I bought and was amazed that it can run Lossless Scaling perfectly. I've been having endless trouble getting LS to work on my new laptop. I wonder if it's Windows 11 vs 10. I've never allowed the "upgrade" on my old laptop, and now I'm planning to protect it from any updates at all. I don't want to lose this ability to get emulation, videos, and all games up to 300fps with perfect frame pacing!! People talk about diminishing returns on higher frame rates, and they're right, but at the same time I'm amazed and enthralled by higher and higher fps. Playing Utopia Must Fall at 300fps and getting the triple shot for the first time, and realizing I can widen or narrow the triple shot with the triggers, well it just looks like a beyond perfect light show! I've gotten up to 16 days survived and something like 210,000 high score. I Love Utopia Must Fall.<br>I'm also playing Dirt Rally at 300fps. Once I destroy all the settings and lower the resolution to 720p (probably my favorite resolution!) it can run at 300 to 400fps, and it looks gorgeous!<br>Also playing Lonely Mountains Downhill (such an amazing and relaxing game), Pru the Pigeon, wipeout 2097 phantom edition (I'll always want to play this at 300fps!), Retro Endurance 8 bit (so grateful the dev programmed this to run at 300, or whatever you've got!), Rush Rally Origins, Classic Mario World 3 the finale, Super Mario World Redone 40 Years of Mario!, Zelda's Adventure DX, and Rocket League.<br>Oh, and I'm super excited to get a Gabecube, Steam Controller, and Frame! I love that the Gabecube can output very high frame rates via Display Port — I'll be using that feature!!<br>And I've enjoyed all the content online. Linus' love struck face cracks me up! I'm excited for the coming expansion of the "open ecosystem"!<br>I also liked Alana Pearce's reporting on Saudi and Kushner investments in EA and games in general (Nintendo too!).<br>I wish everyone well, and happy gaming!</p></section>

<p>This week we’ve moved from playing on the Switch 2 to SteamOS. I installed it on my Mini PC (Minisforum AtomMan G7 PT) after the Steam Box announcement. Running SteamOS is a better gaming TV experience with the only drawback being using the shop on controller can be awful.</p><p>We were sick of our Switch 2 crashing while playing Vampire Survivors. Some folks report no issues on Switch 2 but we’ve had multiple crashes a day and performance after 20 mins in a run is pathetic. It’s sad to see new hardware performance so badly.</p><p>As for Vampire Survivors, we’ve done everything but the adventure modes now.</p></section>

<p>As its mid November, going back to Batman: Arkham Origins on PS3, I think I preferred his one to Knight despite it not being part of the 'trilogy'. The Christmas setting in the city still has great atmosphere, even on PS3 I still think it looks good. Also as I'm using the console, have to play some classic Daytona USA.</p>
<p>Even more retro wise, I picked up the new DLC for Atari 50 on Switch, playing 2600 Dig Dug after all these years is still fun, and very nostalgic.</p>

<p>Traveling to Japan, and was thinking of bringing the Switch to continue Dragon Quest II, but in a stroke of brilliance I dusted off my 2DS XL and Dragon Quest VIII for the flight.</p>
<p>Very curious to see how Street Pass fares in 2025.</p>

<p>Outside of my twice a year "test older game systems and see if they still work" session today - which usually involves firing up a game or two from each system library if the machine functions - I'm still working on <strong>Pokemon Scarlet</strong> with an occasional side order of <strong>Hades</strong> on Switch. I've reached Area Zero in the former and LOVE the group dynamic, character development, and increasing unease in this area. And the <em>music</em>....The area theme is hands down my favorite track in the game. I'm still doing the occasional run through the Underworld in the latter, but I'll admit the game is starting to feel more repetitive. I've at least cleared the final boss once but would like to finish the main story. Which means more escape attempts.</p>
<p>There's a last hurrah of sunny mid 70 degrees F/~25 degrees C weather both yesterday and today in my corner of the US, so I might get outside for a bit too. It was glorious on my lunch trail speed walk yesterday.</p>
<p>Happy gaming!</p>

<p>Happy weekend and gaming everyone. This week I have been playing:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hello_kitty_island_adventure"><strong>Hello Kitty Island Adventure</strong></a> - I caved in and got the Switch 2 edition upgrade for $10. The game looked sharper for a few minutes but then my brain adjusted and I can no longer tell the difference. 😝 Not worth the upgrade, but oh well.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/kirbys_dream_buffet"><strong>Kirby's Dream Buffet</strong></a> - The recent Nintendo Music release reminded me that I hadn't unlocked everything in this game so I have been playing again. Such a fun little game. I wish multiplayer was active, but it's still fun to play around against the bots now and then.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/klonoa_phantasy_reverie_series"><strong>KLONOA Phantasy Reverie Series</strong></a> - The recent Switch 2 OS update finally fixed this game! I'm restarting the first game in the collection. It looks really good on Switch 2 now that it doesn't instantly crash!</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nierautomata_the_end_of_yorha_edition"><strong>NieR:Automata The End of YoRHa Edition</strong></a> - I got this game for a few dollars earlier this year and was waiting for it to be fixed on Switch 2 to play it. I decided to just start. If it breaks I'll swap to Switch 1 😅</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve got limited time to play this weekend because the Spearess and I need to be awake at 2 a.m. Monday to fly to the happy island of Aruba. Still a lot of prep to do before that.</p><p>For those keeping score at home, I easily won my <strong>Civ VI</strong> run as Tsar Peter of Russia very early last weekend, gaining victory by making our founded religion — Rastafari, of course — the dominant religion in every other civilization, the highlight being when Babylon was converted. Jah bless.</p><p>I promised myself I wouldn’t start another run because I didn’t want it occupying my mind while I was on vacation, but then I went ahead and began a run anyway as Pericles leading Greece. I stepped up in difficulty, and it has been a struggle. So, I will indeed have that on my mind next week!</p><p>And … happy gaming, everyone!</p></section>

<p>I'll be playing Pokemon Legends ZA and La Pucelle. Been playing these for the past few weeks. I'm loving how Legends ZA makes things much simpler to do in shiny hunting and training up Pokemon stats making you have more fun actually playing the game than doing time consuming tasks.</p></section>

<p>Been playing some Distance on the PS5. It’s a sort of racing game with a slight horror edge to it. Real fun. On Switch 2 I just wrapped up Chicken Police: Into the Hive so that opens up for more Hyrule Warriors Age of Imprisonment.</p></section>

<p>Finished Kirby and the Forgotten Land. There are fun great moments but then there are some stages that tend to be overly long but the gameplay is too repetitive for that, so it tends to drag. It's also kinda too easy, only the true final boss poses any real challenge. But abilities are awesome, and it has a variety of neat little things to do which I like. And it managed to sate my hunger for a platformer lol</p><p>And I also started up Tales of Graces F. Been wanting to play this one forever and it does not disappoint. Absolutely love the characters and the dialogue. Story starts off pretty troupey but there's never a dull moment yet at least. And the style of the game is gorgeous</p></section>

<p>I'm a broken record as of late. My gaming time has been way less lately than I'd like. Damn personal life. In-laws are in the stage where they need more and more help with errands like grocery shopping, doctor appointments and whatever odds &amp; ends throughout the week (and especially any days off). Taking up more and more of the wife and mine's time.</p><p>Anyways, back on topic when I can game I'll just keep the tunnel vision on <strong>Hades 2</strong> (Switch 2) and <strong>Snowrunner</strong> (Switch 2). Between those two I have no time to squeeze anything else in at the moment.</p></section>

<p>I just rolled through the <span title="Warning: Spoiler!">Olympian family reunion</span> after over a hundred runs with <strong>Hades</strong>. My max heat level was 11 with the blade, although I think I'm fine giving it a bit of a rest for now. <strong>Hades II</strong> being released was the swift kick to the rear I needed to finally go tackle that.</p>
<p>Still very early in <strong>Star Ocean: Second Story R</strong>,, which looks a lot nice in motion that it does in stills. I've also got some <strong>Cities: Skylines</strong> planned out. Lots of school this weekend. And I may yet sleep!</p>
<p>Happy gaming everyone!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/users/Ganner" data-username="Ganner" rel="nofollow">@Ganner</a> Hey, Ganner, I feel you. I've been using a lot of my days off to help the folks with doctors' visits. But the way I look at it, when I was a kid my dad spent so many days off dealing with Little League and other activities for me, so I'm just paying it back. And my dad was a firefighter, so I'm sure he needed the days off much more than I need them now. (It's tough, though, when these games have their claws in you, right?)</p>

<p>Speaking of Resident Evil, the new Switch 2 update breaks progression in the game, making it unplayable on Switch 2. Basically camera will crash and start vibrating in place, with no way to unlock it. You xan still hear what's going on, but you won't see what's happening, because the frames don't advance to the next action. This happens at many points in the game, so no matter where you are in the story, it will eventually stop you from progressing.</p></section>

Vexx level 39.</li><li>The King of Fighters XIII Global Match (Switch): Completed Arcade Mode with the Psycho Soldier Team and the Women Fighters Team. Also, completed 3 Combo Trials with Goro.</li><li>Fate Stay Night Remastered (Switch): Reached Day I-After school/Daily life (I).</li><li>Witch on the Holy Night (Switch): Reached Chapter 5 Night of the Witches 1.</li></ul><p>Happy weekend &amp; gaming everyone!</p></section>

<p>It’s been a while since I posted. I beat donkey Kong bananza more then a week ago. Collected all the bananas and walked around the island in the dlc. This is a great game overall. Mainly because the nostalgia that is in the game. The last couple of worlds and the final boss is what really made me like the game a lot.</p><p>Raidou remastered(switch 1 version) - just started this game properly. I would have bought the switch 2 version but I am trying my best to avoid game key cards but it’s also because Atlus didn’t put much effort into the switch 2 version compared to the switch 1 version. If there was a noticeable difference in graphics/resolution and framerate I would have bought the switch 2 version. I just completed the prologue chapter.</p><p>Otogirisou(snes) on gkd pixel 2 - working on it still. Getting deep into the story.</p><p>Happy gaming everyone!</p></section>

<p>I finished Act 3 in <strong>SilkSong</strong> I’m at 98% completion. What a masterpiece. I can’t recall being this focused on 1 game in some time. It’s fun and challenging in the sense where few games create the same level of accomplishment. A beautiful game that’s not meant for everyone.</p><p>Not sure what I’ll start next, perhaps a mix of <strong>Hades 2</strong> and <strong>Outer Worlds 2</strong>. Could be a sequel weekend! End of the year gaming rush is legit and hard to believe <strong>Metroid Prime 4</strong> is out in a few weeks.</p><p>It’s getting colder outside-hot chocolate and a spliff kind of weather 😉!</p><p>Have a joyous weekend! Keep on gaming!</p></section>

Getting older is both amazing and sucky. It’s tough watching our parents and family members slowing down. This is life! All u can do is enjoy the time as much as you can while you can.</p>

It’s funny looking back at the Game Gear and to have ppl complain about battery life of 4-5 hrs on their fully portable home consoles in 2025 😝</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-server-capacity-tripled-for-launch/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlestate-games-has-tripled-escape-from-tarkov%E2%80%99s-server-capacity-ahead-of-1-0-release.1354528/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>One of the biggest issues that plagues Escape from Tarkov players every time there’s a new update is server queues. The game suffers under the weight of incoming players, and those same players feel that burn. From lengthy queue times to network instability, Tarkov’s servers often crumble around a wipe or new major update.</p>



<p>Battlestate Games has well and truly prepared for that ahead of the game’s 1.0 release, dropping later today. In an episode of Tarkov TV, Nikita Buyanov, the head of the studio, confirmed that Escape from Tarkov’s server capacity has been <strong>tripled </strong>ahead of the release.</p>







<h2 id="h-tarkov-s-major-networking-issues-eliminated">Tarkov’s Major Networking Issues Eliminated</h2>



<p>It’s a huge time for Escape from Tarkov. The game is finally graduating from the beta state it has sat in for almost eight years, becoming a full release and landing on Steam, amongst other things. The super-sized update introduces a new map, a non-linear campaign, fresh weapons, and more than 1,000 bug fixes.</p>



<p>In the most recent episode <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/battlestategames" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">of Tarkov TV</a>, Nikita also confirmed that a huge investment has been made in the game’s server capacity and infrastructure, and that the server makeup has been <strong>tripled </strong>ahead of launch.</p>



<p>This was preceded by a tongue-in-cheek reference by Nikita that begged players not to ‘overload their servers, please.’</p>







<p>Every time a major update has hit the Escape from Tarkov ecosystem, it has led to massive server queues and instability, placated only by users inevitably drifting away because of those issues.</p>



<p>The 1.0 update of Escape from Tarkov arrives after more than a decade of development, which has seen the face of the spearhead extraction shooter evolve numerous times.</p>
