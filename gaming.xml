            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>

<p>Our good friends over at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_9EQ02fVA8">Digital Foundry</a> have delivered their tech review of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tomb-raider-definitive-edition">Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition</a>, which shadow dropped onto Switch 1 and 2 last week, and it's something of a mixed bag.</p>
<p>Starting on a positive note, the Switch 2 version of the game sets out to hit 60fps, and it does so <em>c</em><em>onsistently</em>. DF's Thomas Morgan notes that he noticed "barely any drops" when playing in either handheld or docked modes, so that's a big bonus for fans of smoothness.</p>
<p>What's more, the Switch/Switch 2 'Definitive Edition' boasts many of the re-release 'pros' over the PS3 original — upgraded textures, foliage placement, colour grading, etc. — and renders at 1920x1080p resolution in docked (similarly hits 1080p in handheld). Nice.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are some pretty glaring visual omissions in the Switch version to get things running at the specs outlined above. Shadow density is pulled way back, foliage thickness is reduced, the advanced TRESSFX for Lara's hair is MIA, and many of the cutscenes' cinematics are dialled down for simplicity.</p>
<p>It falls behind the Definitive Edition's PS4 release, in this instance, but strangely, there are select points where the Switch 2 version is even a step back from the PS3 original. There are no screen-splat rain effects, the geometry is more simplistic, and even shadow coverage is a bit of a downgrade. It should be noted that these cutbacks <em>also</em> apply to the PS4 re-release, but, as the DF video states, "the drawbacks are disappointing, given the multi-generational divide between the systems".</p>
<p>For those wondering about the Switch 1 version, the older system runs things at 30fps (sometimes dipping into the 20s in demanding cutscenes), with a "surprisingly respectable" 864p-900p. Many of the visuals are matched between the systems, and while Switch 1 does see a further drop in shadow quality, it "holds up much better than you might expect," according to DF.</p>

			<p>CD Projekt RED reported its latest financial results today with its <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/pl/wp-content/uploads-pl/2025/11/prezentacja-wynikowa-q3-2025-en.pdf">third-quarter 2025 earnings report</a>. The report included a couple of notable updates on the studio's ongoing projects and a significant update about the studio's most infamous release, Cyberpunk 2077. </p>



<p>After what no one will deny was an absolutely disastrous launch, true to its word and commitment to try and right its wrongs, CD Projekt RED has overhauled and patched Cyberpunk 2077 to the point where the game has now sold <strong>35 million copies</strong> since it launched in December 2020. </p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Cyberpunk-2077-Hit-35-Million-Copies-Sold-Nov-2025.png"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: CD Projekt RED</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>This announcement comes almost exactly a year to the day after CD Projekt RED announced Cyberpunk 2077 <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-has-sold-over-30-million-units-says-cdpr/">had reached 30 million copies sold</a>. </p>



<p>No one will soon forget how, in 2020, CD Projekt RED withheld PS4 and Xbox One copies of Cyberpunk 2077 from reviewers ahead of launch, only handing out PC copies pre-release in an attempt to mask how poorly it ran on those previous-gen consoles and protect its pre-orders, and the backlash that followed. </p>



<p>That said, now that we're almost five years out from that disaster, even though it took CD Projekt RED three years to release the <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-2-0-update-release-date/">Cyberpunk 2077 2.0 patch</a>, we're arguably at the point where we can say CD Projekt RED has earned the ability not to be forever judged for Cyberpunk 2077's 2020 launch.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>Though the real test of whether players can really trust CD Projekt RED again will come with the release of its next major title, The Witcher 4. Its launch will likely be the difference maker between whether players entirely abandon CDPR or start to really trust the developer again.</p>



<p>Speaking of The Witcher 4, work on the return of CDPR's other major franchise has continued to be the company's main focus, with 447 developers all working on it. Meanwhile, the percentage of developers working on the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel continues to scale up, with 135 developers now spread out between the studio's Vancouver, Warsaw, and Boston branches, <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-will-do-better-justice-to-its-settings-americana-thanks-to-the-new-boston-studio-says-cdpr/">the latter of which was opened specifically to work on the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel</a>.</p>



<p>Once The Witcher 4 is out the door, we can expect to see more of the company move to working on Project Orion, which is the given code name for the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel, which CDPR has also begun calling "<em>Cyberpunk 2</em>."</p>

<p>"<em>We are very happy and satisfied with the fact that - despite the passage of time - Cyberpunk 2077 remains such a well performing title and continues to attract new players</em>," said Michał Nowakowski, joint chief executive officer of CD Projekt RED in today's presentation. "<em>Sales of the game have exceeded 35 million copies, which testifies to the franchise's enduring power and enables us to be even more audacious about charting its future</em>."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, the <em>Fighting Fantasy</em> Set 2 Kickstarter campaign went live. The campaign aims to reprint five more of the iconic solo adventuring book series. It has already reached its initial funding goal.</p>

<h2>The <em>Fighting Fantasy</em> Set 2 Kickstarter Campaign</h2>

<p>As the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sjgames/fighting-fantasy-solo-adventure-gamebooks-back-in-print" rel="nofollow">campaign page</a> states, the <em>Fighting Fantasy</em> Set 2 Kickstarter goal is to release updated versions of books 6-10 in the <em>Fighting Fantasy</em> series. This campaign is part of a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/fighting-fantasy-solo-adventure-rpg-series-returns-to-us-through-steve-jackson-games" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">publishing agreement</a> signed by series co-creators Sir Ian Livingstone and Steve Jackson with Steve Jackson games to reprint the books in the United States.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fighting-fantasy-set-2-book-display.jpg?itok=Rjn5pTab 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fighting-fantasy-set-2-book-display.jpg?itok=dqxGFUPM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The campaign even opens with Steve Jackson Games applauding the fan response to their first Kickstarter campaign for reprinting set 1, saying it was the most successful crowdfunding campaign in the company's history.</p>

<p>But <em>Fighting Fantasy</em> Set 2 isn't just a reprint of the original 1980s books. The books will still feature the original artwork, but the formatting has been updated and the text size has been increased for easy reading. Finally, each book has a unified design, complete with numbered spines. Each book is around 224-384 pages and is approximately&nbsp;5.0625" x 7.8125", emulating the UK's B-format size.</p>

<p>The pledge tiers for <em>Fighting Fantasy</em> Set 2 are small and straightforward. If you want a single book from Set 2, it will cost you $15. If you want the full five-book set, that is $60. For the most pristine version, there is the slipcase set for $80. The campaign also includes several add-ons including books from <em>Fighting Fantasy</em> Set 1, and similar books from other series like <em>Choose Cthulhu</em>, and <em>The Fantasy Trip</em>.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, the <em>Fighting Fantasy</em> Set 2 Kickstarter campaign has raised&nbsp;<span><span>$106,836, more than four times its initial funding goal of $25,000. The campaign ends December 31 and books are expected to ship on July 2026.</span></span></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cyberpunk-2077-sales-35m-sequel-work</link>
            <guid>1365745</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>CD Projekt Red has revealed that its open-world action RPG&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>has hit a new sales milestone, and that work on the sequel is ramping up in earnest.</p>

<p>As part of its latest Q3 financial results presentation, the Polish studio says that&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>sales have now passed 35 million, a figure that includes standalone sales and those racked up as part of the Ultimate Edition bundle (which includes the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-release-date-revealed" rel="nofollow"><em>Phantom Liberty&nbsp;</em>expansion</a>).</p>

<p>The new figure means that&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>has sold another five million copies <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cyberpunk-2077-sales-witcher-production" rel="nofollow">since November last year</a>, which is a pretty impressive achievement for a game that was released five years ago (although CD Projekt Red clearly very much considers the game a going concern).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cyberpunk-2077-sales-35m-bike.jpg?itok=usilwnmp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cyberpunk-2077-sales-35m-bike.jpg?itok=pYos0TMt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>has hit 35 million sales, and it's still going strong.</figcaption></figure><p>The presentation also reveals that CD Projekt Red has allocated another 19 staffers to work on&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2&nbsp;</em>since July this year, and that a number of new staff have been added in areas like localization and motion capture across the company as well.</p>

<p>Work on the new&nbsp;<em>Witcher&nbsp;</em>game also continues in earnest, although only three more developers have been hired to work on that project since July. It's likely to be a while before we hear more about&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/witcher-4-official-reveal" rel="nofollow"><em>The Witcher 4</em></a>, although whether that or&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2&nbsp;</em>will be officially unveiled first remains to be seen.</p>

<p>Across the company, sales are up when compared to the same period last year, mainly driven by increased sales of&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>; franchise sales for&nbsp;<em>The Witcher&nbsp;</em>have fallen since then, although the release of the Switch 2, along with its&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>port, probably <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-third-party-game-launch-sales-report" rel="nofollow">helped in that area</a>.</p>

<p>Profits are up as well, and when looking at the year to date as a whole, CD Projekt Red's numbers are looking pretty healthy. Whether the company can sustain that health remains to be seen, however, especially with no new games imminently on the horizon.</p>




<p>We'll probably have to wait a while for new info about&nbsp;<em>The Witcher 4&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2</em>, but in the meantime, you can check out CD Projekt's full financial presentation for the third quarter of its fiscal year <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/pl/wp-content/uploads-pl/2025/11/prezentacja-wynikowa-q3-2025-en.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Almost Twenty Years On, Beyond Good and Evil 2 Is Still in Development as New Job Listings Emerge]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/beyond-good-and-evil-2-new-job-postings</link>
            <guid>1365742</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has posted several new job listings for&nbsp;<em>Beyond Good and Evil 2</em>, which means that almost twenty years after its original announcement, the long-awaited action-adventure game is still in development, although probably no closer to release.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://frvr.com/blog/ubisoft-is-still-working-on-beyond-good-and-evil-2-as-new-job-listings-pop-up-after-years-of-development-hell/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">FRVR</a>, new job listings on the Ubisoft <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/company/careers/search?query=beyond%2520good%2520and%2520evil%25202" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>&nbsp;are calling for a lead quest designer, a VFX artist, and a technical lead network programmer, among others, to work on the company's beleaguered sequel.</p>

<p>According to the listings,&nbsp;<em>Beyond Good and Evil 2&nbsp;</em>is still being built in the Voyager engine, which, as far as we know, hasn't yet been used for any other Ubisoft games. It was developed as a proprietary engine for use within&nbsp;<em>Beyond Good and Evil 2&nbsp;</em>itself.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/beyond-good-and-evil-2-job-listings-gameplay.jpg?itok=0x7f52Ga 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/beyond-good-and-evil-2-job-listings-gameplay.jpg?itok=QL_oWnKG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Beyond Good and Evil 2&nbsp;</em>is still in development...somehow.</figcaption></figure><p>The last time Ubisoft provided an update on&nbsp;<em>Beyond Good and Evil 2&nbsp;</em>was in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/beyond-good-and-evil-2-gets-new-creative-director" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">October last year</a>, when a new creative lead, Fawzi Mesmar, stepped in to replace Emile Morel, who sadly passed away in 2023 of unknown causes.</p>

<p>It's been a very long and very strange journey for&nbsp;<em>Beyond Good and Evil 2&nbsp;</em>thus far. The project was originally announced during E3 in 2008, but subsequently underwent a lengthy period of radio silence before being <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-e3-2017-beyond-good-and-evil-2" rel="nofollow">reintroduced in 2017</a>.</p>

<p>Ubisoft subsequently drip-fed more information about the game in the ensuing years, including info about its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/beyond-good-and-evil-2-devs-show-off-ships-staff-combat" rel="nofollow">combat</a>, details about its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/beyond-good-and-evil-2-livestream-shares-new-world-details" rel="nofollow">world</a>, and confirmation that since it had seamless multiplayer elements, the game would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/beyond-good-and-evil-2-q-reveals-online-connection-required-for-game" rel="nofollow">require an online connection</a> to play.</p>

<p>Since then, however, things have been very quiet on the&nbsp;<em>Beyond Good and Evil 2&nbsp;</em>front; original lead Michel Ancel departed not only the project, but video games as a whole <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/beyond-good-and-evil-2-lead-michel-ancel-leaves-video-games" rel="nofollow">back in 2020</a>, although Ubisoft said at the time that he hadn't been "directly involved" with the game for some time upon his departure.</p>




<p>Whether these job listings amount to a new announcement anytime soon remains to be seen, but for now, there's no indication that Ubisoft is even remotely ready to re-re-re-announce&nbsp;<em>Beyond Good and Evil 2</em>. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ecoflow-decided-profit-doesnt-matter-1800w-power-station-hits-new-all-time-low-for-winter-backup-2000647635</link>
            <guid>1365715</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Winter power outages strike more frequently than most people realize with ice storms, heavy snow and equipment failures leaving homes without electricity for hours or days at critical moments. Having backup power transforms these emergencies from stressful crises into manageable inconveniences by keeping essential appliances running.</p>
<p>EcoFlow specializes in portable power stations that bridge the gap between small battery banks and expensive whole-home generators and delivers practical backup capacity without professional installation. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5693/">At $349, down from $699, the Delta 2 has hit a record-low price</a> on Amazon for Black Friday while <strong>being EcoFlow’s bestselling model across several years</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5693/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The 1800W Output Powers Real Appliances</h2>
<p>The<strong> constant 1800W AC power with an accompanying surge power of 2700W</strong> enables the operation of genuine household electronics such as full-sized refrigerators, microwave ovens, space heaters, and medical electronics, beyond the capability of smaller power stations. The power offered here almost competes with the power offered by conventional gas-generators whose use has long been hamstrung by the need for gas tanks, the resultant air pollution, and the lack of quiet operation.</p>



<p>In the event of power outage during the cold seasons, the Delta 2 can power a furnace blower motor, light a refrigerator in order to save the food, and recharge mobile and laptop collections all at the same time. The <strong>use of all the available 15 outlets, ranging from the AC, USB-A, USB-C, and DC ports</strong>&nbsp;enables the operation of all the needed electronics.</p>



<p>The <strong>Delta 2 takes only 50 minutes to charge from empty to 80%</strong> and this has changed the way you now prepare in advance when there are forecasts of storms and unexpected power outages. Conventional portable power stations need 6-8 hours to fully recharge, and this means you could be left in the dark when there are forecasts of storm power outages and when the brief periods offered when the power may be restored are not sufficient for recharging.</p>
<p>The lithium-ion battery chemistry, LiFePO4, has an extraordinary lifespan<strong>, boasting 3000+ charge cycles and retention levels over 80% capacity</strong>, estimated at about 10 years. Another advantage the LiFePO4 battery chemistry boasts over other lithium-ion batteries is increased safety. The battery management system constantly monitors voltage, current, and temperatures in all the cells and <strong>protects against overcharge, over-discharge, overcurrent, and short-circuit conditions.</strong></p>
<p>While the EcoFlow Delta 2 normally costs $349, you can get this power solution with 1800W, 50-minute fast charging and long-lasting LiFePO4 battery technology at an unbelievable price this Black Friday.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-review-in-progress-1851777402"><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i></a> <span>looks primed to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-goty-nominees-categories-clair-obscur-2000644825"><span>take several awards home at The Game Awards next month</span></a><span>. Sandfall Interactive’s turn-based RPG has </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/indie-game-awards-iga-igf-gdc-clair-obscur-expedition-33-2000644070"><span>several nominations across multiple categories</span></a><span>, including the big one: Game of the Year. One category it is most represented in is Best Performance, which features three members of its English voice cast, one of whom has sparked a surprising conversation about how we recognize performances in video games.</span></p> <p><i><span>Daredevil </span></i><span>actor Charlie Cox, the voice behind </span><i><span>Clair Obscur</span></i><span>’s gunslinging false protagonist, admits that he wasn’t as involved in the game as other members of the cast. He spent a few hours in the booth and was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-charlie-cox-gustave-voice-1851784940"><span>surprised to hear just how much people loved his character</span></a><span>. Back in July, he </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-cox-clair-obscur-expedition-33-gustave-actor-1851786701"><span>admitted he still hadn’t played the game yet, either</span></a><span>. Now that his performance as Gustave has been nominated for an award, Cox seems hesitant to take any of the credit.</span></p>

 <p><span>During a Q&amp;A segment at the La Conve 64 event in Mexico, Cox said that any credit he gets for his voice performance should be given to Gustave’s motion capture actor.</span></p> <p><span>“I’m thrilled for this nomination,” Cox said. “I’ve said this before, and I think it’s important to say, there’s an amazing French actor by the name of Maxence Cazorla who did almost all of the motion capture for that role in that game. So any nomination or any credit I get, I really have to give to him because I kind of believe that the performance of that character is really down to him, and my voice is just part of that process.”</span></p>

   <p><span>Cazoria has since responded to Cox’s sentiment on his </span><a href="https://x.com/maxence_cazorla/status/1993339680608465405?s=20"><span>X account</span></a><span>, saying that the actor’s words were appreciated, but bringing Gustave to life was a team effort.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thank you for all the messages these past few days.<br>Charlie’s words were incredibly generous, and I’m truly grateful 🙏<br>Bringing Gustave to life was a team effort, and I’m honored to have played my part in it.<br>Thank you all so much for the love and support 🌹🤍<br>Tomorrow comes ✨</p> <p>— Maxence Cazorla (@maxence_cazorla) <a href="https://twitter.com/maxence_cazorla/status/1993339680608465405?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 25, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Notably, Cazoria was also the motion capture for Renoir and Verso. Ben Starr, who provided the English dub for Verso, is also nominated in the Best Performance category, as well as Jennifer English for her role as Maelle. Cazoria may not be the name many English-speaking players associate with these characters, but as Cox points out, the motion capture artists deserve credit for helping bring these characters to life.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Is there a future where The Game Awards recognizes motion capture actors separately from voice actors? Some industry professionals, like </span><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3 </span></i><span>performance director Aliona Baranova, sure hope so.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">yup, i think we should have a motion capture category at awards shows <a href="https://t.co/6vYaLwXU7X">https://t.co/6vYaLwXU7X</a></p> <p>— Aliona Baranova (@alionabaranova1) <a href="https://twitter.com/alionabaranova1/status/1993588077508673841?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>I would be surprised if The Game Awards bothers to make that distinction. The show already has a propensity to imperfectly lump categories together, such as discontinuing the Best Shooter category to put those games in the Best Action Game pile. But maybe as the industry becomes more aware of how many moving parts make up a whole character like Gustave, award shows will find ways to recognize everyone involved, rather than just the person behind the voice.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[The 10 Best Kirby Games]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-kirby-games</link>
            <guid>1365706</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Kirby has been so many different things since he first floated into our lives in 1992. Besides his dozens of transforming copy abilities, he’s been split into four differently-colored Kirbys, turned into yarn, warped into a ball we controlled on the DS touch screen, and so much more. And now that he’s hopped back on the Warp Star with the release of Kirby Air Riders on Nintendo Switch 2, we thought it was the perfect time to look back at the history of the pink puffball. Here are IGN’s top ten Kirby games of all time.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">10. Kirby and the Amazing Mirror</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/26/kirby-and-the-amazing-mirror-1764139672803.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Two iconic Nintendo heroes were split into four different versions of themselves on the Game Boy Advance: Link in The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords and Kirby in Kirby and the Amazing Mirror. The latter is a 2004 GBA platformer that took advantage of the system’s link cable functionality to allow four players to adventure together, calling each other on a cellphone to regroup if they ever got split up. Just make sure the batteries don’t run out! And even if you played Amazing Mirror on your own, it stands out thanks to its lite Metroidvania setup. Rather than adventure through linear levels like pretty much every other Kirby platformer, Amazing Mirror’s branching paths let players explore levels in different orders at their own pace. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">9. Kirby’s Dream Land 2</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/26/kirbys-dream-land-2-1764139873589.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Before becoming an industry celebrity thanks to the Super Smash Bros. series, Masahiro Sakurai directed the humble Kirby’s Dream Land on Game Boy. Back in those days, Kirby was white instead of pink (at least on the North American box art), and he didn’t have copy abilities! But the 1995 Game Boy sequel, Kirby’s Dream Land 2, improved on everything the first game set up, bringing Kirby Adventure’s copy abilities into the fold, and introducing the iconic rideable animal friends like Rick the hamster. It’s a classic example of a bigger, better sequel, and our pick for the best game in Kirby’s original Dream Land trilogy, even though we really love the pastel art style of Dream Land 3 on Super Nintendo.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">8. Kirby: Triple Deluxe</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/26/kirby-triple-deluxe-1764139983972.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Kirby’s debut outing on 3DS took full advantage of the handheld’s screen, as Kirby: Triple Deluxe (a wordier way to say Kirby: 3D) sees Kirby platforming in the foreground and background in very unique ways. Its main hook is the Hypernova ability, which makes Kirby suck harder than he’s ever sucked before, essentially turning his stomach into a black hole. This is used in all sorts of clever puzzles, including one level where Kirby eats an entire train like it’s a light snack. It also introduced one of my favorite subgames in the series: Dedede’s Drum Dash, a rhythm game where Kirby’s best frenemy bounces to the beat in stages set to familiar Kirby tunes.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">7. Kirby: Nightmare in Dreamland</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/26/kirby-nightmare-in-dreamland-1764140118083.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Kirby’s Adventure is an important entry in the franchise, as it’s responsible for introducing copy abilities. And it wasn’t just two or three; Adventure came out swinging with more than 20 different powers for Kirby to steal from enemies, setting the blueprint for every Kirby game to come. It also established both minigames and Kirby’s longtime rival, Meta Knight, as staples for the series. This NES classic got remade as Kirby: Nightmare in Dream Land on the GBA in 2002, which we’re picking as the definitive version because of its improved controls and additional content it brought with it, like the bonus Meta Knightmare mode, where you can play the whole campaign as Meta Knight — another new wrinkle that would become commonplace in future Kirby games,. But shoutout to the NES Kirby’s Adventure cover, where Kirby is literally eating the box art and revealing the endless void that lies underneath.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">6. Kirby’s Epic Yarn</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/26/kirbys-epic-yarn-1764140224078.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Kirby’s Epic Yarn is probably the easiest game on this list – which is saying a lot, given the general approachability of almost all of the Kirby series – but it’s also one of the most charming. Developed by Good-Feel instead of series steward HAL Laboratory, Kirby’s Epic Yarn transforms the pink sphere into, you guessed it, yarn, completely changing the aesthetic and overall gameplay. There aren’t traditional copy abilities – instead, this Kirby simply morphs himself into a yarn submarine, car, or parachute as he travels with the adorable Prince Fluff through an arts and crafts-themed world. It’s relaxing, beautiful, and fits in right alongside the best Kirby games despite being so different.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">5. Kirby Air Riders</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/13/kirbythumbono-1763069064246.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Kirby Air Riders is only a few days old, but it’s already one of the all-time franchise greats. After more than two decades away, Masahiro Sakurai returned to the franchise he created to take another crack at Kirby Air Ride, which was a fun but somewhat underbaked experiment back on the GameCube. And Sakurai didn’t let any part of this second chance go to waste, creating a definitive sequel that feels like the ultimate realization of its simplistic one-button racing formula. Air Riders is packed with modes, unlockables, and tons of little details that show how much love and attention went into its development. The racing is frantic and fun, but the star of the show is still City Trial; the battle mode / collectathon hybrid that’s a wonderful throwback to local multiplayer modes from the N64 and GameCube days. Its unconventional controls aren’t going to be for everyone, but if you go along for the ride, you’ll find a fantastic Kirby game that’s brilliantly unique.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">4. Kirby’s Return to Dreamland Deluxe</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/26/kirbys-return-to-dreamland-deluxe-1764140399062.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Return to Dreamland on Wii was the first traditional home console Kirby platformer since Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards (which we love but narrowly missed out on our top 10). It delivered the classic Kirby adventuring fans were craving, but introduced fun new copy abilities like Leaf and Water, had multiple well-hidden collectibles to track down in each level, tasked players with mastering every copy ability in its challenge rooms, and a lot more. Most importantly, it’s a blast in local multiplayer, allowing up to four friends to play the entire campaign together as either Kirby, King Dedede, Meta Knight, or Bandana Waddle Dee. Return to Dreamland got a fantastic deluxe treatment on Nintendo Switch, adding a bonus epilogue and a ton of returning subgames from across the series, complete with dozens of achievements to chase, so we’ve gone with that version here.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">3. Kirby Super Star Ultra</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/26/kirby-super-star-ultra-1764140526170.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Sakurai is known for stuffing his games full of side modes that all build around the same gameplay foundations, and that tradition started in Kirby Super Star, the Super Nintendo classic that hosted a small handful of bite-sized adventures to run through. These were repackaged and expanded upon in the excellent DS remake, Super Star Ultra, which brought everything back and added even more, continuing the tradition of a Meta Knight campaign established in Nightmare in Dreamland. Super Star’s biggest strength, though, is its sheer variety: collecting every last treasure in The Great Cave Offensive, racing to eat more treats than Dedede in Gourmet Race, or infiltrating the Halberd as terrified crewmates discuss the best way to stop Kirby. Every mode offers its own flavor, and it all comes together to create the strongest game of Kirby’s early days.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">2. Kirby and the Forgotten Land</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/26/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-1764140743065.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Every game series takes a different approach when transitioning from 2D to 3D, and fittingly for this franchise, Kirby kept things delightfully simple by keeping its formula largely intact as it made the jump. Kirby and the Forgotten Land is a fantastic realization of classic Kirby platforming in a 3D space. Kirby hops, floats, and dodges just like you’d think he would, and the upgradeable copy abilities work seamlessly. Its most memorable new addition is Mouthful Mode, which lets Kirby wrap his enormous mouth around a car, staircase, or even a vending machine, making for fun puzzle platforming that proves this isn’t just a retread of Kirby’s greatest hits. The Forgotten Land also takes some inspiration from the 3D platforming greats, such as Super Mario and Banjo-Kazooie, by sprinkling hidden collectibles and secret objectives across every level, and it’s a joy for completionists to hunt down every last Waddle Dee to send back to town. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">1. Kirby Planet Robobot</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/26/kirby-planet-robobot-1764140874873.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The best Kirby game of them all is Kirby: Planet Robobot, an unassuming sequel to Triple Deluxe on 3DS that turned out to be his finest adventure. That’s largely thanks to the Robobot armor, a hulking mech suit Kirby pilots across the campaign, complete with its own unique copy abilities. While Triple Deluxe’s Hypernova and Return to Dreamland’s Super abilities felt more like gimmicks relegated to setpiece moments, the Robobot armor is seamlessly integrated into the stages, leading to fantastic puzzles with the most depth, variety, and challenge in the series, especially if you’re trying to collect everything. Robobot expands upon Triple Deluxe’s foreground and background platforming and features some of the coolest settings in the series, as a mechanized Planet Popstar is just a great idea that ties each world together. Robobot is an absolute treat, and we can only hope that Nintendo rereleases it on Switch or Switch 2 sometime soon so more people can experience the best Kirby game of them all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There you have it – IGN’s top ten Kirby games of all time.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Cyberpunk 2077 has sold a whopping 35 million copies, CD Projekt has announced. Sales of the five-year-old sci-fi action RPG were boosted recently by its release on the Nintendo Switch 2 as well as Mac devices.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reporting its latest financial results, chief financial officer Piotr Nielubowicz confirmed that Cyberpunk 2077 had reached 35 million copies ahead of The Witcher 3 in the same period since its release. Cyberpunk is currently CD Projekt’s main source of revenue, Nielubowicz added, due to the expansion of the game's availability. Cyberpunk was also added to PlayStation Plus, boosting new players and further encouraging sales of the expansion, Phantom Liberty.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In its financial briefing, CD Projekt said it was “laying the foundations” for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/cyberpunk-2">Cyberpunk 2</a>, outlining plans to scale up its development teams in Boston, Warsaw, and Vancouver and through to the end of 2027. 135 people were working on Cyberpunk 2 as of October 31, 2025, up from 116 at the end of July.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We know very little about Cyberpunk 2, although in May, Cyberpunk creator <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-project-orion-has-night-city-and-another-city-that-feels-like-chicago-gone-wrong-mike-pondsmith-teases"><u>Mike Pondsmith teased some previously unknown details</u></a> when he was asked about the scope of his involvement with what was then known as Project Orion, back at the Digital Dragons 2025 conference.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pondsmith admitted he wasn’t as involved this time around, but said he had reviewed scripts and had been to CD Projekt to check out the ongoing work.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Last week I was wandering around talking to different departments, and seeing what they had, ‘Oh look, this is the new cyberware, what do you think?’ ‘Oh yeah, that’s pretty good, that works here.’"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And then, the morsel on the sequel: that it features a brand new city in addition to the Night City we know from Cyberpunk 2077. Pondsmith described this new city as “like Chicago gone wrong.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I spent a lot of time talking to one of the environment guys, and he was explaining how the new place in Orion, because there’s another city we visit — I’m not telling you any more than that but there’s another city we visit. And Night City is still there. But I remember looking at it and going, yeah I understand the feel you’re going for this, and this really does work. And it doesn’t feel like Blade Runner, it feels more like Chicago gone wrong. I said, ‘Yeah, I can see this working.'”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Cyberpunk Switch 2 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth pointing out that Pondsmith’s comments do not necessarily suggest the Cyberpunk sequel will feature a future Chicago, rather a city that has the feel of a dystopian version of the city. It may well be a take on future Chicago, but that isn’t confirmed based on these comments. There is also some debate about whether Cyberpunk 2 will expand upon the Night City that’s in Cyberpunk 2077 or feature a new version, and the extent to which it is playable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In September, speaking with IGN while promoting his movie Good Fortune, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/johnny-silverhand-actor-keanu-reeves-says-he-absolutely-wants-to-be-in-cyberpunk-2">Keanu Reeves said that he wanted to be part of the sequel to CD Projekt's 2020 game</a>. “Absolutely. I’d love to play Johnny Silverhand again," Reeves said when asked if he’d be interested in revisiting his legendary rockstar terrorist character in Cyberpunk 2. Pondsmith later said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/contact-me-cyberpunk-creator-mike-pondsmith-tells-keanu-reeves-he-has-ways-to-bring-johnny-silverhand-back-from-the-dead-for-cyberpunk-2">he'd worked out a way to make it make sense</a>, and has told the much-loved actor: “contact me.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It sounds like we'll have to wait some time to find out. CD Projekt is of course focusing on The Witcher 4, and CD Projekt co-CEO Michał Nowakowski has suggested Cyberpunk 2 won’t be out until at least 2030. According to the company's latest official figures, 447 staff were working on The Witcher 4 — a figure slightly up from the previous quarter. Overall, CD Projekt enjoyed strong revenue and profits as its games continue to sell.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>If you're hunting for the best offers this week, we're actively rounding up the strongest Black Friday deals on video games, tech, and more.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Cyberpunk 2077 Is A Good Showcase For The Switch 2</p>
      </div>
<p><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/cyberpunk-2077-has-now-sold-35-million-copies-hitting-the-milestone-faster-than-the-witcher-3-did/#google_vignette" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC reminded us</a> that The Witcher 3 needed about six years to achieve 30 million in sales, so Cyberpunk 2077 is selling at a faster rate. Cyberpunk 2077's Phantom Liberty expansion, meanwhile, has sold more than 10 million units. The Witcher 3 went on to sell <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-best-selling-video-games-of-all-time/2900-4814/#1" data-ref-id="2900-4814">more than 60 million units</a> to become one of the top 10 best-selling games of all time.</p><p>Cyberpunk 2077's launch in December 2020 was so problematic that the game was removed from sale on the PlayStation Store due its bugs and issues, and<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sold-13-7-million-copies-in-21-days-30000-people-got-refunds/1100-6490486/" data-ref-id="1100-6490486"> CD Projekt processed thousands of refunds</a>. However, despite the issues, the RPG sold <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sells-13-million-copies-at-launch/1100-6485743/" data-ref-id="1100-6485743">more than 13 million units out of the gate </a>to become one of the fastest-selling RPGs in history. Executives at the developer benefitted, too, with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cd-projekt-bosses-set-to-receive-big-bonuses-despite-cyberpunk-2077-launch-problems" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the top bosses earning millions in bonuses.</a></p><p>CD Projekt vowed at the time to update and improve Cyberpunk 2077, and the company delivered on what many are calling <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/watch-gamespots-cyberpunk-2077-documentary-to-get-an-inside-look-at-the-turnaround/1100-6519512/" data-ref-id="1100-6519512">one of the best comeback stories ever for a high-profile game. </a>Things culminated in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-2-0-update-rebuilds-its-gameplay-to-make-a-fantastic-rpg/1100-6517704/" data-ref-id="1100-6517704">Cyberpunk 2077 2.0 release in 2023.</a></p><p>The game expanded to a new place, the Switch 2, when it launched on Nintendo's console back in June. Following the huge success of Cyberpunk 2077, CD Projekt announced a sequel, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6526333/" data-ref-id="1100-6526333">Cyberpunk 2</a>, which is now in the works at the company's new office in Boston alongside teams in Warsaw and Vancouver.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4612508-screenshot2025-11-26at12.23.19%E2%80%AFpm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4612508" data-ratio="0.55892255892256" data-width="891" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4612508-screenshot2025-11-26at12.23.19%E2%80%AFpm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4612508"></a><figcaption>Cyberpunk 2's dev team is expected to grow.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4612508-screenshot2025-11-26at12.23.19%E2%80%AFpm.png"></figure><p>In CD Projekt's earnings release, the company said had 135 people working on the game as of October 31, which was up from 116 at the end of July. The bulk of the studio's workers are assigned to The Witcher 4 at the moment, with 447 people working on the game (up from 444).</p><p>As you can see in the chart above, CD Projekt plans to significantly ramp up the size of the teams working on Cyberpunk 2 in the years to come, aiming to scale to 300+ by 2027. People are taking this to mean that Cyberpunk 2 won't launch before 2028, but nothing is clear at this point.</p><p>Beyond Cyberpunk 2 and The Witcher 4, CD Projekt is working on a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cd-projekt-red-fully-absorbed-the-studio-making-a-multiplayer-the-witcher-game/1100-6530719/" data-ref-id="1100-6530719">multiplayer Witcher game</a>, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cd-projekt-red-new-ip-everything-we-know/1100-6529021/" data-ref-id="1100-6529021">new IP in the works under the codename Hadar</a>, and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-remake-everything-we-know-about-the-open-world-remake-of-the-classic-rpg/1100-6528839/" data-ref-id="1100-6528839">remake of the original Witcher.</a> The studio is also making a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-dev-partners-with-pokemon-go-owner-for-a-new-game-based-on-its-ip/1100-6530370/" data-ref-id="1100-6530370">new game based on one of CD Projekt's IPs with Saudi Arabia's Scopely. </a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/plants-vs-zombies-replanted">Plants vs Zombies: Replanted</a> is exactly what it says on the tin. Zombies are invading and the only hope against them is a crop of… well, crops. You’ll need to plant an entire plant army to prevent the zombie hoard from entering your home. It’s a simple, if not rather iconic, premise.</p>
<p>I never actually had the chance to play Plants vs Zombies growing up. My only exposure to the franchise has been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/plants_vs_zombies_battle_for_neighborville_complete_edition">the hero-shooter spin-offs</a>. Thankfully, this Replanted edition has breathed life back into the game to offer a way for players like me to experience this cult classic properly for the first time. It’s worked well for the most part; I’ve greatly enjoyed my time with Replanted, even if it stumbles in a few areas.</p>

<p>It’s worth noting the amount of gameplay content you get for your buck. From the main campaign, which is itself fairly meaty, to new minigames to even a puzzle mode, there’s a lot packed into this gem of brain-hungry, botanical tower defence.</p>
<p>The unlockable minigames are a blast. Walnut Bowling is self-explanatory, but modes like ZomBotony — where you’re attacked by plant-zombie hybrids— spin gameplay mechanics around on their heads. And if that’s not enough, there’s also a puzzle mode where you have to think strategically about card placement to clear vases.</p>
<p>There’s also an unlockable co-op mode (that I unfortunately wasn’t able to test as I had no one to play with), and those with a partner will be able to do head-to-head PvP matches, with one player on the side of the zombies. You’ll get hours of replayable fun and I’m surprised by how much I’ve enjoyed it all. The tower defence gameplay is as strong as ever, and I love having to carefully prep my cards (i.e. units) to best battle waves after waves of zombies.</p>

<p>My strategy tended to change between battles. Some plants can spray through screen doors, which makes them essential for battles with zombies sporting screen doors. But then you also have to consider which plant you want to use for resource generation and whether you want walnuts to act as a buffer, or maybe protect your crops with landmines. Those kinds of options helped keep the flow of combat feeling fresh and made me get out of my comfort zone to test new strategies.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there was initially more trouble in the neighbourhood than just the hordes of undead ghouls. As Felix mentioned <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zik-Cx7oxQE">in his video</a>, the optional mouse controls were downright abysmal at launch, and the touchscreen controls didn’t fare much better - at least until <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/plants-vs-zombies-replanted-rolls-out-more-updates-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">patches</a> adjusted things (and also restored the original dynamic audio and implemented a whole load of sound effect fixes which dogged the game on release day).</p>
<p>Previously, trying to use the mouse controls resulted in a headache, as it was so sensitive that it quickly switched back to standard controls the second you lifted the controller. Meanwhile, planting in touchscreen was a letdown because the sprites followed you as if they were stuck to your finger once you selected a unit.</p>
<figure><a title="Plants vs. Zombies: Replanted Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160078/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The ball definitely got dropped in this area, and those <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/plants-vs-zombies-replanted-rolls-out-more-updates-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">post-release patches</a> haven’t totally solved things for me, especially in touchscreen mode. It still feels clunky and difficult to control, sometimes slowing on-screen action to a glitchy crawl and ultimately making me question the inclusion of the control scheme in the first place.</p>
<p>There’s also <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/strategy/amidst-allegations-of-ai-art-and-complaints-about-the-music-plants-vs-zombies-fans-are-not-happy-with-the-remaster/">allegations of AI usage in the game</a>, which — at the risk of sounding like I’m soapboxing — is downright messy if true.</p>
<p>That aside, the overall package is still a blast to play. It doesn’t take very long before the 'just one more level' addictiveness begins to take hold. This is helped by the number of units you unlock, all of which have a quirky charm and cute design. <em>Of</em> <em>course</em> the basic attacking unit is called a Pea Shooter, and <em>of course</em> the icy variant is a Frozen Pea Shooter. You can’t beat those kinds of puns! It’s a game that’s guaranteed to make even the most cold-hearted gamer crack a smile.</p>
<figure><a title="Plants vs. Zombies: Replanted Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160085/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Plants vs Zombies: Replanted also comes with some quality-of-life improvements. One of the best new features is the ability to fast-forward the gameplay up to 2.5x speed. By default, these are the slow shambling type of zombies and there’s normally a long, slow gap between waves. But with the press of a button, they speed up to <strong>World War Z</strong> levels of fast. It makes playing feel more fluid and smooth; it also adds another layer of challenge for those who might find the standard gameplay flow too easy.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Overall, I find myself really loving Plants vs. Zombies: Replanted. Its cute and quirky character designs are infectiously charming, and the gameplay is simple but effective. The graphics are easy on the eyes and help make the character designs shine. It’s a bummer that there were problems with the controls at launch, but even with those issues, it wasn't enough to prevent the game from being a botanical blast.</p></section>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/26/ps-plus-december-2025-monthly-games-features-lego-horizon-adventures-in-a-five-game-bonanza/</link>

		<p>Sony has revealed the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PS Plus</a> Monthly Games for December 2025, and it’s a&nbsp;<em>big</em> month with a bumper crop of five games that includes one of their big first party games… in Lego form. There’s also a surprising amount of mutliplayer horror stuff for the festive season.</p>
<p><span>What are the PS Plus December 2025 Monthly Games?</span></p>


<p>There’s a big bundle of titles for PS Plus this month, available from Tuesday, 2nd December:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>LEGO Horizon Adventures</strong> | PS5</li>
<li><strong>Killing Floor 3</strong> | PS5</li>
<li><strong>The Outlast Trials</strong> | PS4, PS5</li>
<li><strong>Synduality Echo of Ada</strong> | PS5</li>
<li><strong>Neon White</strong> | PS4, PS5</li>
</ul>

<p>LEGO Horizon Adventures is the biggest deal here, as Guerrilla Games and Studio Gobo’s Lego reimagining of their post-apocalyptic robo adventure. Play as Aloy and chums in a bricky adventure that does things a little bit differently to the Travellers Tales games, but looks absolutely gorgeous.</p>


<p>Then there’s the gruesome twosome of Killing Floor 3’s co-op sci-fi zombie blasting and The Outlast Trials’ co-op horror. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/28/killing-floor-3-review/">Killing Floor 3’s</a> a rather recent game, but didn’t have the greatest launch behind it, while The Outlast Trials has a solid cachet and recently was updated with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/21/the-outlast-trials-pvp-invasion-mode-is-out-now-just-in-time-for-halloween/">a new versus mode</a>.</p>

<p>With extraction shooters the talk of the town right now, thanks to ARC Raiders, it’s good to remember that there’s plenty of other examples out there too. Synduality Echo of Ada is just one such game, stuffed with cool mechs, customisable characters and tight combat, and putting its own polish on the extraction experience. We gave it <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/24/synduality-echo-of-ada-review-the-ultimate-extraction-experience/">a hefty 9/10</a> in our review.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="NEON WHITE | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X0b-qZTF0Mc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Perhaps the cream of the crop is <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/06/22/neon-white-review/"><strong>Neon White</strong></a>, which Miguel absolutely adored. He said, “Neon White is a love letter to turn-of-the-decade internet weirdos. It’s full of rule-of-cool anime nostalgia, ear-shredding electronic music, and dialogue ripped straight out of my group chats. It’s a genuine game made for an audience rarely prioritised, but even if you don’t fit the archetypical person this game was made for, you’re still in for the most stylish and satisfying action-platformer I’ve ever experienced.”</p>
<h2>Can you still get the November 2025 PS Plus games?</h2>
<p>Yes! You’ve got until Monday 1st December to claim this month’s PS Plus games, which include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stray</strong> | PS5, PS4</li>
<li><strong>EA Sports WRC</strong> | PS5</li>
<li><strong>TABS</strong> | PS5, PS4</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/30/heres-the-november-2025-ps-plus-monthly-games-cats-cars-and-tabs/">Head here for the full skinny</a> on that.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Splash Damage Enters Consultation Process Impacting All Staff, More Layoffs Incoming]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/splash-damage-enters-consultation-process-impacting-all-staff-layoffs/</link>
            <guid>1365655</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>A short two months after <a href="https://wccftech.com/developer-splash-damage-no-longer-owned-by-tencent-acquired-by-private-equity-investors/">it was acquired by an unnamed private equity group</a>, veteran support studio Splash Damage has announced it has entered a consultation process that will impact all staff members. While all current staff could potentially be laid off, it's unclear at the time of this writing how many will be impacted.</p>



<p>"<em>Today we announced to our teams that we are entering a studio-wide consultation process affecting all roles</em>," a post on the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/splash-damage_an-update-from-splash-damage-activity-7399486098588196864-pz0I/">studio's LinkedIn page began</a>. "<em>This was a difficult step for us to take, but we believe it is necessary so Splash Damage can remain agile and adaptable in what has been a very challenging market. We know this kind of change is emotionally tough, and we will do what we can to guide our people through this process with honesty and care. We're committed to exploring every option to retain talent and making sure those affected have meaningful support throughout</em>."</p>



<p>After quietly pulling away from its previous parent company in September, Tencent, though the studio's future was unclear, there was a bit of a sense that it could fare better away from Tencent than under it. Now, however, it's clear that's not the case, and if the consultation process wraps up before the end of the year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/splash-damage-ends-development-of-transformers-reactivate-lays-off-staff/">it'll be the studio's second layoff in 2025</a>.</p>



<p>Since 2020, Splash Damage has only been able to ship one game, Outcasters, which launched and died with Google Stadia. It supported games like Star Wars Hunters and Gears Tactics, but has been unable to get a game over the finish line since Outcasters. Its last major project, Transformers: Reactivate, was cancelled, which led to the layoffs in January 2025. </p>



<p>It's unfortunate to see Splash Damage struggle like so many other studios, especially because if this does end with the studio essentially shutting down, it'll be the latest veteran studio to be killed off. Splash Damage has been around for 20 years now, and that kind of staying power isn't easy to obtain. </p>

            <p>
I don't know if I'm allowed to write "dad I'd like to" you know what, even as an acronym, so I won't, but my current prediction for Scholar, the first of two new Nightfarers coming to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> as part of its Forsaken Hollows DLC, is that this is what an alarmingly large number of people will refer to him as. I get it! He's a bit grubby looking, but he's smart because he reads books and stuff. There's multitudes there.
</p>
<p>
Goofs and gafs aside, how about we take a look at what he actually does. According to the DLC's <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring-nightreign-dlc-the-forsaken-hollows">official website</a>, the Scholar boasts "impressive arcane levels" and can gain "incredible advantages through battlefield observation." I'm not exactly sure how this translates in-game, but there is one moment where he sort of scans a group of enemies that appear to be causing some trouble, after which they seemingly get easier to takedown.
</p>

<p>
Another spell, used during a boss fight against some clones of the player characters, seemingly links both you and your comrades to one another, but also the enemies to one another. After that, when one of the enemies gets killed, the other two die at the same time, so my guess is that there's a trade-off in that if one of you gets downed, so do the other two. He also has a sword! Seemingly nothing fancy about that particular fact, it looks like he uses it almost like a fencer does, but there's really not much more to say than that.
</p><p>
He is one of two new classes coming with the DLC, the other being the Undertaker, who is yet to receive a trailer herself. The Forsaken Hollows also brings with it two more bosses to face off against, as well as additional shifting earth and a mysterious "more." I'm sure that'll all be revealed soon enough, given that it's due out next week, December 4th.

              <p>The holiday season is here, and to celebrate the most festive time of year, PlayStation is offering all PlayStation Plus subscribers extra games to download and play in December. ‘Tis the season and all that.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/26/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-december-lego-horizon-adventures-killing-floor-3-the-outlast-trials-more/">On November 26, PlayStation revealed December’s monthly games</a> that will be available to all PS Plus subscribers across all tiers. These games will be available to add to your PlayStation library permanently on December 2. Once added, you can install them and play them whenever you want as long as you are an active PS Plus Essential, Extra, or Premium subscriber. Here’s the list of games and what platforms they are available on.</p> <ul> <li><em>LEGO Horizon Adventures</em> – PS5</li> <li><em>Killing Floor 3</em> – PS5</li> <li><em>The Outlast Trials</em> – PS4, PS5</li> <li><em>Synduality Echo of Ada</em> – PS5</li> <li><em>Neon White</em> – PS4, PS5</li> </ul> <p>You don’t want to wait too long to grab these PS Plus monthly games, as they are only available to grab for free until January 5.</p> <p>This is one of the better months for PS Plus in some time<em>.<a href="https://kotaku.com/neon-white-pc-nintendo-switch-annapurna-interactive-got-1849072088"> Neon White</a></em> alone makes this a fantastic list of games. Its fast-paced platforming/shooting action is hard to put down, and the story it tells is equally engrossing. I expect many players will be fighting among friends to reach the top of the leaderboards.</p>

 <p>Meanwhile<em>, LEGO Horizon Adventures</em> is the perfect game for the holidays. If you have young kids hanging out at your house, and you can pull them away from <em>Roblox</em> for a few hours, <a href="https://kotaku.com/lego-horizon-adventures-review-aloy-ps5-switch-pc-1851696761"><em>Horizon Adventures</em></a> is a fantastic co-op game that will help keep them distracted while the adults cook, clean, and wrap last-minute gifts.</p> <p>Or maybe you want to be scared during your holiday break? Well, then I’d check ou<em>t The Outlast Trials,</em> though you might want to scooch away the kids at your house before booting that one up. And don’t forget to add November’s freebies to your PlayStation account library. You have until December 1 to grab <em>Stray, EA Sports WRC 24, </em>and <em>Totally Accurate Battle Simulator.&nbsp;</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[PC RAM Prices Have Soared By Up To 250%]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/pc-ram-prices-have-soared-by-up-to-250/</link>
            <guid>1365640</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Having inventory of extra PC RAM is going to be as valuable as having a stockpile of gold bars if trends continue at their current pace. Due to a claimed memory shortage across the industry, RAM prices have shot up exponentially over recent weeks. </p>



<p>It’s gotten to the point where buying a couple sticks of memory can cost more than a new GPU or even a fully priced video game console. </p>







<p>But how bad is the pricing situation, actually? Looking at storefronts like Newegg, and it paints a pretty dire picture for enthusiasts of all levels. Whether you just want one stick of 16GB or even 64GB for your new build, you better be ready to spend more than ever. Prices of memory have risen by as much as 250% since the beginning of November.</p>



<p>Below you can see just how much costs have gone up for consumers for anything from 16GB (2 x 8GB) to 64GB (2 x 32GB). And this specifically focuses on the current DDR5 generation of RAM.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>PC Memory</th><th>November 1 Price</th><th>November 26 Price</th><th>Percentage Increase</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>16GB T-Force</td><td>$77.99</td><td>$177.99</td><td>128.2%</td></tr><tr><td>16GB Kingston Fury </td><td>$62.99</td><td>$149.99</td><td>138.1%</td></tr><tr><td>32GB T-Force</td><td>$96.99</td><td>$339.99</td><td>250.5%</td></tr><tr><td>32GB G.Skill Flare X5</td><td>$97.99</td><td>$269.99</td><td>175.5%</td></tr><tr><td>32GB Corsair Vengeance </td><td>$142.99</td><td>$406.99</td><td>184.6%</td></tr><tr><td>32GB G.Skill Trident Z5 NEO</td><td>$104.99</td><td>$279.99</td><td>166.7%</td></tr><tr><td>64GB Corsair Vengeance</td><td>$239.99</td><td>$839.99</td><td>250%</td></tr><tr><td>64GB G.Skill Trident Z5 NEO</td><td>$204.99</td><td>$629.99</td><td>207.3%</td></tr><tr><td>64GB G.Skill Flare X5</td><td>$204.99</td><td>$569.99</td><td>178%</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>As the data shows, the availability of memory has turned the market into a chaotic place. It’s even gotten so bad that some stores are starting to sell the components at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1p55n8k/taken_at_microcenter_on_1123/?utm_source=embedv2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">“Market Price”</a>. That’s something usually saved for Lobster and other seafood. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to a number of RAM manufacturers about when they think the prices could come down. Every single person who spoke gave a similar answer of uncertainty. That’s because of the fact that, often times, when there’s a shortage, it could take months and even years to catch back up to meet the demand. It’s the truest form of going day-by-day and week-by-week there is.</p>







<h2 id="h-why-is-there-a-pc-memory-shortage">Why Is There A PC Memory Shortage?</h2>



<p>These price increases while seemingly sudden and extreme, shouldn’t come as a surprise for those who’ve been following what’s happening. For those who are unaware, however, there’s a big reason why RAM costs have gone up the way they have: AI.</p>



<p>As AI infrastructure continues to expand worldwide, the components needed like memory and storage are being bought up. And these companies are willing to pay higher prices for more product. That means there’s just not enough to keep up with average consumer demand. And it seems to be a problem that <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/17/ai-fuels-memory-chip-shortage-that-could-hit-phones-and-cars.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">may only get worse</a> and more expansive before it gets better. </p>



<p><strong>“It could be very bad for PCs, laptops, consumer electronics and automotive, which depend on cheap memory chips,”</strong> TriOrient’s vice president of research, Dan Nystedt, told CNBC.</p>

                <p>If it ever comes out, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/beyond-good-and-evil-2/" data-ref-id="5000-35207">Beyond Good and Evil 2</a> may take home the record for the longest development period in video game history. It's been 17 years and counting, but Ubisoft has sent out a job listing that suggests development on the follow-up to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/beyond-good-and-evil/" data-ref-id="5000-4537">Beyond Good and Evil</a> is still in progress.</p><p>Ubisoft has posted a job on <a href="https://hitmarker.net/jobs/ubisoft-technical-sound-designer-m-f-nb-beyond-good-evil-2-montpellier-1584708" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hitmarker</a> for a technical sound designer for Beyond Good and Evil 2. The role calls for the person in question to have the duties of both a sound designer and an audio technical lead with an emphasis on creating audio assets, as well as proposing and integrating audio designs.</p><p>More intriguingly, the listing reconfirms that Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 will be a prequel to the original game that offers "a seamless experience of exploration and space piracy across a solar system full of exotic locations, colorful characters and mysteries to uncover, solo or with friends." That suggests the sequel will have multiplayer functionality.</p><p>Last year's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/beyond-good-evil-20th-anniversary-edition-gets-a-launch-trailer/1100-6524417/" data-ref-id="1100-6524417">Beyond Good &amp; Evil 20th Anniversary Edition</a> set the stage for the prequel story by adding a side quest that allowed the main character, Jade, to learn about the people and creatures who raised her when she lived among a pirate crew while she was a child. However, it doesn't appear that the sequel will address the post-credits cliffhanger from the original game.</p><p>Michel Ancel--the director of the original Beyond Good &amp; Evil--stepped down from the sequel and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rayman-creator-michel-ancel-retires-but-beyond-good-evil-2-will-go-on/1100-6482347/" data-ref-id="1100-6482347">retired in 2020</a>. The game's creative director, Emile Morel, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/beyond-good-evil-2-creative-director-passes-away-suddenly/1100-6515715/" data-ref-id="1100-6515715">passed away suddenly</a> in 2023.</p><p>In 2020, Netflix announced<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-developing-beyond-good-evil-movie-with-det/1100-6480420/" data-ref-id="1100-6480420"> a Beyond Good &amp; Evil movie</a> from director Rob Letterman, who previously helmed Detective Pikachu. However, that project never materialized. The only news of note outside of the game was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/beyond-good-evil-2-is-still-nowhere-to-be-found-but-now-theres-an-astro-bot-skin/1100-6529785/" data-ref-id="1100-6529785">a callback to Beyond Good &amp; Evil in Astro Bot</a> earlier this year.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Grand Theft Auto 6 (GTA VI) Trailer Breakdown</p>
      </div>
<p>If you've spent any time on X in recent days, you may have seen some gameplay "leaks" of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi/" data-ref-id="5000-569323">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>. They've gone incredibly viral thanks to a poster named Zap Actu GTA6, who's admitted that the videos they've shared are all generated using artificial intelligence.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/increasingly-convincing-ai-generated-gta-6-gameplay-leaks-are-getting-millions-of-views-on-social-media" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">spotted by IGN</a>, Zap Actu GTA6 began posting these "leaks" on November 18. They all typically show some male or female figure walking through Leonida, a fictional state based on Florida. The <a href="https://x.com/zapactugta6/status/1990919582278709450" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">first video</a> only generated 217 likes and 26,000 views, but subsequent ones gained more traction as Zap Actu GTA6 posted more. In <a href="https://x.com/zapactugta6/status/1991284160640827635" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a video posted on November 19</a> that garnered 6,100 likes and 1.8 million views, Zap Actu GTA6 claimed these were from "several anonymous accounts" who filmed the clips "from inside Rockstar’s studios." Another one <a href="https://x.com/zapactugta6/status/1991957817180205341" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posted on November 21</a> purported that a character has "facial features strongly resembling those of Leonardo DiCaprio." Despite claiming there's "absolutely no official confirmation" on anything being posted, Zap Actu GTA6 still noted that the leaks are real and serious.</p><p>That "leak" that really blew up was posted on November 25. Zap Actu GTA6 said the video they shared "surfaced on TikTok before being taken down." It allegedly showed a gameplay moment of someone controlling co-protagonist Lucia as she walked along what appeared to be a beach with a "dynamic weather system" that produced heavy clouds and rain showers. The video went viral, getting 34,000 likes and 8.1 million views, and it wasn't the only one that got this much attention online.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/zapactugta6/status/1993298829584548268" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">🚨🚨 GTA 6 ALERT – EXTREMELY SERIOUS SITUATION 🚨🚨<br>A new and highly disturbing leak has just surfaced on TikTok before being taken down only minutes later — but the damage is already done.

In a November 26 post, they said that they really had "no real leaked information about GTA 6." Everything they posted on their account was AI-generated--exactly what many of the community notes under the posts claimed--saying they're still sharing the fake GTA 6 trailer "for fun."</p><p>Zap Actu GTA6's M.O., according to their X post, was to prove just how "incredibly easy" it is to fool people into believing anything with fake, AI-generated "leaks." According to their metrics, 50% "believed" the leaks, while the other 50% "clearly spotted" the AI in use.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/zapactugta6/status/1993723024034435396" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">🚨 GTA 6 – IT’S TIME TO COME CLEAN 🚨<br>Alright, enough 😅 I trolled you.<br>I have NO real leaked information about GTA 6.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>The moment the first trailer for <em>Rental Family</em> dropped, it felt like the clouds parted and light poured down in a sign from the universe. This was the movie that would finally put Brendan Fraser, an actor I adored in my youth, on the map. The <a href="https://www.avclub.com/brendan-fraser-gets-choked-up-hearing-a-fans-words-of-s-1847465268?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Brenaissance</u></a> film that was promised.&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n0pqP6ClcE8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="RENTAL FAMILY | Official Trailer | Searchlight Pictures"></iframe></figure><p>Back when I was in kindergarten, I was a kid who only watched Bruce Lee flicks (able to recite every line from memory) or random anime on TV. Never anything scary. I was a wimp, you see—a little scaredy-cat. But my mom had a VHS copy of <em>The Mummy</em> that I broke from loving it too much with repeated rewatches. Granted, I probably shouldn’t have been watching it at five (the <em>Freddy vs Jason</em> trailers were too scary for me), but hey, we were also the kind of family who treated <em>The Godfather</em> and <em>Scarface</em> as holiday background movie traditions, so who can blame me for experiencing a film before I was ready?</p><figure><figcaption><span>This was "so cool" (🏳️‍🌈🤔) to a baby Isaiah.</span></figcaption></figure><p>That film wasn’t just another entry in my early cinematic viewing. It was also an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/oct/08/mummy-remains-classic-bisexual-awakening-movie-brendan-fraser-rachel-weisz?ref=aftermath.site"><u>early onset bisexual awakening</u></a> (Fraser, Rachel Weisz, Arnold Vosloo, Patricia Velasquez, and Oded Fehr, I stood no chance). As far as my mom knew, I just found Fraser “really cool,” but we all know what I meant without the words to articulate it. But, more importantly, it opened my eyes to what an actor is. Fraser not only became the definition of the word, he also became the blueprint for my taste in films: action mixed with comedy, charisma balanced with earnestness, and a softness against toxic masculinity. Still, whenever I rewound a tape in our modest <a href="https://halbaronproject.web.illinois.edu/items/show/45?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Cabrini Green project building</u></a> (Delores Wilson is my grandmother, by the way) after school, I was enamored by the gravity of his art. From then on, I only wanted my mom to rent Fraser movies from Blockbuster because he was the best proof that an actor could be romantic, funny, heroic, and deeply human all at once.&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F-lto1Jc2Kg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Brendan Fraser Breaks Down His Career, from 'The Mummy' to 'The Whale' | Vanity Fair"></iframe></figure><p>I watched both <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PP9VGoP8xnI&amp;pp=ygUcZ2VvcmdlIG9mIHRoZSBqdW5nbGUgdHJhaWxlcg%3D%3D&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u><em>George of the Jungle</em>s</u></a> and I even watched those <a href="https://youtu.be/5cKjOl2wr2A?ref=aftermath.site"><u><em>Looney Tunes</em> live action films</u></a>—dated feature-length advertisements, sure, but formative cinema for my hero's uncanny ability to charm no matter how ridiculous the premise of the movie. And as a child who had my eight grade mentor break the news one random evening after school that just because I saw Bruce Lee in a film yesterday doesn’t mean he’s still alive, my mom telling me Fraser was still alive doing things was both a comfort about the fleeting mortality of life and a promise that I’d still be able to be awed by his movies for years to come.&nbsp;</p><p>But the older I got, the fewer movies I saw him in. And after <em>The Mummy 3</em> at 11 (starring Jet Li and <a href="https://gizmodo.com/michelle-yeoh-ne-zha-ii-interview-2000643804?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Michelle Yeoh</u></a>—my action movie Mt. Rushmores of Hong Kong cinema), he virtually disappeared.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So when <a href="https://www.avclub.com/film-review-the-whale-brendan-fraser-darren-aronofsky-1849855211?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>The Whale</u></em></a> arrived when I was comfortably feeling life out as an adult, marketed as his “<a href="https://variety.com/2022/film/features/brendan-fraser-the-whale-career-1235399057/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>comeback</u></a>,” I felt conflicted. It won him awards, but to me it reeked of Oscar-bait misery. The direction of Darren Aronofsky (a director I can comfortably call a hack on a good day)leaned into trauma exploitation, treating Fraser’s character like a wounded puppy in those <a href="https://youtu.be/tjZ5dld2qHs?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Sarah McLachlan ASPCA commercials</u></a> rather than an actor with his full, wide range of talent on display. His performance was strong—especially since he was working through his own Hollywood trauma in the film—but the movie itself felt like audiences were crying at him instead of with him. That one goddamn poster of him looking miserable didn’t help.&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nx6jZ0zJuc4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="RENTAL FAMILY | Outsider Official Clip | Searchlight Pictures"></iframe></figure><p>That’s why director <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hikari_(director)?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Hikari</u></a>’s <em>Rental Family</em> feels like the real Brendan Fraser renaissance. Finally, Fraser isn’t just doing <a href="https://gizmodo.com/brendan-fraser-doom-patrol-robotman-comeback-whale-1849501496?ref=aftermath.site"><u>comic-book jury duty</u></a> or prestige cinema misery porn—he’s back as a full actor. Here, he plays Phillip Vandarpleog, an American actor whose career bloom has faded, reduced to wacky commercial gigs to pay the bills in Japan. Until he stumbles into the bizarre (<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/04/30/japans-rent-a-family-industry?ref=aftermath.site"><u>and actual Japanese industry</u></a>) world of “rental families”---services where actors are hired to play roles in people’s lives. The film is basically Nathan Fielder’s <a href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a40971499/the-rehearsal-nathan-fielder-psychologist-interview/?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>The Rehearsal</u></em></a> meets <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d299rICUzU&amp;pp=ygULa2FwcGEgbWlrZXk%3D&amp;ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer"><em><u>Kappa Mikey</u></em></a>, but played straight. Not therapy, but some bizarro capitalistic extra steps to something resembling closure for clientele. Be it stand-ins at their funerals, where they get to hear good things and hard truths about themselves never meant to reach their ears, infidelity interventions, weddings, and even surrogate fathers.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Searchlight Pictures</span></figcaption></figure><p>I caught the film (which released worldwide on my freaking birthday—a sign, I tell you!) at the Chicago International Film Festival, and I loved it. So much so, I even looked up the exact weekender bag Fraser lugged around in the film to feel vicariously close to my childhood hero in my own parasocially acceptable adult way. But more than anything, <em>Rental Family</em> feels revelatory because it gives Fraser space to be the actor he always was: not trapped in sad-drama roles, but thriving in a dramedy with a mix of humor and heart that shaped my love of movies.&nbsp;</p><figure><div></div><figcaption><p><span>Searchlight Pictures</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>If the past seven paragraphs weren’t evident enough, I can’t talk about this film objectively, if there ever were a way to endeavor to do so with any piece of media. I’m too close to it. Fraser was a linchpin in my appreciation of cinema, and seeing him return to the kind of work that made him a shining star in my eyes—but with deeper emotional resonance, I finally have the words to describe—feels…well, moving.&nbsp;</p><p>If there ever were an actual inception point for his career resurgence, it is <em>Rental Family</em>. While sure, the film <a href="https://joysauce.com/rental-family-skims-the-surface-of-japans-rent-a-family-industry/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>yadda yaddas its way around not fully addressing the awkwardness of rental families</u></a> as a real-life Japanese industry, I’m giving Fraser his flowers for reminding me that he’s just as much a tour de force as he was in my childhood: a kind, funny, deeply human presence both on-screen and off. May the sun never set on the Brenaissance. </p><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/criterion-mobile-closet-picks-peter-decker-interview-chicago-international-film-festival/"><div><p>Criterion’s Mobile Closet Wasn’t About The Van—It Was About IRL Friendships We Made Along The (Five-Hour) Way - Aftermath</p><p>Fifteen years ago Guillermo del Toro was scheduled to drop by Criterion’s New York, and sparked an unexpected tradition.</p><p><span>Isaiah Colbert</span></p></div></a></figure>

The AIR SNES are a heavily customized version of the Nike Air Max 90 inspired by other <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/15/24221246/can-you-guess-which-consoles-inspired-these-custom-shoeboys-sneakers">gaming-themed sneakers like Bull Airs’ ShoeBoys</a>, but Bonzanini’s creation doubles as a functional retro console.</p><p>Given the size of the Super Nintendo, and the chunky cartridges it used, Bonzanini decided against trying to trim down and shrink the console’s electronics to fit inside a shoe that was still wearable. They instead opted to go the emulation route and used a compact <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/2/28/14762228/raspberry-pi-zero-w-wireless-adds-wifi-and-bluetooth">Raspberry Pi Zero W</a>. It has more than enough processing power to play 16-bit SNES games using the RetroPie emulator that Bonzanini customized to match the look and feel of the sneaker.</p><p>But you won’t find the microcomputer hidden away in the sole of the Air Max 90. All of the electronics, including a battery with enough capacity for up to 30 minutes of gameplay, can be found inside the sneaker’s tongue. The Raspberry Pi Zero W includes an integrated Mini HDMI port, but to “make the design feel like it could exist in 1990,” Bonzanini added a small analog converter so the AIR SNES connects to a TV using retro RCA cables.</p><p>The sneakers even work with an original SNES gamepad, but to keep the cable wrangling to a minimum Bonzanini upgraded the controller using an <a href="https://shop.8bitdo.com/products/8bitdo-mod-kit-for-original-snes-sfc-controller-old-edition">8BitDo Mod Kit</a> so it connects to the Raspberry Pi wirelessly over Bluetooth. Given the ever-growing popularity of retro gaming nostalgia and sneaker culture there’s little doubt Bonzanini could sell as many pairs of AIR SNES as they could make. But unfortunately they’re just a one-off creation with no plans to commercialize the design.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/829880/gustavo-bonzanini-nike-air-max-90-sneaker-super-nintendo]]></content:encoded>
