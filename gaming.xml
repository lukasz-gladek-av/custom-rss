                <p>Remasters and ports are big business, and when Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine Master Crafted Edition was announced, hardcore fans who played the original 2011 version were excited. That excitement quickly turned to frustration as the PC release contained a number of bugs, and Sega is now offering refunds to everyone who bought it.</p><p>Over on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3169520/Warhammer_40000_Space_Marine__Master_Crafted_Edition/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, there are almost 100 "mostly negative" reviews citing buggy loads, ugly UI changes, and constant crashing, leaving fans disappointed. "Decided to pick up a copy after the price was reduced for Anniversary Edition owners as some goodwill was returned," one player wrote. "Have played less than an hour and got sent into bugsplat just navigating the menus, all of which are a downgrade compared to the original. No idea why Relic have decided to fix what's not broken here."</p><p>Sega dropped the price to $20 for anyone who already owns the Anniversary Edition, and as <a href="https://kotaku.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-master-crafted-refunds-ps5-1851785318?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=SocialMarketing&amp;utm_campaign=dlvrit&amp;utm_content=kotaku" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a> is reporting, letting fans who already purchased it on PC get a refund through July 10. Sega also laid out improvements that Patch 3 was to implement, including "fixed softlocks, graphical glitches, and input issues in various screens" and more technical fixes like moving local user profile data to a different location to prevent certain crashes. </p><p>However, the game's problems go outside PC players. Xbox Series X|S players--who play the game via Game Pass Ultimate--are also experiencing a bug that's eating their save files. It's such a common complaint that players are sharing their stories over on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Spacemarine/comments/1l9czva/lost_progresssave_on_xbox_series_x_on_master/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> to see if there's any possible solution, as refunds aren't available on that platform yet.</p><p>If you're too frustrated to keep playing but still want your Warhammer goodness, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-you-can-get-a-free-warhammer-40k-game-this-week/1100-6532330/" data-ref-id="1100-6532330">Warhammer 40,000: Gladius - Relics of War</a> is on supersale right now over at GOG. Additionally, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review/1900-6418276/" data-ref-id="1900-6418276">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a> is available on current-gen consoles and PC, and was such a success that a third game is already in the works.</p>

The Season 3 release date is set for July 11, though it remains unclear how some of the content shown in today‚Äôs video will roll out.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Where <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-season-2-ushers-in-the-age-of-ultron-with-hellfire-gala-theme-and-emma-frost"><u>Season 2: Hellfire Gala introduced</u></a> new Heroes, Ultron and Emma Frost, Season 3: The Abyss Awakens looks like it will finally allow players to control Blade and Jean Grey/The Phoenix. The former is an especially important addition, as Marvel Rivals fans have speculated about when the Daywalker would be added to the roster since teases began during the vampire-themed Season 1. Jean Grey‚Äôs inclusion, meanwhile, comes with the surprise that she‚Äôll be able to harness the power of The Phoenix for her telekinetic abilities.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Knull will serve as the big bad this time around, with the Marvel Rivals Season 2 trailer teasing that he‚Äôll be teaming up with Hela to take power.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúIn the wake of the Timestream Entanglement, Knull stirs deep within Klyntar‚Äôs core, stretching his shadowed hands across the cosmos," an official description for Marvel Rivals Season 3 says. "Power promised by the dark symbiote god beckons the awakening of a new queen. The Phoenix arrives from across the stars to erase Klyntar before the darkness can rise again! However, she'll require unlikely aid from a warrior of two worlds who lives to fight against the tide of night. As the god of the symbiotes and the Phoenix Force collide, will you burn with the light of creation or embrace the darkness?‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Eagle-eyed Marvel Rivals players will also notice what is most likely a collection of new skins set to arrive at some point during Season 3. There is, of course, Hela‚Äôs symbiote skin, which Knull gives her early on in the footage, but it‚Äôs toward the end that we get a closer look at a few more. Wolverine can be seen sporting a Phoenix Force skin of his own, with Blade and Magik both sporting fiery outfits as well. It‚Äôs Jeff the Landshark symbiote skin that has most fans really freaking out, though.</p><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="no" dir="ltr">SYMBIOTE JEFF SKIN???? <a href="https://t.co/SMmm41rUYF" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/SMmm41rUYF</a></p>‚Äî Lightoss üí™üåü (@lightossan) <a href="https://twitter.com/lightossan/status/1940062111255712134?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 1, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Marvel Rivals Season 3: The Abyss Awakens will introduce at least two new playable Heroes, but it also marks the beginning of a new chapter for the popular Marvel hero shooter experience.

While past seasons have been approximately three months long, Season 3 will see that schedule change to two-month-long seasons. That means major updates will drop much faster than before without sacrificing any content, as NetEase hopes to keep fans engaged.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The studio has done its best to address fan feedback since launching late last year.

                <p>Crash Bandicoot may not be as popular as he used to be, but three decades ago he was one of PlayStation's first breakout original characters. But when former Sony executive Shuji Utsumi attempted to get Hollywood interested in making a Crash Bandicoot movie, he was given the cold shoulder by film executives.</p><p>Utsumi--who is currently the CEO of Sega of America--told <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/reviving-sega-will-be-the-greatest" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business</a> about his attempt to bring Crash Bandicoot to the big screen. Despite the success of the games--from 1996 to 2010, Sony released a Crash-related game nearly every year--no one seemed to share Utsumi's vision for what the film could be.</p><p>"When I started to get involved in the video game business, I picked up Crash Bandicoot and started asking some of the movie studios if they were interested in turning that property into a movie," recalled Utsumi. "But I was treated like, 'hey, video games is like a toy business.' They didn't really take it seriously."</p><p>Utsumi went on to note that the Sonic the Hedgehog movies have proven to be very successful for both Hollywood--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-film-franchise-races-past-1-billion-at-the-box-office/1100-6528632/" data-ref-id="1100-6528632">the film franchise has pulled in more than $1 billion</a>--and for Sega itself in terms of boosting game sales and Sonic's status as an iconic character. Crash Bandicoot, however, has seen better days. Developer Toys for Bob made <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/crash-bandicoot-4-review-/1900-6417574/" data-ref-id="1900-6417574">Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time</a> in 2020, but the studio reportedly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/crash-bandicoot-artist-says-fifth-game-was-canceled/1100-6524957/" data-ref-id="1100-6524957">canceled plans to produce Crash Bandicoot 5</a>.</p><p>Although the Crash Bandicoot games were originally developed by Naughty Dog, the rights to the character are currently held by Microsoft after its purchase of Activision Blizzard. Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/want-a-crash-bandicoot-movie-ask-xbox-the-last-of-us-boss-says/1100-6531823/" data-ref-id="1100-6531823">expressed his support for a Crash Bandicoot movie</a>, but he also reiterated that it's Microsoft's call whether to actually pursue that project.</p>

            <p>It'll soon be time for another season of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a>, the super-duper Overwotlike and thirsty delivery vehicle for every variation of Marvel character known to the human mind. What's coming in season three? Wesley Snipes and a bloody great burning bird lady. By which I mean, Blade and Phoenix. They'll be matching wits with Hera, goddess of death, who has palled up with Knull, god of symbioties, aka the wriggly black pyjamas sported by Venom.</p>
<p>All of this may seem frightening and bizarre if you're here because you accidentally hit auto-complete while googling "Marks &amp; Spencers opening times", so here's a swift trailer to fill you in.</p><!--more-->

<p>How about that? Nicely surgical bit of techno, I thought, definitely has me <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZuZZzvJxR8">itching for the dance floor</a>. The new season begins on 11th July. Here's some official blurb for that trailer.</p>
<blockquote><p>"In the wake of the Timestream Entanglement, Knull stirs deep within Klyntar's core, stretching his shadowed hands across the cosmos. Power promised by the dark symbiote god beckons the awakening of a new queen. The Phoenix arrives from across the stars to erase Klyntar before the darkness can rise again! However, she'll require unlikely aid from a warrior of two worlds who lives to fight against the tide of night."</p> </blockquote>
<p>"As the god of the symbiotes and the Phoenix Force collide, will you burn with the light of creation or embrace the darkness?" the trailer blurb concludes. I choose to translate this as: do you want Phoenix Force skins or Symbiote skins? As for how the new characters play, <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/massive-marvel-rivals-leak-confirms-season-3-theme-with-new-hero-battle-pass-and-more/">leaks suggest</a> that they're both DPS roles. There's also talk of new hero team-ups and some "anti-heal" mechanics, given away by new voice lines. It's probable one of the new heroes has the power to shut down health replenishment.</p>
<p>We've not covered Marvel Rivals much lately due to a shortage of hands at the wheel and greymass for the ever-expanding hero roster. It remains a popular game, with 56,735 people playing at the time of writing.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/blade-and-phoenix-are-coming-to-marvel-rivals-this-july-in-season-3-along-with-rumoured-anti-heal-mechanics]]></content:encoded>

When they defeat someone in this metaphysical space, the target‚Äôs real-world counterpart has a ‚Äúchange of heart‚Äù and repents for their crimes.

While the original group were facing serious issues of systemic corruption, and here it appears they‚Äôre facing a petty criminal with a pro-wrestler name, it‚Äôs not quite the downgrade it seems. The Subway Slammer, also known as Takeyuki Kiuchi, is a disgraced baseball player who has since retired from the sport and gone to work at a corporate desk job. His athletic career ended after a sexual harassment scandal, and now all his misogynistic tendencies are manifesting in violent acts in Tokyo subway stations, because his ‚ÄúShadow‚Äù in the metaverse is out of control.</p><p>Surely this must be dealt with, and the Phantom Thieves with their ability to enter the Metaverse and face these distorted villains are the ones to do it. But the over-the-top self-seriousness with which <em>The Phantom X </em>treats a guy with such a crass nickname, who so cartoonishly shoulder checks people on the subway, has made it perfect meme fodder for <em>Persona </em>fans. <em>The Phantom X </em>has been out overseas since last year, so some <em>Persona </em>fans were already well aware of this storyline. Now that it‚Äôs out worldwide, everyone is in on the joke.</p><p>To be fair, the issue <em>The Phantom X </em>is depicting here is an important one. There are plenty of real-world reports of subway station violence in big cities, sometimes ending in casualties as victims are pushed onto the tracks. The problem is that the game is depicting Kiuchi‚Äôs crimes in such a way that it lends itself to the kind of unintentional meme-bait that makes it hard to take seriously. X (formerly Twitter) user <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/DeJected_Axe/status/1939373198505623932&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/DeJected_Axe/status/1939373198505623932" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DeJected_Axe put it best</a></span> when they said calling him the Subway Slammer feels like giving him a ‚Äú<em>Scooby-Doo </em>villain‚Äù nickname. It feels like the game isn‚Äôt treating his crimes with the gravity they deserve. How am I supposed to hear a grown man say ‚ÄúThe whole subway‚Äôs mine for the slammin‚Äô‚Äù and not giggle softly to myself?</p><p>All that being said, it sounds like <em>The Phantom X</em>‚Äôs story probably gets better <em>later</em>. Yusuke Nitta, who worked as a scenario planner on the original <em>Persona 5</em> and its extended <em>Royal </em>edition, and as a writer on the tactical RPG <em>Tactica</em>, said in a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/personaphantomx/comments/1lnt17q/in_a_deleted_twitter_post_yusuke_nitta_revealed/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/personaphantomx/comments/1lnt17q/in_a_deleted_twitter_post_yusuke_nitta_revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deleted X post</a></span> that he wasn‚Äôt involved in the Subway Slammer story, and was brought on to write for the game in its third chapter. He apparently removed the post after he got ‚Äúemotional‚Äù seeing the reaction to the Subway Slammer storyline, and said, ‚ÄúRest assured, <em>P5X</em> will get more and more interesting from now on.‚Äù</p><p>I haven‚Äôt had a chance to boot up my copy of <em>Persona 5: The Phantom X</em>, but I <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/persona-5-the-phantom-x-gacha-rolls-preview-mobile-pc-1851783773&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/persona-5-the-phantom-x-gacha-rolls-preview-mobile-pc-1851783773">did play a chunk of the Subway Slammer section</a></span> before the game launched. I don‚Äôt know if this makes me want to play the full game more or less. Maybe more? I gotta take down the greatest villain in <em>Persona </em>history, right?</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/persona-5-phantom-x-subway-slammer-villain-clips-gacha-1851785428]]></content:encoded>

                <p>If you're a fan of piloting mechs around and blowing stuff up, you've probably had your eye on free-to-play shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mecha-break/" data-ref-id="5000-612139">Mecha Break</a>. This third-person action title features five classes and multiple chaotic modes, promising plenty of frenetic shootouts within an alternate future. It's fast, fun, and easy to dive into, so it's all but certain to remain a popular multiplayer option for fans of the genre.</p><p>And since Mecha Break is available on both Xbox and PC (with a PS5 version on the way at an unspecified later date), you may find that you want to team up with a friend who uses a different platform than you. That's where cross-platform functionality comes in. We've got some good news and bad news for you below, so let's dive in and take a look at how Mecha Break handles cross-platform play and cross-progression.</p>

this content!</p></div><h2>Is Mecha Break cross-play?</h2><p>In a day and age where cross-play is becoming the norm rather than the exception, it would be somewhat of a shock to find that a free-to-play shooter doesn't have this beloved feature. Luckily, that's not a problem with Mecha Break. If you want to kick giant robot butts with your friends on other platforms, you'll be excited to know that <strong>Mecha Break fully supports cross-play between Xbox and PC</strong>.</p><p>Once the game goes live, we'll update this guide to go over the specifics of how to group of with friends and players on other platforms, as games are known to handle this in one of a variety of ways. Since the PS5 version isn't available until later, we can't confirm that cross-play functionality will be available on Sony's platform, but chances seem high that it will be supported. We'll be sure to revisit this with an update when we have confirmation, though.</p><h2>Does Mecha Break have cross-progression?</h2><p>Cross-progression is another major feature that is becoming more and more normalized in the world of free-to-play games, so it's always nice to see it available in a new title. But in an unfortunate turn of events, <strong>Mecha Break does not support cross-progression</strong>. As a result, you won't be able to carry your progress from Xbox to PC or vice versa. Instead, if you start an account on one, you'll need to create an entirely new account on the other.</p><p>While cross-progression is no doubt a highly desirable feature to have in a free-to-play shooter like Mecha Break, developer Amazing Seasun Games hasn't mentioned any plans to add it in future updates. That doesn't mean it's bound to always be without the feature, of course, but we wouldn't expect it any time soon, if at all. As always, stay tuned here for any news we hear about this feature down the line.</p><p>Mecha Break is available now on Xbox Series X/S and PC, and it is Steam Deck verified. Also, if you have a Game Pass subscription, you can access some unique cosmetics for your pilot and mech, so don't let that pass you by.</p>

<p>Boom, waka-waka!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Bandai Namco has revealed a new pre-order trailer for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/shadow-labyrinth-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Shadow Labyrinth</a> on the Switch 2, confirming that the game will run at 4K/60fps when docked.</p>
<p>Not only that, but if you wish to purchase the game on the Switch 1 for the time being, you can rest easy knowing that a free upgrade to the Switch 2 version will be available when you eventually nab Nintendo's new console. Bosh!</p>
<p>Launching on <strong>18th July 2025</strong>, Shadow Labyrinth represents a radical departure for the Pac-Man franchise, moving the action firmly into the metroidvania genre with dark overtones and spooky creatures. It looks neat! And it'll look even neater at 4K with silky-smooth gameplay.</p>
<p>Let's remind ourselves of the general premise:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"As Swordsman No. 8, awoken by a floating yellow orb, PUCK, on a mysterious planet amidst relics of wars past, you are chosen to become the instrument of its will.</p>
<p>"To survive you will discover many secrets, consume your enemies, and grow from prey to the apex predator as you embrace your true purpose."</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nvidia-releases-new-geforce-game-ready-driver-for-mecha-break-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-comes-to-nte.1233072/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, NVIDIA has released a new GeForce Game Ready driver (version 576.88) to support the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-officially-unveils-geforce-rtx-5050-desktop-graphics-card/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RTX 5050</a> graphics cards. This driver is also optimized for the launch of Mecha BREAK, the multiplayer mech-themed third-person hero shooter game that's out today on PC and Xbox Series S|X. The game features 3v3, 6v6, and even PvPvE modes like Mashmak, which was <a href="https://wccftech.com/mecha-break-open-beta-mashmak-pc-hands-on-preview-extracted-core/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previewed</a> by Kai Tatsumoto at a recent press hands-on event:</p>



<p><em>The real star of the show that Amazing Seasun Games invited us out to play was their new extraction mode, Mashmak. This loot-and-scoot PvPvE mode is all about airdropping onto a massive 16x16 km map, scouting for resources, taking out rival squads and NPC bosses, and making it out alive with whatever you can carry with you. Despite having a large map, the actual gameplay is limited to up to ten squads of three players, with empty spots filled by NPCs. To force players to keep moving and not camp out in one remote corner of the map, extraction points slowly start to appear at the ten-minute mark with more dropping every five minutes; once one has been used, it‚Äôs gone for good for the rest of that match. Not only do players have to contend with enemy players potentially camping these extraction points out, but there‚Äôs a constantly shrinking field of engagement as Corite Pulse Storms slowly engulf the battlefield. This field can disable weapon lock-ons and also inflict a constant drain on both mech health and fluid armor.</em></p>



<p>Mecha BREAK releases today with built-in support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation, DLSS Frame Generation, and DLSS Super Resolution. Using DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation and DLSS Super Resolution set to Performance Mode, GeForce RTX 50 Series players can see their frame rate boosted by an average of 4.6x while running the game at 4K resolution with max settings.</p>



<p>On the flagship GeForce RTX 5090 GPU, Mecha BREAK runs at an average of 456 FPS, and even the much more affordable GeForce RTX 5070 surpasses 200 frames per second.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Today also marks the debut of Diablo IV: Seasons of Horadrim, the ninth season of the game's live service. The update brings many new features and content and also adds NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation to the game's settings, whereas GeForce RTX 50 Series owners previously had to enable that through the NVIDIA app.</p>



<p>Recently, The Chinese Room's first-person horror game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/still-wakes-the-deep/">Still Wakes the Deep</a> received the premium Siren's Rest expansion. The free update that launched last week also added NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation, and DLSS Super Resolution can be upgraded to the most recent transformer model with the NVIDIA app override.</p>

<p>Lastly, it was confirmed that NTE (<a href="https://wccftech.com/neverness-to-everness-anime-gta/">Neverness to Everness</a>), the online action RPG in development at Hotta Studio, will support DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation already in the upcoming Closed Beta slated to begin this Thursday and scheduled to end on July 16. When the game was first announced in July 2024, the Unreal Engine 5 powered open world game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/neverness-to-everness-is-a-new-gacha-open-world-rpg-from-tower-of-fantasy-devs-powered-by-ue5-with-nvidia-dlss-rtx/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> to support both NVIDIA DLSS and ray tracing. The latter isn't mentioned in the new brief, but it could still be added at a later time.</p>

            <p>There are times in all of our lives when we not only feel compelled to try something new, but burn with an irrepressible desire to break free from the chains of our mundane misery by experiencing a thing which we've not yet experienced.</p>
<p>For some people, that thing might be skydiving or baking a pistachio layer cake with cream cheese buttercream. For me, at one point last year, it was to watch the 1977 film Smokey and the Bandit. For Hideo Kojima, developer of games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>, it is to go to space, and make a game in space. Please, someone just stick him in a rocket already.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I make this plea following Mr Kojima's recent interview with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/jun/19/were-all-connected-but-its-not-the-connection-i-imagined-hideo-kojima-on-death-stranding-2">The Guardian</a>, in which he once again voiced a desire to go to space and then make a game while in space. He's wanted this, or some variation of it, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hideo-kojima-wants-someone-to-send-him-to-space-so-he-can-make-a-game-to-play-in-space">for</a> <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/hey-jeff-bezos-send-hideo-kojima-to-space-already/">years</a>.</p>
<p>People keep putting microphones and bits of paper in front of him, and he keeps telling them he wants it soooooooooo badly. Then, we all go 'Oh aye Hideo, you're so quirky' and move on.</p>
<p>"I want to train properly, learn how to do the docking, go to the International Space Station and stay there for a few months," the space-starved soul said in this latest instance of cosmic craving, "I‚Äôm not a scientist, but I could probably make games in space. I want to be the first. There are a lot of astronauts over 60, so I guess it‚Äôs possible."</p>
<p>He also mentioned in this interview that he's suffering from, er, "Tom Cruise disease". Basically, he wants to risk his life in a way that would give him a feeling of really being alive. Sounds very Breaking Bad, and I'll be honest, it's underlined the seriousness of the situation in my eyes.</p>
<p>We need to get this man up there to space. I don't care how it goes, whether it ends well for Kojima or not. We know he's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/heres-a-morbid-one-kojima-has-a-usb-stick-full-of-ideas-for-kojima-productions-to-use-after-he-dies">prepared for the worst</a>. He wants it so badly that we desperately need to let him eff around, so he can finally find out. Maybe it won't be all he's imagined it to be. Maybe he'll come running back to Earth and spend long evenings whispering to Geoff Keighley and several famous acting people about how much of a letdown it was.</p>
<p>The worst part is, given how long Kojima's been saying this stuff, we clearly can't rely on the governments or billionaires who currently have access to spacecraft or the means to send people up there to accomplish it.</p>
<p>There's only one solution I can see. If we all stand on each other's shoulders, and I mean the entire population of the planet here, we can form a huge flesh ladder which can convey Hideo to the heavens.</p>
<p>No, before you ask, I don't volunteer to be the person at the very bottom.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/someone-please-just-send-him-up-there-already]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 | Official Cinematic Teaser Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Black Ops 2 is known for having some of the best competitive maps in Call of Duty history, such as Yemen, Raid, Standoff, and Slums. It's very possible Metten is teasing part of the map pool for Black Ops 7, especially as Treyarch is tasked with developing back-to-back Black Ops titles.</p><p dir="ltr">2023's Modern Warfare 3 was a direct follow-up to Modern Warfare 2, and the game launched with a remastered map pool from the original Modern Warfare 2 game. It's possible Black Ops 7 will follow the same formula with remastered maps at launch, giving more time to develop brand-new multiplayer maps for post-launch content.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, Metten discussed the over-40-year time jump between the Black Ops 6 and Black Ops 7 storylines. "Not being tied to a previous era has really given us a lot of creative freedom that you're going to feel and experience in our maps and our weapons and our gear," the developer said.</p><p>Black Ops 7 launches later this year for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC. Activision hasn't announced a specific release date, but the game's full reveal is coming later this summer. For more, make sure to check out all the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-7-announced-marks-first-back-to-back-black-ops-release-eve/1100-6532238/">rumors and announcements for Black Ops 7</a>.</p>

<p>Launching this October</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>If you're into games that go hard on frenetic fun and stylish visuals, then you might want to keep an eye on Full Metal Schoolgirl, a new title headed for the Switch 2 from Yuke's, the developers behind <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/earth_defense_force_world_brothers_2">EARTH DEFENSE FORCE: World Brothers 2</a>.</p>
<p>Launching on <strong>23rd October 2025</strong>, Full Metal Schoolgirl takes place within a dystopian Japan, where you must face off against Meternal Jobz, a corrupt corporate superpower. Climbing the heights of an ever-shifting 100-story skyscraper, you'll be mowing down hordes of undead salarymen with massive guns as you work to enact your sweet revenge.</p>
<p>It looks pretty cool; we love the colourful visuals, the awesome enemy designs, and of course, the gigantic weapons. We only hope the gameplay brings enough variety to keep us occupied for the entire runtime, but so far, early impressions are pretty positive.</p>
<p>Let's check out the key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>- Take Revenge as a Fully-Mechanized Schoolgirl:</strong> Step into the role of a cyborg heroine armed with an arsenal of high-powered weaponry and cutting-edge mechanical upgrades in this exhilarating action shooter. Infiltrate Meternal Jobz, the world‚Äôs most ruthless mega-corporation, and fight back against undead ‚ÄúWorking Dead‚Äù, the relentless corporate grunts that will stop at nothing to protect their employer. Show no mercy ‚Äì scrap them all!</p>
<p><strong>- Engage in Close-Quarters Combat in an Ever-Changing Skyscraper:</strong> Enter a towering 100-story skyscraper where the evil CEO awaits on the top floor. Climb higher while navigating an evolving structure as each new run introduces changing layouts and obstacles from its trap-like security system. Own the battlefield to reach the top!</p>
<p><strong>- Fund Upgrades with Live-Streamed Battles:</strong> Use the power of content creation to win the favor of viewers! Obtain materials and rewards by defeating enemies to improve your character and earn donations for upgrades by live-streaming to a captivated audience. As the number of viewers increases, so does the support. Even in the face of defeat, remember you are not alone‚Ä¶ the viewers of your livestream are cheering you on!</p>
</blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>NetEase has released the first trailer for&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>Season 3, and while it's just an animated teaser, it does reveal who the next two playable characters to join the roster will be.</p>

<p>The trailer sees none other than Phoenix, also known as Jean Grey, battling a "new queen" awakened by the symbiotic supervillain Knull. The story for the season will see Grey and the Phoenix Force battling "the god of the symbiotes".</p>

<p>However, she won't be able to do battle with Knull alone, according to NetEase. She's going to need the help of "a warrior of two worlds who lives to fight against the tide of night", which, if you haven't guessed yet, refers to the vampire hunter Blade.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-rivals-season-3-blade.jpg?itok=xSRu1x6j 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-rivals-season-3-blade.jpg?itok=9Av-xEIg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>Season 3 will bring Blade and Phoenix with it.</figcaption></figure><p>There's been talk about whether Blade would make his debut as a playable character in&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>ever since the vampire hunter was featured in one of the game's earlier seasons, but this will be his first time joining other playable heroes like Iron Man, Captain America, and Black Widow.</p>

<p>Phoenix and Blade's presence won't come as a surprise to anyone who's been paying attention to the discourse; both characters were <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoBestFriendsPlay/comments/1lml6bd/twitch_leaked_the_next_two_marvel_rivals/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">leaked</a>, along with their full movesets, a few days ago.</p>

<p><em>Marvel Rivals</em>' third season, also called The Abyss Awakens, is set to arrive on July 11th, bringing the aforementioned two playable characters with it. If <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-season-2-emma-frost-ultron" rel="nofollow">previous</a>&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-modding-clampdown" rel="nofollow">seasons</a> are anything to go by, there will probably be a host of balance changes too.</p>




<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>itself, it's an<i>&nbsp;Overwatch</i>-style hero shooter that features a roster full of Marvel characters, some of whom are more obscure than others.</p>

<p>On the one hand, favorites like the aforementioned Iron Man and Black Widow, as well as others like Spider-Man and Thor, are present, but you'll also find more off-the-beaten-path characters like Magik and Jeff the Land Shark here.</p>

<p><em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>is available to play for free right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2767030/Marvel_Rivals/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/marvel-rivals/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/marvel-rivals/9n8pmw7qmd3d" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. Season 3 launches on July 11th.</p>

            <p>A few days ago, while walking in the woods, I allowed a mosquito to suck blood from my hand for about 20 seconds. Holding my arm extended like a sweaty middle-aged messiah, I watched as the insect tapped methodically at my skin, watched as it pushed its needle nose into the flesh between my smallest knuckles, watched as its hitherto-imperceptible belly bulged and turned a shiny, jubilant red.</p> <!--more-->
<p>Later, I googled West Nile disease and felt like a fool. I'll not be making a habit of this. Still, it was fascinating to see another creature treat my blood like a resource, to see my vital fluids coalesce into a tiny crystal outside my body and fly off to (eventually) form part of some waterborne larvae, deep in the forest. If you get bitten by a mosquito near Watford in the next few days, apologies - there's a non-zero chance that was "one of mine".</p>

<p>This is my overlong, wince-worthy introduction to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/worship">Worship</a>, a mix of Pikmin and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cult-of-the-lamb">Cult Of The Lamb</a> in which you can wreak all <em>kinds</em> of havoc with your casually dispensed body fluids. Devised by Chasing Rats Games, the game casts you as a hooded zealot roaming a usefully colourless realm of warring eldritch gods. The core mechanic is slicing your hand so that you can paint the ground with your blood trail. The shapes you draw with your gore have supernatural properties.</p>
<p>Scrawl a circle around a clump of villagers and they'll be converted to your cause, their pale, unbelieving bodies turning a bold, occult black. Other shapes let you prep and fire off spells to smoosh enemy cultists and shatter obstacles. The catch, of course, is that your character will eventually run out of blood, aka life, but don't worry, you can hold a button to hoover up all of your claret doodles without, it seems, exposing yourself to a cocktail of bacterial infections. Say what you like about occultists, but they're both surprisingly hygienic and thrifty.</p>
<p>Once converted, villagers serve much the same purpose as Pikmin. You can lob them at things you want beaten up, and have them carry things such as the sinister gemstones you need to sow the land with your cursed altars. You can also slash them open and use their <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Dril">victory wine</a> for sorcery, if you're feeling a touch anaemic.</p>
<p>Find <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1548180/Worship/">a demo for Worship</a> on Steam. The full game - out 16th July 2025 - includes four-player support, and I will absolutely give a prize to whichever co-op team can write out the URL for the UK government advice on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mosquito-bite-avoidance-for-travellers">mosquito bite avoidance</a> in their own gore.

It‚Äôs also one that has had a mixed reputation over multiple entries. I groan and grumble every time I unintentionally activate it; but using it correctly with the right weapons and skills feels amazing.</p><h2 id="h20697"><a id=""></a>How does Sliding work?</h2><p>There are quite a few ways to activate this maneuver. <strong>The most common way to make your hunter slide is by running or rolling down a steep slope.</strong> While running downhill, <strong>take notice when the hunter‚Äôs animation changes to them trying to straighten their body out.</strong> This lasts for just a second before they begin sliding. If you want to trigger it even faster, rolling during a run will immediately transition to the slide animation.</p><p><strong>Certain weapon attacks can also combine with the sliding state, as long as they‚Äôre performed on a sloped surface.</strong> Ironically enough, no attacks that feature your hunter sliding on the ground during the animation will work. The following weapons can trigger a slide in <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-best-weapon-the-charge-blade-guide-1851769340&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-best-weapon-the-charge-blade-guide-1851769340">Charge Blade‚Äôs</a></span> Forward Slash</li><li>Dual Blades‚Äô Demon Flurry Rush</li><li>Gunlance‚Äôs Lunging Upthrust</li><li>Hammer‚Äôs Charge</li><li>Lance‚Äôs Dash Attack</li><li>Sword &amp; Shield‚Äôs Advancing Slash</li></ul><p>If any of the above has sent you zooming down a hill, it might help to know that this maneuver does have a purpose. Every weapon has unique actions that can be performed while sliding. Some are simple aerial attacks that are best used for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-how-to-mount-master-mounter-1851775446&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-how-to-mount-master-mounter-1851775446">mounting</a></span>, while others, like the Sword &amp; Shield, have multiple options and follow-ups. My personal favorite is getting crazy air with the Dual Blades and then spinning down a monster‚Äôs back to inflict some major damage. These are all pretty fun once you get the hang of them.</p><h2 id="h20698"><a id=""></a>How to master Sliding</h2><figure id="" data-id="5e9ff074ead72fab2610db85900f82a7" data-recommend-id="image://5e9ff074ead72fab2610db85900f82a7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Change Equipment screen, highlighting the Buttery Leathercraft Group Skill, Affinity Sliding." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Change Equipment screen, highlighting the Buttery Leathercraft Group Skill, Affinity Sliding." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5e9ff074ead72fab2610db85900f82a7" data-recommend-id="image://5e9ff074ead72fab2610db85900f82a7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Change Equipment screen, highlighting the Buttery Leathercraft Group Skill, Affinity Sliding." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The most important tip I can give here is to be aware of what slopes might trigger a slide. The incline in the back of the Training Area is an excellent example. When you‚Äôre out gathering or hunting a monster, go ahead and experiment by rolling down some hills. This will be handy knowledge for future hunts so that you don‚Äôt slide when you don‚Äôt mean to. I know I wasn‚Äôt the only person to accidentally rush down the Windward Plains‚Äô desert dunes while hunting <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-mon-hun-arch-tempered-rey-dau-1851782762&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-mon-hun-arch-tempered-rey-dau-1851782762">Arch-Tempered Rey Dau</a></span>.</p><p>Once you feel confident about using this technique when you intend to, it‚Äôs time to consider increasing its offensive power. Affinity Sliding is a skill that provides a boost to your <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-affinity-meaning-negative-upgrade-1851775744&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-affinity-meaning-negative-upgrade-1851775744">Affinity</a></span> when sliding on terrain. This is another case where the skill‚Äôs description fails to convey just how amazing a buff you receive. I‚Äôve confirmed through testing that it provides a massive 30 percent Affinity boost that lasts for 30 seconds. No matter if your build is low on Affinity or already boasts a high percentage, this is an impressive upgrade.</p><p>The main drawback is that this is tied to the Buttery Leathercraft Group Skill, which is unfortunately attached to some weaker armors. If you‚Äôre going to hunt a monster in a hilly area and want high Affinity, including it in a build might be a good strategy. Just try not to activate this buff when you‚Äôre too close to a monster, since the skill won‚Äôt kick in until you‚Äôve been sliding for about a second.</p><p>I can‚Äôt blame anyone who gets annoyed by this mechanic. Sliding past an enemy is a huge inconvenience, especially if you have to run back up a big hill to continue the fight. Understanding how to trigger it and the benefits of doing so will be a big help going forward.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mhw-slide-hill-how-to-attack-1851785365]]></content:encoded>

As reported by @videotechuk_ on X / Twitter, the update adds a new zombie infected mode, the first mission of which takes place in Armadillo.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Rockstar has launched a new zombie "infected" mode in Red Dead Online as part of the new Strange Tales of The West telegram missions </p><p>The first mission takes place in Armadillo and the main objective to kill infected and bring them to a wagon as a team.</p><p>Infected carry knives. <a href="https://t.co/TC9uOuIDEI" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/TC9uOuIDEI</a></p></div>‚Äî ben (@videotechuk_) <a href="https://twitter.com/videotechuk_/status/1940025158225264674?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 1, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Fans are still digesting the news, with posts across social media and subreddits showing the level of excitement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But what does this mean for Red Dead Online and parent game Red Dead Redemption 2? Given the zombie nature of the update, some are wondering if Rockstar has prepared an Undead Nightmare-style expansion for Red Dead Redemption 2. That would come as a huge shock given the studio‚Äôs all-hands-on-deck focus on next year‚Äôs Grand Theft Auto VI, but perhaps more likely is a next-gen port.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In May, <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/exclusive-red-dead-redemption-2-for-nintendo-switch-2-may-arrive-this-year-1544753/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>GameReactor</u></a> reported that a Nintendo Switch 2 version of Rockstar's Wild West romp was on the way, along with a "next-gen upgrade patch" that would improve the game for current-gen systems (PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S). Both could be released later in 2025, according to the site.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans have long called for an updated version of Red Dead Redemption 2, which is considered a masterpiece. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/10/25/red-dead-redemption-2-review"><u>IGN's Red Dead Redemption 2 review</u></a> returned a 10/10. We said: "Red Dead Redemption 2 is a game of rare quality; a meticulously polished open-world ode to the outlaw era."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, Red Dead Online fans are enjoying digging into Strange Tales of the West, which is officially described as Vol.1. This suggests another content drop is coming. Whatever the future holds, it seems Red Dead Online is back from the dead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-798">Diablo 2</a> celebrated its 25th anniversary on June 29, and developer Blizzard celebrated the occasion with a cryptic <a href="https://x.com/Diablo/status/1939005882940973069" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">tweet</a> that has fans of the classic ARPG speculating wildly about what it could mean.</p><p dir="ltr">The tweet states, "Happy Birthday Diablo 2. Twenty-five years have passed since our first foray into the Burning Hells." It's the second part of the tweet, however, that has fans excited.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/Diablo/status/1939005882940973069" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Happy Birthday Diablo 2.<br>25 years have passed since our first foray into the Burning Hells.<br>If you think you've seen and done it all, just wait for the chaos we've yet to unleash. <a href="https://t.co/zqXTzc4mOL" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/zqXTzc4mOL</a></p>  ‚Äî Diablo (@Diablo) <a href="https://twitter.com/Diablo/status/1939005882940973069?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 28, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">"If you think you've seen and done it all, just wait for the chaos we've yet to unleash," the tweet concludes.</p><p dir="ltr">What, exactly, that means is up for debate, but players are certainly intrigued. Blizzard released Diablo 2: Resurrected in 2021, bringing changes to the over-two-decade-old RPG that included updated visuals and, in subsequent patches, significant balance changes like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-diablo-2-resurrected-runewords-for-patch-2-4-revealed/1100-6499724/" data-ref-id="1100-6499724">new runewords</a>. Major updates to Diablo 2: Resurrected largely stopped following <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-2-resurrecteds-terror-zones-offer-a-welcome-new-endgame-option/1100-6507734/" data-ref-id="1100-6507734">patch 2.5 and its addition of Terror Zones</a> in 2022, but Blizzard's tweet seems to imply more could be on the way.</p><p dir="ltr">There is no shortage of quality-of-life updates to Diablo 2 that players <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo_2_Resurrected/comments/15jv4ii/what_is_your_diablo_2_resurrected_wish_list_for/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">would love to see added</a> to the game, including things like a customizable loot filter, additional character slots, and stackable gems and runes. But those kinds of relatively small changes seem unlikely to be worthy of a 25th-anniversary tweet.</p><p dir="ltr">Instead, players are thinking bigger. For serious Diablo 2 players who are pushing their builds and characters to the max, the game's hardest Hell difficulty eventually doesn't pose much of a challenge. Some players are speculating Blizzard is hinting at a new, harder difficulty. Others are hoping for a new act or expansion, or possibly even a new class. Despite Diablo 2's popularity, the game only received one expansion, 2001's Lord of Destruction.</p><p dir="ltr">If Blizzard is indeed teasing major new content for Diablo 2, it wouldn't be the first time Blizzard created new content for one of its classic games. Blizzard re-released the 2006-era version of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a> as WoW Classic in 2019. The old-school version of Blizzard's MMORPG has gone on to receive new content on experimental seasonal servers, and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-major-new-wow-classic-project-is-in-the-works-and-fans-are-hoping-for-one-thing-in-particular/1100-6531868/" data-ref-id="1100-6531868">WoW Classic team has said it has "big plans and big ambitions"</a> as it relates to the future of the game.</p><p dir="ltr">With that in mind, it's not out of the question that Blizzard could create more new content for Diablo 2: Resurrected, as the game still has a dedicated following. Even with nothing more to go on than rampant speculation (players on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo2/comments/1lms36x/blizzard_tweet_re_d2_25th_anniversary_if_you/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> are trying to not get their hopes up and attempting to lower their expectations), it's clear Blizzard has hit upon a desire among the Diablo 2 playerbase for new content. Now, all fans can do is sit and wait for more news.</p><p dir="ltr">In other Diablo news, Diablo 4's new season kicks off today and will let players <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-9-will-let-players-build-their-own-spells/1100-6531782/" data-ref-id="1100-6531782">craft their own spells</a>, as well as bring <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-9-will-bring-big-permanent-changes-to-nightmare-dungeons/1100-6532690/" data-ref-id="1100-6532690">permanent changes to the game's Nightmare dungeons</a>. Meanwhile, Diablo Immortal recently revealed its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-immortal-is-putting-a-new-spin-on-a-classic-diablo-class/1100-6532742/" data-ref-id="1100-6532742">new spin on the franchise's Druid class</a>.</p>
