			<p>The PlayStation is approaching its 30th anniversary of the first PlayStation console, and Hideaki Nishino on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/19/celebrating-30-years-of-playstation-with-a-nostalgic-look/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation blog</a> has announced that there will be a PlayStation 30th Anniversary Collection. The aesthetic is that of the PlayStation 1 and pays homage to the console that launched on December 3, 1994. The collection will be sold in "highly limited supply," as the consoles won't only just come with the limited edition skin but will come with original PlayStation controller-style cable housing, a sticker, and a Paperclip, as an example.</p>
<p><iframe title="Introducing the PlayStation 30th Anniversary Collection" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/amdZnHooTkk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Not only will the PlayStation 5 Pro get this bundle, but the PlayStation 5 Digital Edition will also get the limited edition version of the console, as well as the DualSense controllers and a Console Cover for the Disc Drive (which is sold separately).</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the PlayStation Portal Remote Player will also receive a limited edition skin in the 30th Anniversary Collection. Since the PlayStation 5 Pro was announced recently along with <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-price-test-consequences/">its price tag</a>, it's fair to assume that the limited edition console is going to cost a pretty penny. At the moment, it has not been announced how much any of the items will cost, but if you get the full PlayStation 30th Anniversary collection, it can be expected to cost at least $850.</p>
<p>In total, there will only be 12,300 units of the PlayStation 5 Pro Console available for customers to purchase, all of which will have their limited edition numbers etched into the unit, representing the month and date of the first PlayStation console launch.</p>
<p>For those who want to get hold of this bundle, it will be available for pre-order on September 26 on the PlayStation website. For regions where the direct website isn't available, pre-orders will begin on September 26 at participating retailers. The PlayStation 5 Digital Edition bundle will be available for pre-order at participating retailers beginning October 10, with the DualSense Wireless Controller being available for pre-order at participating retailers beginning September 26.</p>
<p>It's also possible to buy the Portal Remote Player and DualSense Edge Wireless Controller on their own, rather than purchasing the whole bundle. According to the blog post, Sony has a lot of things lined up for the anniversary of the console, such as a free weekend of online multiplayer, PS5 Esports tournaments, and some of the most iconic PlayStation game soundtracks available to stream.</p>
<p>Sony has set up a <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/30th-anniversary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">page specifically</a> for the 30th anniversary so that those interested can see what is upcoming for Sony and whether anything else will be added in the future.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/19/24248947/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-cloud-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Preorders are now open for <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</em> through the Microsoft Store. The <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/09/19/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-preview/">next installment of the franchise</a> will launch on Xbox and PC on November 19th, with updates that include new aircraft like hot air balloons and a more realistic-looking simulated earth. But the most welcome upgrade could be a much smaller installation size.</p><p>The current version of <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator</em> needs over 130GB of storage, but that’s just for the base version of the game. Players can enhance their experience by downloading additional aircraft or installing world updates that bring more details to local scenery and airports, but that can gobble up even more storage. Those playing on the Xbox Series S, which only offers players 364GB of storage, could potentially see almost all of that disappear on one game.</p><p>Microsoft says the installation size for <em>MSFS 2024</em> has been reduced to “about 30GB” by “tapping into the latest cloud streaming technology” and “streaming in the higher detailed areas that are only necessary for your flight path.” The game will no longer require players to download hefty world updates, but not at the cost of the game looking worse. That data will instead be streamed on demand with higher-resolution graphics being swapped in as players soar closer to landmarks like airports and cities.</p><div><figcaption>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 <em>will accurately depict how hot air balloons inflate and fly.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Microsoft</cite></p></div><p>Aspiring pilots still can’t use <em>Flight Simulator 2024</em> as a way to earn their license, but it does introduce a new career system that will mimic an aviation career. Players start off by taking flying lessons that include more preflight procedures like route planning based on weather forecasts. As their skills improve, they’ll be able to take on jobs like search and rescue missions, aerial firefighting, and commercial flights, before eventually earning enough virtual money to start and manage their own companies within the game that includes maintaining a private fleet.</p><p>New aircraft coming to <em>MSFS 2024</em> include the Boeing 747-400 LCF Dreamlifter, a custom variation of the plane that Boeing uses to help manufacture the 787. For pilots who prefer something less stressful than flying airplane parts around a simulated world, the game will feature hot air balloons powered by a realistic “soft body simulation.” Turning on the burners will actually cause the balloons to inflate and gain altitude.</p><div><figcaption><em>Improved ground detailing in </em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024<em> will also affect where and how some aircraft can land.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Microsoft</cite></p></div><p><em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</em> will be available in several editions, ranging in price from $69.99 to $199.99 depending on the number of planes and airports that come bundled. The Standard Edition will also be available through Xbox Game Pass starting on launch day.</p><p>Those who’ve been playing the previous version of the game for four years will have a chance to put their piloting skills to good use earning a simulated salary, and <em>MSFS 2024</em> will potentially let them free up some storage space so they can try another game.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>With God of War Ragnarok's PC release coming soon, Sony revealed that there is an option to reduce the frequency in which players hear puzzle hints from other characters.</p><p>According to the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/18/god-of-war-ragnarok-brings-a-host-of-new-features-to-pc-available-tomorrow/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PlayStation Blog</a>, the new option is in the Gameplay Settings tab. Enabling it will make it so that companions like Atreus and Mimir won't provide puzzle hints nearly as often. For some players, the banter was quite annoying. While the game's puzzles aren't overly difficult to solve, some players still like to figure them out by themselves.</p><p>The game is also getting cinematic audio descriptions, which plays audio descriptions of visual events during cutscenes. This helps provide additional context alongside the spoken dialogue in order to create a more detailed experience for players with low vision. The feature can be enabled under the audio accessibility menu.</p><p>Sony also confirmed that both the puzzle-hint frequency and audio-description features will be added to the console versions soon.</p><p>God of War Ragnarok launches for PC on September 19.

Recently, Game Developer </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/why-and-how-you-should-leave-unity-and-unreal-to-make-your-own-engine">published</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> an article about Rez Graham’s talk at GDC 2024 in San Francisco. It hit home for me as someone who built their game on a custom engine instead of using what was already out on the market. During the development of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Highfleet</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, I often questioned whether that was the right call. So, is building your own still worth it, or should you stick with the big-name engines? And if it’s worth it – when?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Custom engines were necessary for pushing performance limits or creating something truly unique. However, with industry-standard engines like Unreal and Unity offering increasingly powerful and flexible tools, the need for custom engines continues to decrease. On the one hand, this creates a degree of uniformity, as many games are developed using the same foundational technology, which gives the games a familiar appearance to players. At the same time, it lowers the barrier to entry, allowing more talented indie developers to bring their ideas to life. The key is determining whether the time and effort required to build a custom engine aligns with your project’s goals.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Three misconceptions about building a custom engine"><span>Three misconceptions about building a custom engine</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>1. A game engine is just about rendering sprites</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One common misconception (that we also initially had) when deciding to build a custom engine is thinking that an engine is only about rendering sprites, animations or shaders. In reality, engines come packed with a wide range of functionality that you’ll have to implement yourself if you're building from scratch, such as:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Rendering sprites, animations, or shaders.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Handling physics and collision detection.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Managing input from various devices (mouse, keyboard, different types of controllers, racing wheels).</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ensuring multi-platform compatibility (minimizing effort for porting your game to PS/Xbox/Nintendo/mobile platforms).</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Built-in opportunities for creating multiplayer functionality and handling network communications.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Support for complex audio systems, including spatial audio and dynamic soundtracks.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Optimizing performance for various hardware configurations, from high-end PCs to mobile devices.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A host of other details, such as built-in support for multiple languages, saving/loading game states, and more.</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Underestimation of the scope of features that modern engines provide can lead to months or even years of extra development time, especially when you have to implement things that most proprietary engines already handle out of the box.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>2. I know my game’s needs and can build a custom engine around them</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This one is incredibly common. You might think that you fully understand what is required in your specific case and create an engine that is the perfect fit. But in reality, game development rarely goes according to plan, especially in indie projects. You might start with a simple concept, but as the project grows, you will need to scale the game world or add more complex effects. That’s when you realize your custom engine wasn’t built for these new demands, and then performance starts to suffer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Take the render pipeline, for example. Let’s say a small indie team builds a custom 2D engine, and everything runs fine — until they decide to scale the map 10x or add more detailed special effects. Suddenly, the engine struggles, and performance drops. At this point, the team has to either optimize or, in many cases, rewrite parts of the engine.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Maybe the game was built around DirectX 11, but now they need features from DirectX 12, which forces a full migration. Our </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Highfleet</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> engine went through this process, moving from DirectX 9 to 10, and eventually to 11, with each transition requiring significant rework.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Imagine – a studio sets out to create a 2D platformer, like most traditional ones. The designer outlines the vision, and the developers build a custom 2D engine tailored to the game. But after much of the work is already done, the designer decides the game would look better with 3D trees in the background, casting soft shadows on the 2D characters. For a developer using a proprietary engine, this would still present challenges, but for someone with a custom engine, it could be catastrophic. The engine wasn’t built for 3D rendering, and 3D wasn’t even a possibility in this case, so now the team would need to go back to square one: researching theory, planning the architecture and render pipeline, coding the new functionality, integrating it with the existing engine, testing, optimizing, and testing again.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Even smaller, less drastic, but frequent changes to the requirements for a custom engine can turn it into a never-ending development project, taking valuable time away from refining the actual gameplay.</span></p><p>Screenshot from 2D platformer game Shovel Knight. Image credit: CNET.com</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Proprietary engines are built to handle these kinds of changes from the start, allowing you to adapt much faster and focus on what really matters — your game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>3. Building your own engine is faster (or cheaper)</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It’s easy to think that building your own engine will save time and money, but that’s rarely the case. To develop a game using an engine like Unity or Unreal Engine 5, you need to invest time learning them. While this can take a while, it's still a much smaller time investment compared to building your own engine from scratch and learning the underlying technology needed for it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For example, once a programmer understands Unity or UE5, they can quickly implement new features. When a new version of DirectX comes out or new rendering techniques (like RTX) become popular, the engine developers handle the integration of those technologies. All the programmer has to do is update their engine and apply the new features in their game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When you’re building your own engine, though, updates don’t come automatically. If a new version of DirectX is released or new rendering trends emerge, you have to study the theory behind those technologies, and manually integrate them into your engine, and only then can you start using them in your game. This can be a complex and time-consuming process, especially for a small team. For example, a quick YouTube tutorial on “How to add RTX lighting in UE5” is 40 seconds long. But to add RTX lighting to your own engine, in a way that meets all your game’s needs and is well-optimized, would take much more time and effort.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another big advantage of proprietary engines is the vast amount of pre-existing assets, shaders, and algorithms made by other developers, which you can easily plug into your game. In contrast, with a custom engine, you’re constantly reinventing the wheel, chasing industry trends, and building everything from the ground up. Even technologies that have existed for years — such as various lighting algorithms, shadows, bloom, bump mapping, diverse post-processing effects, weather systems, water surfaces, etc. — will require manual implementation from your side. Yes, open-source projects with the right licensing, developer forums, and sites like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://shadertoy.com/">ShaderToy</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> can be incredibly helpful resources, but at the end of the day, it’s up to you to integrate all of that into your game.</span></p><p>Shadertoy.com, Greek Temple shader by Inigo Quilez</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is exactly what Rez Graham was talking about at the GDC conference I mentioned earlier. The key benefit of using proprietary engines is what he called "automatic knowledge." By using a well-established engine, you gain access to institutional knowledge shared by other developers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And about the cost — yes, Unity and other proprietary engines do charge fees, but those costs are minimal compared to the time it takes to develop your own engine. Unless you’re selling millions of copies, building your own engine doesn’t offer much financial benefit. You could argue that it pays off in the long run, but that’s only true if your engine is robust enough to support multiple projects in the future.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What about libraries?"><span>What about libraries?</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Indeed, some of the features proprietary engines offer can be achieved in custom engines by using third-party libraries. For example, you can handle physics with libraries like Box2D, and sound with BASS. However, while these libraries can be helpful, you still need to integrate them into your project, and they won’t cover all the needs of a game developer in each area.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The main challenge with using standalone libraries is that they only handle specific tasks, and it’s up to you to ensure everything integrates smoothly. Proprietary engines, on the other hand, already have these systems built in, reducing the need for heavy customization and allowing you to focus more on game development rather than technical integration.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What does this mean for the industry?"><span>What does this mean for the industry?</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As you’ve likely guessed, the challenges mentioned above push most developers to choose proprietary engines, which is a logical and justified decision. However, looking at the bigger picture, this creates a certain degree of technological monopolization within the gaming industry, sadly leading to less project diversity.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Because many developers use the same engines, like Unity, they might end up using the same assets and shaders, causing games to feel similar or even – generic. Additionally, proprietary engines are often optimized for more traditional game types. If a developer is working on something truly unique, there are cases where a custom engine could better serve the project’s needs.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A great example of a justified use of a custom game engine is the well-known Noita. The game has a truly unique concept that likely wouldn’t have worked with any existing proprietary engine, a uniqueness captured in the name of its engine, "Falling Everything." Yet, Noita doesn’t rely on advanced graphical effects, it’s single-player, and it was built exclusively for one platform — PC.</span></p><p>Screenshot from Noita.

You have no other choice</span></span></p><p>Screenshot from Mount &amp; Blade. Image credit: Steam</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sometimes, you don’t have the option of using an existing engine because the game you want to create relies on new technology that isn’t supported by current engines — or can’t be adapted as easily as you’d like.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This might mean building a large-scale simulation that needs really low-level control to run efficiently (like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dwarf Fortre</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">ss or</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> Noita</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">). In cases like these, using a standard engine could slow you down because it won’t give you the flexibility to optimize at the level you need.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another example is when your game mechanics are so unique that no existing engine fits the vision. Games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mount &amp; Blade</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> needed custom engines because their gameplay doesn’t follow conventional patterns, and trying to make a standard engine work would have meant constantly running into limitations or forcing it to do things it wasn’t originally built for.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>&nbsp;2. You have (really) big plans</span></span></p><p>Screenshot from The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. Image credit: dualshockers.com</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you’re thinking long-term and planning to grow your studio, building your own engine could make sense. This isn't just a one-off investment for a single game — it’s something you’ll use across future projects as you scale. But, it’s important to understand the magnitude of resources required to pull this off.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">By making your own engine, you can optimize your workflow specifically for the kind of games you’re making. This is the path that CD Projekt RED took. Their REDEngine was developed over many years and was used in hits like The Witcher series and Cyberpunk 2077. However, what’s telling is that even with all the arguments in favor of using their own engine — sufficient human and financial resources, extensive experience in engine development, and significant sales volumes that would make third-party engine licensing fees substantial — CD Projekt RED still decided to retire REDEngine and partner with Epic Games to use Unreal Engine.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>3. You want to be technically, legally, and financially independent</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you're using a third-party engine and encounter a bug or missing feature that impacts your game, you often have no choice but to wait for the engine’s developers to fix it. With a custom engine, you can solve these problems immediately as they come up, giving you full control over your development process.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another downside of proprietary engines is the cost. For example, Unreal Engine 5 (UE5) takes a 5% royalty on gross sales after your first million dollars in revenue. But what’s worse is that the owner of the engine can change the terms of use at any time. This risk became very real during the Unity pricing controversy in late 2023. Although they rolled back some of those changes, the incident highlighted a serious risk for developers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With a custom engine, you avoid these uncertainties — no unexpected fees, no sudden changes in licensing, and total control over your tech.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Conclusion"><span>Conclusion</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Writing your own engine is a complex task. It’s a natural fit for large studios working on AAA projects since they have the manpower and resources to develop, maintain, and update their engines to stay on top of modern technologies. For these studios, the cost of developing their own engine is easily offset, especially by avoiding fees associated with third-party engines. Plus, they’re often working on multiple projects, making the investment in a custom engine even more worthwhile.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Indie developers can also benefit from creating their own engine, particularly if they’re working on a highly specialized single-player game that doesn’t require multiplayer support, multi platform compatibility, or technologies like complex graphical effects, ray tracing, or global illumination. Additionally, indie devs may want to avoid the risks that come with relying on proprietary engines and their changing terms. However, even in these cases, it’s essential to weigh the pros and cons carefully — using a proprietary engine might still be the better option in the end.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/powerwash-simulator-shrek-dlc-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix and FuturLab have revealed the&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator Shrek&nbsp;</em>DLC release date, so get ready to hose down a bunch of&nbsp;<em>Shrek</em>-related locations and objects. As the Steam page says, "playtime is ogre".</p>
<p>Landing on October 10th, the&nbsp;<em>Shrek&nbsp;</em>DLC is the latest in a long line of crossovers for&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator</em>. Other collaborations have included&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/powerwash-simulator-final-fantasy-vii-crossover-dlc-arrives-in-march"><em>Final Fantasy VII</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/powerwash-simulator-back-to-future-dlc"><em>Back to the Future</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/powerwash-simulator-warhammer-40k-dlc"><em>Warhammer 40k</em></a>.</p>
<p>In this particular DLC, you'll be able to take your powerwash tools to five different&nbsp;<em>Shrek</em>-themed maps, each of which has a veritable kingdom's worth of dirt and grime for you to blast off.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/powerwash-simulator-shrek-dlc-swamp.jpg?itok=djRLIFbZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/powerwash-simulator-shrek-dlc-swamp.jpg?itok=lgpFHnS- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you're a&nbsp;<em>Shrek&nbsp;</em>fan, the latest&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator&nbsp;</em>DLC should have you ogre the moon.</figcaption></figure><p>Here are the five maps you'll be able to explore and hose down as part of next month's&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator Shrek&nbsp;</em>DLC.</p>
<ul><li>Duloc</li>
<li>Hansel's Honeymoon Hideaway</li>
<li>Shrek's Swamp</li>
<li>Fairy Godmother's Potion Factory</li>
<li>Dragon's Lair</li>
</ul><p>As well as all of these maps, you'll also get access to a custom knight model for your character, and your power washer will take on the appearance of a sword, for what is knightly duty if not vanquishing filth from the kingdom?</p>
<p>If you want to see the&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator Shrek&nbsp;</em>DLC in action, then you can do so right here via the release date announcement trailer. Somebody once told me it's pretty good.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator</em>, it's a work sim game in which the aim is to visit a series of grimy locations and hose them down with your power washer.</p>
<p>Playing either solo or with your friends in online multiplayer, you'll build a business, switch up your tools for the job, and generally relax as you purge dirt and restore cleanliness to the land.</p>
<p>Although our own reviewer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/powerwash-simulator-review">wasn't particularly impressed</a>,&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator&nbsp;</em>has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/powerwash-simulator-player-count">found a niche for itself</a>, garnering enough interest for Miniclip to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/miniclip-futurlab-acquisition">acquire developer FuturLab</a> earlier this year.</p>
<p>You can grab&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1290000/PowerWash_Simulator/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/powerwash-simulator/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/powerwash-simulator/9NHDJC0NW20M" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/powerwash-simulator-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/greedfall-2-early-access-roadmap-promises-new-companions-and-more.985794/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/greedfall-2-early-access-roadmap<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Spiders and publisher Nacon have revealed the&nbsp;<em>GreedFall 2&nbsp;</em>Early Access roadmap, showing off what's coming to the RPG in the months before it launches in full.</p>
<p>When&nbsp;<em>GreedFall 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/greedfall-2-release-date">launches next week</a>, you'll have access to "the beginning of the story and its main quest", according to Spiders. This includes character creation and three zones, each of which has secrets to discover and allies to meet.</p>
<p>After that, in fall, you'll get access to a new companion and their associated quests, as well as an extension for the main story. You'll also be able to explore a new region and access&nbsp;<em>GreedFall 2</em>'s main hub, as well as exploring two new skill trees.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/greedfall-2-early-access-roadmap-full.jpg?itok=_WCHjivD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/greedfall-2-early-access-roadmap-full.jpg?itok=vt1JkaFq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>There's lots coming to&nbsp;<em>GreedFall 2&nbsp;</em>over the next few months.</figcaption></figure><p>Another new companion is on the way in the winter update for&nbsp;<em>GreedFall 2</em>, and you'll get to experience their quests at that point too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The winter update will also bring the game's crafting system with it, as well as new local quests to take on in two of the main regions. A new skill tree and associated abilities will also be introduced at this point.</p>
<p>After that, you can look forward to lots more&nbsp;<em>GreedFall 2&nbsp;</em>content, including new companion and faction quests, a whole new region to explore, and more main story to experience. Suffice it to say that&nbsp;<em>GreedFall 2&nbsp;</em>is just getting started.</p>
<p>Spiders also says that it plans to continuously update&nbsp;<em>GreedFall 2&nbsp;</em>with balance tweaks and content "depending on your feedback", so the above might not even be everything that's heading to the game in the coming months. Exciting!</p>

<p><em>GreedFall 2&nbsp;</em>is, as you've probably guessed, the followup to the original&nbsp;<em>GreedFall</em>. First <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/greedfall-2-release-announced-2024">revealed in May 2022</a>, the game will serve as a prequel to the original&nbsp;<em>GreedFall&nbsp;</em>and will cast you as a Teer Fradee native thrust into a "treacherous" political climate.</p>
<p>The game's developer, Spiders, was recently embroiled in a dispute with its management regarding working conditions and employee pay, but that dispute was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/spiders-strike-policies-negotiations">resolved in the employees' favor earlier this month</a>.</p>
<p>You'll be able to play&nbsp;<em>GreedFall 2&nbsp;</em>when it launches in Early Access for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1997660/GreedFall_II_The_Dying_World/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010517" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and Xbox Series X|S on September 24th. Stay tuned for more.</p>

All the consoles and accessories are cast in classic PlayStation gray and feature the old-school multicolored PlayStation logo creating a look designed to target every gaming 30-something’s nostalgia organ with surgical precision.</p><p>The 30th anniversary collection features a PS5 Pro bundle that includes the console, two controllers, a controller charging station, a console stand, a sticker, and a matching cover if you purchase the Pro disc drive.

There will be 12,300 units of the PlayStation 5 Pro Console – 30th Anniversary Limited Edition Bundle available for customers to purchase, with limited edition numbers etched onto the unit. The number represents the month and date of the first PlayStation console launch.</p><p>We’ve had five fantastic console generations since the launch of our very first PlayStation console. We’re proud of the innovations and experiences we’ve brought to the PlayStation community over the years as we kept up with the latest technology as it advanced. In the early days, the number of pixels was around 300-thousand, and now it is more than 8 million pixels for 4K on screen. Additionally, stereo sound evolved into surround sound – and now we are using 3D audio. The game controller has also evolved, starting with buttons, then came the analog stick and later vibration – and now we have haptics and even adaptive triggers. Everything we’ve done is to ensure PlayStation is the best place to play. We believe the beginning of our journey is an important part of our history at Sony Interactive Entertainment, which is why we are honoring this moment by bringing the original PlayStation design theme into the latest products for PlayStation 5 to commemorate the last 30 years. As we look ahead to the future, we will continue to innovate as technology evolves, so you can enjoy each memorable moment in your continued journey with PlayStation.</p><p>Please be sure to check in with us regularly on our 30th anniversary webpage as we’ll have more fun celebration activities as we head towards our 30th anniversary.</p><p>We’d like to give a heartfelt thanks to everyone for being a PlayStation fan over the last 30 years.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-5-pro-and-digital-edition-30th-anniversary-limited-edition-consoles-announced<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Sony has announced a limited edition classic-coloured console range for its 30th anniversary, with versions of both the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-announces-digital-only-playstation-5-pro-costs-700">newly-announced PlayStation 5 Pro</a> and the PS5 Digital Edition, both sporting a retro grey finish.
</p>
<p>
As you'd expect, there's a matching grey-coloured DualSense controller to go with the consoles. There's also a grey PlayStation Portal - remember that? - too.
</p>
<p>
Both the PS5 Pro and the PS5 Digital Edition also have classic-coloured PlayStation logos and textured plastic with the PlayStation symbols embossed in.

<p>
The entire range will only be available "while supplies last", though the PS5 Pro in particular will be in very short supply. Only 12,300 30th Anniversary PS5 Pro consoles will be sold (which Sony explained is  a reference to the brand's original 3rd December launch date). Each will be individually numbered.
</p>
<p>
Sony will open pre-orders on 26th September via direct.playstation.com ahead of the range's release on 21st November.</p>
<p>Crucially, there's no word yet on how much any of this will cost. (If a standard PS5 Pro costs £700, any guesses for what this might set you back?)
</p>
<p>
Both consoles will be packaged with a DualSense controller (the Pro gets a DualSense Edge as well) and also include a smattering of extra items. You get a retro PlayStation controller cable, four cable ties themed to the four PlayStation controller button shapes, a PlayStation sticker, a PlayStation poster, and a PlayStation paperclip.

The first PlayStation console launched in Japan on 3rd December 1994 - an anniversary that's now fast approaching. (Here in the UK, we had to wait until September 1995 for the PS1 to arrive on these shores.)

            <link>https://aftermath.site/big-love-sister-wives</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/big-love-sister-wives-and-feeling-religious-on-tv.985758/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/big-love-sister-wives<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I don’t think I’m alone in trying to fill the <em>Succession</em>-shaped hole in my life since the show ended last year. I worked my way through some of HBO’s other tentpoles, like <em>The Sopranos</em> (meh; please don’t yell at me), <em>Deadwood </em>(Luke was right that I shouldn’t have watched the movie), and yet another run through <em>The Leftovers</em>. Recently, I watched all five seasons of <em>Big Love</em>, a show about a polygamist family in Utah that ran from 2006 to 2011.&nbsp;</p><p>I was surprised that <em>Big Love</em> mostly predates <em>Sister Wives</em>, a polygamist reality show on HBO sister network TLC that started its 19th season last weekend, just as I finished my <em>Big Love</em> watch. <em>Big Love</em> stars the fictional Henrickson family: husband Bill; first and “public” wife Barb; second wife Nikki, a daughter of the head of the abusive polygamist compound Bill grew up on and was expelled from; and third and youngest wife Margene. <em>Sister Wives</em> husband Kody Brown has said he’s <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/sister-wives-kody-brown-said-could-relate-bill-hbos-big-love.html/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">aware of and can relate to</a> <em>Big Love, </em>but that seems to be where the overlap ends. Both shows explore how people live their unusual faith together, but they do so in unexpectedly different ways.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Big Love</em> had five seasons. Here’s a video from HBO recapping seasons one through four; I’ll be honest I don’t know how to deal with spoiler warnings for a show that’s been off the air for 13 years, but proceed at your own risk.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Big Love: Catch Up on Seasons 1 thru 4 (HBO)" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C7Y0KfL5zzI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>The major tension for much of <em>Big Love</em> is that the Henricksons will be found out for being polygamist and incur the wrath of their community and the mainstream LDS (Latter Day Saints, or, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/17/us/mormon-church-name-trnd/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">contentiously</a>, Mormon) church, which decries polygamy in its history and the satellite faiths that exist today. Alongside that, the Henricksons have familial tensions: Nikki’s continued relationship to the compound, Margene’s efforts to make friends and find herself, Barb coming to chafe against the demands and constraints of their way of life. You’d think all that would be more than enough fodder for a show, but <em>Big Love</em> isn’t content to stay in the family lane, sprawling out into plotlines that sometimes stretch the bounds of believability. There’s drama at Bill’s home goods stores. The family tries to open a Mormon-friendly casino. People poison and bludgeon and shoot each other. There’s a big trial and a federal investigation and interference in the investigation. There’s a kidnapping and rescue mission. There’s medical experimentation. There’s underage marriage. (It’s worth noting that the show ran at the height of attention paid to FLDS, or Fundamentalist LDS,&nbsp; leader <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Jeffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warren Jeffs</a>, whom the compound plotlines feel clearly inspired by.) It’s hard to tell if the show wants to be a domestic drama or some kind of thriller, and it careens wildly in ways that are exciting, but also make it hard to know what kind of show it is.&nbsp;</p><p>A friend of mine<a href="https://x.com/dialmformichele/status/1803646714819105180" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> suggested</a> seeing <em>Big Love</em> as a sitcom rather than a prestige show. Kody Brown called it “a soap opera.” I think both these definitions are pretty accurate: It has great fundamentals in terms of a cast of characters with strong identities and goals, but at the end of every episode and every season, they basically stay the same. The later seasons attempt to create some movement, and do to an extent, but the characters felt like they always fell back into their roles, rather than growing in the way you’d expect in a prestige drama.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The most intriguing thing I found about the show was how sympathetic it is to polygamy while also making it seem so utterly unappealing. Despite how often the family insists they love each other, and how much Bill bangs on about his commitment to his family and the principle of plural marriage, the family is mostly a site for narrative conflict rather than genuine love. The cast is full of children who basically exist to be sent out of the room. The wives clash over and grapple with the logistics of their lives–the finances, the scheduling–but the show doesn’t dwell too much on how it would actually <em>feel</em> to be in a marriage that requires weekly meetings. I frequently wondered why the family didn’t just break up.&nbsp;(I should point out that <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/3/12/11210932/big-love-hbo-religion-anniversary" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other viewers</a> don't share my view of this.)</p><p>But at the same time, <em>Big Love</em> casts the Henricksons as bold, faithful outsiders. They’re fighting the good fight to protect their family and their version of polygamy against the secular world’s misconceptions and the compound’s abuses, down to stirring speeches to the government and the public. The show seems to want you to root for them and, by extension, polygamy, but it’s also careful not to express any positive feelings about polygamy or show it in a positive light. In one way this gives you space to draw your own conclusions, but in another it feels like it just keeps everything at a remove.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Big Love: Season 5 Extended Trailer (HBO)" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QgVT4CYsMRc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>I can’t figure out if I actually <em>liked</em> the show, even though I watched it all. You might know I have an interest in religion and especially <a href="https://www.conspirituality.net/episodes/brief-cult-of-the-lamb-riley-macleod" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cults</a> or smaller faiths, and how they’re <a href="https://aftermath.site/video-games-cults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">portrayed in media</a>. As such, <em>Big Love</em>’s exploration of tensions between the LDS church and the Henricksons, and the Henricksons and the compound, were fascinating to me, being so specific to a certain corner of religion that often gets painted with an <a href="https://religionandpolitics.org/2022/05/10/violence-in-mormon-ways-a-review-of-under-the-banner-of-heaven/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">overly-broad or slanted</a> brush. I was watching it alongside the height of attention to trad wife influencer <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/nara-smith-lucky-blue-smith-tiktok-mormon-tradwife-1234979241/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nara Smith</a>, and every time I saw someone on social media “uncover” that she’s Mormon, I had to resist the urge to tweet <em>Yeah, sometimes people are just </em><a href="https://www.allure.com/story/why-so-many-beauty-bloggers-are-mormon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Mormons</em></a><em>, it’s not a gotcha</em>.</p><p><em>Big Love</em> takes my unsent tweets a step further by saying yeah, sometimes those people are even just polygamists, and in doing so, it does something really interesting with how religion gets talked about on TV. By taking the Henricksons’ family and faith as givens more than subjects in themselves, it can go to these weird and dramatic and sometimes unbelievable places instead of spending time defending its core premise. It doesn’t have to have plots about being a sister wife; it can have plots about sister wives smuggling exotic birds. In some ways, I’m kind of excited about how disappointed I felt in the show’s emotional distance–in wishing it had more feeling, in wishing it delved more deeply into the felt experience of its characters’ faith, that meant it wasn’t holding religion up as an oddity to be gawked at.&nbsp;</p><p>This is very different from <em>Sister Wives, </em>which at its start at least clearly wanted you to watch the oddballs. Starting in 2010, <em>Sister Wives</em> follows a real polygamist family, the Browns, with husband Kody already in a relationship with wives Meri, Janelle, and Christine. When it began, they were just considering adding fourth wife Robin; in the latest season, Robin is the only wife left, with all the others having left Kody or, in Meri’s case, a decision somewhere between mutual and Kody dumping her. The entire premise has changed so much that, while watching the opening credits, I wondered if the show should still even be called <em>Sister Wives</em>.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="New Season | Sister Wives | TLC" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BpYxY3XfRS0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Everyone on the show has different explanations for why the family broke down. I don’t think I’m the only viewer who would chalk it up to Kody: while it was easy to look askance at his ego and generally conservative worldview and the whole structure of the family with the man at the head, in the show’s earliest days he seemed to truly love his family and respect his wives. But covid, Trumpian politics, and most likely the effects of being on TV for so long clearly took their toll on him. He was never a “great” guy by my standards, but the way he’s become demanding and cruel and subsequently driven so much of his family away can be genuinely hard to watch.</p><p>When <em>Sister Wives</em> started, it felt kind of revelatory to me as a portrayal of an unusual religion. Since their unique family and how it differs from the viewers’ was the whole reason the Browns were on TV, the show focused at length on the logistics of that family, how everyone feels and how their needs get met. As such, it didn’t steer clear of showing people really <em>wrangling</em> with living their faith. I was impressed by how this showed the family as intentional and thoughtful about their relationships and their connection to their religious beliefs. Even when I wanted to yell “Queer people have already thought of this; read a book!” at my TV when the Browns faced domestic struggles, I thought there was a lot of value in showing the messy but loving reality (or “<a href="https://aftermath.site/mrbeast-beast-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reality</a>”) of their religious family at work.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Sister Wives: Meet Kody and the Wives (S1, E1) | Full Episode" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6LJWi5z1SCE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>And though it feels voyeuristic, it’s even fascinating to watch their family breaking apart. What does it mean to get divorced within a cosmology that holds <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/liahona/2023/01/10-families-are-eternal?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">family as eternal</a>; what does it mean to get divorced when you aren’t legally married, or when you’re married in a spiritual sense? It’s been interesting to watch the sister wives try to figure out if they’re still family without their relationship to Kody binding them; in the latest episode, Christine says that she and Janelle have a “sister wife family,” while other wives have less close relationships. It’s tough to watch Robin support Kody through multiple simultaneous divorces while she’s still married to him, and tragic to watch her grieve losing the family full of other wives that she joined the Browns for, a struggle so unique to their faith.</p><p>Lest this sound like <em>Sister Wives</em> is some masterpiece of television, it’s still an essentially trashy reality TV show. I fell off it for a long time when I didn’t have access to TV; when I came back recently, I was frustrated with how it’s grown slow-moving and repetitively structured and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TLCsisterwives/comments/15cd5ty/has_production_ever_explained_why_the_show_is/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">years behind</a>. I sort of hope for everyone’s sake that the show ends soon, though I’m sure there are contracts and the cast’s financial situations to think of. After so long and <a href="https://people.com/sister-wives-janelle-brown-no-idea-garrison-brown-struggling-before-death-exclusive-8710021" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">so much</a>, it’s probably time for the Browns to live their lives offscreen.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Sister Wives</em> does the opposite thing as <em>Big Love, </em>which, by not focusing too hard on the family, doesn’t take a stance on polygamy. By showing polygamy as abnormal and focusing all its attention on why and how, <em>Sister Wives</em>, or at least its earlier seasons, ran the risk of making the Browns’ faith and way of life seem <em>too </em>appealing. But this is also, strangely, TLC’s MO, given the network’s weird obsession with fundamentalist and conservative religions; this is the network that laundered the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw1rAMzPf70" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Duggars</a>’ abuses and papered over the harms of the <a href="https://economichardship.org/2019/03/tlc-show-cynthia-jeub-kids-by-the-dozen-quiverfull-movement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Quiverfull </a>movement, performing what a 2015 Buzzfeed article calls “<a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/sarahjones/how-tlcs-fundamentalism-as-kitsch-hurts-women" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fundamentalism as kitsch</a>.” Like the Henricksons, in early <em>Sister Wives </em>episodes the Browns make it clear they <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/sister-wives-kody-brown-flds-warren-jeffs-becoming-sister-wives-memoir-not-my-world.html/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">aren’t FLDS</a>, but the show is still ultimately glossing over the more <a href="https://people.com/tv/gwendlyn-brown-says-trans-sibling-leon-has-been-separating-from-sister-wives-family-to-feel-safer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">challenging</a> parts of the Browns’ faith. And all <em>this</em> is to say nothing of the idea of kids growing up on reality TV at all, and the harms that surely causes.</p><p>(If you’re interested in fundamentalism and reality TV, allow me to recommend the excellent YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@FundieFridays" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fundie Fridays</a>. Also, if you know anything but why the hell TLC is like this, please <a href="https://aftermath.site/tips" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">let me know</a>.)</p><p>I would have expected the shows to do the opposite of what they do with where they place their specific faiths in relation to the viewer. I’d think <em>Big Love</em>, with a room full of fiction writers unbound by reality, would have more space to explore the emotional landscape of polygamy. And I’d have thought that <em>Sister Wives</em>, with its interest in what makes the Browns unusual, would spend more time highlighting the ways they clash with the outside world. But the shows instead trade places.</p><p>I’m obviously torn on whether either show is “good” or if I’d recommend them. And I’m not an expert in Mormonism or its offshoots, though I know some <a href="https://uncpress.org/book/9781469682709/queering-kinship-in-the-mormon-cosmos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">smart folks</a> who are. But the timing that led me to watch the two shows so close together let me see them as on something of the same project, doing different things with how media can feel religious.  </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>During Kai's trip to San Francisco to <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-hands-on-preview-rook-takes-queen-checkmate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">play Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>, he was able to secure <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-exclusive-qa-no-side-quest-exists-without-contributing-to-the-narrative/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an exclusive interview</a> with BioWare's Francois Chaput (Missions and Level Design Director) and Matt Rhodes (Art Director). Later, though, he also participated in a roundtable Q&amp;A with Game Directors Corinne Busche and John Epler where various colleagues from the press were able to ask their questions.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting answers came on the topic of companions, which are the very focus of Dragon Age: The Veilguard and even prompted <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-veilguard-is-the-new-name-of-dreadwolf-reveal-scheduled-for-june-11-with-15-minutes-of-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the title change from Dreadwolf</a>. When asked when they decided companions wouldn't be directly controllable (unlike previous installments), they said:</p>
<p><em><strong>Corinne Busche:</strong> I think I can start this one and then maybe John if you want to jump in. Dragon Age has such an amazing, rich lore and history behind it. The worldbuilding, I really think it's what's kept this franchise alive and people discussing it 10 years after Inquisition. So our North Star was that we wanted you to embody Rook, to step into Rook's shoes, to experience this world on the ground as this character. And what that meant is giving you more autonomy, more control of the character, putting you in control of every single swing, and really making it feel like you're a part of this world.</em></p>
<p><em>What's more, we've talked a lot about the companions. I know a lot of the questions that came up today about Dragon Age: The Veilguard were about the depth and authenticity of the companions. We really felt like there was a big opportunity here to make the companions feel more realized, more like their characters who fight alongside you and have their own styles, motivations, and interactions if you're not actually embodying them.</em></p>
<p><em>But of course, throughout all of that, we do know in the combat system, that sense of teamwork, of pause and play, tactical depth. That has been the throughline through every single edition of Dragon Age. So we wanted to walk the fine line of making that teamwork and that sense of strategy show up but also make you feel like you're in this world.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>John Epler:</strong> Yeah, and Corinne touched on autonomy as far as Rook goes, but also part of making the companions feel like their own people, like their own characters, is giving them that autonomy as well on the battlefield. Again, you are the leader of this group. They have their own personalities and their own stories, and we wanted to make sure that you felt that through the gameplay as well.</em></p>
<p>It's not the first time BioWare has talked about companions being '<a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-the-most-complex-fully-realized-companions-weve-ever-crafted-says-bioware/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fully realized</a>', though it is the first time they've linked that to the decision to remove direct player control of the party, which remains controversial for some fans.</p>
<p>We won't have too much to wait until we can play Dragon Age: The Veilguard for ourselves and decide whether it was the right choice. In the meantime, stay tuned for the full transcript of the roundtable Q&amp;A.</p>

			<p><span>BioWare and Electronic Arts recently invited a select number of media and influencers, Wccftech included, to their western California campus to get some of the first hands-on with their long-awaited sequel to the Dragon Age franchise. It’s been a long time coming and a series of iterations to get to where we are now and with the release only a handful of weeks away, gamers will finally have the opportunity to take up the mantle of The Veilguard.</span></p>
<p><span>Built upon the narrative started nearly two decades ago and touched on as recently as Dragon Age: Inquisition’s DLC, Dragon Age: The Veilguard starts with a daemon attack upon Tevinter and the swift introduction to the player’s chosen Rook and only a small selection of the Veil jumpers that will form the basis for the player’s faction of interlopers this time around: the Veil Jumpers. Varric and Bianca also make their presence known early on, but this time around, the plucky thief is more content with taking a more passive role along this adventure.</span></p>
<p><span>This opening act was the very same that’s been present from the very <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-gets-first-gameplay-and-details-tremendous-amount-of-handcrafted-side-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first</a> gameplay footage shown to the world of Dragon Age: The Veilguard. From character creation up through that fateful encounter with Solas (which for many players may indeed be the first time that they’ve met face to face if coming in having skipped Dragon Age: Inquisition), I got to see firsthand the carnage that attempting to tear open the Veil might cause despite some good intentions behind the act.</span></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Dragon-Age-Dreadwolf-Screenshot-Bellara.png"></a></figure>

<p><span>Bioware has invested a great amount of time into the character creation suite of Dragon Age: The Veilguard. The Keep has sadly been left behind in an earlier console generation and, with it, a way to carry forward the status of Thedas and choices made prior. BioWare remedied this to a lesser extent by permitting the player to make a few key observations about the state of the world but this is a feature that they intend to keep under wraps until much closer to release. For the player's own iteration of the Rook, players can change everything from the body type and pronouns down to freckles and hair growth. A player could easily spend a solid hour trying to come up with the perfect character, only to change their minds midway through the adventure. To remedy this, there is a magic mirror inside the main base of operations that serves as aesthetician and barber all in one.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Throughout the roughly six hours of playable gameplay to Dragon Age: The Veilguard, we had to jump about within the narrative to experience a variety of the story without taking part in one solid block of time. Following the initial reveal of Solas and his end goals, the story then jumps forward to a bit of time later on in the first act as players have already formed up a minor resistance band known as the Veil Jumpers. This dysfunctional troupe of heroes and anti-heroes are united together to follow a path first laid out by the Dreadwolf and Elven god himself.</span></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Dragon-Age-The-Veilguard-Champion-Skill-Tree.png"></a></figure>

<p><span>In these early formative quests of Dragon Age: The Veilguard, a majority of the cast has already been assembled for those common goals. Progressing the narrative will not always be a straight line. Side quests routinely break up the pacing of the story without feeling rushed to save the world, even if there should be a proper sense of urgency in the battle of gods. Many of these sidequests were locked out from accessing during the preview as EA instead wished for players to continue on a familiar path across all early players. There is a fair bit of exploration available to the player in The Crossroads, another familiar locale for Dragon Age veterans, but the kiddie rails were left on to prevent any one of us from delving into uncharted spoiler territory.</span></p>
<p><span>The primary choice offered to me was in regards to bringing the Veil Jumpers to one of two catastrophic events to protect and resolve. For me, the obvious choice was to track down a blood mage and put them down; from taking a moment to peek at the neighbors around me during the preview session, this appeared to be the less popular option. While I was a veritable powerhouse with a two-handed hammer for much of the quest, facing the mage while she was bathing in an infinite pool of blood slowed down to a halt. No longer was I cracking kneecaps and hurling shields for kills in one or two hits. </span></p>
<p><span>Instead, this boss fight was an exercise in tedium as the fight itself lasted close to ten minutes of constant attacks, darting behind pillars to avoid bloodborne missiles and smacking the occasional zombie minion to recharge my champion’s ultimate ability only to repeat over and over. Presumably, there was some key conversation or dropped lore entry that might have yielded a weakness I could have exploited early on in the fight, but I was unsuccessful in locating it during my demo session.</span></p>

<p>Any fears that Dragon Age: The Veilguard may be watered down in its combat were quickly washed away as I settled into the roles of Mage and later Warrior. Each class offered at least two different distinct playstyles depending on the primary and secondary weapons along with a relatively small list of equipable actions that almost all ran either on some sort of timer or required some energy to charge up in the case of Rook's ultimate attacks. The combat itself sits somewhere between Dragon Age II's action combat and a character action game. Dodges and evasive maneuvers are critical in combat with only a few healing options available to the character (players can bring three health potions at a time into battle, although I did find a piece of gear later on that would expand that with an additional potion slot) and only a very few actual healing spells across all of the various classes and specializations.</p>
<p>Assuming direct control of the Rook's party members is a thing of the past in Dragon Age: The Veilguard, with the crew actually playing relatively smart and synergizing automatically with the player's given playstyle with their own abilities. There is still a pause menu where players can issue specific commands and utilize combo attacks under the right conditions, but players will spend most of the time in combat assuming control of Rook to slash, cast, and roll their way through hordes of enemies. It's a change that will take some getting used to but I've rather enjoyed the evolution to role-playing combat that BioWare has devised in Dragon Age: The Veilguard.</p>
<p><span>In the years since Dragon Age: Inquisition graced our Xbox Ones and PlayStation 4s, BioWare has become master craftspeople with their facial capture technology. Far more impressive than the exotic landscapes and gruesome evil monsters are the fine touches they’ve put into every little thing for the Rook and their various party members, from gentle smirks to glorious shouts. This is one title I’ll have to look forward to playing on PC or the newly announced PlayStation 5 Pro at the very least.</span></p>
<p><span>It’s rather fitting that players will have had to wait roughly the same amount of time since Dragon Age 4’s initial reveal between the canon events of Dragon Age: Inquisition: Trespasser leading Dragon Age: The Veilguard, but that wait will be over soon. Dragon Age: The Veilguard will be available across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and PC on October 31st, 2024. PC players with an active EA Play Pro subscription will also be able to journey through Thedas the very same day.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dragon Age: The Veilguard Hands-On - A Cure for Tiresome Open Worlds]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/dragon-age-veilguard-hands-on-cure-for-tiresome-open-worlds</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon-age-the-veilguard-hands-on-a-cure-for-tiresome-open-worlds.985734/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/dragon-age-veilguard-hands-on-cure-for-tiresome-open-worlds<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> is a massive game and step forward for the series. Its design is thoughtful, the moment to moment gameplay exhilarating, and full of spectacle around every corner. For many, this will not only be a return to form for BioWare but a level up.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Before going further, check out the above video to see much of what I’m discussing here in-motion and a bunch of other features like the character creator, views of the class skill trees, the companion skill trees, and a whole lot more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead of describing combat to you, we have a few videos showing off different levels of <em>Veilguard</em>’s gameplay. We have one focused on the <a href="https://youtu.be/NwxJf2_uVu0">Warrior class showing early combat</a>, one on the <a href="https://youtu.be/oqorhe8uT-M">Mage class showing a more intermediate look at combat</a>, and then we have <a href="https://youtu.be/Flt6JRXJBcY">a video on Rogue combat</a> that shows what a well-crafted higher character can do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In all, there’s about an hour’s worth of footage to take in if you want to see what <em>Veilguard </em>is all about.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I write this, I am keeping in mind my <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/interviews/veilguard-game-director-corinne-busche-on-player-choice-and-companion">interview with Game Director Corinne Busche</a>. In that interview, we discuss the design philosophy behind how they handle player choice and just how much it permeates the entire game. BioWare’s approach really shows up in every aspect of the game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I encourage you to read that interview as a companion piece to this, as it talks a lot more about important player choices, dialogue choices, and relationships with companions. The amount of effectual choices you can make is truly impressive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just as the choices you make in the story and the relationships you’ll make in the game are vast and varied, so too are the options for you to play the game just as you want. Your toolbox when it comes to combat is humongous.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Veilguard’s Skill Trees Encourage Experimentation&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The skill trees for the various classes have a staggering amount of variety and nuance to them. &nbsp;Each tree has a few defined paths to specializations, which in themselves are great, but there’s a lot of things on the margins for you to take in as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One thing to note is that <em>Veilguard </em>has a level cap of 50, and while I haven’t counted them, there’s definitely well over 100 nodes in the skill tree to make your build. So, there’s a lot of freedom to do what you want with a build.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What it also means is that the trees were designed with the knowledge that you won’t be able to fill out even most of it, so they are filled with a bunch of strategic decisions to build something unique to your playstyle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In just the Warrior alone, you can build something around parrying, around shield throwing, around two handed weapons, a lifestealing build, and man so much more. I wish I had studied the trees a little closer as there’s so much there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, the developers said at the preview event I attended that the finetuning of the trees has been a big focus of <em>Veilguard</em>’s development with the hope that people can outsmart the developers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, they mentioned that someone playtesting the game was able to make a shield-throwing Warrior build that could more or less one shot bosses. That of course needed to be tuned down some, but they’re excited at the prospect of what people will be able to do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even with my limited time messing with it, I can already see that a popular post in Dragon Age communities and social media &nbsp;will be showing off crazy builds and the combos you can pull off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The best part of the skill tree is the fact you can redo it whenever you want. There is no limit on respeccing what you want, so you can fine tune between encounters if you want or just change something completely.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Gear is More than Just Numbers&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Adding a layer on top of that is the gear you’ll equip. There are a lot of different status effects and attributes that can affect the damage you do. Focus on breaking down shields, barriers, holding people in place, staggering – there are stats for all of that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The gear isn’t simply just a “bigger number is better” approach, either. Pieces of armor or a weapon can be dramatically different from one another, and I can foresee a possibility where you find something so sick you change your build to make use of its stats and abilities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Runes are another piece of gear you get access to that add a lot of versatility. You can equip up to three and each come with some sort of active ability and stat boost.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, one might just give you a straight 10% bonus to cold damage and then have an active ability that increases your ability damage by 20% for a certain time period.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each of the three runic abilities will be available to you in combat, too. You can cycle through their use as another active ability to use.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Companions are Key to an Optimum Build, Too&nbsp;</h2>
<p>One final wrinkle to consider when trying to make the most optimum build you can are your companions. Like your player character, companions have fairly expansive skill trees and even gear to equip.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whenever you venture out with your two companions, you can equip them with three abilities each. Each companion has five different abilities to choose from, each of which have their own upgrade path.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Obviously, the skill trees are no where as huge as the player character’s, but you can change up what sort of effectiveness an ability has pretty significantly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For example, in that screenshot above Davrin has the ability Death From Above. That’s something he can call down from the sky to cause a small explosion, damage, and stagger some enemies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In one upgrade path, you can go full bore and try to make Death from Above the most devastating AoE attack you can. In the other, it will buff your companions and yourself in various ways at the same time becoming a pseudo-support ability. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Some abilities go from causing huge types of certain kinds of damage to trying to control the field more, like slowing or freezing enemies in place. Or maybe you’re wanting someone to heal, to keep enemies at a distance, or just try to blow up as much as you can.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those are all viable options that you can use to complement your playstyle. With a Mage or even a Rogue focusing on the bow, some companions may be more helpful in controlling the field by allowing you to keep your distance and stay in range. Or maybe they can group enemies up while another companion sticks them in place for you to deliver some powerful blow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There’s a lot of choices you can make in not only the party make up but the individual choices for your companions, which can empower you’re preferred playstyle a great amount.</p>

<p>Synergy is the word the developers use with your companions, and there is certainly a lot to be found. Not only in just the straight utility of the abilities, but there are some abilities companions or player characters can use simultaneously for a big bonus in damage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The amount of player choice you have in how you want to play is truly astonishing and like nothing I’ve seen in an action RPG of this type before. It’s not only the choices you can make but just how obviously effective they are. It’s not simple stat increases here and there but huge shake ups that dramatically effect how you can play the game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like I said before, BioWare told us at the preview event that they can’t wait to see how players outsmart the development team with the incredible tools they’re putting in our hands.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Veilguard Isn’t Open World But Still Feels Huge&nbsp;</h2>
<p>I don’t know about you, but the open world formula has been pretty tiresome in so many games for so long. Too often great ideas and great games are bogged down by open world bloat and “activities” littered on a map just for something to do. &nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> gives you the best of both worlds in terms of having plenty of exploration with hand-crafted gameplay experiences. At no time in my near 7 hours of playing the game did it feel claustrophobic or that I wasn’t immersed in some massive well-realized world.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Veilguard </em>is mission-based, so you’ll gather up some companions and venture out to complete some quest, or more than one, in a specific area of the game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Shedding the weight of designing an effective open world lets <em>Veilguard</em> really shine. Each of the missions I completed were full of awesome spectacle, a cool set piece, or some exquisite arena in which to fight a boss.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those epic crescendo moments saved for big climaxes in games feel like they’re around every corner in <em>Veilguard</em>. I was constantly delighted and taken aback by the amazing imagery and emotion these hugely dramatic moments constantly portrayed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The best moments of so many games are not remembered from how you got from point a to point b but what you actually did when you got there. Those fine-tuned gameplay sequences that really show a game at its best.&nbsp;</p>
<p>More or less, that’s basically what <em>Veilguard </em>is. The prologue kicks you off in what the developers wanted to feel like was the final mission of a game, a big story concluding moment to set the stage. From that point on, Veilguard never really lets go.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Obviously, I can’t imagine the whole game is as crazy cool at that rate it was in my preview. The snippets of gameplay the chose to show were put there for a reason, after all. Regardless, I think there’s a lot to look forward to.</p>

<p>I don’t want you to think that <em>Veilguard </em>is just high-octane action all the time, as BioWare has a reputation for crafting some good stories – particularly in telling stories about the companions you gather along the way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those intimate character moments are still there. Between missions you’ll be at your base of operations, The Lighthouse, where everyone can kind of chill and collect their thoughts. You’ll have the opportunity to talk with and learn a ton more about the companions and the world at large there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each of them are well-realized with well-defined personalities, beliefs, desires, goals, and everything else that goes into a great character. It is learning who these folks are that we really get to start putting the rest of the world-threatening plot into perspective.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Crossroads Will Satisfy Your Exploration Urges&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The Lighthouse is a sanctuary within the Veil for your party to hangout, but you’ll quickly get access to another part of the Veil for travel: The Crossroads.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Crossroads is a place in-between in the Veil that allows for quick travel all around the world. It is an expansive set of ruins, structures, dungeons, and more just waiting to be discovered.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can engage with The Crossroads as much or as little as you want. Once you’ve made y our way to the major fast travel point to get you to somewhere in the world, you don’t have to do much in The Crossroads.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, there is a lot of story and sidequesting to be done there. It’s full of open world puzzling, random events, and quests to stumble upon. For example, in one I stumbled into an old memory of Solas’ past, getting to experience it firsthand while delving a dungeon.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Dragon Age: The Veilguard Preview | Final Thoughts&nbsp;</h2>
<p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> feels like <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>’s cousin. I know how insane that sentence sounds, particularly with BioWare’s history in the <em>Baldur’s Gate</em> series.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both are RPGs with incredible tools for player agency with actual game changing consequences. Both focus heavily on deep connective stories with companions and party members. Both let you get as crazy as you want with their respective combat systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In short, both in terms of design philosophy and quality, I think <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> is to action RPGs what <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> is to CRPGs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Might be a little early to say that, as there’s a whole lot of the game I didn’t see, but I don’t think I’ve walked away feeling better about the quality of a game than with <em>Veilguard</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<hr><p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard was previewed at an event with close to 7 hours of hands-on gameplay.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/veilguard-game-director-corinne-busche-on-player-choice-and-companion-relationships.985728/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/interviews/veilguard-game-director-corinne-busche-on-player-choice-and-companion<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>BioWare has a rich history of innovation when it comes to player choice and agency, from the dialogue wheel to the relationships you build with companions. With that in mind, I had a chance to talk with <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> Game Director Corinne Busche about player choice and what it means for your character and companions.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Check out our <a href="https://youtu.be/4Ejlg-sn-AU">overview video of everything we learned about </a></em><a href="https://youtu.be/4Ejlg-sn-AU">Dragon Age: The Veilguard </a><em>in our seven hour preview here.</em></p>
<h2>Player Choice in Veilguard Is Intimate&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p>There are near endless ways to handle player choice, and I wanted to know what their guiding principles were in <em>Veilguard</em>’s design. Busche had an interesting answer as to their approach: intimacy.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We wanted you to feel like you're in this world, that you're more attached and on the ground than perhaps even other entries in the game or in the IP’s history. So with that comes a level of intimacy. So choice and consequence, particularly as it relates to narrative beats, we really lean into what are those things that are going to affect people's lives? &nbsp;... What are those really personal moments where you feel like, if you really care about this character, that you can help them make some of the most important decisions of their lives? ... Our choices, that intimacy and connection, that sense of immersion, is really our North Star.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To be clear, and Busche wanted to stress this as well, intimacy doesn’t necessarily mean romantic (don’t worry, it’s BioWare so you’ll have plenty of romance options).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Intimacy just means being close, having an understanding. Getting into the nitty gritty of details and information of your own character and those they interact with.</p>

<p>Based on my time with the game and further conversation with Busche, I think that is a great word that shows its influence throughout <em>Veilguard</em>’s design. &nbsp;</p>
<h2>Veilguard Companion Relationships Are Impactful and Complex&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Obviously, the relationships you have with characters will be intimate. There is a closeness that will develop from their shared cause of the game, of course, and you have an opportunity to make them more personal if you wish.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Companions in <em>Veilguard </em>cast a huge shadow of course, both in how integral they are to the plot and in how they ground the game. They have unique personalities, motivations, and past histories. Naturally, that means you’ll get a wide variety of reactions to the choices you make.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it comes to decisions affecting companions:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There will be times where it changes the nature of the dynamic you have with them. There will be times when people need to step away. Another factor is, do you actually help them out with their own personal motivations, and how does that affect how they show up?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Depending on where you or your companions are in the story, they may be off doing their own thing. They have goals, desires, and a whole life outside the main plot of the game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, maybe you made one angry with a decision but maybe they just have something they needed to do, so off they go. You’ll even have a chance to run into companions going about their business when you’re out exploring as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Not all choices are so obviously huge they may send a companion off to take a break or what have you either, as the small choices through dialogue or elsewhere build up to big effects, too.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Companion Progression in Veilguard&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Building relationships with companions is exactly how you’ll see them progress, with Busche noting that they’ve taken a new approach to companion progression in <em>Veilguard</em>:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So their progression is based on how well you know and understand one another. It's directly tied to your relationship with them. And it's not necessarily how friendly you are with them, it's how well you know each other, how well you know how to work together. So as I bring companions with me on missions, I help solve their problems, that's going to improve that sense of connection, and that's going to make us work better as a team.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As much as gaining XP is fun and all, your companions won’t just level up with the player character at the same rate. Instead, the level of your relationship grows the closer you get to them. That grows through conversation, bringing them on missions, choices, and quests specific to them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each companion has a fairly expansive skill tree that you can customize as you wish. Obviously, the lower your relationship with them, the fewer points you’re able to put in their skill tree.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These skill trees aren’t just simple upgrades to stats, like more strength or what have you. Each node on the tree directly affects one ability or another.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I did ask if there could be situation where a companion would be underpowered if I never used them in <em>Veilguard</em>, but Busche said that while they won’t have quite as much at their disposal, companions will always have an effect. They’ll never be useless.</p>
<p>Growing that relationship level isn't just as simple as spending time with them, either.&nbsp;Each have their own complex histories, preferences, and desires that will inform the way they act and react.</p>
<h2>Companion and Character Histories Matter a Lot&nbsp;</h2>
<p>This philosophy is applied to all your interactions and the reactions you’ll receive from companions and characters along the way. Romance, however, is probably the easiest to see how it works.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While you can certainly pursue all of your companions, that doesn’t mean that <em>Veilguard </em>will just let you romance them just for the sake of it. If you do certain things or make certain choices, they just won’t be that interested in you. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In other words, as Busche described, companions won’t conform to the player. They won’t just crumple their beliefs and preferences for the sake of letting you romance someone. In other words, it has to make sense.</p>
<p>Outside of even romance, Busche made sure to note that growing these relationships doesn't necessarily mean you'll be friends with all the companions. The shared experience and common cause create an intimacy, but there's a chance your personalities just won't gel. A working relationship you could say.</p>

<p>In the mix of all of this are the choices you made when creating a character and those you continue to make when further defining who your Rook will be in the game. Character creation choices from the race you are to your background, class, and those choices beyond the character creator are just as impactful and intimate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Busche gave two examples of these intimate choices. In one, if you’re playing a dwarf, you can have an interesting conversation with Harding early in the game as both your character and her have a dream. Dwarves don’t dream and they’re wondering what the hell is going on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In another, Busche described a smaller decision with a less important character having a big impact:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the smaller choices, but one that hit me quite hard, it sits with me, is when you have choices of maybe somebody living or dying, but if I'm a Grey Warden, well I can send them to the order as well and they show up later in the game. And while that might not be a world shaking decision, you really get the sense that, like you're affording a second chance to these characters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are a ton of opportunities to make <em>Veilguard </em>your own that extend far beyond the choices you make in dialogue, about certain characters, or about deviances in the plot, too.</p>
<h2>Be Who You Want To Be&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Busche said that one of their pillars of design was “Be who you want to be.” That is precisely the experience they want players to have, so you can customize your character in so many ways.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We break down the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/dragon-age-veilguard-hands-on-cure-for-tiresome-open-worlds">various systems of<em> Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> here</a>, but you’ll have the chance to customize your character’s class, skill tree, armor, companion skill trees, and more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is even an option to customize pretty much every UI element of the game, removing or adding whatever you want. That means that, yes, you could have absolutely nothing on screen if you want.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To boil it all down, that “be who you want to be” pillar is the goal Busche is trying to achieve in <em>Veilguard</em>. From important companion relationships, to the plot, to character customization, to skills, to gear, and everything in-between, <em>Veilguard </em>is striving to let you play any way you want.&nbsp;</p>

The studio that developed&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/18/24248602/nintendo-pokemon-palworld-pocketpair-patent-infringement-lawsuit">the game at the heart of the suit</a>, issued a statement early this morning saying it doesn’t know what patents it violated. “At this moment, we are unaware of the specific patents we are accused of infringing upon, and we have not been notified of such details,” the statement read. </p><p>According to Nintendo’s press release, the reason for the lawsuit has to do with Pocketpair allegedly infringing on multiple as yet undisclosed patents. The details of the lawsuit have not yet been made public, so we do not yet know which patents, and according to Pocketpair’s statement, it doesn’t know, either.</p><p>The news broke last night that Nintendo and TPC were suing the makers of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24048972/palworld-news-trailers"><em>Palworld</em></a><em> </em>— an open-world survival crafting game that features a collection of companion monsters players can catch and battle. Since its release in January, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/22/24047087/palworld-early-access-steam-xbox-gamepass">the game became an instant hit</a>, racking up over 10 million in copies sold and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/23/24048343/but-for-palworld-it-was-tuesday">breaking Steam concurrent player records</a> within its first few weeks. Almost immediately, people noticed striking similarities between<em> Palworld</em>’s “pals” and pokémon from their looks <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/22/24047087/palworld-early-access-steam-xbox-gamepass">down to their extraordinarily similar character models</a>.</p><p>Though Nintendo’s not going after Pocketpair because <a href="https://palworld.fandom.com/wiki/Lamball">lamballs</a> look uncomfortably similar to <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokedex/wooloo">wooloos</a>, we do know the company is famously litigious in protecting its brand. Shortly after <em>Palworld</em>’s release, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/23/24047854/nintendo-palworld-pokemon-mod-youtube-dmca">TPC ordered a programmer to take down a video</a> that featured a mod of <em>Palworld</em> that replaced all the pals with pokémon. It also issued a statement <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/25/24050320/pokemon-palworld-investigation-copyright-plagiarism">saying it was aware of <em>Palworld</em></a> — although the statement did not refer to the game by name — and would be investigating the game to “take appropriate measures to address any acts that infringe on intellectual property rights related to the Pokémon.” Looks like the company found something.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
