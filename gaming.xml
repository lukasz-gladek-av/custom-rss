<p>The 'So Strong It's Funny' event will get underway on <strong>25th November</strong> and will be hanging around until <strong>2nd December</strong>, so you have just one week to rack up a high score and pull in the bonus goodies.</p>
<p>And gosh, are there some goodies this time. As was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/two-classic-donkey-kong-icons-may-soon-join-bananza-as-unlockable-figures">previously rumoured</a>, the upcoming event's in-game statues are modelled on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/donkey_kong_64">DK 64</a>'s Chunky and Lanky Kong. Finally, we can decorate DK Island with a small slice of the iconic duo... albeit only as inanimate objects.</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytfMx2XNyAq4E" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4zoqhtx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>

<p>You'll find the precise times that the event gets underway in your region below:</p>
<ul><li><strong>North America:</strong> 12am PST / 1am MST / 2am CST / 3am EST</li><li><strong>UK/Ire:</strong> 8am GMT</li><li><strong>Europe:</strong> 9am CET / 10am EET</li><li><strong>Asia/Oceania:</strong> 5pm JST / 4pm AWST / 7pm AEDT</li></ul>

<p>Much like the last Emerald Rush challenge, 'So Strong It's Funny' adds a tactical twist to the game mode's usually randomised elements, cutting the pool of possible upgrade perks and skills down to a pre-determined list. It looks like it'll only be 'Groove' upgrades up for grabs this time, so expect to be picking up Emeralds in style.</p>
<p>And for those wondering, the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/topics/article/e5d5c669-a123-408e-bbd1-1e8a390cbef8">Japanese Nintendo website</a> promises that there is <em>another</em> in-game event coming our way before 2025 is up. Hey, whatever it takes to beef up that DLC package a little.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/umami-review-puzzingly-delicious.1355590/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Over the last few years alone, players have been treated to gaming excellence that can be explored and completed in a single gaming session (or night, if preferred), and there's a new title to be added, but simply not ignored: <em>UMAMI</em>. While the word itself is commonly used to describe the savoriness of a dish, it's also the name given to developer Mimmox's debut release, and yes, food is most certainly involved!</p>

<p>The game's developer did not shy away from delivering us with extravagant yet mouth-watering... puzzles (and yes, you've read correctly). Puzzles that look like some popular real-world dishes. So, after a few hours of puzzle-solving and building quite the appetite, did the developer cook something delicious with <em>UMAMI</em> worthy of a five-star rating?</p>

<h2>First Puzzling Encounter For A Hungry Mind</h2>

<p><em>UMAMI</em> is the delectable debut game from developer&nbsp;Mimmox, in which it equally challenges and makes one quite hungry over its scrumptious food-centric dioramas. It doesn't overstay its welcome when it comes to solving the puzzles, which is a great thing, but it's also very streamlined in its gameplay design and mechanics, and it packs on the cozy vibes for a stress-free experience (no hair-pulling needed).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/umami-screenshot-1075.jpg?itok=rPGqyqzT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/umami-screenshot-1075.jpg?itok=HxcfLQ79 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>We wonder just how puzzingly difficult it can be to assemble a hamburger?&nbsp;(Picture: Mimmox / Ashleigh Klein)</em></figcaption></figure><p>Each&nbsp;diorama featured in <em>UMAMI</em>&nbsp;has a unique theme and an associated master chef credited beside their tasty masterpieces, ranging from a purrfect hamburrrger to honey-drenched waffles, to towering stacks of sushi, and a spooky apple pie. Players must position every eye-watering piece to the diorama using a reference image of the completed&nbsp;puzzle by playing around with each puzzle piece, rotating and placing them.</p>

<p>There may not be an overarching story involved, other than the bite-sized descriptions of the themed dioramas to solve and the outstanding (and creative) chefs behind their creations. Nevertheless, players can bask in a delightful yet soothing gameplay environment while puzzle-solving, with no time limits and no added pressure, but all the time to spare in a single evening or over a weekend, relaxing over some appetizing puzzles.</p>

<h2>Let Us Cook!</h2>

<p>As alluded to, <em>UMAMI</em> is a 3D puzzle experience with warm and inviting, cozy vibes that remove the gloves and restrictions for a relaxing, puzzling solving experience. The best and adequate description of this 3D cozy puzzle game is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/overcooked-review-culinary-triumph" rel="nofollow"><em>Overcooked</em></a>, with mechanics akin to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/review/fez-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Fez</em></a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/little-to-left-review" rel="nofollow"><em>A Little to the Left</em></a> (and borrowing the latter's cozy vibes).</p>

<p>Like many 3D puzzle games, <em>UMAMI</em> features key elements and gameplay mechanics designed for a stress-free gaming experience as players move from one deliciously enticing puzzle to the next, cooked up by the talented animal chefs for us to behold. Movement-based mechanics is one such key element, as players are free to move or change their position to assist in solving each diorama, which extends to moving each puzzle piece by playing around with them and rotating them to discover the correct orientation.</p>

<p>Granted, it will take players some time to determine its correct orientation&nbsp;after playing around and rotating each puzzle piece, before they can place the piece onto a 3D diorama structure. Luckily, we didn't go into every puzzle blind, as the developer has kindly provided us with a reference image featuring the solved diorama, including the front and back positions, to further aid players in locating those key pieces and placing them in their correct position on the diorama structure.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/umami-screenshot-1074.jpg?itok=rqzLjhPf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/umami-screenshot-1074.jpg?itok=yX7R_Je6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>If you need further help in solving this tasty diorama, click the puzzle piece in the top right corner for some clues or hints. (Picture: Mimmox / Ashleigh Klein)</em></figcaption></figure><p>This added detail has certainly come in handy even after spending minutes staring point-blank at the puzzle pieces and the structure, especially on the levels where many pieces look all too familiar. After completing a diorama, the next one will immediately unlock, and it's pretty much "rinse and repeat" until all 15 beautifully hand-designed levels are completed.</p>

<p>A little delicious mention is that there are a few secrets to be discovered on every level, adding yet another unique touch to this cozy puzzle experience. As for what secrets exactly can be found, all we can say is that there are animal friends that appear in some levels and cards, so our lips are sealed.</p>

<h2>Is Fresh Or Rotten?</h2>

<p>There aren't many drawbacks regarding this 3D cozy puzzle game, aside from the lack of narrative and strong art, level, and gameplay design, so players and puzzle enthusiasts won't have much to complain about. However, if one were to be nitpicking, <em>UMAMI</em> is a short game overall, as players can expect to complete all the puzzles in rapid timing before dedicating extra time to find all the secrets, so one would be looking around the ballpark of four to eight hours for 100% completion.</p>

<p>Sure, there are conversations regarding gameplay length in general, but the developers prioritized delivering a complete and polished game, well-designed puzzles, and adorable yet cozy aesthetics for an experience that's well-paced without sacrificing or cutting out content or mechanics. But if the game's appetizing puzzles are too mind-boggling for one to solve, then players would be better off playing something easier or going elsewhere for a less challenging gameplay experience, but that would be too silly to do.</p>

<p>Additionally, the game's cozy aesthetics may not appeal to every player seeking their next puzzle experience, which in turn could lead to unwarranted and incorrect assumptions about the game. As such, we would counter that argument and recommend playing the demo to find out for yourselves, but this game is worth it for the engaging puzzle and level designs, cozy aesthetics, and time well spent that leaving a tip is required (because the developer certainly "cooked" with <em>UMAMI</em>)!</p>

<h2>UMAMI Review |&nbsp;Final Thoughts</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/umami-screenshot-1072.jpg?itok=7ZY2P6St 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/umami-screenshot-1072.jpg?itok=l387n1t4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>We're just leaving this here, but this should be a clue of what else players may find in-game. (Picture: Mimmox / Ashleigh Klein)</em></figcaption></figure><p>Our time with <em>UMAMI</em> may have been fleeting, but it was certainly tantalizing and utterly irresistible, largely thanks to gorgeous puzzles, ingenious gameplay design and mechanics, and inviting audio mixing and design. The developers made a stellar effort in exquisitely designing, hand-painting, and well-balancing all 15 puzzles featured, which is worth spending every minute solving them and replaying just for the cozy aesthetics alone.</p>

<p>Speaking of which, the game's cozy aesthetics and environment definitely made every minute spent less stressful and, instead, made us want more puzzles, but we were understandably satisfied with what we received. Without any guardrails or time restrictions, players are left to their devices, albeit with some assistance, to move from puzzle to puzzle at their desired pace.</p>

<p><em>UMAMI</em> may demand some brainpower, plenty of logic, and perspective to solve the five-star gourmet puzzles, but it doesn't demand too much of one's time to complete them. There is no such thing as the wrong or incorrect way to solve a puzzle, but that's the beauty and joy of them, and that's quite simply... <em>UMAMI!</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[ASUS TUF F16 (2025) Gaming Laptop With RTX 5050 Just Dropped by Hundreds, Lowest Price Yet for This New Release]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-just-slashed-350-off-this-asus-tuf-f16-gaming-laptop-dropping-a-1300-machine-to-its-lowest-price-yet-2000644446</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/asus-tuf-f16-2025-gaming-laptop-with-rtx-5050-just-dropped-by-hundreds-lowest-price-yet-for-this-new-release.1355584/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Handheld gaming PCs have had a <em data-start="168" data-end="176">moment</em> these past few years. The Steam Deck basically kicked the door open, and then devices like the Lenovo Legion Go and the Asus ROG Ally walked right in behind it. They’re convenient, sure, and there’s something very fun about flopping on the couch and playing full PC games without the weight of a whole laptop. But at the end of the day, those handhelds are still pretty focused on gaming and not a whole lot else. If you want something that can actually do all the normal “computer stuff” <em data-start="666" data-end="671">and</em> play the games you want, a good gaming laptop still just makes more sense. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5631/">And right now, Amazon has a solid deal running on the Asus TUF F16. It normally sits at around $1,300, but it’s marked down to $950 at the moment—a nice $350 off.</a></p>
<p>Let’s talk specs for a minute, because that’s what really makes or breaks a gaming laptop. The TUF F16 comes with a 16-inch display in a 16:10 aspect ratio, and it pushes a Full HD resolution. The refresh rate tops out at 165Hz, which is great if you play anything fast-paced or competitive, and the response time clocks in at 7ms. It also uses Adaptive-Sync, which basically helps keep your games looking smooth by cutting down on screen tearing and random stutters. The bezels are pretty slim too, so you get a surprising amount of screen without the whole machine feeling huge.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5631/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Subtle Styling</h2>
<p data-start="1493" data-end="1738">The keyboard is full-size with a number pad—which you don’t always get on laptops these days. Asus also gave the WASD keys a gold highlight, which is a small touch but a fun one if you like a little flair without going full RGB explosion.</p>
<p data-start="1493" data-end="1738">Under the hood, this particular model is running an Intel Core i5-13450HX paired with an NVIDIA GeForce 5050 laptop GPU. You get 16GB of RAM and a 512GB PCIe Gen4 SSD for storage. It’s not a monster machine that will play every AAA title at ultra settings, but for the price, it’s more than capable. Indie games will be a breeze to run, and a lot of bigger-budget titles should run just fine at medium settings without you needing to sacrifice too much.</p>


<p data-start="2777" data-end="2997">Battery life is solid, too. The 90Wh battery supports fast charging, letting you go from dead to 50% in about half an hour. You also get a 100W USB-C port that can charge your phone or accessories, which is always handy.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>This LEGO Christmas tree has become Amazon’s best-selling toy over the past week, and it received back-to-back price cuts in seven days. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5554/">set just dropped to $26 from its usual $44 price and marks a 40% discount and a new record low</a> for this holiday season icon. <strong>Amazon sold over 60,000 units already</strong>&nbsp;which shows how people are jumping on this early Black Friday deal before inventory disappears. The 2-in-1 building option <strong>lets you construct either one large tree or two smaller trees</strong>, which gives you flexibility for different display spaces.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5554/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Holiday Classic</h2>
<p>The larger tree configuration <strong>stands over 11 inches tall</strong> which makes it substantial enough to serve as a tabletop centerpiece without dominating your space. Each tree comes adorned with miniature ornaments, candles, and a yellow star on top that captures the classic Christmas tree aesthetic. The LEGO designers nailed the proportions and details that make this recognizable as a Christmas tree rather than just a generic green structure.</p>
<p>The 2-in-1 building option is what separates this from single-configuration sets that limit your creativity. You can build one tall tree at 11 inches for a dramatic display, or <strong>construct two smaller trees at 9 inches and 6 inches</strong> to spread holiday cheer across multiple rooms. Families can split the pieces and build together, creating matching trees for different spaces in the house.</p>



<p>Build quality matches what you’d expect from LEGO with tight brick connections and durable pieces that survive multiple rebuilds. The green pieces interlock firmly enough to create a solid structure that won’t fall apart when you move it around your house. The <strong>ornament details use clever brick combinations</strong> that add visual interest without requiring hundreds of tiny frustrating pieces. The<strong> color palette stays traditional with greens, reds, and touches of gold</strong> that fit any holiday decor style.</p>



<p>The timing makes this <strong>perfect for early holiday decorating or as a family activity during Thanksgiving weekend</strong>. You can build it together as a group project that gets everyone involved in holiday preparations without spending hours untangling light strings or arguing about ornament placement. The set arrives ready to build with all pieces included and no batteries or electronics required.</p>
<p>At $26 for a set that normally costs $44, you’re getting legitimate holiday decor. You’re investing in reusable decor that brings joy every year instead of disposable decorations that end up in landfills, all while paying pocket change during this record-low Black Friday pricing.</p>

<p>Use these Roblox Dueling Grounds monthly redeem codes for November 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Coins, Gems and much more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dueling Grounds is a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-skateboard-simulator-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> fighting game where players take part in one-on-one duels to find out who the ultimate fighter is. Players can utilise weapons such as swords and daggers, while also executing typical fighting game actions like blocks, parries, and punches. It’s essential for players to get a solid grasp of the controls, as simply button-jamming will only get them so far. Chaining combos is crucial, as it’s the best way to do the maximum amount of damage most efficiently.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Like most fighting games, Dueling Grounds also boasts an ability bar, which can be filled up by landing strikes and successfully blocking or parrying the opponent’s moves. Once filled, players can launch an ultimate attack that deals massive damage, increasing their chances for victory. Although simply progressing through the game will give players the resources they need to stay competitive, using redeem codes to gain an advantage is a common practice in most Roblox games.&nbsp;</p>

</ul>



<h2 id="h-expired-dueling-grounds-codes-nbsp">Expired Dueling Grounds Codes&nbsp;</h2>



<p>As of the writing of this article, there are no expired codes in Dueling Grounds, as the game released quite recently. Considering just how much popularity it has gained over the last few weeks, the developers are likely working on new codes to be released. Once new codes release, older ones tend to expire, and when that happens, the expired codes will be moved to this section. In the meantime, we urge players to make use of the active codes at the earliest, as they could expire at any moment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Redeeming codes in Roblox Dueling Grounds is a fairly straightforward process, as it’s just a matter of navigating through the game’s menu and inputting one of the active codes listed above into the corresponding text box. For players who are new to the Roblox environment, here’s a detailed step-by-step guide:</p>



<ol>
<li>Open Roblox and launch Dueling Grounds.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Click on the green star icon on the left hand side of the screen.</li>



<li>Scroll down till you see the codes text box.</li>



<li>Input one of the active codes listed above into the text box.</li>



<li>Click on the redeem button to claim your reward.</li>
</ol>







<h2 id="h-how-to-get-more-dueling-grounds-codes">How To Get More Dueling Grounds Codes</h2>



<p>New Dueling Grounds codes are likely going to be released through the game’s official Discord server or through the developers’ social accounts. However, tracking both of these for new codes regularly can be a hassle, and that’s where this page can come in handy. We update this page as soon as any new codes drop , so we recommend that you keep this page bookmarked for future reference.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Donkey Kong 64 fans celebrate! Nintendo will pay tribute to a pair of classic N64 characters via an upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> Emerald Rush DLC challenge.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After years left in the wilderness, both Chunky Kong and Lanky Kong will return in the DLC as "exclusive in-game statues", Nintendo has today <a href="https://x.com/NintendoUK/status/1990389457187455057" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">confirmed</a>, as part of the upcoming So Strong It's Funny in-game challenge.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The event, set to run from November 25 to December 2, will be set on the game's Hilltop Layer. As of yet, there's no word on exactly how may points players will need to rack up to earn these latest cosmetic items used to decorate DK Island.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/17/16x9-nswitch-donkeykongbananza-sostrongitsfunny-1920x1080-gb-en-image1280w-1763384530128.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">They're finally here! It's Lanky Kong and Chunky Kong.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Regardless, long-term Kong fans are simply celebrating the fact that Nintendo has referenced these long-lost characters at all, after only a handful of glimpses over the past few decades.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Brawny but gentle Chunky Kong (cousin of Dixie Kong) has only made three video game appearances since his 1999 debut in Donkey Kong 64. He cameos in a Donkey Kong Country 3 mini-game on Game Boy Advance, then pops up as a sticker and spirit in Super Smash Bros. Brawl and Ultimate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Eagle-eyed fans also spotted a split-second appearance by Chunky Kong in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/the-super-mario-bros-movie">The Super Mario Bros. Movie</a>, standing alongside an equally-brief appearance for Diddy and Dixie — though you'll need to pause the film to really know it's him. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans had hoped that this appearance, and the fact Nintendo had gone to the trouble of slightly tweaking his design, suggested more appearances for Chunky Kong in future. And indeed, Bananza's upcoming statue seems to feature this same slightly-tweaked look. Could we see more of him in the upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie">Super Mario Galaxy Movie</a>, or perhaps even that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-has-filed-a-copyright-notice-for-an-untitled-donkey-kong-motion-picture">long-rumored upcoming Donkey Kong movie</a> spin-off? Time will tell.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The long-armed Lanky Kong, meanwhile, is similarly little-seen. He didn't get a Super Mario Bros. Movie cameo, but did appear as an unlockable character in 2007 Wii racer Donkey Kong: Barrel Blast. Could we be seeing more of him in the future too?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you haven't picked it up already, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-dk-island-and-emerald-rush-first-hands-on-impressions">Bananza's DLC</a> is stuffed full of references to Donkey Kong 64 and other past classics, with appearances from Diddy, Dixie, Cranky, Squawks the parrot from Donkey Kong Country and DK's house from Donkey Kong Country Returns. Other Kongs referenced (but not seen) include a poster for Candy Kong (don't ask) and a pair of Donkey Konga bongo drums to bounce around on top of. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So now, who's next for a return?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Valve is making a play for living rooms again with its new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-reveals-new-hardware-lineup-a-controller-compact-gaming-pc-and-vr-ready-headset/1100-6536148/">Steam Machine hardware</a>, and the company believes that the compact gaming PC could be equal to or better than what "70%" of people have at home currently. In a new interview, Valve engineer Yazan Aldehayyat explained that the Steam Machine is designed to be both a powerful and entry-level gaming device, capable of running most of the games in your Steam library at high performance levels.</p><p>"As you know, we definitely learned a lot, from 10 years ago. We learned a lot from the Steam Deck. We really feel like we have all the hardware and the software bits to make that vision a reality," Aldehayyat said to <a href="https://youtu.be/VkW3wTHT-p8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Tested</a>. "It needs to have enough performance to play all your Steam games; we wanted it to be a pretty simple experience. We also wanted to target more of an entry-level device. Affordability is really important, and definitely the price-point played a huge factor in what performance level we're trying to target. Another thing we looked at is the Steam Hardware Survey. It gives us a good benchmark of where people's home devices are at in terms of performance, and the Steam Machine is equal or better than 70% of what people have at home."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkW3wTHT-p8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VkW3wTHT-p8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Aldehayyat's comments might not be too far off the mark. Older gaming PCs are still capable of running a wide variety of games thanks to upscaling technologies, while in the console space, many games are still released for both current and last-gen machines, like the PS4 and the Switch. Valve has also said that the Steam Machine is over six times more powerful than the Steam Deck, and the official tech specs released for it do suggest that it'll be capable of comfortably playing modern PC games.</p><p>The biggest question so far about the Steam Deck isn't <em>how </em>it'll perform, but what it'll cost when it launches next year. Aldehayyat has mentioned that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-much-will-steam-machine-cost-heres-what-valve-had-to-say-about-pricing/1100-6536161/">Valve wants to sell Steam Machine units at a "competitive" price</a>, with analysts predicting that it could cost $400 in a best-case scenario or as much as $1,000 if Valve is aiming to break even on every sale or make a slim profit. This is the second time that Valve is launching a Steam Machine, but Valve says it's determined to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-is-aiming-for-its-new-steam-machine-to-succeed-where-the-original-failed/1100-6536209/">not repeat the mistakes of the past</a>.</p>

                <p>Retailer GameStop has announced a "Trade Anything Day," and as part of this, people can visit a store and trade anything. Well, not quite anything. There is a list of items that GameStop will not accept, including dead animals and illegal drugs.</p><p>The fine print for the December 6 event states that people can only bring in for trade items that fit into GameStop's own 20x20x20 box and that employees have discretion to reject any item.</p><p>In terms of the specific exclusions, GameStop said people cannot bring hazardous waste, weapons, dead or alive animals (taxidermy is OK, though), alcohol, tobacco, drugs (illegal or otherwise), "sexual and explicit" items, or items "resembling body parts." The full list of exclusions is <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=GameStop+%22Trade+Anything+Day%22+Is+Coming+Up+Soon%2C+Doesn%27t+Accept+%28Most%29+Dead+Animals+Or+Illegal+Drugs&amp;fnauthor=eddienoteddy&amp;fndate=2025-11-17+05%3A04%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-11-17+05%3A35%3A42&amp;fnarticle_id=6536265&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Standard+News&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DVZfI20jEa0c%26mid%3D24348%26u1%3Dsubid_value%26murl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.gamestop.com%252Ftrade%252F&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fgamestop-trade-anything-day-is-coming-up-soon-doesnt-accept-most-dead-animals-or-illegal-drugs%2F1100-6536265%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">available on GameStop's website.</a></p><p>It is unclear how GameStop will determine trade-in values for some of the odd items people may choose to bring on the day.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="d5a922d8707e4"><a title="Mega Starmie" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d5a922d8707e4/mega-starmie.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It came during the night. From the darkest, most existentially tortured recesses of a Game Freak designer’s brain. Diffidently, at first, then more boldly. Finally, hips swishing, stripper heels glittering, it announced itself across the Internet in a burst of dramatics. I am speaking, of course, of Mega Starmie, the breakout Internet star of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>.</p>
<p>At first, Mega Starmie frightened us. In its first official days of life, its long, powerful legs and humanoid gait evoked images of runway models, male, female, or otherwise; however, its lack of a head seemed at odds with this, confusing anyone who had liked those legs. <em>“Am I attracted to Mega Starmie?”</em> asked certain players, before ultimately dismissing Mega Starmie as a valiant yet unfinished design. Certainly, it was not something that they had thought of sexually when alone and three drinks in, staring out the window during a rainstorm.</p><div><figure data-videoid="2LcP6TZzqhM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt2LcP6TZzqhM" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed635c59yqsiul&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Next came the memes. They cast Mega Starmie as an outsider, an abomination, a sentient pair of legs with no real purpose for existing. And man, those legs took a beating. Every joke seemed to zero in on this one physical trait over which Mega Starmie had no real control.</p>
<p>They compared Mega Starmie to Patrick from <strong>SpongeBob SquarePants</strong>. They claimed that Mega Starmie was a bug the programmers had forgotten to address. They suggested Mega Starmie was physically violent. No one ever stopped to think about how this made Mega Starmie feel.</p>

<p>But it’s always darkest before dawn, and Mega Starmie began to build a cult of personality. Perhaps it was the meme of Mega Starmie as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fno-one-will-ever-convince-me-mega-starmie-is-bad-v0-nrjp2t8wqxxf1.png">Patrick in sexy fishnets</a>; perhaps it was Mega Starmie’s status as an underdog, spurned by society. Perhaps it was because of Mega Starmie’s Pokédex entry, which suggested that it had become more humanoid “to supplant humanity.” To break the wheel.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, Mega Starmie began to assume the role of a self-possessed rebel imbued with feminine power. A symbol of resistance. A queer icon.</p>

<p>Queer cosplayers across the Internet started <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@weeeelson/video/7568166463383571725">dressing as Mega Starmie</a>, both for Halloween and just to terrorise their conservative relatives. Awarding her the pronouns of she/her, they recast her as the protagonist of a new, celebratory strain of memes, positioning her as a SheEO and arbiter of taste. She appeared in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gay_irl/comments/1okhu8j/gayirl/"><strong>Devil Wears Prada</strong> memes</a>, <strong>Bridesmaids</strong> memes, <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/3152153-mega-starmie">Jean Claude Van Damme memes</a>. Drag queens learned how to paint like Mega Starmie and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DP9-eQFEktz/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==">constructed entire garments</a> to evoke her potent, otherworldly glamour.</p>
<p>Finally, Mega Starmie had a purpose in life: to slay.</p>

<p>Regular Starmie has already been memed before, of course. Once the Internet caught on to its vaguely sexual cries in French dubs of the original Pokémon series, people had a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/dOzdKjux6vI">field day.</a> But even French Starmie’s sex positivity and certified freak status weren’t enough to make it into a queer icon.</p>
<p>This time around, things are different. Mega Starmie is a former reject of society, excluded for her very nature. She didn’t choose to have long, muscular legs. She was born this way.</p>
<p>It also helps that Regular Starmie was already a queer icon of sorts before Legends: Z-A came out. Thanks to its officially genderless status according to <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokedex/starmie">the National Pokédex</a> and its purple-and-yellow colouring, which evokes the non-binary flag, Regular Starmie <a href="https://adobe-outdesign.tumblr.com/post/686157350094192640/starmie-has-been-referred-to-as-a-non-binary">has already been</a> a non-binary icon for many.</p>

<p>In fact, its former status has inspired passionate questions about how Mega Starmie should identify now in terms of its pronouns. Is Mega Starmie she/her? Or is Mega Starmie they/them? Perhaps she/they are comfortable with both labels and will accept either.</p>
<p>I choose to believe that Mega Starmie is nothing if not passionate about making her gender identity non-controversial. For this reason, I believe that she’s a she/they who uses any <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/guilhernunes.bsky.social/post/3m3dnvqn3q22z">discussion surrounding her labels</a> as an opportunity to educate her friends and provoke her haters, in a non-pedantic way.</p>
<p>And just like non-binary and trans people these days, Mega Starmie has often been misunderstood and even feared by the general populace. I mean, it’s not like she’s turning children gay by breathing on them, or Hydro Pump-ing every man she sees; a lot of the time, she’s just trying to teleport up to her trainer as he completes yet another scaffolding obstacle course. And we’re going to snicker behind her back? Wow.</p>
<figure data-uuid="51a923bceb5a4"><a title="Mega Starmie" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/51a923bceb5a4/mega-starmie.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Whatever people say about her, Mega Starmie is thriving these days. And she may even have a love interest soon. Word on the street is that Mega Malamar has also been claimed as a queer icon, one that’s even more out and proud than Mega Starmie. In one meme, Mega Malamar can be seen using his psychic powers to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DObbGIYCK3-/?hl=en">spread gay rights around the world</a>. Honestly, he sounds like a perfect match for Meg. They can attend rallies together.</p>
<p>Also, the world needs another ludicrous fictional couple to root for now that Pennywise and the Babadook have parted ways. At least, I assume they have. I used to check every year but I haven’t in a while. Maybe that’s because my mental health has improved.</p>
<p>And maybe <em>that’s</em> because I know that there’s a Mega Starmie out there somewhere, watching over the queers, singing <strong>God Help the Outcasts</strong> as she struts down Centrico Plaza, Mega Kick-ing anyone who doesn’t have a Pride flag on their porch.</p>

			<p>It's no mystery that Valve's Steam platform continues to grow at a steady rate. Over the past few years, we've reported several new concurrent peak player records, the last of which <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-achieves-new-concurrent-player-record-over-41-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was recorded a month ago with around 41.6 million users</a> online at the same time.</p>



<p>Unsurprisingly, this also translates into higher sales on the store. <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/valves-bold-expected-return-to-the" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to Rhys Elliott from Alinea Analytics</a>, Steam has already generated sales for around $16.2 billion in 2025, a 5.7% increase over 2024's estimated $15.33 billion. Do note that 2024's data point is, of course, final, whereas there are still 44 days left in 2025, and it's arguably the period when people spend more due to Thanksgiving, Black Friday sales, Holiday gifts, and so on. It would not be a surprise to see Steam break the $17 billion threshold by year's end.</p>



<p>Valve takes a substantial cut out of each sale conducted on the store: 30% until the product reaches $10 million in revenue, 25% between $10 million and $50 million, and 20% over $50 million. It's one of the ways the <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-taking-fight-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Epic Games Store</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-store-fee-lowered-from-30-to-12-for-pc-games-halo-infinite-will-have-crossplay-and-cross-progression/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">later the Microsoft Store</a> have attempted to compete with Valve's store (which many game developers still consider a monopoly) by offering a higher revenue per sale than they can get on Steam. On those stores, developers only pay a 12% fee and get 88% of the sale.</p>



<p>Epic also famously paid hefty sums to secure big temporary game exclusives, such as Borderlands 3, on its store. At one point, Epic founder Tim Sweeney even <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-tim-sweeney-promises-forego-exclusive-deals-if/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">challenged Valve to match the Epic Games Store's revenue split</a>, stating that he would have ended the exclusivity program if they agreed to do so.</p>



<p>Valve never flinched, though, thanks to the unwavering loyalty of hundreds of millions of gamers. While Epic did manage to carve for itself a sizable platform on the EGS, between exclusive, free games, and the evergreen Fortnite, Steam did not suffer in the least and, as shown by these figures, keeps growing.</p>



<p>Alinea Analytics estimates that Valve has already earned $4 billion in 2025 from the sales on its store. With these numbers, it's perhaps no wonder that its president, co-founder, and majority stakeholder, Gabe Newell, has a lot of money to spare.</p>



<p>Earlier this month, website Boat International <a href="https://www.boatinternational.com/yachts/news/oceanco-y722-superyacht-leviathan-delivery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that Newell has just received his latest superyacht, a 111-meter entirely custom wonder called Leviathan. Produced by Oceanco (which was also acquired by the Valve owner earlier this year), it can accommodate up to 22 guests plus 33 crew members. It features two gyms, a spa, a bar, a basketball half-court, a beach club, a small hospital, and, of course, an entertainment room equipped with fifteen top-of-the-line gaming PCs.</p>



<p>With Steam poised to expand its ecosystem even further <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-unveils-steam-frame-steam-machine-steam-controller-launch-early-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with the launches of the Steam Machine, Steam Frame, and Steam Controller products early next year</a>, Valve's billionaire owner, who recently said he lives full-time at sea but still works remotely on various company projects, will probably be able to afford more of these superyachts in the near future.</p>

            <p>November digs in. The conveyor belt of crowns, clowns and clones that is Videogaming rattles onward through the midnight forest. The rains swept past over the weekend and now the mud is waist-deep, worryingly responsive, and rank with the stench of neglected deckbuilders. Several sedan chairs carrying former BioWare creative leads are caught in a wave of slop, becoming a disorderly barricade of people crying out for Femshep to come save them from the GAAS. Tencent executives rush over with handfuls of rope, but whether they mean to drag the afflicted free or bind their limbs is unclear.
</p><!--more-->
<p>Answering the call of nature, you wade away from the tumult of shovels and torches. As you pass behind a trunk, you are caught in the spell of metsänpeitto, and are suddenly alone. There is no sound, neither the shriek of mired horses nor the clinking of coins in the CEO carriages. The trunks lean towards the glow of your lantern. Then you hear a crackle. Twitching radiance guides you through a gap to a clearing, where five hooded arcanists circle a ritual pyre. Each is named for a weekday, and each has a bagful of new PC games they now thrust upon you. Which will you choose? Do not refuse them all: the flames can always take another body.

<p>The choice is made. Your sight thickens abruptly, the fire falling still. The hooded figures swell and pustulate and you realise that you are looking at a circle of mushrooms, while lying flat on a boulder of moss.</p>
<p>You rise to your feet groggily. Behind you, the great procession of Videogaming continues. Somebody has resolved the sedan chair situation by rolling the ex-BioWare contingent into an enormous, squelching katamari. A few bats swoop past as you resume your place in the convoy. Keep trudging onward. Surely this forest has an outside. Some day, December will come.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-joy-con-controllers-l-r-are-going-for-peanuts-as-a-special-early-black-friday-deal.1355542/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>One of the main ways to play on the Nintendo Switch is with the Joy-Con controllers. If you’ve been looking to upgrade your existing ones or just want to gift a fresh set to a gamer in your life this holiday season, we’ve got good news.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5630/">Right now, the Nintendo Joy-Con (L/R) are down to $79 on Amazon, which is 12% off their usual $90 price tag.</a> Joy-Cons rarely see major discounts, which makes this one a great option to grab a new pair without paying the full price. There are other color options available, too, though the discount may vary depending on the one you choose. The Neon Red and Blue combo is a classic, though, and it makes the most sense to grab it while it’s the most heavily discounted. We just highly recommend acting fast to snag it up, as the deal is likely going to wrap up soon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5630/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Multiple Ways to Play</h2>
<p>These Bluetooth controllers can be used in multiple ways. You can use them independently in each hand, attach them to a Joy-Con grip for a single controller-style unit, or snap them onto the Switch for handheld gaming. Each of these has a full set of buttons, so using one as a standalone mini-controller won’t feel limiting at all. In fact, it’s going to come in handy for some two-player sessions in games!</p>
<p>There’s an accelerometer paired with a gyro-sensor for accurate, two-dimensional movement tracking. These make it possible to pull off motion-based gameplay without requiring any additional accessories.</p>



<p>Battery-wise, you’re looking at up to 20 hours of continuous use on a full charge, which is more than enough to support at least a couple days of gaming. They recharge quickly too and are back to full in about 3.5 hours, so you can get back to the action without much downtime. Recharging can be done by attaching them to the Nintendo Switch console while it’s docked or plugged in. You can also insert them in the Joy-Con Charging Grip which is sold separately, or go for third-party charging accessories.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5630/">Again, it’s best to grab the offer sooner rather than later. We’re not expecting Amazon to keep this deal live for too long, especially with holiday shopping ramping up.</a> Once the discount disappears, you’ll have to pay the full $90 price or worse, deal with shipping delays.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5630/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>It has been confirmed that at least five games will leave Xbox Game Pass this November.</p>

<p>It’s currently unknown if the list of games will be the final total, but generally speaking, Xbox removes around five to ten games per month, so don’t forget to claim them now before they leave the subscription server!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Everstone Studio's Where Winds Meet does a lot of things right, but its AI chatbot NPCs are unironically one of its best features, leading to all sorts of hilarious interactions that players are fully embracing.</p>



<p>Many of the game's NPCs, with which players can build lasting relationships as part of the game's core mechanics, are actually powered by AI chatbots that reply to all sorts of inputs from the player. During the early access review period of the global version, I wasn't able to make them do anything other than repeat some set lines, but now that the game is finally live, these NPCs are fully functional, and players have been testing how much they can be pushed to provide some genuinely fun interactions.</p>



<h3 id="h-the-most-vicious-ai-break-up-child-support-and-grief">The Most Vicious AI Break-Up: Child Support and Grief</h3>



<p>One user on the game's <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WhereWindsMeet/comments/1oxqhuz/anybody_else_mentally_break_the_zhao_dali_ai_just/">official subreddit</a>, MisterZan25, proved to be particularly cruel, subjecting the Zhao Dali NPC to a vicious narrative arc. The player made the NPC believe their character was pregnant with their child, demanded child support, and eventually informed them that the child had died.</p>



<p>The AI NPC believed the entire scenario and reacted dramatically to the news, <strong>providing a moment of dark comedy.</strong></p>



<blockquote>
<figure></figure>
</blockquote>



<h3 id="h-life-advice-and-martial-arts-moves">Life Advice and Martial Arts Moves</h3>



<p>Not all interactions have to be so destructive in Where Winds Meet. Some kind-hearted players have tried to lift the spirits of some AI NPCs, often resulting in reactions that fit the Wuxia setting.</p>



<p>User lessobvious had a <strong>constructive exchange</strong> with an NPC, successfully lifting their spirits by highlighting the value of training, even after that training had failed to help the NPC find a wife.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>User zheiro provided life advice to an AI NPC, who <strong>appreciated the guidance and thanked the user gracefully</strong> in a manner that felt perfectly in line with the game’s aesthetic.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>User OtherwiseEnd944, on the other hand, decided to have a little bit of fun with another NPC, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wherewindsmeet_/comments/1oxmtez/the_ai_is_killing_me/">suggesting a rather "peculiar" martial arts move</a>, which<strong> left the NPC baffled</strong>, proving the system reacts even to the most absurd of interactions.</p>



<h3 id="h-taunt-npcs-and-pay-the-price">Taunt NPCs and Pay the Price</h3>



<p>The AI’s reactivity extends beyond mere conversation. Treating the NPCs rudely can lead to believable, and sometimes violent, reactions. User Sensitive_Touch_8190 taunted an AI NPC repeatedly, and after having had enough, <strong>the character retaliated</strong>.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Even if this sort of bizarre, player-driven feature isn't your alley, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Where Winds Meet</strong> has a lot to offer for all sorts of players.

            <title><![CDATA[MSI’s $380 QD-OLED gaming monitor is one of 2025’s best deals so far]]></title>
            <link>https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/820451/msi-qd-oled-1440p-gaming-monitor-deal-sale-black-friday</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/msi%E2%80%99s-380-qd-oled-gaming-monitor-is-one-of-2025%E2%80%99s-best-deals-so-far.1355518/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>At $380, MSI’s 27-inch 1440p QD-OLED gaming monitor is one of the best purchases <em>Verge </em>readers who want an awesome gaming upgrade can make now. That’s how much it costs in an online-only deal at <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.costco.com/p/-/msi-265-wqhd-qd-oled-240hz-amd-freesync-premium-pro-gaming-monitor/4000411993?langId=-1" rel="sponsored">Costco</a> for <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.costco.com/join-costco.html" rel="sponsored">membership holders</a> through December 1st. In case you’re curious as to what kind of OLED monitor you can get for just $380, so was I. So I got MSI to send over a review unit, which I’ve been using for over a week.</p><p>This monitor (model MAG271QPX E2) doesn’t really differ from several other similarly-sized models. It offers a fast 240Hz refresh rate, fantastic viewing angles compared to cheaper panel types, and colors that really pop. It’s not typically one I’d suggest most people buy at its usual <a href="https://www.amazon.com/MSI-QD-OLED-27-inch-Response-Adjustable/dp/B0D68C1BVS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">$599</a> sale price, but it becomes an extremely compelling value for $200 less.</p><p>MSI’s QD-OLED replaced an aging Acer 1440p IPS 144Hz monitor at my desk, and the difference was profound when I jumped into a game. I’ve been playing a lot of <em>Battlefield 6</em> lately, and the landscapes look more lived-in than they do with the limited, pale color gamut that my IPS can muster. The chaotic action looks a little more real, thanks to more vivid-looking explosions. Every little aspect of the interface is easier to parse, too, thanks to OLEDs unbeatable contrast ratio.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>I’m happy with how this monitor looks, especially for this doorbuster price.</em></figcaption></p></div><p><em>Ambrosia Sky</em> is another title I recently picked up that looks particularly stunning on this display. I wish I had started testing this around Halloween, when I was playing more scary games, because its deep black levels look fantastic in my home office — it’s got great contrast. If this is your first OLED gaming monitor and you haven’t yet experienced the difference between that and an inferior panel type, you’re in for a treat that keeps on giving.</p><p>I play a lot of games, but I type articles in Google Docs more often because of my job. OLEDs have a bad reputation for rendering text; various subpixel layout types introduce color-tinged aliasing that’s not present on IPS and other types of non-OLED panels. The evidence of this is irrefutable under close inspection, as this <a href="https://youtu.be/lrdllziZe5w?si=isDLVHCijYqUKk2a&amp;t=159">Monitors Unboxed hands-on video</a> proves. However, as the video mentions, you may not notice it. From the distance I sit from the monitor, it looks fine to me.</p><p>This monitor’s specs make it a particularly good deal compared to other non-OLED monitors at this price point. This model supports variable refresh rate between the range of 48Hz and 240Hz. While it only lists support for AMD FreeSync Premium Pro adaptive sync, not Nvidia G-Sync, I’ve been happy with its performance in a range of games while connected to my Nvidia RTX 5070 Ti-powered PC. The panel itself is covered in an “anti-reflection” coating that appears semi-glossy, so it might catch reflections in a well-lit room. This monitor comes with a nice height-adjustable stand that allows for tilting, swiveling, and pivoting, but I just tossed it on my monitor arm thanks to its VESA mount.</p><p>MSI covers the monitor with a three-year warranty that includes panel burn-in, which is great. I’m also smitten with this model’s ports. It sports one DisplayPort 1.4a port, two HDMI 2.1 ports supporting up to 240Hz on PC (or up to 120Hz on consoles), plus one USB-C with DisplayPort video, which works great with my Steam Deck, and a headphone jack. That port allows 15W PD charging, but is turned off by default.</p><p>If there’s one complaint that I have, it’s that the plastic chassis on the back is a bit chunky compared to other models that I’ve tested. However, MSI says that this is where the monitor’s heatsink is located, which allows it to have a fanless design. And at $380, this complaint doesn’t hold much water.</p><p>If you aren’t a Costco member, it may be worth it to become one if only just for this deal. But if you don’t plan to become one, it’s possible that we’ll see deals at other retailers for this model. It sold for $449.99 at Amazon during the Prime Big Deal Days, so hopefully that price (or ideally, something better) will pop up during Black Friday.</p><p>While Best Buy only sells the MSI monitor through a third-party seller, the retailer currently has <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Falienware-aw2725d-27-qd-oled-qhd-280hz-0-03-ms-freesync-and-g-sync-gaming-monitor-with-hdr-hdmi-displayport-black%2FJ3K4L6RFPL%2Fsku%2F6640502" rel="sponsored">Alienware’s AW2725D</a>, the company’s 27-inch 280Hz 1440p QD-OLED, for $499.99 — a $50 price drop. LG’s 27-inch 1440p OLED with 240Hz refresh rate (which seems very similar to MSI’s) is $499.99 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DF786923/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>. In other words, there are deals to be had just about anywhere. But right now, Costco’s is the one to beat on a QD-OLED gaming monitor.</p><p><em>Photography by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge</em></p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/820451/msi-qd-oled-1440p-gaming-monitor-deal-sale-black-friday]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Amazon Is Practically Giving Away the New Fire TV Stick HD in a Pre–Black Friday Price Meltdown]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/ahead-of-black-friday-amazon-has-its-fire-tv-stick-hd-on-sale-for-half-price-2000644443</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-is-practically-giving-away-the-new-fire-tv-stick-hd-in-a-pre%E2%80%93black-friday-price-meltdown.1355515/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Back when the Amazon Fire TV Stick first showed up, the whole pitch was basically, “Hey, plug this in and boom—your old TV is suddenly smart.” Fast-forward to now, and most TVs fresh off the shelf already have some kind of smart interface built in. The thing is, a lot of those built-in interfaces… kind of suck. Some companies still haven’t cracked the code on making a simple, smooth UI. (Looking at you, LG, with your strange Wiimote-wannabe remotes). So at this point, the real draw of the Fire TV Stick isn’t that it makes your TV “smart”—it’s that it gives you a <em data-start="722" data-end="730">better</em> smart experience. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4359/">And right now, the newest Fire TV Stick HD is down to just $18.</a> Normally it runs $35, but this deal chops nearly half off the price, which is pretty hard to complain about.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4359/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Once you plug it in, you can basically stream anything you’d expect: Netflix, Hulu, HBO Max (or whatever they’re deciding to call it this month), Disney+, Prime Video—the usual cast.. As long as you’ve got the subscriptions, the content is there. But even if you don’t want to spend any more on streaming subs, the Fire TV Stick actually has quite a bit of free stuff built in. Apps like Freevee, Tubi, Pluto TV, and a ton of Fire TV’s own free channels give you a surprising amount of movies and TV show episodes to just kick back and watch. Sure, they’re ad-supported, but free is free.</p>
<p data-start="1513" data-end="1986">One of the nicest quality-of-life things is the Alexa remote. No one enjoys hunting and pecking their way through an on-screen keyboard with a clunky d-pad. With the Alexa button, you literally just say what you want—“play <em data-start="1736" data-end="1742">Dune</em>” or “find <em data-start="1753" data-end="1770">The Mandalorian</em>”—and it pulls it up for you. It even scans across multiple apps to tell you which service actually has the thing you’re searching for, which saves you from the endless “which app did I watch that on?” guessing game.</p>


<h2 data-start="1513" data-end="1986">Cloud-based Gaming</h2>
<p data-start="1988" data-end="2503">Another neat perk that’s becoming more and more practical: you can actually play cloud-streamed Xbox games through it. If you’ve got Game Pass Ultimate, you don’t need an Xbox console at all—the cloud streaming service lets you play straight on your Fire Stick as long as your internet isn’t terrible. It’s kind of wild being able to fire up games like <em data-start="2321" data-end="2334">Animal Well</em> or <em data-start="2338" data-end="2374">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> on something only marginally larger than pack of gum. As long as your Wi-Fi is steady, the whole experience is way smoother than you’d expect. And now with&nbsp;<em>Red Dead Redemption 2&nbsp;</em>coming to a number of services including Netflix, now’s a great time to experiment with cloud gaming.</p>

      I started trying to install SteamOS on other PCs basically as soon as Valve made it possible.

<p>Valve’s second big foray into first-party PC hardware <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/11/valve-says-its-still-waiting-for-better-chips-to-power-steam-deck-2/">isn’t</a> a sequel to the much-imitated Steam Deck portable, but rather <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/11/steam-deck-minus-the-screen-valve-announces-new-steam-machine-controller-hardware/">a desktop computer</a> called the Steam Machine. And while it could go on your desk, Valve clearly intends for it to fit in an entertainment center under a TV—next to, or perhaps even instead of, a game console like the Xbox or PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>I am pretty sure this idea could work, and it’s because I’ve already been experimenting with what is essentially a “Steam Machine” underneath my own TV for months, starting in May when Valve began <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/steamos-3-7-brings-valves-gaming-os-to-other-handhelds-and-generic-amd-pcs/">making it possible to install SteamOS on certain kinds of generic PC hardware</a>.</p>
<p>Depending on what it costs—<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/11/are-you-ready-for-a-1000-steam-machine-some-analysts-think-you-should-be/">and we can only guess what it will cost</a>—the Steam Machine could be a good fit for people who just want to plug a more powerful version of the Steam Deck experience into their TVs. But for people who like tinkering or who, like me, have been messing with miniature TV-connecting gaming PCs for years and are simply tired of trying to make Windows workable, the future promised by the Steam Machine is already here.</p>
<h2>My TV PC setup</h2>
<p>I had always been sort of TV PC-curious, but I can trace my current setup to December 2018, when, according to a Micro Center receipt in my inbox, I built a $504.51 PC in a tiny InWin Chopin case centered on an <a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/cpu-specs/ryzen-5-2400g.c1976">AMD Ryzen 5 2400G processor</a>.</p>
<p>At the time, the Ryzen brand was only a couple of years old, and the 2400G <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/amd-ryzen-5-2400g-zen-vega-cpu-gpu,5467-11.html">had impressed reviewers</a> by combining a competent-enough quad-core CPU with a usably performant integrated GPU. And the good news was: It worked! It was nowhere near as good as the graphical experience that, say, a PlayStation 4 could provide, but it worked well for older and indie games, while also giving me access to a TV-connected computer for the occasions when I wanted to stream things from a browser, or participate in a living room-scale Zoom call (something that would become the box’s main job during the pandemic-induced isolation of 2020 and early 2021).</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>(This PC evolved over time and currently uses a Ryzen 8700G processor, which includes AMD’s best CPU and integrated GPU for socketed desktop motherboards. I did this to get more stable 1080p performance in more games, but I would not recommend this build to most people right now—more on that in a bit.)</p>
<p>The main problem was Windows, which was not and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/full-screen-xbox-handheld-ui-is-coming-to-all-windows-pcs-starting-next-year/">still is not</a> particularly well-optimized for controller-driven living room use. What I really wanted was a startup process that felt more or less like a game console: hit the power button, and automatically get launched into a gamepad-navigable interface that would let me launch and play things without touching a mouse or keyboard.</p>
<p>There are third-party apps like <a href="https://www.launchbox-app.com/">Launchbox</a> that make a go of providing this functionality for people more interested in emulation or who own games from multiple PC storefronts. What I eventually settled on was <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/838506/how-to-sign-into-your-windows-11-pc-automatically/">a sort of hacky fix</a> that allowed my user account to log in automatically, and then automatically launch Steam in <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/3725-76D3-3F31-FB63">Big Picture Mode</a>.</p>
<p>This worked… fine—except when I needed to interact with a mouse and keyboard to install driver updates, or when some component of the Windows UI would steal focus from the Big Picture Mode window and make it impossible to use the controller to navigate.</p>
<p>So when reports indicated that Valve was working on a SteamOS version that would run on more hardware, I was immediately interested. SteamOS was designed to boot right into its gaming interface, and the desktop mode was its own separate thing that you needed to open up manually—ideal for my usage model, since I didn’t want to <em>give up</em> the desktop mode but also didn’t need to use it often. But I did run into some bumps during the installation process, which I’ll share here in case it helps you avoid them.</p>

<p>I had trouble using Valve’s official restore image (SteamOS version 3.7.7, from <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/1b71-edf2-eb6d-2bb3#reimage">this support page</a>) to get newer hardware working, which may be one reason why that language was softened. It was no problem to install official first-party SteamOS on slightly older hardware, like the Ryzen 7040 version of the Framework Laptop 13 or an older Acer laptop with a Ryzen 6000-series processor installed. But trying to install the software on newer hardware failed no matter what I tried. Those systems included the Ryzen AI 300 version of the Framework Laptop; a socket AM5 testbed desktop with a dedicated Radeon RX 7800 XT GPU; and, to my great disappointment, my TV desktop’s Ryzen 7 8700G.</p>
<p>There’s very little information out there about installing or troubleshooting SteamOS on generic hardware, but if you poke around on Reddit about much of anything, you’ll quickly meet a specific Type of Guy who believes that anyone with hardware compatibility issues should just use <a href="https://bazzite.gg/">Bazzite</a>, a community-developed alternate operating system that attempts to provide a SteamOS-ish alternative with wider hardware support (including for Intel and Nvidia hardware, which isn’t likely to be supported by the official SteamOS any time soon).</p>
<p>And so Bazzite I tried! Indicating that I used an AMD GPU and wanted to boot into the SteamOS interface offered me the exact same image that Bazzite offers for the Steam Deck and other handhelds, and it installed on my Ryzen desktop with minimal fuss.</p>
<p>Bazzite also came&nbsp;<em>painfully</em> close to what I wanted it to be, in terms of user experience—a desktop mode to boot into on the occasions I needed one, but otherwise I could just fire up the Xbox controller I had paired to the PC and jump right into a game.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>But Bazzite was sunk by the same kind of bugs and edge cases that often chase me away from Linux operating systems when I try them. The main issue was that periodically, the system would boot up into desktop mode without asking (usually this seemed to happen when the Steam client software needed an update, but I can’t say for sure). Restarting the system would usually boot it back into the SteamOS interface—but I’d need to log in all over again, <em>and</em> the OS would switch Bluetooth off by default. Not only am I having to dig out a keyboard and mouse to solve this problem, but I’m needing to use a&nbsp;<em>wired</em> keyboard until I could get Bluetooth turned back on.</p>
<p>By the time this had happened twice, I was sure it wasn’t a fluke; by the time it had happened four or five times, I was determined to blow the entire operating system away and try again. And I was particularly interested in trying actual, for-real SteamOS again, just in case a new Bazzite install would have the same problems as the one I was already using.</p>
<p>After some digging, I found <a href="https://steamdeck-images.steamos.cloud/steamdeck/">this directory</a>. If you look through those folders, you’ll see OS images for various versions of SteamOS, including newer versions of SteamOS 3.7 (the “stable” version you’ll find on the Deck) and builds of both SteamOS 3.8 and 3.9 (the Deck will pull these down if you switch from the “stable” OS channel to “main”). Not all of those folders include the repair image you need to wipe a device and install SteamOS, but a few do—<a href="https://steamdeck-images.steamos.cloud/steamdeck/20251027.1000/">this one</a>, dated October 27, is the most recent as of this writing.</p>
<p>Those newer versions of the operating system include changes that expand SteamOS’s hardware support, most notably a step up from Linux kernel version 6.11 to version 6.16. And it was that <code>steamdeck-repair-main-20251027.1000-3.8.0.img.zip</code> file that I was finally able to <a href="https://etcher.balena.io/">flash to a USB drive</a> and install on my TV desktop <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/65B4-2AA3-5F37-4227">using Valve’s instructions</a>.</p>

    <div>
          
          
<p>It has only been a week or so since then, but at least so far I’m finally getting what I wanted: the same experience as on my Deck, just on my TV, with hardware that is somewhat better-suited for a larger and higher-resolution screen (and that’s the main reason to do this, rather than use a docked Steam Deck for everything).</p>
<h2>The SteamOS experience</h2>

      The “console-like experience” designed for the Steam Deck also works well with a TV and a gamepad.

<p>Once the OS is installed and is up and running, anyone who has used a Steam Deck will find it instantly familiar, and all you’ll need to do to get going is connect or pair a gamepad and/or a keyboard and mouse.</p>
<p>Most of the bugs and quirks I’ve run into stem from the fact that this software was developed for standalone handheld gaming consoles first and foremost. There are multiple settings toggles—including those for adaptive brightness and HDMI-CEC—that serve a purpose on the Steam Deck but just don’t function on a desktop, where these features usually aren’t present or aren’t supported.</p>
<p>SteamOS is also pretty hit or miss about selecting the correct resolution and refresh rate for a connected display. Navigate to the Settings, to Display, and then turn off the “Automatically Set Resolution” toggle, and you’ll see a full list of supported resolutions and refresh rates that you can pick from. You may also want to scroll down and change the “Maximum Game Resolution” from “Native” to the actual native resolution of your screen, since I occasionally encountered games that wouldn’t offer resolutions that were supported by the display I was using.</p>
<p>Similarly, you may need to navigate to the Audio settings and switch output devices if you’re sending audio over HDMI. I also needed to turn the audio output volume up to around 80 percent before the sound coming out of my Steam Machine would match the volume of all the other boxes connected to my TV.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>And if you’ve never used SteamOS before, it’s worth reading up on some of its limitations. While its compatibility with Windows games is quite good, Valve’s Proton compatibility layer is in continuous development, and not every game will play perfectly or play at all. Games that use anti-cheat software are <a href="https://areweanticheatyet.com/">still broadly incompatible with SteamOS</a>, since many anti-cheat programs hook into the Windows kernel in ways that are impossible to translate or emulate. And while it’s possible to run games from other storefronts like Epic or GOG, it’s best done with third-party software like the <a href="https://heroicgameslauncher.com/">Heroic Games Launcher</a>, adding an extra layer of complexity.</p>
<p>And although SteamOS includes a useful desktop mode, it’s really not meant to be used as a day-to-day workhorse operating system—security features like “using a password to log in” are off by default in the interest of expediency, and you need to open your system to bootloader tampering just to install it. It’s fine for installing and running the odd desktop app every once in a while, but I’d hesitate to trust it with anything sensitive.</p>
<p>Finally, while our tests have shown that SteamOS <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/games-run-faster-on-steamos-than-windows-11-ars-testing-finds/">generally performs at least as well, if not better, than Windows</a> running on the same hardware, the first-party version of SteamOS is still made with handhelds and other low-power hardware in mind. In my limited testing of SteamOS on desktops with both integrated and with more powerful dedicated GPUs, I’ve generally found that those observations hold up. But I’ve only tested on a narrow range of hardware, and you could easily encounter a setup where SteamOS just doesn’t run games as well as Windows does.</p>

<p>Say you’re interested in having a Steam Machine, you don’t want to wait for Valve, and you don’t just happen to have a spare ideally configured AMD-based PC to sacrifice to the testing gods.</p>

          
                  </div>

<p>I am more or less happy with my custom-built mini ITX Steam Machine, but I find it difficult to recommend this hardware combination to basically anybody at this point. For me, it scratched a PC-building itch, and the potential for future upgradability is mildly interesting to me. But given the high cost of AMD’s Socket AM5 platform and spiking costs for RAM and SSDs, it’s going to be difficult to put together an 8700G-focused system in an InWin Chopin for less than $800. And that’s a whole lot to pay for a years-old Radeon 780M GPU.</p>
<p>For a more budget-friendly Steam Machine, consider the range of no-name mini PCs available on Amazon and some other places. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/what-i-learned-when-i-replaced-my-cheap-pi-5-pc-with-a-no-name-amazon-mini-desktop/">We’ve dabbled with systems</a> from manufacturers like Aoostar, Beelink, Bosgame, and GMKtec before and come away conditionally impressed by the ratio of utility-to-performance, and YouTubers like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLl0WU8Gkzk">RetroGameCorps</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N88lXCTMNqE">ETA Prime</a> periodically cover new ones and generally have positive things to say. You’re rolling the dice on long-term reliability and support, but it’s also tough to argue with the convenience of the form factor or the pricing compared to a custom-built system.</p>
<p>If you’re going this route, we have some general recommendations and performance numbers, based on testing of similar chips in other laptops and desktops. Note that the Ryzen 6800U/Radeon 680M system is an Acer Swift Edge 16 laptop with 16GB of soldered DDR5, while the Ryzen 7840U/Radeon 780M system is a Framework Laptop 13 with non-soldered DDR5. Performance may differ a few FPS in either direction depending on your hardware configuration. The Ryzen 7700X/Radeon RX 7600 system is a custom-built testbed desktop similar to the one we use for testing CPUs and GPUs; based on hardware alone, we’d expect the real Steam Machine to perform near or slightly below .</p>

<p>In the $350 to $400 range, look for PCs with a Ryzen 6800-series chip in them, like the 6800H or 6850H (here’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DQKRXKS5">one from GMKTec for $385</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F62L51RJ">one from Beelink for $379</a>). These processors come with a Radeon 680M integrated GPU, with 12 compute units (CUs) based on the RDNA2 architecture. These boxes will offer performance slightly superior to the actual Steam Deck, which uses eight RDNA2 CUs and squeezes them into a system with a small power envelope.</p>
<p>If you can spend around $500, that generally seems to get you the best performance for the price right now. Look for processors in the Ryzen 7040 or 8040 series, or the Ryzen 250 series (here’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CQ4WBV8L">one for $$490 from GMKtec</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DZBSPBN9">one for $499 from Bosgame</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FSKYK2MQ">one for $449 from Aoostar</a>). These chips all offer broadly similar combinations of eight Zen 4-based CPU cores, and a 12-core Radeon 780M GPU based on the RDNA3 architecture.</p>
<p>In a mini desktop, this GPU can come pretty close to doubling the performance of the Steam Deck, though it will still fall short of most dedicated graphics cards. It’s similar to the performance level of <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/processors/handhelds/ryzen-z-series/z2-series/z2.html">the non-Extreme version of the Ryzen Z2 chip</a> for competing handhelds. The 780M is also the same GPU that comes with the Ryzen 8700G desktop chip I use, and I’ve found that it gets you decent 1080p performance in many games.</p>
<p>The GPU is the most important thing to focus on in these systems, since it’s going to have the most impact on the way games actually run. But keep an eye on RAM and storage, too; a 1TB SSD is obviously preferable to a 500GB SSD. And while most of these come with a healthy 32GB of RAM by default, pay attention to the <em>type</em> of RAM. If it just says “DDR5,” that’s most likely to be socketed RAM that’s a bit slower, but which you can upgrade yourself if you want. If it comes with LPDDR5X, that’s going to be soldered down, but also a bit faster, maximizing your graphics performance.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>The Steam Deck is a useful benchmark here, because it’s a fixed hardware platform that’s popular enough that PC game developers sometimes go out of their way to target. Games often include Steam Deck-specific graphics presets, which are a useful starting point when you’re fiddling with settings.</p>
<p>I would generally try to avoid systems with Ryzen AI 300-series chips in them—their Radeon 890M GPUs are faster, but they can also be twice as expensive as the Radeon 780M boxes. I’d also stay away from anything with Ryzen 5000 or 3000-series chips, or Ryzen 7030-series chips. The price tags on these $200 to $300 systems are tempting, and they <em>will</em> probably run SteamOS, but their older Vega-based GPUs will fall far short of the Steam Deck’s GPU, let alone the Radeon 680M or 780M.</p>

<p>OK, but what if you have more money to spend, and you’re more interested in 1440p or 4K gaming performance (roughly what Valve is targeting with the actual Steam Machine)? I think that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/review-framework-desktop-is-a-mash-up-of-a-regular-desktop-pc-and-the-mac-studio/">the Framework Desktop</a> is a surprisingly good fit here; <a href="https://frame.work/products/desktop-diy-amd-aimax300/configuration/new">$1,200</a> will get you a console-sized PC with an eight-core Zen 5 CPU, a Radeon 8050S GPU with 32 CUs based on the RDNA 3.5 architecture (the Steam Machine has 28 RDNA3 CUs), 32GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD.&nbsp; I can confirm firsthand that SteamOS 3.8/3.9 installs and runs just fine.</p>
<p>This desktop is <em>probably</em> a bit more expensive than the Steam Machine will end up being, but it’s impossible to say how much more expensive before Valve actually puts out a price.</p>
<h2>The TV PC is ready for its close-up</h2>
<p>TV-connected PCs have historically been a niche thing. They’re expensive, they’re finicky, and purpose-built game consoles have always provided a more pleasant and seamless experience for people who just want to do everything with a controller from the couch.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>But the TV PC could finally be ready for its moment. In SteamOS, Valve has created a pretty good, pretty widely compatible Windows substitute that buries a lot of the PC’s complexity (without totally removing it, for the people who want it sometimes). Like the Nintendo Switch, Valve has crafted a user interface that feels good to use on a handheld screen and on a TV from 10 feet away.</p>
<p>And this is happening at the same time as a weird detente in the console wars, where Sony seems to be embracing PC ports and easing up on exclusive releases at the same time as Microsoft <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/10/rog-xbox-ally-x-the-ars-technica-review/">seems</a>, for all intents and purposes, to be winding down the Xbox hardware operation <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/why-microsofts-next-xbox-should-just-run-windows-already/">in favor of Windows</a>. Valve is way out in front of Microsoft on its console-style PC interface at the same time as the PC is becoming a sort of universally compatible über-console.</p>
<p>I’m kind of the ideal audience for the Steam Machine; nearly all my PC games are on Steam, I play practically nothing that requires anti-cheat software, and I play mostly graphically undemanding indie games rather than GPU-bruising AAA titles. So, you know, take my enthusiasm for the concept with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>But as someone who has already functionally been living with a Steam Machine for months, I think that Valve’s new hardware could do for living room PCs what the Steam Deck has done for handhelds: defining and expanding a product category that others have tried and failed to crack.

            <p>Capcom is working to ensure Resident Evil Requiem will perform well on PC, following a multitude of technical issues this year with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>.</p>
<p>The company has been heavily criticised for the performance of Monster Hunter Wilds, though it's acknowledged those issues. A <a href="https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1988371442619003050?s=20">free update is due on 16th December</a>, something <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-monster-hunter-wilds-pc-players-wait-almost-a-year-for-better-performance-capcom-is-in-danger-of-losing-its-most-important-audience">players have been waiting the majority of the year for</a>.</p>
<p>It seems Capcom has learned its lesson, though, and will ensure Resident Evil Requiem won't suffer a similar fate.</p>

<p>"Resident Evil Requiem differs from Monster Hunter Wilds in terms of gameplay, system architecture, and network features," said Capcom during a <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/pdf/explanation/2025/2nd/explanation_2025_2nd_02.pdf">Q&amp;A for its latest earnings report</a>.</p>
<p>"At present, we do not anticipate similar risks. We are developing the game to provide a smooth gaming experience across a wide range of PC specifications."</p>
<p>Resident Evil Requiem, the ninth mainline game in the series, launches next year on 27th February. Not only will it be released on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S, it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-7-re-engine-resi-switch-2">coming to Switch 2 too</a> along with Resident Evil Biohazard and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-village">Resident Evil Village</a> on the same day.</p>
<p>As such, Capcom has an extra platform on its hands to optimise.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-requiem-producer-explains-why-capcom-scrapped-multiplayer-horror-we-cant-just-slap-on-new-skins-and-characters">Resident Evil Requiem actually started life as an online multiplayer open-world game</a>, it was recently reported, and it retains "some" elements of that concept.</p>
<p>"Looking at the game when it was multiplayer, the horror part was very mild," said producer Masato Kumazawa. "However, in that build, we made a game that was fun to play. But we looked deeply into this game and wondered if a fan of the franchise would really like this, so we thought they [...] probably wouldn't enjoy it as much."</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sony-dumps-the-1000xm5-at-40-off-now-2-5x-cheaper-than-apples-rival-headphones-2000644742</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-dumps-the-1000xm5-at-40-off-now-2-5x-cheaper-than-apple%E2%80%99s-rival-headphones.1355491/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Premium noise-canceling headphones tend to be a choice between Sony’s 1000XM5 and Apple’s AirPods Max and the price difference is just ridiculous. Apple wants $549 for their headphones, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5629/">while Sony’s flagship just dropped to $248 on Amazon, down from $399 in a Black Friday deal</a> that hits nearly all color options. Some colors are selling out fast as people realize they can get comparable performance for 2.5 times less money. If you’re willing to step outside the Apple bubble and give up the brand premium, you’re getting essentially the same listening experience for half the cost.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5629/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why Sony’s Noise Cancellation Beats All Competitors</h2>
<p>The<strong> noise cancellation is powered by a pair of processors and eight microphones</strong> and it is as good as it gets: yes, even better than Apple’s implementation. It works in real-time and adjusts to your surroundings to block out the din of airplane engines, coffee shop chit-chat, and street noise with scary effectiveness. An Auto NC Optimizer adjusts for atmospheric pressure, so the noise cancellation doesn’t change whether you’re at sea level or cruising at 35,000 feet. You can genuinely work or relax in near-silence even in the noisiest environments.</p>
<p>The <strong>battery life hits 30 hours on a single charge</strong> to cover multiple cross-country flights or weeks of daily commutes without hunting for an outlet. With quick charging, you’ll get three hours of playback from just three minutes plugged in, so forgetting to charge overnight doesn’t ruin your day. A USB-C cable comes included, and the headphones work while charging if you absolutely need them immediately.</p>



<p>Hands-free calling uses four beamforming microphones in concert with <strong>advanced audio signal processing to isolate your voice from ambient noise</strong>. These microphones focus on your voice while filtering out wind, traffic, and the general hum of people chatting in the background that usually ruins phone calls. Video conferences sound professional, even when you’re calling in from a busy street or noisy office.</p>



<p>Touch controls on the ear cups let you pause, play, skip tracks, adjust volume and answer calls without having to pull out your phone. After one day of usage, gestures become second nature, and responsiveness is immediate without lag or missed inputs. You can swipe up and down for volume, tap to pause, or hold to activate your voice assistant. It’s large enough to register gestures but not so sensitive that an accidental touch constantly stops playback.</p>
<p><strong>Comfort comes from the lightweight design and soft-fit leather that distributes pressure equally</strong> across your head. The headband has just enough padding to prevent hotspots during long listening sessions without adding bulk. The ear cups create a seal that enables noise cancellation while staying breathable enough to wear for hours without sweating. These headphones disappear on your head in a way that heavier models never do.</p>
<p>Sound quality provides the well-balanced and detailed profile Sony is known for without the bass-heavy tuning some brands use to impress in quick demos. Mids and highs remain clear and separated, which means vocals and instruments don’t muddy together during complex tracks. The soundstage feels wide and natural rather than artificially processed. Audiophiles will appreciate the fidelity and casual listeners will enjoy how everything just sounds right without needing EQ adjustments.</p>
<p>At $248 for headphones that go head-to-head with $549 AirPods Max, you save $301 and get equal noise cancellation, better battery life, and similar audio quality.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony has issued takedown notices for videos showcasing a fan-led project that's bringing doomed PlayStation live-service game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/concord"><u>Concord</u></a> back to life. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">PlayStation's quickly-binned hero shooter Concord was one of the biggest flops in the compay's history. Amid disastrously low player numbers, Sony pulled the game offline just two weeks after launch, with one estimate suggesting it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-is-estimated-to-have-sold-only-25000-units-heres-why-analysts-think-its-failing"><u>sold just 25,000 copies</u></a>. It proved a costly failure for Sony, with hundreds of millions of dollars wasted. Its developer, Firewalk Studios, closed shortly thereafter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite its brief life, or perhaps because of it, Concord remains of interest — with a dedicated group of players dedicating "months" of work to getting the game back online again, reverse-engineering the code and using private servers to host online matches of Clash Point. And now, it seems, Sony has taken notice.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"After a long time of reverse engineering [and] server development, we just managed to play a match of Concord!" the team announced on Discord (thanks, <a href="https://thegamepost.com/sony-cracks-down-concord-custom-servers-dmca-takedowns/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>The Game Post</u></a>). "The project is still WIP, it's playable, but buggy. Once our servers are fully set up, we'll begin doing some private playtesting, if anyone here wants to join those playtests, let me know (include what region/time zone you are in for convenience)." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the volunteer developers admitted the build could be "buggy," the team managed to get the main menu, character select screen, and matchmaking working again, with one team member <a href="https://discord.gg/q9Q2N52agh" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>saying</u></a>, "the project is still a [work in progress but] it's playable."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Around this time, volunteers began sharing videos and images of their project in action and posted them to YouTube. But news of the project gained traction, it also appears to have caught the eye of Sony, which has seemingly begun striking down the videos with copyright notices.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans behind the rebuilt game appear keen to make clear their attempt only provides server access to players who had legitimately bought the game, rather than anyone using or sharing "copyrighted files." In a message on the fan project's Discord: "I know this sucks for people who got forcefully refunded, but lawyers are most likely already watching everything we do and I want to ensure this project stays as legal as we realistically can do. We will be removing any posts containing links to copyrighted files."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite this, however, the group leaders have now paused invitations, stating they had received "worrying legal action."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Concord Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In February 2022, Jim Ryan, then-PlayStation's boss, announced that the company would launch more than 10 new live-service games by<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-playstation-to-launch-more-than-10-live-service-games-by-2026"><u> March 2026</u></a>, and spent big on studio buyouts as part of the drive, bringing in Destiny developer Bungie, Jade Raymond's Haven Studios (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-live-service-woes-continue-as-playstation-executive-jade-raymond-exits-fairgames-developer-after-external-test-sparked-concern"><u>Raymond has since left the company</u></a>), and the now-shuttered Firewalk Studios. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since then, however, Sony has cancelled a slew of projects, including a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-cancels-two-unannounced-live-service-games"><u>live-service God of War title in development at Bluepoint</u></a>, and another live-service title being made by Days Gone developer Bend.

            <p>It has been reported that PlayStation's Horizon series, which began in 2017 with Zero Dawn, has now passed 40m sales.</p>
<p>These latest figures come from a Korean news article, which was translated on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/horizon-franchise-has-reached-40-million-units-sold-according-to-a-korean-news-article.1354003/">ResetEra</a>. If accurate, that means the Horizon series has sold roughly 2m copies in the last few months. In July of this year as part of a filed legal complaint against <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a>, where <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-sues-tencent-over-slavish-horizon-knock-off-light-of-motiram">Sony accused the Chinese technology conglomerate of ripping off its Horizon video game franchise with its upcoming release Light of Motiram</a>, the PlayStation maker said the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/guerrillas-horizon-franchise-has-sold-over-38m-copies-worldwide">Horizon franchise had sold in excess of 38m units</a>.</p>

<p>As for the most recent Horizon figures, they were shared as part of a report on the upcoming MMO spin-off from NCSoft, known as Steel Frontiers. "It is an MMORPG currently in development, based on the 'Horizon' series of open-world action adventure games with cumulative global sales reaching 40m units, designed to be playable on mobile devices," the translation reads.</p>
<p>"This new title was described by Co-CEO Park Byung-moo during the Q3 earnings conference call as one that 'earned a standing ovation'. It garnered significant attention as the main highlight of NCSoft's opening speech on the 13th."</p>
<p>To compare Horizon's latest alleged sales numbers with another of Sony's properties, in 2022 PlayStation announced that <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/22q2_sonyspeech.pdf">Santa Monica's God of War reboot had surpassed 23m units sold</a>. That same year, the company announced that its sequel <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-ragnarok-sells-51m-copies-in-first-week">God of War Ragnarök had sold 5.1m copies in its first week</a>, making it officially the fastest-selling first-party PlayStation title to date. By November 2023, PlayStation revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarök</a> had sold through more than 15m units worldwide across both PlayStation 4 and PS5.</p>
<p>Meanwhile earlier this month, Sony's shared its latest financial results, where it indicated that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-yotei-sells-over-33m-units-in-one-month-which-makes-it-about-twice-as-popular-as-astro-bot">Ghost of Yōtei had sold-through 3.3m units</a> as of November 2, 2025. That's roughly within one month of its release. </p>
<p>Eurogamer has asked Sony for comment on Horizon's sales figures.</p>

<p>Looking at what's next for the series, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/guerrilla-affirms-its-working-on-new-games-in-the-horizon-franchise-as-ncsoft-mmo-skips-ps5">Horizon Steel Frontiers is described as a "fierce survival adventure"</a>, in which players take on the role of machine hunters in a region known as Deathlands. The team promises "large-scale raids" and an "advanced combat system" on the game's eventual release.</p>
<p>While it is currently slated for release on mobile and PC, last week executive producer Lee Song shed a bit more light on why NCSoft's game isn't coming to PlayStation, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-steel-frontier-developer-wants-playstation-release-but-its-not-something-we-can-decide-on-our-own">suggesting excluding the platform was not NCSoft's decision</a>.</p>
<p>For more on Horizon, earlier this year Aloy actress Ashly Burch spoke to Eurogamer about her thoughts on AI, and why <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-zero-dawn-developer-replacing-all-actors-with-robots-not-going-to-happen-says-aloy-voice-actress">she believes developer Guerrilla replacing all actors with robots is "not going to happen"</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> has blown past its concurrent player count on Steam yet again, hitting close to half a million PC players online at the same time over the weekend.</p>
<p><a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1808500/charts/">According to SteamDB</a>, the popular extraction shooter hit its peak of 481,996 yesterday, topping the previous peak by roughly 30,000 players. The game is also out on consoles whose player figures remain largely a mystery, so even this figure is only a piece of the wider picture.</p>
<p>Why has Arc Raiders <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-breaks-another-concurrent-record-as-player-count-soars">broken its concurrent player record yet again</a>? Well, there may be two major reasons. For one, word of mouth. The game continues to garner praise from a vast <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-are-arc-raiders-players-so-averse-to-pvp-to-find-out-we-spoke-to-a-sociologist">variety of friendly fans</a>, including many influencers. It seems as though the game has found a gap in the market where it can thrive, even at a time where bigger franchises like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> are still wobbling around.</p>

</figure>
<p>The second reason can likely be attributed to recent major content drops. Arc Raiders recently held a massive community event <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-update-opens-up-the-north-line-towards-new-stella-montis-map-in-massive-community-event">to open up its latest map</a>: Stella Montis. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-players-finish-community-event-and-unlock-a-new-map-in-just-one-day">The playerbase managed to smash this resource-gathering challenge in only one day</a>, despite the developers at Embark <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-first-major-community-unlock-event-has-been-made-harder-mere-hours-after-launch-as-players-were-completing-it-too-fast">making it harder to finish</a>. As such, there's a lot to do right now for fresh and experienced players alike.</p><p>Can Arc Raiders hit the 500,000 mark? Probably! <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-has-an-impressive-2025-roadmap-and-its-bringing-a-new-map-new-events-and-other-game-changers">There are still a handful of events yet to happen this year</a> including a new weather effect on maps which should maintain interest for the short term at least. On top of that, we're near the holiday season. If Arc Raiders can keep players engaged for a few more weeks it'll enter a period where a bunch of people are off work and school and can spend their free time throwing purple gear at me during night raids. Nice!</p>
<p>If you're curious to read about what the big deal is with Arc Raiders, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-review">you can read Eurogamer's review</a>. It dives into all the merits of the extraction shooter, as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nexon-ceo-believes-its-important-to-assume-that-every-game-company-is-now-using-ai-following-arc-raiders-launch">the use of generative AI</a> voice acting which sadly stands opposed to an otherwise enjoyable game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p><a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/anno-117-pax-romana">Anno 117: Pax Romana</a> sees <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/ubisoft">Ubisoft</a>‘s long-running real-time strategy series enter a bold new era, winding back the clock by almost two thousand years when compared the most recent entry, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/anno-1800">Anno 1800</a>. This leap back in time offers a whole new setting and aesthetic for the franchise compared to other instalments that have taken place during the late Medieval, Renaissance, and the Industrial Age, as well as those Anno games set in the near and distant future.</p>
<p><iframe title="Anno 117: Pax Romana - Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4oVSysv9uH8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>At its core, Anno 117: Pax Romana offers the same rich, layered web of strategy game mechanics that have been continually tweaked and refined over the years. While dense in certain aspects, the game is far more approachable in comparison to grand strategy epics such as <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/crusader-kings-iii">Crusader Kings III</a>&nbsp;or <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/Europa-Universalis-V">Europa Universalis V</a>. This is mainly thanks to its scale, tasking players with managing cities rather than globe-spanning empires.</p>


<p>For the first time in the series’ history, Anno offers a story-driven campaign where you choose one of two main characters, playing through a series of quests that serves as an extended tutorial. Set during the Pax Romana – a time of peace of prosperity following bloody campaigns and civil war – you slip into the role of either Macus or Marcia, son and daughter to a governor in Rome’s Egyptian provinces.</p>
<p>Inexperienced but not entirely naïve, they are tasked with rebuilding the lost city of Ambrosia to its former glory (now named Juliana after the wife of the Emperor). It’s a pretty ideal scenario, giving you a fertile patch to plant the seeds of your own soon-to-be bustling metropolis.</p>


<p>While the game’s story features twists, turns, and a growing cast of characters, it never intrudes, allowing players to go at their own pace without piling on urgent tasks or dragging them away from their city-building. There is one exception to this, however, and it’s not too long before you’ll be whisked away from the sunny Latium to the uncharted, and somewhat ominous, wilds of Albion.</p>
<p>It’s here, within a cluster of islands resembling Celtic Britain, that you’ll gain more freedom, learning Anno 117’s advanced systems such as diplomacy, warfare, and establishing trade routes. Again, story elements are there to compliment your learning experience: well-crafted and immersive without hindering gameplay.</p>
<p>Speaking of gameplay, Pax Romana is relatively easy to dive into even if you’re completely new to the genre. The Anno games are best known as city-building sims that have a strong emphasis on trade and economy rather than warfare and real-time battles (though these do play a part in the overall experience). One key element that makes Anno 117 more accessible than menu-loving grand strategy games is being able to see your city fully realised in 3D with workers and citizens all milling around. Instead of viewing a number or a UI icon to denote the grandeur and prestige of a city, you can see it with your own eyes.</p>
<p>Creating a thriving metropolis will take time, however, and plenty of careful planning. With that said, there’s no right or wrong way to play Anno 117. Sure, for competitive players there will always be an optimal path that takes them from a single modest trading port to a sprawling cityscape in the shortest amount of time, but the same amount of satisfaction can be derived from crafting gorgeous cities that can be customised using a suite of clever tools.</p>

<p>For the most part, you’ll be constructing various buildings that each perform their own function. Housing, for instance, adds citizens to your workforce who can also be regularly taxed to bring in a steady income. These workers will man the various production stations you build within your territory, from vineyard farmers to iron miners, transporting these raw materials to other stations where they’ll be processed into goods such as wine and weapons. By producing and trading a growing portfolio of these goods you’ll satisfy the needs of your populace, allowing you to upgrade them to artisans and nobles and thereby unlocking even more building types to construct.</p>
<p>While there is certainly an emphasis on building – and optimising the placement of stations, ports, and warehouses to meet local demands – you’ll also need to juggle affairs from beyond your own borders. While some factions will happily engage in trade, exchange gifts, and form alliances, others are more hostile in their approach. A good governor will know how to balance the economic output of their city with its defences, not just against invading enemies but from fires and disease, too.</p>

<p>Keeping on top of everything requires quick and effective navigation of Anno 117’s various menus which are concise and well-presented. Nothing is hidden away or buried though console players will hit the occasional snag due to the inherent clumsiness of gamepad controls when sifting through multi-layered menus, search bars, and icons to find what they need.</p>
<p>Several hours into the game – once the main events of the campaign have been resolved – players can stay within this sandbox or jump into Anno’s Endless Mode which can be enjoyed either in solo or co-op with the option for 16-player competitive games that divide rival governors into teams of four. This multiplayer offering, combined with a roadmap of upcoming content, and the game’s inherent replayability are all conspiring to eat away the free time of any strategy fan with a taste of Ancient Rome.</p>

			<p>Leon S. Kennedy is rumored to be the second protagonist of the upcoming Resident Evil Requiem, but until CAPCOM confirms his presence in the next entry in the series, anything seen or heard online should not be believed, according to the game's producer.</p>



<p>In a new interview with<a href="https://stevivor.com/features/interviews/resident-evil-requiem-interview-leon-is-fake-news-no-demo-and-how-outbreak-fits-in/"> Stevivor</a>, Producer Masato Kumazawa addressed the rumors that have been circulating online for a few months, highlighting how <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-first-trailer-hides-leon-campaign-clues-insider-claims/">any supposed evidence is the result of detective work from players</a> and should not be taken at face value.</p>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"Considering that now is the time when AI [can be used to make] videos and photos, we don’t know what’s right or what’s wrong. It’s just that players are free to believe what they would like to believe; what I’d like to tell is that, please, unless it’s officially released from Capcom, we can’t give you any confirmation,"</em> Kumazawa-san added. Likewise, the image going around showing Leon with an eye patch, and mentions of an extra DLC costume for the character are all fake, the producer concluded. However, Kumazawa-san didn't not deny the character isn't in, so there's still hope he is as rumored and speculated.</p>



<p>The Resident Evil Requiem producer also commented on the ability to switch between first- and third-person views, as well as the reasoning behind it.</p>



<p>Reportedly, the developer received lots of feedback from players after the release of the third-person view mode for Resident Evil Village, so much so that Kumazawa-san decided to let players choose which one they prefer between first and third-person view. In addition, the implementation of the third-person view allowed the team to&nbsp;<em>"sort of ease the horror"</em>, as many players thought that<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-7-survival-horror-king/">&nbsp;Resident Evil VII Biohazard</a>&nbsp;was a little too scary with the first-person view only.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, it seems ike fans of the series will have to wait until February 2026 to get their first taste of Resident Evil Requiem. </p>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"So, in terms of a demo play, we actually have no plan for one at the stage. None at all. We just want to focus on finishing off the game,"</em> Kumazawa-san said in regards to a playable demo. With the game launching in a little over three months, chances are slim that plans may change, but with <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-village-final-demo-availability-extended/">every recent entry in the series</a> getting <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-4-chainsaw-demo-new-video-provides-an-out-of-bounds-look-at-the-village/">a demo before launch</a>, there's still the chance for one to launch for Resident Evil Requiem as well.</p>



<p>While I would definitely love to see Leon in Resident Evil Requiem, the idea of having the vulnarable Grace as the only protagonist would be very intriguing, to say the least. When I tried the game a few months ago during Gamescom, I really appreciated what CAPCOM has done with the character, <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-gamescom-hands-on-preview-turn-on-the-lights/">and the feeling of helplessness that permeated the demo</a>. If this were also to permeate the combat mechanics, I think it would make for a really different experience.</p>

            <p>Ubisoft's UK publishing arm have filed a strategic report for the year ending March 2025 in which they warn that they expect yearly revenue to fall in the current fiscal year, ending March 2026. They attribute this partly to slumping sales of physical copies of games, and more broadly to the fact that people are fixating on a fistful of mega-popular games at the expense of all others, with subscription and streaming services like Microsoft's Game Pass making us all feel less inclined to buy individual new games. Plus ça change.
</p><!--more-->
<p>"The traditional 'full game' model of selling a single £50-60 game to a consumer as a one-time purchase continues to become less ubiquitous, with Multi Game subscription services, long running Games As A Service titles, Free To Play games and Cloud Streaming offers all providing new and attractive ways for consumers to access gaming content," reads <a href="https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/02409000/filing-history">the report</a>, which was filed on 13th November last week and passed along by <a href="https://www.cityam.com/ubisoft-issues-sales-warning-as-gamers-habits-change/">City AM</a>. 
</p>
<p>"Consumers are playing fewer games, playing them for longer, and as a result, outside of a few notable exceptions, many new games are struggling to stand out and achieve the sales they may once have had, whilst the market is more volatile and the potential for any specific title less predictable as a result," it continues.
</p>
<p>"As a result of a smaller physical new releases schedules in the coming year, Ubisoft Limited expects revenue to fall in FY26."
</p>
<p>All this comes in the context of dramatic wider corporate musical chairs across Ubisoft's international dominions. The company recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-hand-ubisoft-a-big-wad-of-cash-to-spin-out-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-as-a-separate-business">struck a deal with Tencent to carve out a new subsidiary</a>, Vantage Studios, dedicated to the best-selling Assassin's Creed, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry">Far Cry</a>, and Rainbow Six series.</p><p>The remainder of the company's development studios are being reorganised into "creative houses", with a familiar and worrying emphasis on being "agile" and "focussed". Ubisoft recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-want-to-trim-down-the-division-developers-and-are-pivoting-trials-creators-redlynx-to-mobile">announced layoff plans</a> at The Division developers Massive and Trials developers Redlynx, both of whom fall outside the new Tencent-backed subsidiary.
</p>
<p>More Ubihappenings may be in the offing. A few days ago, the company <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/uh-oh-ubisoft-postpones-its-quarterly-financial-report-at-the-last-minute-and-halts-stock-trading/">postponed the release of their latest half-year earnings report</a> while requesting that European exchange Euronext halt trading of Ubisoft shares and bonds until the report's publication. According to rumour, the company's founding Guillemot family are having a staring match with Tencent about whether they can retain their dominance. Yves Guillemot recently appointed his son Charlie Guillemot as co-chief of Vantage, which feels a bit, you know, Succession-y.</p>
<p>Investors appear cool on the new direction: as <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/ubisoft-delays-half-year-results-requests-trading-suspension-2025-11-13/">reported by Reuters</a>, Ubisoft's Paris-listed share price was down 49% year-to-date as of 13th November. Me am just humble dormouse guzzling crumbs under the banquet table, with no real understanding of the arcane financial phrases uttered by the courtiers above, but these seem like worrying numbers.
</p>
<p>To return to the broader topic here, games industry bigwigs and assorted wonks have long warned that subscription models and a handful of enduringly popular games are sucking up all the oxygen. Back in 2024, Inflexion's Aaryn Flynn <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/todays-new-games-struggle-because-evergreen-hits-like-fortnite-pull-players-towards-them-at-all-times-says-former-bioware-gm">spoke to us at length</a> about how "evergreen" games like Fortnite trample new releases that are still finding their legs. "There's this incredibly thick line now of [yearly revenue], which is games that are five, even 10 years old, like GTA Online, and those games have done so good, and are so exceptional because of the just enormous amount of investment that's been put into them, that they are evergreen," he said. 
</p>
<p>More recently, market research company Circana <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/more-than-60-of-us-game-players-only-buy-two-games-or-fewer-per-year-survey-finds/">shared a survey</a> indicating that the majority of videogame players in the USA only buy one or two games a year.
</p>
<p>Again, me am just brainless sheep pundit nuzzling at King Guillemot's electric fences, but whenever I read reports about the industry being eaten alive by the Steam top 10 most-played, I find it helpful to browse, say, one of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-are-we-all-playing-this-weekend-358">our weekend What Are We All Playing articles</a>. I can only marvel at the range of things people say they're playing in those comments threads.</p><p>That's a small and purely anecdotal research sample, of course, but then, I imagine Ubisoft UK's research criteria from the above report are quite selective as well: they need to release games that make many millions of pounds. The fortunes of games from much smaller teams and companies do not, I imagine, enter into their calculus.</p>
