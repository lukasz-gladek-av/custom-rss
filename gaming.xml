			<p>Xbox Live went down today following an outage reported at PlayStation, with a huge outage that started on Monday night. The PSN services were only reported back to being online yesterday, although it's claimed that the outage ended after several hours. While the official PSN Service Status page said all services were up and running on Tuesday morning, it quickly slipped back into the red at 8.25 AM ET / 5.25 AM PT / 1.25 PM BST. Overall, it's said that the outage lasted for roughly eight hours and impacted every PlayStation system, including PS Vita and PlayStation 3, all the way up to PS5. Today, Xbox Live has reported an outage. As of 2.33 PM BST / 9.33 ET / 6.33 PT, it was reported on their <a href="https://x.com/XboxSupport/status/1841471647531803028" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official X page that the outage</a> was resolved. However, as seen by the image below, there are still significant outages in sections of Xbox, with there being no guarantee that players will be able to access their games during the outage.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>PlayStation and Xbox weren't the only companies to experience recent outages. Yesterday, Steam was also down for a while in parts of the world.&nbsp; Although, it seems that the Steam outages were very brief, and only required those using the app to restart it.</p>
<p>With the PlayStation outage, it seems it took them quite a while to resolve the issue, as those trying to use their console weren't even able to play single-player games that needed to sign-in online, as well as multiplayer games being off of the table. Offline games were reportedly safe to play and caused no issues.</p>
<p>Compared to Xbox, Sony didn't acknowledge the outage on social media accounts, and the only post that was made was a statement on a<a href="https://x.com/AskPS_JP/status/1840930118379970616" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Japanese PlayStation support page</a> telling users and game developers to notify players that the servers were offline. Additionally, Sony hasn't announced what caused the outage, so it is up in the air as too what was the reason for the outage happening in the first place.</p>
<p>Although Xbox is still suffering outages in some of the places on their overall network, they have handled the situation much faster than <a href="https://wccftech.com/uk-class-lawsuit-against-sony-set-to-go-to-trial-in-march-2026/">Sony</a>, as well as able to inform the consumers about what is going on retroactively, compared to Sony, who decided to stay completely silent on the issue, despite people not having access to any online features for over eight hours.</p>

It is him who created the story of Yanus—a private investigator with a troubled past, now trying to solve an unexpected case revolving around a stolen data carrier, all this while fighting his own inner demons, the urban gangs and a nigh-omnipotent corporation responsible for the downfall of the city he used to call his own.</p><p>The game offers solid combat and movement systems, as well as a modular weapon upgrade system, thanks to which the players striding through the dark corners of the city may make every encounter feel and look different. <a title="Genres > Action [2,220 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">Action</a>-packed levels with <a title="Genres > Stealth [70 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/stealth">stealth</a> elements, hacking, and environmental puzzle solving are intertwined with more slow-paced sequences of city exploration, side quests, and storytelling.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>A unique, inherently Slavic take on the cyberpunk world is sure to leave none indifferent thanks to its sharp, caustic sense of humor and a slightly pessimistic outlook at the neon-grey shades of the surrounding reality, at the same time providing a much needed breath of fresh air to the genre itself.</p><p>As a team, the question we asked ourselves was: what was the world going to look like in a couple of decades? How would a hypothetical Central and Eastern European city and its inhabitants differ from, say, <em>Blade Runner</em>‘s Los Angeles or <em>Akira</em>‘s Neo Tokyo?</p><p>The attempts to answer this puzzle has had a tremendous deal of influence upon the game’s artistic choices, including a mix of futuristic-esque and overly outdated technologies, the grim, brutalist architecture typical of the post-communist countries, the character’s not-so-obvious moral choices and the often crudely makeshift, yank-and-tuck character and atmosphere of an environment overpacked with people forced to cope with the uneven distribution of goods and wealth, often relying on their wits and sheer luck to make it to the next paycheck without losing their minds.</p><p>The <em>SlavicPunk: Oldtimer</em> story goes to show that there is more than meets the eye to this dystopian version of the future is, and it is only up to the players to discover what lies beneath the neon glow and the concrete streets – helping Yanus unravel his last case and find out just how brutal and ugly the truth may actually be.</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

As Ikarus sets off on this <a title="Genres > Adventure [1,796 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> to ascend the tower, he is accompanied by Phi, a mysterious wandering µbot created through Megaryon’s autonomous operations.

            <p>The Alters - the upcoming release from the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/this-war-of-mine">This War of Mine</a> team 11 bit Studios, described as an "emotional" sci-fi game featuring plenty of cloning action - has been delayed.</p>
<p>In a post on social media, which has been laid out like a letter to the game's main character Jan Dolski, the studio said this delay will allow time to "optimise all mission-critical systems", while ensuring "every aspect of your journey is as seamless as possible" on the game's release.</p>
<p>This note added that reception to the game so far had been positive, but "good" is "never enough" for Ally Corp, the company coordinating Jan's rescue from the hostile planet he is trying to escape from within the narrative of The Alters.</p>

<p>"This additional time will allow us to polish each phase of the project, delivering results that surpass our prior projections - an outcome that benefits both Ally Corp and, naturally, yourself," the delay announcement reads.</p>
<p>"Thank you for your patience and ongoing commitment to Ally Corp's mission."</p>
<p>The Alters is currently slated to release on an unspecified date during the first quarter of 2025, having previously been pegged to debut this year.</p>

<p>"It's a glimpse of a game that intrigues me but also leaves me slightly confused," our Bertie wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-war-of-mine-devs-clone-survival-game-the-alters-is-a-curious-blend">Eurogamer's The Alters preview from 2023</a>.</p>
<p>"This War of Mine had a much clearer idea - living as a civilian through war - whereas The Alters seems more speculative and fragmented. Is it a mining game? Is it a survival game? Is it a game about clones? I think it's trying to be all three, but I'm not yet convinced it's managed. But like I say, I've only seen a glimpse, and if it turns out to be anything like This War of Mine, I'll be happy."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Your first new car is the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution VIII MR GSR '04, which...well, to be honest, that's a mighty fine bunch of numbers and letters, but I'm not enough of a car enthusiast to know what they mean. I'm sure it's fast, though!</p>
<p>You're also getting the Nissan GT-R Premium Edition T-spec '24, a speedy-looking sports car with a pretty beautiful dashboard, as well as the Toyota Hiace Van DX '16, which won't be winning any races but which looks like a sturdy and reliable enough little vehicle.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to new World Circuit events, including the Sunday Cup, which takes place on the Tokyo Expressway, as well as the Circuit de Sainte-Croix's Nissan GT-R Cup and the Kyoto Driving Park's Evolution Meeting.</p>
<p>More tracks have also been made compatible with&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7</em>'s Sophy AI, so you've got more places to test your skills against this advanced driving intelligence. Just don't be ashamed if you lose; that's what it's built for, after all.</p>

<p>This update is the latest in a long string of content drops for&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7</em>, which have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-7-update-physics-new-cars">brought plenty</a> of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-7-update-144">new cars</a> to the game since it launched back in March 2022, as well as new tracks and more.</p>
<p>Hopefully, some of these updates have been able to take the sting out of Sony <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-sport-delisted">delisting&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo Sport&nbsp;</em>without warning</a> back in January, which probably left a fair few racing fans in the lurch.</p>
<p><em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/gran-turismo-7/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation consoles</a>. Update 1.52 is due to arrive tomorrow, so make sure you're ready for it when it's up for download!</p>

<p>Nintendo has taken down another popular Nintendo Switch emulator as its war on emulation continues on all fronts. According to the social media accounts for the platform, the Ryujinx emulator has been shut down after the developer was “offered an agreement” by Nintendo.</p>



<p>“Yesterday, gdkchan was contacted by Nintendo and offered an agreement to stop working on the project, remove the organization and all related assets he’s in control of,” developer riperiperi said in the <a href="https://x.com/RyujinxEmu/status/1841188744126480428" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">software’s Discord server</a>. “While awaiting confirmation on whether he would take this agreement, the organization has been removed, so I think it’s safe to say what the outcome is. Rather than leave you with only panic and speculation, I decided to write this short message to give some closure.”</p>







<p>As of writing, all of the emulators files have been removed from GitHub, the <a href="https://ryujinx.org/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">download page</a> on the Ryujinx website is empty,  and there are no more official updates coming to the software.</p>



<p>Ryujinx shutting down is the latest in a long line of Nintendo going after emulators and emulation in general. Earlier this year they had Switch emulator <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/yuzu-nintendo-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yuzu shut down</a>. They also have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-is-going-after-more-people-with-lawsuits/">multiple lawsuits</a> going regarding emulation and piracy.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Nintendo for comment.</p>

After so many years of production, the risk that the game will have any shortcomings is unnecessary for us.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The Alters Screenshots - Steam Next Fest 2024</h3></div></output><p>The Alters is a survival video game set for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S, with a day-one launch on Microsoft’s Game Pass subscription service. You play Jan, a space miner who must create alternate versions of himself in order to survive on an inhospitable planet.</p><p>Here's the official blurb:</p><blockquote>Inspired by the critically acclaimed title This War of Mine, The Alters thrusts players into a heart-pounding battle for survival that Jan can't conquer alone. After crash landing on a desolate planet with a scorching star, Jan must avoid the murderous conditions by taking refuge in a cutting-edge mobile base. The only issue? It’s meant to be operated by a skilled team and he’s just Jan.</blockquote><blockquote>Thankfully, fate takes a turn with the discovery of Rapidium, a mysterious substance exclusive to this perilous world. Interacting with the Quantum Computer on board the mobile base allows Jan to manipulate pivotal decisions from his past—creating alternate versions of himself known as Alters—that have the potential to change everything.</blockquote><p>The announcement of the delay comes hot on the heels of 11 bit studios’ release of city-building survival sequel Frostpunk 2, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/frostpunk-2-hits-350000-copies-sold-which-is-enough-for-the-dev-to-break-even-but-not-enough-to-prevent-a-share-price-collapse">which sold enough copies to break even but not enough to prevent a share price collapse</a>.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Human bodies are frail and quickly fall to enemy attacks or suffer enough damage. During times when both guarding and evasion are difficult, use possession to swiftly escape, and do not hesitate to discard bodies when they are no longer of use. Even Rarities have trouble defeating enemies alone, so use humans in the area aggressively.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Blood-Time_2024_10-02-24_028.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Blood-Time_2024_10-02-24_029.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Blood-Time_2024_10-02-24_030.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Blood-Time_2024_10-02-24_031.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Deflect and Evade</strong></p><p>Enemy attacks can be repelled and neutralized with “Deflect”—A guide will display in the direction just before an enemy attacks. While in a defensive stance (guard), it will activate if the camera is shifted in that direction right when the guide lights up. When Deflect is successful, it will throw the enemy off balance and allow for a counterattack, as well as restoring Blood Weapon durability. Attacks that do not display a guide cannot be deflected. Use evasion or possession to deal with them.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Blood-Time_2024_10-02-24_032.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Blood-Time_2024_10-02-24_033.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Blood-Time_2024_10-02-24_034.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Blood-Time_2024_10-02-24_035.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Blood Time</strong></p><p><a title="Companies > SUCCESS Corporation [89 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/success-corporation">Success</a>fully executing consecutive Deflects will activate Blood Time.

            <p>Nintendo has issued a copyright strike against a YouTube channel that reviews emulation handhelds.</p>
<p>The channel in question, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@RetroGameCorps">Retro Game Corps</a>, describes itself as offering "in-depth reviews and showcases" as well as "emulation setup guides". One of its more recent videos has received a copyright strike from Nintendo, marking a second strike for the channel.</p>
<p>"My Wii U video was taken down and I received another copyright strike, even though this showcase video was no different than all of the tech demos and reviews I have made on this channel previously," Retro Game Corps owner Russ wrote in a statement on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoZQiN0o7f36H7PaW4fVhFw/community?lb=UgkxqDniEBASvWOChP2-WYysGcwkCDwSMD9k">YouTube</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2024/10/nintendo-is-now-going-after-youtube-accounts-which-show-its-games-being-emulated">TimeExtension</a>).</p>
<p>Russ is now considering filing a counterclaim as he believes the video "was for educational use, transformative in nature, and had no effect on the market".</p>

<p>"It was a demonstration of a console no longer for sale (even the Wii U eShop is closed, so the company itself has no means of earning revenue from Wii U sales)," Russ said. "However, I am reluctant to open that can of worms with a multi-billion dollar corporation, as their next step would be to file legal action."</p><p>The YouTube channel said it will now need to adapt the way it approaches future videos. "I will no longer show any Nintendo games on-screen, which is a shame because I love using those games for my hardware demonstrations," Russ wrote.</p>
<p>The channel is also going to blur out "any Nintendo game content" on its previous videos as a precaution. That includes "even innocuous content like NES games".</p>
<p>"Unfortunately this is going to delay some video releases - my latest video should be up right now, but instead I have to re-edit and re-upload the video first," Russ closed. "I know this is disappointing news, but with now two strikes on my channel, I don't really have any other choice except to adjust accordingly. Thanks for your understanding."</p> <div>

			<p>Epic Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-unreal-fest-showcases-new-features-for-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> some big announcements for game developers at Unreal Fest Seattle 2024, revealing the new features of Unreal Engine 5 and reducing the royalty fee for games that launch on the Epic Games Store at the same time as other stores.</p>
<p>However, before all these announcements, Epic founder, CEO, and main stakeholder Tim Sweeney <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGEfQJPqW8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">addressed</a> the viewers with an interesting speech. First, he remarked that following <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-founder-explains-massive-layoffs-says-development-and-core-initiatives-are-unaffected/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last year's layoffs</a>, Epic is now solid from a financial standpoint and has registered record numbers for Fortnite and the store. Secondly, Sweeney discussed the growing importance of live service multiplayer in an increasingly complex gaming market where even big games may struggle.</p>
<p><em>I'm happy to tell you now that Epic&nbsp;is financially sound and that Fortnite and the Epic Game Store have hit new records in concurrency and success. Fortnite hit 110 million monthly active users last holiday, an all-time peak. And this is all happening in the context of a game business that's rapidly changing in a way that we've only seen a few times in our lifetimes as game developers. It's a generational change. One of the manifestations we're seeing right now is a lot of games are released with high budgets and they're not selling nearly as well as expected, whereas other games are growing incredibly strong.</em></p>
<p><em>What we're seeing, the real trend here is that players are gravitating towards the really big games where they can play with more of their friends. This is a manifestation of Metcalfe's Law, the idea that the value of a network, a game, or a social experience grows in proportion to the number of friends that you can connect to. In the world of gaming, that means you and your friends getting together and playing games, chatting by voice, attending concerts, and doing all other kinds of cool virtual things online.</em></p>
<p><em>This trend, some people will call it the metaverse. We're not all in agreement on what this means. Some people, when they hear the word metaverse, think of what Facebook is doing with VR and now AR. Some people use the metaverse to describe everything they don't like about the current Fortnite season. But when you look at what's happening in the world of Fortnite, it's new and it's exciting and it's something that's never happened at this scale in the history of entertainment, with an original story that's evolving with original content and also all the world's brands participating. Musicians reaching users, Disney and Star Wars, and others all coming together to create a world-class entertainment experience that's ever-evolving and live, and that's that's really what we think that the future of gaming is about.</em></p>
<p>While Sweeney has a point when he says that an increasing number of players value the live multiplayer experience, it's equally true that several big live service multiplayer games have disappointed badly. Examples include the likes of Crucible, Babylon's Fall, Anthem, Marvel's Avengers, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, and most recently, Concord. Not even IPs as powerful as Marvel's and DC's were enough to prevent these failures.&nbsp;As such, while Epic may not be interested in making another single player game for the time being, many other developers certainly are, and they are bound to find success if they create a quality experience.</p>
<p>In other Epic news, Sweeney's company has just <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-has-filed-a-new-legal-complaint-against-samsung-and-google-claiming-their-auto-blocker-feature-is-anti-competitive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sued</a> Google and Samsung because of their auto blocker feature.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/palworld-mobile-version-in-development-at-pubg-studio.998469/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-mobile-version-krafton<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>publisher Krafton has announced that it's working on a&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>mobile adaptation, and that said adaptation will be handled by one of its most prominent studios.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.krafton.com/news/press/%ed%81%ac%eb%9e%98%ed%94%84%ed%86%a4-%ed%8c%b0%ec%9b%94%eb%93%9c-%eb%aa%a8%eb%b0%94%ec%9d%bc-%ea%b2%8c%ec%9e%84-%ea%b8%80%eb%a1%9c%eb%b2%8c-%eb%9d%bc%ec%9d%b4%ec%84%a0%ec%8a%a4/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an announcement</a> on the official Krafton website (which is in Korean; we're using machine translation), Krafton's mobile version of&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>will be handled by PUBG Studios, the division responsible for developing&nbsp;<em>PUBG: Battlegrounds</em>.</p>
<p>Krafton says its&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>mobile adaptation will "faithfully reinterpret and implement the original's main fun elements to fit the mobile environment" (again, the actual wording is likely to be a touch different, since we're using machine translation).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/palworld-mobile-announcement-player-riding-pal.jpg?itok=-f6w-90o 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/palworld-mobile-announcement-player-riding-pal.jpg?itok=eMf81_b5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>is making its way to mobile.</figcaption></figure><p>There's a lot we don't yet know about&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>'s mobile version. It sounds like Krafton will be creating a brand new version of the game rather than just porting the existing version, but beyond that, we're not sure exactly what form&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>on mobile will take.</p>
<p>We also don't know when the game will launch for mobiles, nor do we know whether it'll make it out of Krafton's native Korea or not.</p>
<p>I'm assuming it will; after all,&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>is a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-finally-dethrones-baldurs-gate-3-as-most-played-game-on-steam-deck-in-february">hugely popular game</a>, so it would seem rather foolish to restrict its mobile version to one region. Still, the game technically hasn't been announced in the West yet, so we'll have to wait and see.</p>
<p>The announcement of&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>on mobile is a pretty timely one, though. Last week, the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-ps5-release">surprise-launched on PS5</a> following a State of Play presentation (although not in Japan, where a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-palworld-pocketpair-lawsuit">patent infringement lawsuit</a> is currently ongoing between&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>developer Pocketpair and Nintendo).</p>

<p><em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>is a creature-collecting survival game in which the goal is to survive in a world populated by&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-palworld-trailers-unleash-more-unspeakable-quasi-pokemon-brutality-and-cuddles"><em>Pokemon</em>-esque creatures</a> called Pals.</p>
<p>Although the designs are certainly reminiscent of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em>, the gameplay is more akin to something like&nbsp;<em>Ark: Survival Evolved</em>; you must build a base, battle hostile Pals, and decide whether you're going to enslave your Pals to help you build or to treat them as friends.</p>
<p><em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>is currently available for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623730/Palworld/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP6360-PPSA23126_00-0112788005082769" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/palworld-game-preview/9NKV34XDW014" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and we now know that a version of the game is also coming to mobile at some point.

                <p>Until late last month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date-gameplay-and-everything-we-know/1100-6523576/" data-ref-id="1100-6523576">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> was slated to be released in November of this year. Ubisoft subsequently made the surprise announcement that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-until-early-2025/1100-6526703/" data-ref-id="1100-6526703">the game has been delayed to early next year</a>. But according to a new report, this was far from a surprise to Ubisoft Quebec, the studio behind Shadows. The developers have reportedly been pushing for a delay for months.</p><p>Ubisoft's announcement stated that Shadows' new release date was implemented to give the developers more time to polish the gameplay, and because the company wanted to apply the lessons it learned from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/star-wars-outlaws-review-missing-the-mark/1900-6418273/" data-ref-id="1900-6418273">Star Wars Outlaws</a>' disappointing rollout--the game has reportedly sold <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-sales-were-worse-than-expected-ubisoft-admits-full-mobilized-to-fix-it/1100-6526702/" data-ref-id="1100-6526702">only around 1 million copies thus far</a>. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-context-around-the-assassins-creed-shadows-delay/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Inside Gaming</a>'s report states that both of those reasons are true, but adds further context by stating that, "[Assassin's Creed Shadow] is currently not at the stage it needs to be for release."</p><p>There are still adjustments to be made to fix the remaining bugs. However, the larger issues apparently revolve around the desire to shore up the historically accurate aspects of the story. One of the stated reasons for these 11th hour changes is that "historical experts were brought onto the project much later than usual for a project of this magnitude." </p><p>At least one silver lining from Ubisoft's latest moves was the decision to reverse the company's stance about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-reverses-its-steam-policy-will-launch-new-games-there-on-day-one/1100-6526711/" data-ref-id="1100-6526711">releasing new games on consoles and Steam</a> on day one. That was apparently a frequently requested change from some of Ubisoft's employees.</p><p>Assassin's Creed Shadows will hit consoles and PC on February 14, 2025.</p>

                <p>A mobile version of the popular game Palworld is in the works, with PUBG company Krafton working out a licensing deal with Pocketpair to bring the game to phones.</p><p>PUBG Studios is developing the mobile version of Palworld, though additional details were not provided in the <a href="https://www.krafton.com/news/press/%ED%81%AC%EB%9E%98%ED%94%84%ED%86%A4-%ED%8C%B0%EC%9B%94%EB%93%9C-%EB%AA%A8%EB%B0%94%EC%9D%BC-%EA%B2%8C%EC%9E%84-%EA%B8%80%EB%A1%9C%EB%B2%8C-%EB%9D%BC%EC%9D%B4%EC%84%A0%EC%8A%A4/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">press release</a>. Following Palworld's release in January 2024, scammers quickly created fake versions of Palworld for mobile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-dev-warns-of-mobile-game-scams/1100-6520728/" data-ref-id="1100-6520728">prompting Pocketpair to warn fans to remain vigilant. </a></p><p>The deal between Krafton and Pocketpair was announced not long after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-is-suing-palworld-devs/1100-6526569/" data-ref-id="1100-6526569">Nintendo sued Pocketpair over patent infringement claims.</a> Palworld had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-reaches-25-million-players-in-one-month/1100-6521294/" data-ref-id="1100-6521294">enormous success</a> when it launched on PC and Xbox earlier this year, and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-launching-on-ps5-today-despite-nintendo-lawsuit/1100-6526675/" data-ref-id="1100-6526675">PS5 edition was released at the end of September.</a></p><p>Mobile is just the latest extension of Palworld, and Pocketpair doesn't plan to stop there. The company also partnered with Sony to create <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-dev-and-sony-are-teaming-up/1100-6524828/" data-ref-id="1100-6524828">a venture called Palworld Entertainment</a> that will handle additional licensing opportunities, including merchandise.</p><p>Palworld bears similarities to Pokemon, but Nintendo's lawsuit pertains to patent infringement claims, not copyright infringement allegations. One analyst believes Nintendo will prevail in its lawsuit against Pocketpair, saying he believes that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-vs-palworld-why-nintendo-will-probably-win-according-to-analyst/1100-6526608/" data-ref-id="1100-6526608">because Nintendo can't stop Palworld on the basis of copyright</a>, it intends to "screw them with other things," like technical patents.</p><p>If you're just getting started with the game, be sure to read <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/palworld/guides/">GameSpot's Palworld guides to hit the ground running.</a></p>

			<p>The next Starfield DLC expansion will provide a continuation of the Constellation and Artifact storyline, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://x.com/Odah_SFA/status/1838732164310999264">@Odah_SFA</a>, the next expansion, which should be named <a href="https://wccftech.com/starborn-trademark-could-hint-at-starfields-next-expansion/">"Starborn</a><span><a href="https://wccftech.com/starborn-trademark-could-hint-at-starfields-next-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">,"</a> will be about the disappearance of Constellation's founder, Sebastian Banks, providing a continuation of the organization and the Artifact storyline,</span>&nbsp;which makes up much of the base game's story.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">OK. So, I've heard some gossip that <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Starfield?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Starfield</a> 's next Expansion titled "Starborn" will be about the disappearance of Sebastian Banks, Founder of Constellation and the continuation of the Artefact story. Will post more info once I know more <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Starborn?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Starborn</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bethesda?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bethesda</a></p>
<p>— Odahfield (@Odah_SFA) <a href="https://twitter.com/Odah_SFA/status/1838732164310999264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 25, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>As the first Starfield story expansion, Shattered Space, has only just released, it is unlikely we will hear anything about Starborn anytime soon, so it may a while until we learn if the expansion will indeed be more tightly related to the base game's main campaign. Considering how the first expansion is more of a side story, however, it would make sense for Bethesda to go in this direction and explore more of Constellation's origins.</p>
<p>Starfield is now available on PC, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. You can learn more about the game by checking out my<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-the-elder-space-scrolls/"> review.</a></p>
<p><em>With an engaging story, well-developed characters and lore, and a huge amount of meaningful content, Starfield is one of Bethesda's finest games and one of the best role-playing games released in the past few years. The lack of seamless exploration and real innovation of the typical gameplay formula from the studio are noteworthy, but those willing to forego these issues will find a reactive and sprawling sci-fi universe to lose themselves in for hundreds, if not thousands, of hours.</em></p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/throne-and-liberty/" data-ref-id="5000-582820">Throne and Liberty</a>, the free-to-play fantasy MMORPG from Korean developer NCSOFT and published by Amazon Games, is off to a big start on Steam--though not quite as big as Amazon's two previous MMOs.</p><p dir="ltr">An early-access period in which players could pay to play five days early saw Throne and Liberty's concurrent player counts peak at around 56,000. On October 1, when the game launched for free-to-play players, those numbers rapidly climbed. Throne of Liberty reached 326,377 concurrent players on launch day and for a time was the fourth most-played game on Steam.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dS4OpIWM6U" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2dS4OpIWM6U" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">As often seems to be the case with the launch of a new MMO, server woes and login queues plagued Throne and Liberty in its opening hours, with NCSOFT rapidly spinning up new servers to meet demand. There were also a handful of other issues shortly after launch that NCSOFT said it was working to resolve, including some players being unable to create new characters or missing characters for those who played during early access.</p><p dir="ltr">Throne and Liberty's Steam launch numbers are nothing to sneeze at, but far behind the launch of Amazon's previous two MMOs, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/new-world/" data-ref-id="5000-489582">New World</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/lost-ark/" data-ref-id="5000-533053">Lost Ark</a>. New World, internally developed by Amazon, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-world-passes-900000-concurrent-players-on-steam/1100-6496765/" data-ref-id="1100-6496765">broke Steam records when it launched in 2021</a> and saw more than 913,000 concurrent players despite its $40 price tag. Lost Ark, another free-to-play Korean MMO localized and published by Amazon, fared even better during its launch in 2022, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lost-ark-passes-1-3-million-concurrents-overtakes-cyberpunk-2077-dota-2-and-cs-go-to-become-steams-2nd-biggest-game-of-all-time/1100-6500630/" data-ref-id="1100-6500630">hitting 1.3 million concurrent players</a>. It is worth noting that unlike Lost Ark or New World, Throne and Liberty is also available on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, meaning that its Steam concurrent players don't paint the full picture.</p><p dir="ltr">Amazon prior to launch detailed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/being-a-free-player-in-amazons-new-mmo-wont-be-quite-so-rough-thanks-to-new-changes/1100-6525061/" data-ref-id="1100-6525061">all the changes it would be making to Throne and Liberty compared to the Korean version</a>, with the goal of adjusting the game's business model to better fit the expectations of Western players. Those changes included lowering the price of the game's battle pass and leveling pass, as well as additional rewards and the removal of an optional subscription called the Blessing of Solisium. Amazon said it would "evaluate" how the subscription needed to change in order to "serve the needs of our players."</p><p dir="ltr">Throne and Liberty wasn't even going to be the only MMORPG Amazon published in 2024. The juggernaut also planned to publish the Western version of Bandai Namco's anime MMO <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/blue-protocol/" data-ref-id="5000-499449">Blue Protocol</a>. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-and-bandai-namco-cancel-western-release-for-mmo-as-service-ends-in-japan/1100-6526156/" data-ref-id="1100-6526156">Western release of Blue Protocol was canceled in August</a>, with the Japanese servers set to go offline in January.</p><p dir="ltr">Even if Amazon has a reputation for creating and publishing MMOs (it's currently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-still-trying-to-find-the-hook-for-lotr-mmo/1100-6526064/" data-ref-id="1100-6526064">working on a Lord of the Rings MMO</a> and is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-world-aeternum-revamps-the-mmo-for-consoles-with-solo-play-and-more-changes/1100-6524219/" data-ref-id="1100-6524219">reworking New World for consoles</a>), the company is looking to branch out into other genres. It was announced as part of Gamescom 2024 that Amazon would publish the co-op dungeon crawler <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/king-of-meat/" data-ref-id="5000-640430">King of Meat</a>.</p>
