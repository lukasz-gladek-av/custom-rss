              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/a-review-of-gears-of-war-reloaded-and-the-state-of-the-franchise-2000620106"><em>Gears of War: Reloaded,</em></a> the newly released remaster of the original <em>Gears of War</em>, has a low review score on Steam due to crashes and missing split-screen support. This follows a day-one patch that was supposed to fix a number of bugs and crashes on both console and PC.</p> <p>On August 26, Xbox launched <em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em>–a remastered version o<em>f Gears of War: Ultimate Edition</em>, itself a remaster of <em>Gears of War-</em>-on Xbox Series X/S, PC, and for the first time in franchise history, PlayStation, <a href="https://kotaku.com/gears-of-war-remastered-reloaded-running-ps5-xbox-weird-2000620092">a leap it made via a PS5 port.</a> And the game is totally fine if you want to replay<em> Gears of War</em> again. But on PC, players are encountering some annoying issues and are upset about the lack of split-screen. Meanwhile, the Xbox port has a weird FPS bug, and I’ve experienced some issues on PS5, too.</p> <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2523720/Gears_of_War_Reloaded/"><em>Gears of War: Reloaded’</em>s user review score on Steam sits at 49 percent</a> as of 1 p.m. EST on August 27. That’s not great! Checking out the reviews, it seems a big issue with this new remastered shooter is that it crashes a lot for some folks. What’s odd is that some players claim that<em> Gears of War: Reloaded</em> was running fine shortly after launch, but has started crashing more since then. One fix floating around online involves deleting a specific folder and not connecting to Xbox Live, which seems to imply there might be some server shenanigans happening. <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/gears-of-war/gears-of-war-reloaded-hammered-in-steam-reviews-for-missing-splitscreen-co-op-and-microsoft-accounts-seemingly-crashing-everyones-fun-including-mine/#:~:text=I%20ended%20up%20refunding%20it%20on%20Steam%2C%20renewing%20my%20Xbox%20Game%20Pass%20sub%2C%20and%20redownloading%20the%20game%20through%20the%20Xbox%20PC%20app.%20This%20version%20of%20the%20remaster%20has%20performed%20fine%20for%20me%20for%20a%20few%20hours%20now%2C%20suggesting%20there%20is%20genuinely%20something%20wrong%20with%20the%20Steam%20version."><em>Gamesradar</em> reports that<em> Gears of War: Reloaded</em></a> works fine when downloaded and installed via the Xbox PC Game Store, suggesting that the version on Steam, or at least how it connects to Xbox servers, might not be working properly.</p>

 <p>Other players report that changing the game’s graphical settings leads to frequent crashing. I’ll say that on PS5, I ran into two crashes and some weird performance problems as well. <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/08/digital-foundry-praises-gears-reloaded-on-xbox-but-points-out-glitch-with-the-120fps-mode"><em>Digital Foundry</em> also reports</a> that there’s an odd FPS bug on Xbox Series X that causes the campaign to improperly run at a not-so-stable 120FPS. I also ran into weird FPS issues on PS5 and had to turn off VRR. The PC port also lacks an FOV slider and has some weird limits on keybinding.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The team is investigating crashes on Steam when launching the game and missing pre-order character skins for some users, as well as initial reports of matchmaking issues.</p> <p>You can see all known issues by going to <a href="https://t.co/LNNEO2vf0H">https://t.co/LNNEO2vf0H</a></p> <p>Thank you for your patience.</p> <p>— Gears Community (@Community_Gears) <a href="https://twitter.com/Community_Gears/status/1960483079082139975?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><a href="https://x.com/gearsofwar/status/1960084806831608233?s=46">A day-one patch was supposed to iron a lot of this out</a>, but it doesn’t seem to have completely worked. As a result, <a href="https://x.com/Community_Gears/status/1960483079082139975">Xbox and The Coalition posted on social media</a> on Tuesday that the team is currently “investigating” the PC crashes and reports of online matchmaking errors, as well as an issue in which people who pre-ordered did not receive the cosmetics they were promised for doing so. Keep in mind, this is a remaster of a 10-year-old remaster. It’s wild to me that<em> Gears of War: Reloaded</em> seemingly shipped in such a wonky state.</p> <p>Another reason for the game’s low rating on Steam is that players thought<em> Gears of War: Reloaded</em> would support split-screen co-op on PC. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Splitscreen/comments/1kg674q/gears_of_war_reloaded_pc_split_screen_confirmed/">Split-screen was reportedly listed on the game’s official Steam store page</a>. There’s also evidence that split-screen co-op support was mentioned in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/1n0t0ud/the_pc_version_of_reloaded_is_still_under_cooked/"><em>Reloaded’s</em> Steam page trailer</a>. But it appears all mentions of split-screen support have since been removed. My guess is that this was a mistake and Xbox never intended to add split-screen to PC. Regardless, it’s just one more reason PC players are disappointed with <em>Gears of War: Reloaded.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Konami has publicly addressed a number of launch issues for Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater that have been reported by players.</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://x.com/Metalgear/status/1960740185957917022" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, Komani says that it has <strong>“received reports of several issues and are preparing a patch to address them.” </strong></p>



<p>The issues all center around game crashes and includes:</p>



<ul>
<li>Performing an additional survival knife attack after completing a series of consecutive attacks to secure food may cause the game to crash under certain conditions.</li>



<li>Removing the Crocodile Cap from the Survival Viewer while it is equipped may cause the game to crash under certain conditions.</li>



<li>Collecting food when a hungry crocodile is nearby may cause the game to crash under certain conditions.</li>



<li>Transitioning from a roll into a crawl may result in the character model floating in mid-air under certain conditions.</li>



<li>In areas where the camera switches to Intrusion View, character movement may become restricted under certain conditions.</li>



<li>Opening the Radio Window under certain conditions may cause the game to crash.</li>
</ul>



<p>Konami doesn’t have a specific timeline for a release for the update, but says that it will “take a little longer to implement the fixes” as they investigate the causes.</p>



<p><strong>“We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause,”</strong> they said.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/silent-hill-f-officially-announces-english-voice-cast.1282365/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hot off Gamescom, Silent Hill f has officially revealed the English voice cast. In it, there are plenty of RPG heavyweights, as well as some promising new actors. </p>



<p>Silent Hill f, the next entry in the acclaimed horror franchise, takes players to Japan. You play as Hinako, a high school student who’s town is now shrouded in an eerie fog. While it doesn’t take place in the town of Silent Hill like previous games, you’ll still encounter disgusting monsters and deadly situations. As the eight mainline title after 2012’s Silent Hill: Downpour, the series may be on it’s way to claim the horror crown again. Luckily, they have some great voice actors along with them on the journey.</p>



<h2 id="h-english-cast-of-silent-hill-f-features-final-fantasy-and-nintendo-voice-actors">English Cast of Silent Hill f Features Final Fantasy and Nintendo Voice Actors</h2>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="First Look | SILENT HILL f English Voice Cast Interview" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I2ebMX6kV2w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In a video from Konami, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2ebMX6kV2w">seen above</a>, it was confirmed that five voice actors will be performing in the English dub of Silent Hill f. The full list of actors can be found below:</p>



<ul>
<li>Suzie Yeung as <strong>Hinako Shimizu</strong></li>



<li>Nicholas Leung as <strong>Iwai Shu</strong></li>



<li>Frankie Kevich as <strong>Nishida Rinko</strong></li>



<li>Courtney Lin as <strong>Igarashi Sakuko</strong></li>



<li>Caleb Yen as <strong>Fox Mask</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>The most notable of the bunch is <strong>Suzie Yeung</strong>, who was confirmed last week at Gamescom Opening Night Live. So far, the actress has voiced several main characters in gaming, specifically RPGs. This includes <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/heres-the-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-voice-cast/">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> as Yuffie, Persona 3 Reload as Fuuka, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-leak-teases-deadpool-daredevil/">Marvel Rivals</a> as Invisible Woman. She will voice Silent Hill f’s protagonist, Hinako.</p>



<p>In addition to Yeung, the rest of the cast are fairly new to the VA scene, like <strong>Nicolas Leung</strong> and <strong>Frankie Kevich</strong>. <strong>Caleb Yen</strong>, who plays Fox Mask, starred as the protagonist of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/play-these-games-after-metaphor-refantazio/">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>, which earned a fair share of awards last year. <strong>Courtney Lin</strong>, interestingly enough, is now the new voice of Princess Peach for Nintendo, first playing the role in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-all-characters-in-mario-kart-world/">Mario Kart World</a>. Overall, it seems like a great lineup and one many will enjoy hearing when it launches on September 25th, 2025.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/judas-creative-director-talks-villainy-system-and-development-progress/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/judas%E2%80%99-creative-director-talks-villainy-system-and-development-progress.1282362/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Judas’ creative director Ken Levine has broken Ghost Story Games’ silence on the state of the game, offering the a new look at how the game is shaping up. Instead of waiting months between trailers and “fancy imagery”, Levine says these “lo-fi” updates will give players more frequent insights into development while the team keeps its main focus on finishing the game.</p>



<h3 id="h-judas-villainy-and-relationship-system">Judas’ Villainy And Relationship System</h3>



<p>One of <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/27/judas-ken-levine-details-how-player-actions-determine-who-becomes-the-villain" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the biggest updates</a> comes in the form of a new feature called Villainy. Unlike BioShock or BioShock Infinite, where the antagonist was fixed, Judas will let players determine who the villains are. The game’s “Big 3” characters can be drawn to the player as friends and allies, but if ignored, they may turn into enemies. </p>



<p><strong>“From there, they will get access to a new suite of powers to subvert your actions and goals,”</strong> Levine says.</p>



<p>The update also reinforced the game’s focus on character-driven storytelling. Inspired partly by Shadow of Mordor’s Nemesis System, Judas aims to take things deeper by making relationships with the Big 3 emotionally meaningful. Characters will try to earn the player’s trust through bribes, saving them in fights, gossiping about rivals, or even sharing secrets. Losing one of them is meant to feel like losing a friend.</p>



<p>In contrast to BioShock Infinite’s Elizabeth, who players came to know well but who didn’t really know the player, the Big 3 in Judas will actively observe your actions. They’ll react to how you handle combat, crafting, hacking, and especially how you treat the others.</p>



<p>As for when players can get their hands on Judas, the team isn’t ready to commit. While development is moving forward and milestones are being hit, the studio says it wants to avoid announcing a release date that could slip. </p>



<p><strong>“But we know Judas is not really a game until the players get their hands on it, and that’s a day everyone on the team is working toward,”</strong> he said.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The latest Silent Hill movie is blazing its own trail.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Christophe Gans’ <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/return-to-silent-hill"><u>Return to Silent Hill</u></a> is hitting theaters in January 2026, just in time for the 20th anniversary of the original Silent Hill movie. This is good news, given that Silent Hill still ranks as one of the better video game movie adaptations to date. 2012’s Silent Hill: Revelation? Not so much. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cineverse just released <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/return-to-silent-hill-teaser-trailer-revealed-for-third-movie-based-on-konami-game-franchise"><u>a short first teaser for Return to Silent Hill</u></a>, offering a glimpse of the many horrors Jeremy Irvine’s James Sunderland will face as he navigates the town in search of his missing wife.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Given that so much time has passed since Gans last set foot in the moody town of Silent Hill, you might be wondering how this sequel is connected to its predecessors. Is it a direct continuation of Silent Hill and Silent Hill: Revelations? Which game is it adapting? Here’s everything you need to know before Return to Silent Hill hits theaters.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">How Return to Silent Hill Connects to the Other Movies</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">2006’s Silent Hill stars Radha Mitchell as Rose Da Silva, a woman who brings her adopted daughter Sharon (Jodelle Ferland) to the remote, abandoned town of Silent Hill in order to get to the bottom of Sharon’s recurring nightmares. Sean Bean also stars as Rose’s husband Christopher, who attempts to rescue his family even as they become trapped in a hellish other dimension. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite featuring a different director and writer in M.J. Bassett, 2012’s Silent Hill: Revelation serves as a direct sequel to the first movie. Adelaide Clemens stars as the adult Sharon, now assuming the identity of Heather Mason. When her father disappears in Silent Hill, Heather and her classmate Vincent (Kit Harington) return to the town to find him. Revelation also deals heavily with the religious cult known as the Order of Valtiel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Return to Silent Hill is not a direct follow-up to either of those films. Instead, this film is telling a standalone story with a different set of characters. Return to Silent Hill stars Jeremy Irvine as James Sunderland, a widower who is stunned to receive a letter from his dead wife Mary (Hannah Emily Anderson), urging him to meet her in Silent Hill. James will descend deeper and deeper into the otherworldly dimensions of the town in order to find her. Silent Hill 2 Remake’s Evie Templeton will reprise her role as Laura, a young girl also caught in the web that is Silent Hill.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In short, it seems you don’t necessarily need to have seen the other Silent Hill movies in order to enjoy Return to Silent Hill. This sequel follows the approach of the games in that the spooky town itself, not the characters, provides most of the connective tissue. Most of the games aren’t directly intertwined by plot, but instead focus on different characters being drawn into the town and finding their personal demons manifesting into literal monsters. The series is not unlike Hellraiser in that regard, as the Hellraiser movies are mostly standalone horror stories linked together by the overarching mythology of Pinhead and the Cenobites. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The script for a new Silent Hill movie that is totally independent from the two previous movies made and respects the way Silent Hill has evolved,” <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-new-movie-2023"><u>Gans said in 2022</u></a>. “Silent Hill is a bit like Twilight Zone, the Fourth Dimension, a place where anything and everything can happen.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Silent Hill 2 (2024) Review Screens</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Which Games Does Return to Silent Hill Adapt?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If the description of Return to Silent Hill’s plot sounds familiar, it should. This film happens to be a direct adaptation of the Silent Hill 2 game, which was originally released in 2001 and remade in 2024. Just like this film, Silent Hill 2 follows James Sunderland as he navigates the various dimensions of the town in search of his late wife. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Return to Silent Hill looks to be the most faithful adaptation of the game out of the three films to date, to the point that Gans went to the trouble of casting Templeton as Laura again. We assume the film will follow the core beats of the game, pitting James against terrifying monsters like Pyramid Head and culminating in a similarly tragic twist ending. Pyramid Head himself can be seen in the teaser, making him the one character confirmed to appear in all three films.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Neither of the previous Silent Hill movies could be considered more than loose adaptations of the source material. The first Silent Hill film may borrow liberally from the imagery and music of the series, along with a few basic plot points from 1999’s Silent Hill, but its plot and cast of characters are largely unique. Silent Hill: Revelation is sort of an adaptation of the Silent Hill 3 game, transforming Rose and Christopher Da Silva into Heather and Harry Mason. But, again, the less said about Revelation, the better.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Direct adaptation or not, it doesn’t appear that Return to Silent Hill will be a 1:1 copy of Silent Hill 2. Gans has hinted the film <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240506195503/https://www.ecranlarge.com/films/dossier/1435959-le-pacte-des-loups-silent-hill-christophe-gans-pionnier-du-blockbuster-a-la-francaise" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>also draws inspiration from 2014’s P.T.</u></a>, the infamous demo that was meant to lead into Hideo Kojima’s canceled Silent Hills game. Does that mean the film will feature first-person sequences, a la 2005’s Doom? Or is the P.T. influence more in terms of the steadily mounting sense of dread and psychological horror? We’ll find out when Return to Silent Hill hits theaters in January 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more on Return to Silent Hill, find out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/return-to-silent-hills-first-cinematic-trailer-has-completely-divided-the-community"><u>why the teaser trailer has divided the Silent Hill fan community</u></a>.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jesse is a mild-mannered staff writer for IGN.

While you may be able to travel between planets within the same system, fans said it looked like you wouldn’t be able to fly <em>all the way</em> between systems. And it looks like you won’t be able to fly directly from a planet's surface into orbit, like No Man's Sky.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">References to the new offering, referred to in the game's code as "Cruise Mode," were detected by players and shared on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/1mii922/new_findings_in_the_last_2_update_suggest_dev/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>reddit</u></a>, though Bethesda reportedly issued another small patch to scrub them from view.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, in <a href="https://youtu.be/_zknfAghd-s?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a new video discussing his career</a>, veteran Bethesda developer Tim Lamb confirmed that the studio has been working on Starfield’s space gameplay, and that a new DLC story is still coming at some point.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think as it comes to Starfield, I'm really excited for players to see what the teams have been working on,” he said. “We have some cool stuff coming, including free updates and features the players have been asking for, as well as a new DLC story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I can't go into all the details just yet, but I will say part of the team has been focused on space gameplay to make the travels there more rewarding. We're also adding some new game systems, and a few other smaller delights. There's also some really interesting stuff coming down the pipe from our verified creators. There's some fun stuff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I just want to say thanks. We really appreciate the support and the enthusiasm. We can't wait to get it into the hands of our players.”</p><div id="xbox-games-series-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3><h3>Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-breaks-silence-on-starfield-future-promises-to-share-details-on-exciting-things-in-the-coming-months"><u>Bethesda said it had "exciting things" coming to Starfield soon</u></a> — presumably referring to this. However, Starfield was a no-show at gamescom 2025 last week, prompting further fan concern.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this month, it was reported that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/starfield-reportedly-set-for-ps5-release-during-spring-2026-alongside-new-expansion"><u>Starfield's second expansion and much-anticipated PlayStation 5 port would now arrive in 2026</u></a>, following the poor reception to 2024 add-on Shattered Space. Bethesda boss Todd Howard had <a href="https://youtu.be/2ew8LQFGNWU?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>previously talked of expansions arriving annually</u></a>, but perhaps Bethesda sees the addition of some form of spaceflight as something to keep players occupied until then.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Starfield launched in September 2023 as Bethesda’s first brand new IP in 25 years, but it was not as well received as the studio’s previous games in the Fallout and The Elder Scrolls franchises, and the Shattered Space expansion, released a year later in September 2024, has a ‘mostly negative’ user review rating on Steam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Starfield went on to reach 15 million players, but the question of whether Bethesda might walk away from the game to focus on its other franchises has been a running theme since release. In June 2024, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-isnt-walking-away-from-starfield-its-planning-a-second-story-expansion-for-year-2"><u>Bethesda insisted it remained committed to supporting Starfield</u></a>, and confirmed at least one other story expansion would come out following Shattered Space. And in an interview with <a href="https://youtu.be/2ew8LQFGNWU?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>YouTube channel MrMattyPlays</u></a>, Bethesda Game Studios’ Todd Howard said the developer was aiming to release an annual story expansion for “hopefully a very long time.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking more generally about the development of Starfield, Lamb described it as “like making four games at once.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You have your, I'm running around shooting aliens and space guys,” he said. “You have your, I'm flying around in a spaceship, shooting other spaceships. You have the ship builder game. You have the outpost game. Starfield to me was like making four games at once.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

                <p>Gears of War: Reloaded, a remaster of the 2006 original game, launched this week--but it didn't go over entirely smoothly.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2022/2022/12/08/bioshock-creators-ghost-story-games-reveals-first-title-judas">Judas was formally revealed during The Game Awards 2022</a> as the next game from BioShock creator Ken Levine and his studio, Ghost Story Games. Since then, the team has remained mostly silent, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/state-of-play/2024/01/31/new-look-at-judas-gameplay-reveals-more-bioshock-inspiration">save for a gameplay trailer last year,</a> on what it's been up to with this sci-fi shooter (that looks a lot like BioShock). However, Levine took to the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/27/judas-ken-levine-details-how-player-actions-determine-who-becomes-the-villain/">PlayStation Blog</a> to share new details about the game's Big 3, villainy system, and the Judas key art.&nbsp;</p><p>Taking inspiration from famed Star Wars poster illustrator Drew Struzan, the Judas key art features the protagonist up front and center, seemingly overshadowing what I think is a variant of her (presumably alluding to the way choices can affect the narrative of the game, though it could just be a totally different character), above the Big 3: Queen Nefertiti, Sheriff Tom Austin, and Hope Jimenez. Levine teases there's more to glean from this key art, so I'll leave you to it:&nbsp;</p>










<article data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="c2a35418-253f-4baf-9a27-dcb207a5e607" data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-embed-display-settings="{&quot;link_url&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;link_target&quot;:0,&quot;link_original&quot;:0,&quot;image_source&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;embed_source&quot;:0,&quot;image_caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;embed_caption&quot;:0,&quot;content_warning&quot;:0}" data-langcode="en">

<p>Alongside this key art, Levine has shared that Ghost Story Games has just finished a major milestone it calls "Villainy." The director writes that villainy is a central feature of Judas, and that your actions will attract members of the Big 3 to you as friends, or turn them into foes. "When you play BioShock or BioShock Infinite, the villain is always going to be the villain," Levine writes in the blog. "Fontaine, Comstock – they're always going to be the bad guys. In Judas, your actions will attract members of the Big 3 to you as friends. But ignore one of them enough, and they become the <em>villain</em>. From there, they will get access to a new suite of powers to subvert your actions and goals."&nbsp;</p><p>The included clip in the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/27/judas-ken-levine-details-how-player-actions-determine-who-becomes-the-villain/">blog post</a> shows a Rent-a-Deputy robotic horse, which can attack enemies for you once rented, turning against you at the hands of Big 3 member, Sheriff Tom Austin. Levine says this is just a small way a Big 3 friend-turned-foe can make your life on the Mayflower, the spaceship setting of Judas, harder.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T5_r-un--bA"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T5_r-un--bA" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>In the blog, Levine continues, explaining Ghost Story Games wants players to get to know the Big 3 intimately, and wants losing one of them to feel like losing a friend. The Big 3 will be competing for your favor and attention through Judas – they can bribe you, save you in battle, badmouth the other two Big 3 members, and share with you their deepest secrets. But, as Levine points out, eventually, you have to decide who you trust and who you don't... and that's going to cause problems.&nbsp;</p><p>"In BioShock Infinite, there was a lot of energy invested into developing your relationship with Elizabeth," Levine writes. "By the end of the game, you knew everything about her, her abilities, her hopes, and dreams. But the truth is she knew almost nothing about you, the gamer playing Booker. In Judas, the Big 3 observe you as you play, and they have feelings not only about how you approach combat, hacking, and crafting, but most importantly, your interactions with the other two characters."&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, today's blog doesn't include a release date or window for Judas as Ghost Story Games doesn't want to say when its game will launch until it's confident in a date it can hold. <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2022/01/03/new-report-details-bioshock-creators-new-game-and-the-rocky-development-employee-burnout">Considering Levine's release track record</a>, Judas could still be years away (but hopefully it isn't).&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2022/2022/12/08/bioshock-creators-ghost-story-games-reveals-first-title-judas">watch the Judas reveal trailer</a>, and then <a href="https://gameinformer.com/state-of-play/2024/01/31/new-look-at-judas-gameplay-reveals-more-bioshock-inspiration">check out the Judas gameplay trailer shown last year</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ghost Story Games, the studio founded by BioShock director Ken Levine and currently working on a very BioShock-esque-looking game, Judas, just <a href="https://www.judasthegame.com/news/dev-log-1">published a developer blog for the first time</a> in the game's more than a decade-long conceptual and development production period. The update provides a few details about one of the game's core features, and shows off some impressive key art, but it does not provide any kind of update as to the game's release date.</p>



<p>We got our very first proper look at Judas last <a href="https://wccftech.com/judas-is-finally-unveiled-by-bioshock-creator-ken-levine/">March</a>, and since then, Ghost Story Games has been about as quiet as it was for the last decade. Though in fairness, Judas has been an idea floating in <a href="https://wccftech.com/ken-levines-new-game-is-small-scale-open-world-sci-fiai-themed/">Levine's mind since 2015</a>, and Ghost Story Games was only <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ghost-story-games">founded</a> from the rubble of Irrational Games in 2017.</p>



<p>Still, it feels weird and surprising to read "<em>Dev Log #1</em>" at the top of the post for a game that we've been hearing about for years. At least it features a few interesting tidbits about what to expect in Judas, namely around the game's core feature called Villainy.</p>



<p>"<em>Villainy is a central feature of </em><em>Judas</em>. When you play <em>BioShock</em> or <em>BioShock Infinite</em>, the villain is always going to be the villain. Fontaine, Comstock — they’re always going to be the bad guys," the post reads. "<em>In </em><em>Judas</em>, your actions will attract members of the Big 3 to you as friends. But ignore one of them enough, and they become the VILLAIN. From there, they will get access to a new suite of powers to subvert your actions and goals."</p>



<p>The post also digs into how Judas takes a good deal of inspiration from Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor and its Nemesis System. But before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monoliths-shadow-of-mordor-nemesis-system-patent-doesnt-expire-for-another-decade/1100-6529722/">Warner Bros fires up its legal team</a>, the post is quick to point out that what Levine and the Ghost Story Games team have made for Judas is a system that is accomplishing different goals, particularly around how you'll interact with the three core characters referred to as 'The Big Three,' which is Tom, Hope, and Nefertiti.</p>



<p>"<em>In </em><em>Judas</em>, you're going to get to know these characters <em>intimately</em>. We want losing one of them to feel like losing a friend. We want to play with that dynamic, and we want that choice to be super hard. The Big 3 are all going to be competing for your favor and attention. They can bribe you, save you in battle, talk shit about the other characters, and share with you their darkest secrets. But eventually, you've got to decide who you trust and who you don't."</p>



<p>Ghost Story Games also revealed that it has just completed a playtest for its Villainy feature, which was another major milestone in the game's development, before closing the post by making it clear that the studio won't be announcing a release date until it is sure that it will hit said date.</p>



<p>"<em>While we wish we could give you an exact date today, we’re not quite ready to finalize that. As you know, release dates have a way of slipping by, and we’d like to avoid having to change the date after we announce it. But we know </em><em>Judas</em> is not really a game until the players get their hands on it, and that’s a day everyone on the team is working toward."</p>



<p>Earlier this month, it seemed like Ghost Story Games' parent company Take-Two Interactive, <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-two-ceo-says-mafia-the-old-country-is-a-wonderful-premium-title-seems-to-confirm-judas-for-2026/">confirmed</a> that Judas will arrive sometime in 2026. Hopefully, that is the case, and we can finally wrap up this decade-long journey from BioShock Infinite to Judas. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, and oddly enough, it doesn't sound like BioShock 4 will be as lucky, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-4-late-2027-release-cloud-chamber-layoffs-80-people/">might not be arriving until 2027</a> as its development troubles only seem to keep piling up. </p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games-review/766751/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/metal-gear-solid-delta-awkwardly-mixes-modern-visuals-with-old-school-frustrations.1282332/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em> seemed to be designed specifically for me, at first. I’ve played and loved nearly every entry of the <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> series, and the original <em>MGS</em> is one of my favorite games of all time. These weird, third-person stealth action games feature bizarre characters and scenarios that have lingered in my memories through a consistent mixture of intricate political espionage and ridiculous action sequences. The only entry that I never managed to play was <em>Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</em>.</p><p><em>Delta</em> is a modern remake of <em>MGS3 </em>that uses the same levels, cutscenes, voice lines, and performances, making it ideal for those who adored the earlier entries. Sadly, after hours of play, <em>Delta</em> often left me frustrated. You play as a more novice version of one of the series’ protagonists, Naked Snake, who is completely unequipped to deal with the scenarios before him. This makes sense from a story perspective, but it left me feeling as though I was playing with one hand tied behind my back. I also did not have the benefit of nostalgia to see me through this fog of annoyance.</p><p>Despite its incredible visuals, this is not an overhaul to the extent of recent remakes like <em>Resident Evil 4</em> or <em>Silent Hill 2</em>. This is an almost shot-for-shot remake of the original <em>Snake Eater</em> (to not complicate matters, we won’t discuss the many different versions of <em>Snake Eater</em> and which is the definitive version). This means that you’ll experience it with warts and all.</p><p>You can miss equipment at crucial stages and melee combat works when the game decides (I can hit flying creatures with a torch but I can’t stab a snake with a knife). Healing makes as much sense as reading tea leaves. I could not tell you how or why Snake manages to heal, despite there being an entire mechanic cleverly dedicated to counter broken bones, bullet wounds, and so on. Snake can use a lit cigar to rid himself of leeches or bandages to stop bleeding, but these do not improve health bars so much as stop them from degrading. I don’t know what raises his health bars.</p><p>The game’s structure is part of why it feels dated. The levels are broken up by frequent loading screens that show how small they really are, making me feel like I was moving from one tiny fake set to another, rather than navigating a dense jungle. To be fair, that is how the original game works and, as noted, this is not a bottom-up remake. Nevertheless, these small levels feel at odds with the modern visuals.</p><p>I have no problem learning a game’s systems through trial and error, especially when loading is lightning fast (the PS5’s SSD has no doubt saved many a potential broken controller). But I felt constantly unprepared in <em>Delta</em>. The early hours saw me frequently reloading a level due to a sudden introduction of landmines, a distinct inability to see or detect enemies, and uninspired boss fights. These all threw me off and made me roll my eyes when I had to come back. The game and I were just not clicking. The versions of Snake I saw in cutscenes felt like a different character in my useless hands during gameplay.</p><p>To be clear, Snake feels incredible to control, akin to the Snake in 2015’s <em>Metal Gear Solid V: Phantom Pain</em>, the most recent entry in the series. He responds immediately to controls, directional movements are twitch perfect, and shooting and fighting felt, well, solid. It was also lovely to hear Snake’s English voice being performed by series original David Hayter, whose over-the-top action hero growling once again works perfectly. His performance straddles the line between the ridiculousness of B-grade action flicks and the slick, big-budget productions of a <em>John Wick</em> film.</p><p>Snake does eventually start growing his large arsenal of gadgets and weapons, and learning when and how to use these various gadgets does prove to be part of the joy of the game. But I never felt like I truly understood how and when to use the various gear, which ranges from a weird sonar detector to a crocodile helmet.</p><p>For example, moving through a base near water means you could don a crocodile helmet pretending to be said animal, until you find a ledge, climb on top, and quietly deal with various guards. However, despite wearing the helmet, I was immediately spotted in one instance, bringing a whole level of enemies on top of me. Another area required me to sneak into a base, but it was surrounded by an electric fence and landmines, which proved impossible to spot because I had missed out on a landmine detector earlier in the game.</p><p>Until I obtained thermal goggles, spotting enemies was a nightmare. I found some success by using the game’s remarkable camouflage system (which allows Snake to wear different outfits and body paint to blend into the immediate environment) that renders him almost invisible to enemies. This meant, if I stumbled on an enemy, I had a higher chance of not being immediately spotted.</p><p>The game calls for slow, methodic movement in terrain that can prove hostile, with aforementioned mines, poisonous animals, guard dogs, and so on all trying to find ways to kill you. The game felt more like a collection of puzzles than fully realized environments like in past games, and this structure just never clicked with me.</p><p>The story did, however. It is a delightfully convoluted mess that anyone who has played a <em>Metal Gear</em> game will expect. Snake has been sent to a remote jungle location during the Cold War to stop a Very Big Machine from nuking the world. High-ranking government officials from Russia and the US are vying for power but prove vulnerable to some powerful military offshoot who is trying to take control. There’s backstabbing, twists, and the usual reflection on war, technology, conquest, and the horror of power. Series creator — and the original <em>Snake Eater</em>’s director and writer — Hideo Kojima has been obsessed with these themes for decades. It was actually touching to see his name in the credits and displayed prominently, despite his infamous fallout with Konami.</p><p>Without the benefit of nostalgia, my perspective — that is, someone who is experienced with all the other <em>Metal Gear</em> games but has not touched this one — puts me in a weird space. The gorgeous visuals and eccentric story make it appear like a perfect fit for me. But <em>Delta</em> left me feeling frustrated in its (deliberately designed) helplessness and old-school structure. It left me wanting to be anywhere else rather than in the jungles with that beloved weirdo Snake.</p><p><sub>Metal Gear Sold Delta: Snake Eater <em>launches on August 28th on the PC, PS5, and Xbox.</em></sub></p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/766751/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-review#comments">0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAwNTg="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tauriq Moosa</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games-review/766751/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-review]]></content:encoded>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/judas-previews-bioshock-ken-levine-1851367642">Where is <em>Judas</em></a>? That’s the question <em>BioShock </em>creator Ken Levine keeps getting asked. On Wednesday he took to the PlayStation Blog to tell players he still doesn’t have an answer. “While we wish we could give you an exact date today, we’re not quite ready to finalize that,” he writes, though he does offer some other details.</p> <p>His new <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/27/judas-ken-levine-details-how-player-actions-determine-who-becomes-the-villain/">“lo-fi” dev log</a> explains that<em> Judas</em> has no set villain. NPCs called the “Big 3” will share secrets with you, give you quests, and talk shit about the others. Depending on who you engage with and how, one of characters will be elevated into the game’s main antagonist, unlocking additional powers with which to hamper your journey in the process.</p> <p>“In <em>Judas</em>, you’re going to get to know these characters intimately,” Levine writes. “We want losing one of them to feel like losing a friend. We want to play with that dynamic, and we want that choice to be super hard. The Big 3 are all going to be competing for your favor and attention. They can bribe you, save you in battle, talk shit about the other characters, and share with you their darkest secrets. But eventually, you’ve got to decide who you trust and who you don’t.”</p>

 <figure><figcaption>Credit: Ghost Story Games</figcaption></figure> <p>Ghost Story Games, the studio making <em>Judas</em>, also revealed the game’s key art. It includes the Big 3, killer robots, and ’80s iconography like floppy disks, cassette tapes, and an Atari-esque game stick. Levine confirmed the game recently held a closed playtest and will likely feature over 100 speaking roles by the time it’s complete. He also teased that the key art is intended as more than just an homage to the work of movie poster artist Drew Struzan. “Let’s just say there’s some stuff in this game that we’re not going to talk about right now, but everything here is relevant,” Levine writes.</p> <p>Despite its already lengthy development cycle, with early elements teased as far back as 2015 and a reveal trailer at The Game Awards 2022, <em>Judas</em> seems unlikely to be launching anytime soon. I’d peg it for a fall 2026 release at the earliest, though spring 2027 seems like a better bet. “As you know, release dates have a way of slipping by, and we’d like to avoid having to change the date after we announce it,” Levine writes.</p> <p>The director’s infamously <a href="https://kotaku.com/report-ken-levines-ghost-story-studio-is-nowhere-near-1848297126">difficult production style and the high turnover</a> at his current studio probably haven’t helped. Can <em>Judas</em> live up to all of the procedural narrative ambition Levine is promising? Will it still manage to come out before <em>BioShock 4</em>? We still have way more questions than answers.</p>

                <p>Yooka-Laylee earned mixed reviews upon its release in 2017, but that didn't stop it from gaining a faithful following of 3D platforming fans charmed by its Banjo-Kazooie-inspired gameplay--which should come as no surprise, as its developer, Playtonic, consisted of many former Rare employees. While the series has continued with the well-received 2D sidescrolling spin-off, Yooka-Laylee And The Impossible Lair, Playtonic is resurrecting the original Yooka-Laylee with an enhanced remaster dubbed <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FNP1T9WR?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Yooka-Re-Playlee</a> launching for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch 2, and PC in the near future. We don't know the specific release date just yet, but physical preorders for the game are already live, and you can secure your copy for just $50 at Amazon.</p><div title="6534306 - Yooka-Re-Playlee Preorders" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4218" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6534306 - Yooka-Re-Playlee Preorders" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FNP1T9WR?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0FNP1T9WR?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FNP1T9WR?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Yooka-Re-Playlee Standard Edition</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FNP1T9WR?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0FNP1T9WR?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FNP1T9WR?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$50 | Release TBA</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>The $50 Yooka-Re-Playlee Standard Edition is the only version of the game announced so far.

Playtonic also added helpful tools like a map system to help you navigate its sprawling 3D world and keep track of which challenges you've completed. On top of all that, it will also feature a reorchestrated version of the soundtrack composed by Grant Kirkhope (Banjo-Kazooie, Mario+Rabbids, Viva Piñata), David Wise (Donkey Kong Country), and Steve Burke (Viva Piñata).</p><p>If you're looking for other 3D platformers to keep you busy Yooka-Re-Playlee arrives, Kirby and the Forgotten Land is an easy recommendation.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="article-base-contributors"><div data-component="contributors"><p><a data-testid="contributor-name" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/author/diego-arguello" data-discover="true">Diego Argüello</a><span data-testid="contributor-title">, <!-- -->Contributing Editor, News</span><span data-testid="contributor-title">, <!-- -->GameDeveloper.com</span></p><p data-testid="contributors-date">August 27, 2025</p></div><p><span data-component="icon" data-name="Clock"></span><span>5 Min<!-- --> <!-- -->Read</span></p></div><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Side and Razer have announced a new playtest tool that uses Side's proprietary AI technology, which aims to analyze data to ‛improve quality assurance results' and reduce playtesting costs.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On paper, the workflow of the tool, named Razer Cortex: Playtest Program—Powered by Side, goes like this: a Razer Cortex user, which is the company‛s PC launcher app, can sign an NDA and receive a download key for a game in development. Cortex then "tracks in-game activity and performance" while collecting "player sentiment".</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After completing a required play time and submitting feedback, the user earns Razer Silver, a digital currency that can be exchanged for rewards via the app. Meanwhile, Side's proprietary AI "de-duplicates and consolidates the data," which is then validated by quality assurance teams (QA). The companies claim the tool will be an instance of "human-in-the-loop" AI.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The goal for the app is to provide information to QA workers at Side from large playtests, which is aimed to help them catch bugs that "could have potentially flown under the radar in a lab setting." An example of this, according to the announcement, is that if a playtest comes back with multiple reports of a crash in the same section, Side‛s testers know to start looking for a bug.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-king-s-leadership-is-sceptic-about-microsoft-s-ai-mandate" target="_self" data-discover="true">Report: King's leadership is 'skeptic' about Microsoft's AI mandate</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When asked about the difference in involving players who aren't exactly trained in playtesting or fit a specific profile, Side's chief technology officer, Dr. Harlan Beverly, said the differences in experience and other factors are "negated through the volume of testers we are talking about participating in this program." In addition, Beverly said that the tool "isn't there to replace lab standard playtesting," instead offering a "new type of playtest" to evaluate the experience of people who don't have the top-performing PC and internet connection usually available in a lab environment.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The development of this tool reflects Side's commitment to infuse technology with human ingenuity," continues the announcement. "Providing playtest reports of this caliber to human QA teams wouldn’t be possible without the company’s significant investment in AI-enabled gaming services solutions."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the announcement, Beverly claimed that the tool will lead to "more testers and more playtest hours at the same or lower cost" for developers who enroll to use the tool. When asked for an example, the CTO said that during the team's market research, Side found numerous companies who offer playtesting services, one of them quoting "a cost of $1.2 million for a 100,000-person playtest to last 30 minutes." Beverly said the program "would easily be able to reduce that by 80 percent."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/developer-rec-room-lays-off-about-half-its-staff" target="_self" data-discover="true">Developer Rec Room lays off 'about half' its staff</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Meanwhile, Quyen Quach, vice president of software at Razer, called the tool a "cost-effective way" for developers to run playtests at scale. The companies claim that around 100,000 users could take part in the tests. "By integrating Side's solution into Razer Cortex, we simplify build distribution, enable targeted player selection, and support structured data collection," Quach said. "Developers can target player pools based on gameplay behaviour, experience, and eventually, broader audience insights. This could also enable player-led localization testing in the future."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The companies claim this will be an instance of 'human-in-the-loop' AI">The companies claim this will be an instance of 'human-in-the-loop' AI</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Side, primarily a co-development studio, has been working on AI-powered services for some time now. Almost a year ago to the day, the company </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ptw-acquires-ghostpunch-games-for-13-million-and-pitches-ai-based-services">acquired Ghostpunch Games</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for $13 million. At the same, Side said that Ghostpunch's vast experience could be combined with its own "deep QA knowledge" to offer AI-based QA automation and other services to clients in the future.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Additional synergies can be seen through the combination of PTW's AI-based art technology and Ghostpunch's art integration capabilities, which will bring new generative art integrated technology offerings to the games industry," read a press release at the time. PTW refers to Side's previous name </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ptw-rebrands-as-side-to-begin-new-era-of-support-services">before a rebranding</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in March of this year.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ubisoft-ceo-summoned-to-court-in-harassment-case" target="_self" data-discover="true">Ubisoft CEO summoned to court in harassment case</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In last week's announcement, Side said that "building AI into our workflows is critical to keeping both our clients and our team ahead." Referring to QA teams specifically, the company said that there are usually "5-6 people" working in a fully secure environment for most AAA titles. (Without taking into account how QA is often outsourced). The tool's goal, then, is to gather data from people who are "playing the game authentically for entertainment purposes," as opposed to QA folks who are "attempting to 'break' the game" by focusing their time on key moments and areas that players are most likely to interact with.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Regarding the "human-in-the-loop" term for the AI, which is present in the press release for the announcement, Beverly said the company doesn't "use any playtester data to train the AI," and neither Side nor Razer retains the data, with the solution being done in compliance with GDPR and other regulations on a country-by-country basis.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Instead, during the setup phase, we give the AI context about the game itself, which helps guide the AI to better understand and analyse playtester feedback," the CTO said.

</article>
<p>Alongside these character sketches, we have some details for each:&nbsp;</p><h3>Tessalynde (Tess) Halendria: The Rogue – Elf</h3><p><em>Tess is a professional young infiltrator who always has a plan.</em></p><p>Tess was such a proficient thief as a child—and caused so much havoc in her small town—that her overwhelmed parents sent her to the city to train with an elderly halfling rogue famed for her good deeds. Now, with the skills of a master burglar, tempered by the conscience to use them for good, she pursues high-stakes jobs and big-time coin, always striving to keep her party safe.</p><h3>Anson Iro: The Fighter – Human</h3><p><em>Anson always gets back up when he’s knocked down, even if staying down is smarter.&nbsp;</em></p><p>Orphaned at a young age, Anson and his brother were polarized by their boyhood trauma. While Anson chose the path of a righteous warrior, his brother embraced a life of crime. Still, Anson refuses to give up on his only surviving family member. Having lost so much, Anson clings to what’s his, even if it’s broken.&nbsp;</p><h3>Cazrin Varaith: The Wizard – Human</h3><p><em>Cazrin is a walking reference library who enthusiastically shares her knowledge whether you want it or not.&nbsp;</em></p><p>Cazrin’s long-ago ancestress was a wizard who launched devastating attacks on elite institutions of magical learning in the belief that magic should be accessible to all. The horror of these actions prevents the Varaith family from using magic to this day. But Cazrin has taught herself the fundamentals of spellcasting by recovering scraps of her ancestress’s knowledge. A fearless experimenter, she will test any theory in the name of learning.</p><h3>Lark Silverstring: The Bard – Tiefling</h3><p><em>A born showman who attracts attention and trouble in equal measure.&nbsp;</em></p><p>Lark lives to perform. But that’s a problem when he’s being hounded by dangerous bounty hunters and a small but dedicated fanbase. Consumed by the need to entertain, he routinely blows his own cover and must scramble out of the spotlight. As his old band enjoys widespread fame, Lark evades pursuers and questions about who wants him and why.</p><h3>Baldric Goodhand: The Cleric – Dwarf</h3><p><em>A smooth talker who negotiates for spells with a variety of gods.</em></p><p>Baldric’s certain he can talk his way out of anything. Though a man of the cloth, he refuses to pledge service to a single god, preferring to bargain for spells and favors from the entire pantheon. His unconventional relationship with the gods gives him a freewheeling confidence. But while he’s jaded with the divine, his faith in fellow mortals runs deep.</p><hr><p>"In a time of fickle dogs and feckless governors, the world yearns for heroes," a press release about this comic series reads. "What it gets are the Fallbacks – a party of daring, dubious, and dysfunctional adventurers who arrive in the city of Loudwater in search of gold and glory. But an encounter with kobold thieves puts the Fallbacks in the crosshairs of a rival team of deeply annoying local heroes. Will the Fallbacks pull off a heist for the ages? Or will they sacrifice it all to put these 'heroes' in their place?"</p><p>Here's a look at the different covers for Issue #1:&nbsp;</p><p>The Fallbacks begins this October with Issue #1 from Dark Horse Comics.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>Are you going to be checking out Dungeons &amp; Dragons: The Fallbacks in October?

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ninja-gaiden-4-gamescom-hands-on-preview-%E2%80%93-a-promising-return.1282290/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>With series developer Team NINJA starting to focus on action RPG games with a distinct Soulslike feel with the first entry in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nioh-complete-edition/">Nioh</a> series, it felt like the Japanese studio was done with the Ninja Gaiden franchise, one of the series that better defines the team. As the years went by with no news on a new entry in the series, it felt more and more like Ryu Hayabusa's story had come to an end, but in early 2025, it was made clear how the series is not only alive, but also rather well. Following the release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ninja-gaiden-2-black-the-edge-of-the-dragon-sword/">Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</a> and the classic 2D action game Ninja Gaiden Ragebound earlier this year, the series will return to PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S with Ninja Gaiden 4, a game that has the potential of being not only one of the best entries in the series, but one of the best action games of the generation, combining the best Team NINJA and PlatinumGames have offered with their games to date.</p>



<p>Though very short, barely clocking 30 minutes in length, the Ninja Gaiden 4 Gamescom demo did an excellent job showcasing how the game will continue the series tradition of lightning-fast action gameplay, but with a distinct PlatinumGames flavor. Controlling Yakumo in a futuristic rendition of Tokyo which ran extremely well on Xbox Series X, with little to none framerate drops, I was able to try out his parkour and movement abilities, which include a grappling hook for superior mobility across long distances that also has some combat applications, fight a few regular enemies along the way, which were combo'ed to death using different weapons, aerial launchers and devastating finishing moves, and put my skills to the test against a powerful boss. This fight was definitely the highlight of the experience, as it served as an introduction to Yakumo's Bloodraven form, a special technique that allows the Raven clan ninja to enhance his weapons and expand their movesets using blood.</p>

</div>
</figure>



<p>Mastering a complex combat system with the limited time available was a challenge, and it took me many attempts to understand how to use the Bloodraven technique to prevent the powerful boss from unleashing his special attacks and stagger him so that he could be damaged with longer combos, which are performed in typical PlatinumGames fashion by using light and heavy attacks in specific sequences. What I appreciated the most is that, compared to too many character-action games, Ninja Gaiden 4 doesn't toss everything the player learns out of the window in boss fights, but actually allows players to use any intricate combo they use against regular enemies even against certain bosses. It's impossible to know if this will be the case for all of them, but the fact that this was possible against this particular boss definitely bodes well. With the rocking music's intensity ramping up as the boss entered his second phase, with more powerful attacks which were trickier to dodge, and some clearly advanced tech that required more time to be used properly, including the dodge offset mechanic made popular by the Bayonetta series, the game immediately brought to mind Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance, one of PlatinumGames' finest action games ever.</p>



<p>Unable to try out Ryu Hayabusa's gameplay, which should be closer in feel to the traditional series' experience, it's impossible to say at this time how Ninja Gaiden 4 will balance the new and old approach and how everything will come up together, but the little taste of the experience I had made more more excited than before about the game, which has the serious chance of topping <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> as my game of the year. Thankfully, the wait won't be too long, as the game launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S on October 21.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/skate-early-access-roadmap-ea-full-circle/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-and-full-circle-dive-into-what-skate-will-include-at-launch-and-reveal-its-early-access-roadmap.1282284/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, EA and Full Circle <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-skate-early-access-release-date/">announced</a> that Skate will launch into early access this coming September 16, 2025, on PS5, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Today, EA and Full Circle debuted a new development update which delved into what players will be able to experience at launch, and the early access roadmap for Skate, and spoiler alert, there's no defined date yet for its 1.0 launch. </p>



<p>What the roadmap does have is the breakdown of how Skate will be getting its major updates, which will be distinguished by seasons. The first season will arrive sometime in October 2025, with the introduction of Skate's battle pass that's just called the Skate Pass, two seasonal events including a Halloween event, and of course a slew of bug fixes. </p>



<p>Every season Full Circle releases will include "<em>new skateable areas, new challenges, new seasonal events, new brand partners, new cosmetics, new tracks added to the soundtrack, bug fixes, and quality of life updates</em>."</p>



<figure><figcaption>EA and Full Circle's early access roadmap for Skate. Image credit: EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>Season 2 will arrive sometime in December, which will introduce co-op gameplay, improvements to the video editor, and new tricks to perform on top of the regular seasonal updates, and Season 3 will add new game modes, leaderboards, more ways to customize your skater, player-created parks, and more tricks for players to master when it arrives in 2026. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Regarding what'll be there at launch in the time between September 16 and the season one release, players will more or less get the chance to get comfortable with Skate again, especially if you've not been part of the closed playtesting period.</p>



<p>The flick-it-style gameplay that made Skate iconic has been rebuilt within EA's Frostbite engine, and there's a Skatepedia players can lean on to help them master every trick in the book, or at least every trick that'll be included in the game at launch.</p>



<p>If you were in the insider playtesting for Skate, then you're already playing the early access version of the game, as EA and Full Circle have already pushed it to playtesters. Everyone else will be able to jump in for free on September 16.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/paizo-is-changing-their-pathfinder-adventure-paths-publishing-schedule-dropping</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/paizo-is-changing-pathfinder-adventure-paths-publishing-schedule-dropping-monthly-and-going-quarterly.1282281/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Paizo is changing the way they're publishing <em>Pathfinder</em> Adventure Paths. The publisher behind the beloved fantasy TTRPG has been releasing prewritten adventures the same way since 2007, but will change in response to a different tabletop gaming landscape.</p>

<h2>The New Pathfinder Adventure Paths Changes</h2>

<p>In an official blog post, Paizo prefaces the way they have released <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/pathfinder" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Pathfinder</em></a> Adventure Paths in the past. They mention the format, releasing a three-part Adventure Path in separate softcover books monthly, was an outgrowth of the company's start publishing <em>Dungeon</em> and <em>Dragon </em>magazine from 2002 to 2007.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pathfinder-adventure-paths-hellbreakers-book-promo.jpg?itok=unLkILkP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pathfinder-adventure-paths-hellbreakers-book-promo.jpg?itok=Y60SkN03 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>But, the world has changed a lot since then. As such, the Adventure Path format will change as well. Paizo is still committed to releasing four Adventure Paths per year. The difference is that each Adventure Path will be released in its entirety in one hardcover book, released each quarter.</p>

<p>The reasons for this change to <em>Pathfinder</em> Adventure Paths are numerous and reasonable. First, the logistics of printing multiple books in the current climate have become volatile due to ongoing&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/gama-joins-second-anti-tariff-lawsuit-against-trump-administration" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">trade tariffs</a>, so consolidating material into fewer books is a sensible move. Second, the MSRP for these books is $79.99, which is noticeably cheaper than buying three softcover books at an MSRP of $89.99.</p>

<p>Third, having everything in one book is easier for GMs. There's less clutter at the table, less flipping around for a certain chart or statblock, and the GM can read ahead to ensure the adventure is continuing as intended. Lastly, this new model will make reprinting these books easier since they won't have to worry about reformatting the softcover parts.</p>

<p>The first two <em>Pathfinder</em> Adventure Paths being released under this new model will be released in 2026. The first is <em>Hellbreakers</em>, which involves the outbreak of war between the nations of Andoran and Cheliax. The second is <em>Hell's Destiny</em>, the follow-up to <em>Hellbreakers</em>.</p>

<p>As part of No Man’s Sky’s big Voyagers update, patch notes for the latest version are now available. The new update, called Update 6.0, is the third largest in No Man’s Sky’s almost decade-long release. While it had a nightmare launch, No Man’s Sky has grown in popularity and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/no-mans-sky-new-steam-review-rating/">redeemed itself</a>.</p>



<p>Voyagers now allows players to customize their spaceships, called Corvettes, however they’d like. While it is the highlight of Update 6.0 of No Man’s Sky, other improvements have been made to several aspects of the title. For example, load times have been shortened and multiple bugs have been fixed to ensure the best possible experience. </p>



<p>The full patch notes can be found below for No Man’s Sky and <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/voyagers-update/">on the official website</a>. The game has grown quite a bit, with no signs of stopping, so keep it at Insider Gaming for more like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/no-mans-sky-nintendo-switch-2-beacon-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">news</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/no-mans-sky-launches-massive-omega-update-with-free-trial/">updates</a>.</p>

</p></figure>



<h3 id="h-corvette-class-starships">Corvette-class Starships</h3>



<ul>
<li>Added a new class of starship, the Corvette. Corvettes are large, fully bespoke ships with furnished interiors, capable of accommodating multiple passengers.</li>



<li>A lightweight tutorial for assembling your first Corvette will activate upon first collecting a Corvette module or interacting with the Corvette Workshop.</li>



<li>A large catalogue of snappable structural and decorative modules is available for Corvette assembly, including habitation modules, hulls, wings, engines, windows, accessways, weapons, reactors, shield generators, connectors and decorative peripherals.</li>



<li>Corvette modules can be unearthed from salvage containers buried on worlds across the universe, as well as discovered in Derelict Freighters.</li>



<li>Modules can also sometimes be retrieved from defeated pirates, freighter cargo pods, crashed freighter crates, frigate expeditions, or received as rewards for completing missions.</li>



<li>Structural Corvette modules are collected individually in the inventory and spent directly when assembling a Corvette.</li>



<li>While standing within a Corvette, specialised furnishings and a selection of base decorations can be installed in the ship’s interior.</li>



<li>Internal modules can be installed without limitation, but require resources to construct.</li>



<li>Habitation modules (“habs”) form the main living area for Corvette-class starships. Habs are available in three distinct classes: Titan, Thunderbird, and Ambassador, each with its own sci-fi aesthetic. Installed furnishings reflect the style of their hab, and multiple habs placed adjacently are automatically linked with doorways.</li>



<li>Multi-storey Corvettes can be assembled with the installation of internal stairways.</li>



<li>Several installable Corvette modules have practical functionality, such as the Living Wall, Nutrition Unit, Refiner Unit and Mission Radar.</li>



<li>A number of Corvette modules are linked to technology upgrades, automatically improving the Corvette’s stats alongside its appearance.</li>



<li>Corvette Workshop terminals can be found aboard the Space Station. These terminals provide an interface through which collected Corvette modules can be assembled into a pilotable, habitable starship.</li>



<li>The terminal also provides access to a shop for purchasing basic Corvette modules, and a barter interface for trading advanced Corvette modules.</li>



<li>The Corvette Workshop can store a draft Corvette, allowing work-in-progress edits to be saved and returned to at a later time.</li>



<li>A nearby cache will collect any overflow of refunded Corvette modules if there are too many to store in the player’s inventory.</li>



<li>The Corvette benefits from an especially powerful pulse drive, which moves faster than single-occupancy ships.</li>



<li>Corvettes can autopilot to space stations, discovered planets, and mission destinations.</li>



<li>Corvettes can also be set to autopilot along the current flightpath.</li>



<li>Corvette accessways are accompanied by a specialised teleporter, allowing the ship to hover above especially mountainous or difficult terrain, while passengers beam themselves to and from the planetary surface.</li>



<li>Added support for multiple physics worlds, enabling players to travel stably and walk on foot around fast-moving Corvettes.</li>



<li>Spacewalking is now a fully supported mode of navigation, allowing players to leave their ships (or freighters) and use their jetpack to fly among the stars.</li>



<li>Added a number of Corvette-specific visual effects for engines and landing.</li>



<li>Added new audio effects and ambient environments for Corvettes.</li>



<li>Added specialised camera handling for piloting Corvettes and navigating their interiors.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-corvette-multiplayer-missions">Corvette Multiplayer Missions</h3>



<ul>
<li>Added a Corvette-based mission board, allowing players on board the Corvette to register as mission crew to co-operatively complete objectives in the local system and earn rewards and standing.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-corvette-expedition">Corvette Expedition</h3>



<ul>
<li>Expedition Nineteen, Corvette, will begin shortly and run for approximately six weeks.</li>



<li>Rewards include new posters, decals and titles, the vigilant jetpack trail and plasma starship trail, an exclusive deadeye cannon module for Corvettes, and the unique Mecha-Mouse robotic companion.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-skyborn-exosuit-and-jetpack">Skyborn Exosuit and Jetpack</h3>



<ul>
<li>Added the 5-piece Skyborn Exosuit to the Appearance Modifier, including armour, gloves, boots, legs and torso customisations.</li>



<li>Added the Skyborn Jetpack to the Appearance Modifier.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-twitch-drops">Twitch Drops</h3>



<ul>
<li>A new package of Twitch drops will begin shortly. Sign up and connect your platform accounts on the Twitch Drops page, then tune in to Twitch to earn exotic base parts, high-tech starships, fireworks, appearance modifications, and more.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-gameplay-and-quality-of-life">Gameplay and Quality of Life</h3>

He added that the project is still in the very early stages, and is expected to go through a "lengthy concept process." Hight compared it to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-jedi-director-developing-dungeons-dragons-single-player-action-adventure">a similar new D&amp;D video game project</a> Wizards of the Coast is supervising under Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order director Stig Asmussen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The 14 other developers joining de Plater are veterans of Cliffhanger Games, a studio <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-ea-studio-dedicated-to-open-world-action-adventure-will-be-led-by-former-monolith-studio-head">formed under EA in 2023</a> largely comprised of veterans from de Plater's Shadow of Mordor team.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week in Cologne, Capcom's nerve-jangling <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> demo was one of the highlights of the Gamescom 2025 show floor. Offering an introduction to the game's hero Grace Ashcroft, as well as a suitably unsettling monster, the short taster of next year's title simultaeously felt fresh but also like classic Resident Evil — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-hands-on-preview">a perfect blend of old and new for the series' upcoming 30th anniversary</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But, as we all know, there's something else about Resident Evil Requiem driving fan interest right now — and that's the ongoing question mark over the status of floppy-haired fan favorite Leon S. Kennedy. Rumors persist he is in the game as a second character, though, if indeed he is, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-trailer-shows-fresh-look-at-grace-ashcrofts-backstory-but-wheres-leon">Capcom once again held back from revealing the Resident Evil 2 and 4 star</a> during the Gamescom's Opening Night Live story trailer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">My gut feeling here is that Capcom is thoroughly enjoying all the speculation, and in no hurry to end it one way or another. Of course, fans should expect more Resident Evil Requiem details to be announced in due course, but all according to the game's carefully curated marketing plan. And this is why, as I readied myself to sit down with Requiem's director Koshi Nakanishi and producer Masato Kumazawa, I was overly not surprised to be told that the pair would not comment on whether Leon was in the game or not. (Otherwise, this would have have been my first question.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, and without specifically confirming Leon either way, Nakanishi and Kumazawa had plenty to say on fan expectations for a game that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/for-the-first-time-in-over-a-decade-resident-evil-requiem-will-return-to-franchises-original-overarching-narrative-featuring-raccoon-city-and-umbrella">Capcom itself has been promoting as the entry that finally gets back to the franchise's origins</a> — though, intriguingly, the pair confirmed Resident Evil Requiem was not designed specifically as a 30th anniversary game, a clarification Capcom perhaps feels necessary to keep some wilder fan expectations in check. There's plenty below about Requiem's new monster star, a hulking, heaving distorted female figure that seems set to take on the same status as Mr X, and an  apparent shutdown of a theory as to the monster's identity (it doesn't sound like it's Lisa Trevor). Read on for all that, and much more.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Let's start by talking about the monster — do you have a name for her yet?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Koshi Nakanishi:</strong> She's scarier if we don't tell you her name. Feel free to give her a nickname! 'Big Mama' is one of the ones we've heard, but we're taking all kinds of suggestions. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: These enemy characters often become emblematic of the games they're in — such as Mr X, Nemesis, even Lady Dimitrescu. How do you begin designing these characters that become such a, literally, big part of your game? </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nakanishi:</strong> Yeah, there's been quite a few types of so-called 'stalker enemies' in Resident Evil games over the years and I think it's become a bit of a legacy of the series to have these pursuers. That made it difficult for us in terms of how to design a new one that would stand out amongst the crowd of iconic characters that you mentioned. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Actually in this case the character was originally smaller, but I figured let's scale her up and I think that was the right answer because then her incredible size suddenly becomes overwhelming and she literally stands out from the pack of stalker enemies. The base concept was an enemy that you would know in an instant, and when you glance you know, like, 'that's not right, I don't want any part of this, this is bad.'</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: There's a clear visual cue when Big Mama steps into the light that suggests she can't follow you into lit rooms. The light burns her, and you immediately understand that this makes lit rooms a safe zone. Was that a reaction to past safe zones in bright rooms where enemies aren't able to pursue you, but without an in-universe reason why?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nakanishi:</strong> Yeah, that's part of it. I wanted to bring a slightly new twist on the idea of exploring the so-called mansion-type environments that are typical to Resident Evil games and rather than having a specific location that's safe, or unsafe, you will have noticed that a lot of the rooms have light switches and lamps and things in them. So I think it's more to let you have a chance to create your own room that in a given situation that particular creature is afraid of the light amd won't come in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: One of my favorite moments from the demo was when the light went out in a room that I thought was safe. Are there still rooms which are definitively safe, maybe with a typewriter in? Or is it that, in this game, no room is completely safe? </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nakanishi:</strong> I'm glad that worked on you because that was my exact intention. I think with horror you need to establish the rules and then you need to break them to add even more fear and anxiety. So you figure out how to stay safe, and then you realize that it's not as safe as you thought. It is a way to just bring a next level of fear to the experience. You think you have it, and then we pull the rug from your feet. So that's exactly my intention. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: So, are there rooms in the game that are definitively safe?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nakanishi:</strong> Even I don't want to know if I can commit to 100% safe. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Resident Evil Requiem First Gameplay Screenshots — Capcom Spotlight 2025</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Obviously Big Mama is the focus of this demo but, going back to those horror rules, you also presumably need sequences where the player feels more safe. How much of the game has the pursuer element in?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nakanishi:</strong> The demo takes place pretty early in the game and the situation Grace finds herself in is the most terrifying of her life. She's a fairly inexperienced, she's never been in this kind of biohazard situation before. So that's pretty much like a maximum level of fear for her. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There will of course be a growth that she experiences and she'll go through this and come out hopefully feeling a little less scared. And you'll have moments where you'll be able to take a break from that extreme horror and do some exploration, backtracking and puzzle-solving and then gun combat as well. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">She will get weapons in her hands. She won't be defensive throughout the entire game and I think that it's a satisfying growth journey that you go on with her where she's not going to be terrified right through the end of the game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: So Grace herself will be able to fire guns later in the game?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Masato Kumazawa:</strong> Yes. As you mentioned, the series is known for this kind of tension and release, catharsis curve. We can't sustain maximum anxiety throughout or its tiring, but we also want to keep you on your toes so you have to have this rollercoaster dynamic tension throughout. And we're going for that again, but we want to make the wavelength of that curve be the biggest it's ever been, where you're going to have huge tension spikes and then we give you a great release of tension as well. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: There are some very interesting theories about the monster online. I've seen discussion about Big Mama being Alyssa, literally Grace's mother, turned into a monster. There's also chatter that the monster's screams sound the same as Lisa Trevor. Are you aware of some of these fan theories and is there anything you would like to point players towards? </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nakanishi:</strong> We're very much aware of the discussion and speculation about this kind of thing and as a player, whenever I'm playing a game, I love to get involved in that stuff, but I don't think it's fair for me to weigh in on those debates as a developer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kumazawa:</strong> I don't want to burst this bubble before the game comes out. That expanding discussion and speculation is part of the fun of waiting for a game to release and then you'll get the answer when you play the game. So hopefully you can that just a little bit longer. One comment I will say is that you mentioned about the scream being part of the speculation, the sound in the demo is not final, it's actually temporary audio, so I wouldn't focus too much on what you can hear in the demo right now. When the final game comes out, it'll become clearer. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: A lot of people who've played the demo here at Gamescom have said it would be great to release it publicly before the game comes out — and in the past the Resident Evil series has done things like that. Is that something you are considering? </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nakanishi:</strong> Nothing is confirmed or set in stone at the moment, but we are also monitoring the feedback of people who are playing the game at events and we're going to take that into consideration when we decide our next steps. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Let's discuss Alyssa — fans were pleasantly surprised to see her return, some time after Resident Evil Outbreak. Why was her character picked to return and become such a big part of Requiem's story?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nakanishi:</strong> We knew we wanted to return to Raccoon City for this game. It's been a long time since the Raccoon City incident and for the past few titles we've been exploring slightly more unknown corners of the Resident Evil universe. So, coming back to the Umbrella Corporation and the series main central mysteries and themes was the goal of this project. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With that in mind, actually, Alyssa was the perfect character to be the key to all of this because she, as fans will know, is a survivor of the Raccoon City incident who then became a journalist and wanted to uncover the truth behind Umbrella Corporation's involvement. She chased up leads and as you saw in the Opening Night Live presentation, she ultimately paid the price of her life for that investigation. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Grace, her daughter, now is the next generation. She didn't directly experience the Raccoon City incident, but her life is changed by the death of her mother — the murder of her mother as a consequence or cover up of all this. So she's taking that torch to the next generation and as an FBI investigator wants to get to the truth behind not just the incident but her mother's death as well. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So when you think about it in those terms, really Alyssa was crucial and almost the only character we could have used to connect all of these dots together </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Resident Evil: Requiem - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: And it feels intentional, as the Resident Evil series approaches its 30th anniversary, to have a game that looks back at those origins, right? How ambitious are you being answering some of those mysteries and questions from the initial games in Requiem? </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nakanishi:</strong> It's difficult to exactly say how many of the lingering mysteries of the Resident Evil lore will finally be answered, but you will get answers in this game to at least some of them. And while it's not an ending for the series, it moves the general storyline of the universe forward. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Why did you make the decision, with such a focus on the older games and older mysteries, to introduce a new protagonist? </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kumazawa:</strong> Although there are a lot of connections in this game to the lore and the mysteries of the series, past titles and overall storyline, I don't want to give the impression that you have to be an expert in all of this lore to really get the game. If this is your first Resident Evil game ever, we've designed it so you can enjoy it on its own terms, as a game with a storyline that features a character who, if anything, as a new protagonist Grace almost represents that kind of player. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">She's someone who didn't experience all of these things but has heard of them and heard of Umbrella Corporation and Raccoon City, but it's actually all fresh and new, and terrifying. Of course, if you are a fan and know those things, there's an extra level that you can get out of it, but you can still get a 100% from this game. And if you do know any of it, you'll get 120%.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And by having a new character, I think we can bring you on a journey with her that shows her growth, from being fairly terrified and inexperienced at the start of the game, when you'll feel the same, so you can grow with her and become more comfortable. I can't really say exactly what will happen on that journey, but I'm really confident that you'll love coming along for the ride when the game finally releases.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: There's so many fan favourites from the Resident Evil series' past that players want to see come back. Do you feel a need to include elements of the past, especially in this game that looks back to the series' origins?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nakanishi:</strong> Yeah, it's tough to answer without getting into too much we're not ready to talk about yet, but we know that people expect to be surprised or pleasantly surprised whenever they, like you say, they get the connections or they're happy to see this or that they're familiar with coming back. But I'm sure that people will be happy when they see how we've managed to blend a fresh approach and a fresh new character with also things that fans will recognize. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Finally, without asking about any particular character being in the game, I'll simply enquire — are you enjoying the current amount of speculation online about Resident Evil Requiem?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kumazawa:</strong> Yeah, we love checking out the conversations that are happening, but this isn't a game which is entirely focused on looking back. And we're back in Raccoon City, but that's not the only location in the game. It's coming out in the 30th anniversary, but it wasn't planned that way. It just ended up with the development was finished and the game is ready to release in 2026, which is the 30th anniversary. It wasn't built in to be an anniversary title that is only backward facing. So there's a lot more to the game than just the series' legacy. We didn't call it Resident Evil 9 after all. There's a clue in the logo type, but ultimately the name is Resident Evil Requiem. That's what we want you to take from the name of the game. That said, the feeling we need to live up to fans' expectations is in a good sense a kind of pressure because it motivates us. So we love to see it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

And it'll be there, in the crumbling remnants of the series' past, that Capcom has also promised players will find answers to lingering story threads and open questions from decades ago. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But despite all of this, and despite the huge ongoing speculation over Leon S. Kennedy's potential presence in the game (something Capcom specifically declined to comment on to IGN), Capcom is keen for Requiem to be seen as more than just a look back into the franchise's past. Speaking to IGN last week at Gamescom, in a question specifically about the current focus of fan debate, producer Masato Kumazawa made it clear that Requiem would end up being as much about the series' future, as well as its origins.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"We love checking out the conversations that are happening," Kumazawa said, "but this isn't a game which is entirely focused on looking back. And we're back in Raccoon City, but that's not the only location in the game," he revealed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, while Requiem's release has lined up with the Resident Evil series' 30th anniversary next year, Kumazawa made clear that this was not the project's initial plan — perhaps suggesting that fans expecting some kind of long-planned grand finale might need to adjust their expectations. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's coming out in the 30th anniversary, but it wasn't planned that way," Kumazawa said. "It just ended up with the development was finished and the game is ready to release in 2026, which is the 30th anniversary. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It wasn't built in to be an anniversary title that is only backward facing," he continued.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><a title="Companies > Ghost Story Games [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/take-two-interactive-software/ghost-story-games">Ghost Story Games</a> creative director Ken Levine has shared an update on single-player, narrative <a title="Genres > First-Person Shooter [2,763 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/shooter/fps">first-person shooter</a> <em><a title="Games > Judas [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/judas">Judas</a></em> on <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/27/judas-ken-levine-details-how-player-actions-determine-who-becomes-the-villain/" target="_blank">PlayStation Blog</a>, including new key art, details on the “Villainy” system that can turn allies into enemies based on player choices, and plans for more frequent developer updates. <span id="more-988584"></span></p><p>Get the details below.</p><div><p>We know, we know… we’ve been silent for a while. It takes a lot of time and energy to make marketing materials like trailers, and we’re trying to focus all our efforts on finishing <em>Judas</em>.</p><p>But we also miss the days of having a more direct relationship with you, the gamer, so we thought, “Why not start releasing some dev logs?”</p><p>Through these, we hope to communicate more frequently to update you with new details of what we are working on, without spoiling too much of what <em>Judas</em> has in store. The goal is to keep this pretty lo-fi, meaning more frequent updates than before, but not necessarily always with fancy trailers and super polished final imagery. (Though there will be more of those as well!)</p><p><strong>Feature Update: Villainy</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>We’ve just finished a major milestone: Villainy. Villainy is a central feature of <em>Judas</em>. When you play <em>BioShock</em> or <em>BioShock Infinite</em>, the villain is always going to be the villain. Fontaine, Comstock—they’re always going to be the bad guys. In <em>Judas</em>, your <a title="Genres > Action [2,987 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s will attract members of the Big 3 to you as friends. But ignore one of them enough, and they become the villain. From there, they will get access to a new suite of powers to subvert your actions and goals. The clips below demonstrate just a little bit of the feature.</p><p>This is just one example of how the Big 3 can retaliate. The more dangerous and character-specific stuff will be kept a secret, for now.</p><p>Eventually, you’ll have to make decisions about who you’re going to focus your energy on… and who you’ll wind up alienating.</p><p><em>—Want to Rent-A-Deputy?</em></p><p><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]--><br><video id="video-988584-1" width="640" height="360" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://i.imgur.com/DukUCOy.mp4?_=1"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/DukUCOy.mp4">https://i.imgur.com/DukUCOy.mp4</a></video></p><p><em>—But… be careful not to rent one when Tom is pissed off.</em></p><p><video id="video-988584-2" width="640" height="360" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://i.imgur.com/L1HuA9f.mp4?_=2"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/L1HuA9f.mp4">https://i.imgur.com/L1HuA9f.mp4</a></video></p><p><strong>A Focus on Character</strong></p><p>One of my personal favorites of all time is <em>Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor</em> because of the emergent gameplay made possible by their Nemesis System. The system allows you to develop small relationships with multiple orcs. However, their goals were a little different than ours, because there are so many different orcs and they don’t have time to develop them into characters.</p><p>In <em>Judas</em>, you’re going to get to know these characters intimately. We want losing one of them to feel like losing a friend. We want to play with that dynamic, and we want that choice to be super hard. The Big 3 are all going to be competing for your favor and attention. They can bribe you, save you in battle, talk shit about the other characters, and share with you their darkest secrets. But eventually, you’ve got to decide who you trust and who you don’t.</p><p>In BioShock Infinite, there was a lot of energy invested into developing your relationship with Elizabeth. By the end of the game, you knew everything about her, her abilities, her hopes and dreams.</p><p>But the truth is she knew almost nothing about you, the gamer playing Booker. In <em>Judas</em>, the Big 3 observe you as you play, and they have feelings not only about how you approach combat, hacking, and <a title="Genres > Crafting [45 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/crafting">crafting</a>, but most importantly your interactions with the other two characters.</p><p>As part of the Villainy <a title="Companies > Milestone S.r.l. [31 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/milestone-s-r-l">Milestone</a>, we also completed the biggest <em>Judas</em> playtest yet, where new players experienced this feature firsthand. Every time we test, we learn so much, and we love having that level of knowledge when working on the game. The testers shared tons of valuable feedback on the weight of decisions and how it impacted outcomes, their interest in learning more about character motivations, and how moments where the Big 3 helped—or turned on them—changed their future decisions.</p><p><strong>New Key Art</strong></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Judas_08-27-25.jpg"></a></figure><p>Another thing we’re excited to be able to share is… this:</p><p>We’re really happy to finally show this off. I have always personally been a huge fan of Drew Struzan’s work and that era of movie posters. The style is great at presenting films that have a big cast, like Star Wars. And <em>Judas</em> has a big cast. Outside of the lead roles, there’s likely going to be more than one hundred speaking parts… If you look closely, there’s probably some details you might be curious about. Let’s just say there’s some stuff in this game that we’re not going to talk about right now, but everything here is relevant.</p><p>There’s one thing we’re sure you all want to know: <strong>when is <em>Judas</em> coming out?!?!</strong></p><p>While we wish we could give you an exact date today, we’re not quite ready to finalize that. As you know, release dates have a way of slipping by, and we’d like to avoid having to change the date after we announce it. But we know <em>Judas</em> is not really a game until the players get their hands on it, and that’s a day everyone on the team is working toward.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/judas-reveals-new-key-art-villainy-system]]></content:encoded>

<h2>The long and winding road</h2>
<p>It's hard to remember now, but <em>Star Citizen</em>'s <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/11/star-citizens-6-3-million-haul-breaks-gaming-crowdfunding-record/">then-impressive $6.3 million Kickstarter campaign</a> came just a few months before <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/09/gta-v/">first launched on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360</a> (remember those?). But development on Rockstar's long-awaited sequel <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-development-began-in-earnest-in-2020-following-the-massive-success-of-red-dead-redemption-2-take-two-says">didn't start in earnest until 2020</a>, publisher Take Two says, around the time <em>Star Citizen</em> developer Roberts Space Industries was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/01/crytek-cloud-imperium-battle-over-how-to-end-star-citizen-lawsuit/">settling a contentious lawsuit over game engine rights</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/07/star-citizen-dev-offers-roadmap-for-development-of-new-development-roadmap/">rolling out a new development roadmap</a> for the game.</p>

<p>Of course, the development of <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> has happened completely behind closed doors, with developer Rockstar and publisher Take Two only occasionally offering <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/12/grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer-confirms-many-things-including-its-florida-vibes/">tiny drops of information</a> to a desperate press and fan base. By contrast, Roberts Space Industries has issued&nbsp;<a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/en/community/devtracker" target="_blank" rel="noopener">regular, incredibly detailed information dumps</a>&nbsp;on the drawn-out development progress for&nbsp;<em>Star Citizen</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Squadron 42</em>, even when that kind of openness has contributed to the public appearance of internal dysfunction.</p>
<p>The massive, ongoing crowdfunding that powers the open development structure "allows us to do things without imposing the framework of a typical video game studio," Roberts told La Presse. "The players who fund us expect the best game, period. We don't have to streamline, cut jobs, or change our business model."</p>
<p>That pre-launch development cycle must eventually end, of course, and the La Presse report suggests that the full 1.0 release of <em>Star Citizen</em> is "now promised" for "2027 or 2028." While we'd love to believe that, the history of <em>Star Citizen</em> development thus far (and the lack of any provided sourcing for the claim) makes us more than a little skeptical.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">The Outer Worlds was widely seen as a decent stab at mapping Obsidian's first-person RPG style onto a new retro-future sci-fi setting, but what really set it apart was its satirical sense of humor. Unlike similar series like Elder Scrolls or Fallout, the spacefaring setting gave it new avenues to mock corporations and governments. For The Outer Worlds 2, Obsidian is doubling down on those qualities with a premise that's more immediately satirical and opens more options to poke at the edges of its systems.</p><p dir="ltr">I played roughly an hour of The Outer Worlds at Gamescom, which looked to represent the opening of the game, from character creation and a late title card. Right away the humor shone through, as each archetypal selection had its own funny aside that helped illustrate what made it unique. I chose the Roustabout, described as a person with no skills who essentially fell ass-backwards into their role as a commander in the Earth Directorate. So you have power and influence in an elite covert organization, but you also don't really deserve it. Picture Mass Effect's Shepard mixed with Futurama's Zapp Brannigan.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> 40 Minutes of Outer Worlds 2 Gameplay</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The opening mission has you dispatched to investigate spacetime anomalies and coordinate with an agent on the inside of the Protectorate, a totalitarian colony government that's at conflict with a megacorp. Already you have the ingredients for rich worldbuilding, which is first illustrated with a silly propaganda show for the Directorate and continues with seeing firsthand the way the Protectorate runs its government. Protectorate workers are often portrayed as true-believer zealots in the project, though they occasionally make asides that suggest they're more afraid of reprisals than they are genuinely all-in. But you're no heroes, either, as the Directorate is an overbearing police-force-for-hire that seems mainly concerned with protecting megacorp profits. The stakes of the story felt immediately understandable, which is a nice change since the first game took a while to gain its momentum.</p><p dir="ltr">While I'm curious to see all of the class types in the final game, I'm glad I chose the Roustabout and will probably stick with that for the full campaign. A trigger-happy space cop who has no idea what they're doing just feels right for this world, and leads to consistently funny dialogue options. At one point I was confronted with a Protectorate zealot who asked why I chose violence, and I blew my cover with my response: Look man, I'm just improvising here, I'm as clueless about all this as you are. It didn't resolve the situation, but it did make me laugh. Plus, without spoiling how this opening sequence ends, roleplaying as an overwhelmed, overconfident idiot actually makes a lot of sense for where the plot ultimately goes.</p><p dir="ltr">This was the opening sequence, so I didn't get a very substantial feel for how to approach missions in different ways, but I had a few options available to me. I could sneak my way through, talk my way out of situations, go in guns blazing, or, in my case, all three in that order. When I did have to resort to using my weapons, the gunplay felt improved over the first game. I had a trusty sidearm pistol that was very precise, along with a more powerful rifle that came in handy for some ranged encounters. About halfway through, I also found a knife that let me sneak up on guards and take them out silently.</p><p dir="ltr">One element of the first Outer Worlds that I loved, but didn't get to experience much in this Outer Worlds 2 build, is Flaws. Those tend to appear after you've shown certain play patterns over hours of gameplay, so I didn't have time to develop any, but they're a great avenue for tweaking the game mechanics, evaluating trade-offs, and creating organic humor. I wish I had gotten to play more with them in this demo, but that's something to experience in the final game.</p><p dir="ltr">I did hit one progression bug that required a quick reload; I needed a prompt to appear to open a door, and while I got the dialogue leading up to it, the prompt never appeared. That doesn't necessarily speak to the end quality, as there's plenty of time for bug fixes and I may have just been unlucky, but it was familiar enough for this style of game that it felt noteworthy.</p><p dir="ltr">Familiarity is a feeling that permeated throughout The Outer Worlds 2. This is very much more of the same, but it feels better. The story is more immediate and urgent, the weaponry feels great, and the humor is polished and sharp. I rather liked the first Outer Worlds, and everything about this looks just as inviting. I'm looking forward to bumbling my way through another zany space adventure.</p>

                <p>Hitman: World of Assassination launched today for iOS, and the price point is higher than some might have expected. Now that <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hitman-world-of-assassination/id6742786366" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the game has gone live</a>, players have discovered that while the first location is free, you have to pay $70 USD to unlock the full game (but not necessarily the entire experience). </p><p>The $70 price for the full game actually represents a savings over buying the 25 levels outright for $3 each--purchased that way, you'd pay more (<a href="https://kotaku.com/hitman-world-of-assassination-out-now-on-iphone-for-70-or-3-a-level-2000620693" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via Kotaku</a>). Hitman: World of Assassination includes Hitman, Hitman 2, and Hitman 3, and the developers will add the <a href="https://hitman.fandom.com/wiki/Freelancer" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Freelancer mode</a> in a future update. The game supports touch controls and also has support for dedicated gaming controllers.</p><p>Beyond unlocking the full game, people can pay extra for other DLC. In total, the game offers $135 worth of microtransaction opportunities. You can see a full rundown below. For what it's worth, World of Assassination on other platforms is priced similarly, and is often on sale. For example, GameSpot sister site Fanatical has the game <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=It+Costs+%2470+To+Buy+Hitman+On+iOS&amp;fnauthor=eddienoteddy&amp;fndate=2025-08-27+10%3A17%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-08-27+10%3A57%3A43&amp;fnarticle_id=6534314&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Standard+News&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.fanatical.com%252Fen%252Fgame%252Fhitman-world-of-assassination&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fit-costs-70-to-buy-hitman-on-ios%2F1100-6534314%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">for $23 right now on PC.</a></p><p>The first level that's free in the iOS edition is the tutorial, which is the ICA Training Facility and the Sebastian Principle escalation mission in Dubai. The full game weighs in at 43GB, which is a hefty size for a mobile game.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYJwROKrP6I" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fYJwROKrP6I" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>World of Assassination for another mobile device, the Switch 2, is priced at $60 USD. There is no word yet on a release for the game for Android devices.</p><p>The $70 price point for World of Assassination for iOS is bringing up memories of Capcom's pricing decisions for its own AAA game ports for mobile devices.
