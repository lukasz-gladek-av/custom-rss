            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I love <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>. I feel like I have to remind myself of that sometimes, as I'm so bored off my face with shooters in general, and don't really play online competitively anymore. I just can't be bothered with the stress and/or real emotion of it all.</p>
<p>However, Apex Legends, once I get over myself and turn it on, does stuff that pleases my monkey brain quite a lot. Back in 2019 when it released, which feels like centuries ago now, I couldn't believe how clever, simple, and obvious this hero shooter's ping system was. How hadn't anyone done this before? It's a game that's built with no-fuss, unobtrusive teamwork at its core. And it makes it a blast for anyone to have fun with.</p><!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/accessibility-report/2700/embed @ 1754590314 -->
<p>The roster of hero characters, which is now enormous compared to when I last played it, is hugely varied, and they all have amplified and incredibly moreish methods of traversal. It's all very zippy, cloaky, boost-jumpy, and very, very fast. The movement and controls and shooting and zooming around collecting stuff endlessly is just as pleasing as the pings. I know you know all of this already, I'm just saying.</p>
<p>Back on Switch 1, Apex Legends managed to arrive feature-complete. However, it was laid low by terrible performance issues. Indeed, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/apex_legends">I gave it a 5/10</a>, saying it was still fun to play, but had notable frame rate issues, muddy textures, unresponsive and laggy controls...yeah, it was basically a really tragic Switch port.</p>
<p>We don't have to worry about any of this now, though. We can concentrate on having a good time with what's surely still one of the very best (if not <em>the</em> best) hero shooter, Battle Royale...eh, thingies out there. It really is that good. I've used my unlock tokens to grab all but three of the full roster, and I've fallen down the rabbit hole once more.</p>
<p>Because, much like how its ping system originally dazzled me, this Switch 2 port has dazzled me all over again by being perhaps the very first fully-fledged and functionally perfect online shooter that I've ever sat and played on my sofa on a portable console. Yes, there are other great online shooter games on Switch, like the majestic <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon</a> series, but this scratches a very different shooter itch. And it's free!</p>
<p>In docked and handheld, performance feels great on Switch 2, and bar the odd hiccup as you load into a stage, this is silky smooth stuff, even during busy firefights. It looks perfectly crisp and clear at <em>all times</em>. Add in motion controls for fine-tuning your snipes, a bonus mouse-mode that's fun (I'm still using the normal controls, mind), and you've got a version of Apex Legends that, despite all of its hard-selling of Apex Points and outfits, is very, very hard to pick a hole in.</p>
<p>In fact, Apex Legends redeems itself on Switch 2. This upgraded version gives us 60fps shooting action with crisp, clear resolutions and none of that juddery, unresponsive, blurry stuff we had back in 2021. It's still the best hero shooter/Battle Royale out there for me, with amazingly fluid traversal, best-in-class gunfeel, and a ping system that puts proper teamwork and tactics front and centre. The cherry on top, of course, is that it's free to play, too, so there's no good reason for shooter fans not to dive right in.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/apex-legends]]></content:encoded>

<p>Turn 10 and Playground Games will “continue to support Forza Motorsport and Forza Horizon 5.”</p>



<p>In a post on social media on Thursday, the developers said that they “appreciate the support of [their] incredible community”. They also wanted to make it clear that support for Forza Motorsport and Forza Horizon 5 wasn’t ending. </p>



<p>“We wanted to assure players that Turn 10 and Playground Games will continue to support Forza Motorsport and Forza Horizon 5,” <a href="https://x.com/ForzaMotorsport/status/1953508994581938364" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">they said</a>. </p>



<p>The team <a href="https://forza.net/news/forza-motorsport-update-21-featured-tours#logitech" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">then linked</a> to a post going over what’s coming in the future to Forza Motorsport. Those updates include near featured tours, new cars earned through challenges, and new featured rivals. The new update is scheduled to come on September 4.</p>



<h6 id="h-more-xbox-contraband-development-stopped-at-xbox">More Xbox: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/contraband-development-stopped-at-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Contraband Development Stopped At Xbox</a></h6>



<p>While current support continuing is good news for players, what wasn’t mentioned in the statement, however, was anything regarding the future of the Forza Motorsport series. </p>



<p>After Microsoft’s latest layoffs at Xbox in July, one studio reportedly hit hard was Turn 10 games. According to reports, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/turn-10-studios-loses-nearly-half-of-its-staff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">up to 50% of the team</a> was let go and it was turned into a support studio for the Forza Horizon series with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-motorsport-canceled" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the mainline series being canceled</a>. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming has made numerous efforts to get clarification on the state of the Forza Motorsport franchise but neither Microsoft or Turn 10 have responded to requests for comment.</p>



<p>Forza Horizon 6 is currently in development. Playground Games, the developers of the Forza Horizon series, are also working on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fable-delayed-into-2026-by-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reboot of Fable</a>.</p>



<p>What do you think the future holds for Forza Motorsport? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It appears yet another previously announced game has got the chop by Microsoft with <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lvt7g4p7fs2k">Jason Schreier from Bloomber</a>g reporting that Avalanche Studio’s Contraband has been cancelled.</p>
<p>That has just been confirmed by Avalanche, although they say development has stopped whilw they “evaluate” the project’s future.</p>



<p>Announced during the 2021 Microsoft and Bethesda Showcase with a CGI trailer for the game and&nbsp; very little else.&nbsp; The official version of the reveal trailer has been removed for YouTube, but here’s a copy.</p>
<p><iframe title="Contraband. Teaser 4K" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/71hMe-XsYx0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>“Contraband is our most ambitious game yet and working closely together with Xbox Games Studios has been a great experience,” said Omar Shakir, Game Director at Avalanche Studios at the to,e. “We can’t wait to share more about the game and the world of Bayan.”</p>

<p>“We’re incredibly excited to work together with a partner such as Xbox Game Studios and look forward to laying the foundation for a long-standing partnership,” added Pim Holfve, CEO at Avalanche Studios Group. “With Contraband, we’re taking everything we’ve learned from 18 years of being in the forefront of open world games as well as bringing the knowledge from running successful live game services focusing on our player communities.”</p>
<p>Some leaks did hit the internet over the past few years, it was said to be a mix of PayDay, Battlefield Hardline, Mad Max, and Dukes of Hazard. It was going to be a four and eight player co-op and seemed to pit a team of cops against a team of robbers who are trying to pull off a heist.</p>
<p>A QA tester posted this on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbZxS5WZ_Es">YouTube</a></p>
<p>“I was one of the first employed QA Testers to experience the game and even in the early stages it was hella fun. As of my last experience the vehicles were fully customizable. You could slap on giant off road tires on what looked like a typical 60s muscle car. You also could get covered in mud and even stuck. Though my personal favourite was the land rover style vehicle. It could go anywhere, really fast and could boost plus at the time had a winch. Basically take all the awesome vehicle driving and customization in Mad Max and put it in the game for the vehicle missions.”</p>
<p>“The island design will be super clean. There was talk about licensed music but they already had a lot of music that you would expect to hear in the 70s in south east asia. The main story had four female protagonists and was the main selling point of the game at the time. So I can confirm that it will be four player. Not sure about the eight player but we did have that as an option, we just didn’t have enough people to test it out. When I mean I was one of the first testers, I’m not joking, the team was only four people, a QA Lead, Test Engineer and two testers.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Microsoft has reportedly stopped development on Avalanche Studios co-op game, Contraband. According to a report from <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/breaking-microsoft-stops-development">Stephen Totilo at Game File</a>, development on the open-world co-op title, which was initially <a href="https://wccftech.com/abalanche-studios-contraband-announced-for-pc-xbox-series-xs/">announced in 2021</a>, has been put "<em>on hold</em>" following <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-layoffs-funding-increased-spending-ai-infrastructure/">Microsoft's layoff of 9,000+ employees</a> across the company, with cuts to Xbox's publishing division specifically impacting Contraband's development.</p>



<p>After Contraband was announced in 2021, we heard basically nothing about the game, at least from official channels. There were rumors that it had hit some <a href="https://wccftech.com/contraband-a-ways-off-report-avalanche-shuts-down-multiple-studios/">development struggles and had been delayed</a> into this year, and even those rumors came after<a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-5-xbox-exclusives-before-july-2023/"> speculation that it was supposed to have arrived</a> sometime between 2023 and <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-is-targeting-2025-contraband-might-launch-this-year-says-leaker/">2024</a>.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Contraband - Official Reveal Trailer 4K | E3 2021" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t5qlGpqHggw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>When Microsoft began announcing the its layoffs from last month, cuts which <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-workers-call-out-microsoft-mass-layoffs-inhumane-disgusting/">ZeniMax employees called "<em>inhumane</em>" and <em>"disgusting</em>,"</a> Totilo points out that Contraband's initial announcement trailer had been set to <a href="https://x.com/DestinLegarie/status/1942272038045122595">'Private' on the official Xbox YouTube channel</a>, which added oxygen to the fire of speculation that it had also been cancelled alongside other projects like <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/">Perfect Dark</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/rare-everwild-cancelled-microsoft-gaming-layoffs/">Everwild</a>.</p>



<p>Totilo's report today shows that there are real flames to that fire, though neither Avalanche Studios nor Microsoft have officially commented on the status of Contraband.</p>



<p>Even though Totilo isn't exactly reporting that Contraband has been cancelled, based on how Xbox had no problem leaving behind projects that were based on established series like the aforementioned Perfect Dark reboot, or from its proven first-party teams, like cancelling Rare's Everwild and ZeniMax Online's new MMO that <a href="https://wccftech.com/spencer-reportedly-loved-playing-zenimax-onlines-new-game-in-march-only-to-cancel-it-in-july/">Phil Spencer reportedly loved so much he couldn't put it down</a>, it feels fruitless to hold out hope for a title that was being made by an external studio on which Xbox was the publisher.</p>



<p>Of course, something could happen where Avalanche is able to buy the publishing rights from Xbox and finish the game solely on their own dime, but that's not exactly a common scenario for a game on the scale of Contraband.</p>



<p>When Contraband was announced, Avalanche Studios' chief executive officer called <a href="https://wccftech.com/avalanche-ceo-it-made-sense-to-choose-xbox-for-contraband-due-to-the-grandness-of-the-project/">Xbox the partner that "<em>made sense</em>" for the project</a>, specifically because of how grand the project was going to be. </p>



<p>"<em>It made a lot of sense to work with Xbox on this because of the grandness of the Contraband project. It's not a concept we would pitch to every publisher</em>."</p>



<p>Totilo adds that there are no more layoffs expected for the Xbox publishing division with Contraband put on hold, and hopefully Avalanche Studios is able to move beyond this project pause without losing any of its team members. We'll update you on this story if/when more information becomes available.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>On Tuesday, an Indiana Fever and Los Angeles Sparks WNBA game was <a href="https://www.espn.com/wnba/story/_/id/45911373/sex-toy-tossed-sparks-court-third-incident-7-days">temporarily disrupted after someone tossed a large green dildo</a> at the players on the court. This is the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1760105008213278">third such incident</a> of a sex toy being tossed onto a WNBA court during an active game in the last two weeks. And with some betting markets now taking bets on whether or not a dildo will be tossed at WNBA players at future games, it’s very likely this terrible trend will continue, even as the WNBA reportedly looks to ban fans from bringing bags into venues in an effort to prevent this from happening.</p> <p>The first incident of a dildo being thrown onto a <a href="https://kotaku.com/nba-2k-announces-wnba-players-a-river-of-sexism-follow-1837111136">WNBA</a> court happened on July 29 during a match between the Golden State Valkyries and the Atlanta Dream. Like what happened on Tuesday, a neon green dildo was reportedly thrown onto the court. On August 1, a similar incident involving a sex toy happened during a match between the Valkyries and the Chicago Sky. There are also at least two reports via social media of people attempting to toss dildos onto the court at other WNBA games, but these didn’t make it out of the crowd.&nbsp; However, one of these sex toys, also neon green, reportedly thrown during an <a href="https://x.com/osnapitsari/status/1952914027618943453">August 5 WNBA game in New York City</a>, came close to hitting a child. It’s clear this is becoming a “thing” and players and coaches are understandably frustrated and upset about the situation.</p> <p>“I think it’s ridiculous, it’s dumb, it’s stupid,” Sparks coach Lynne Roberts said after the game on Tuesday. “It’s also dangerous, and players’ safety is number one. Respecting the game. All those things.

Yes, we are living in a timeline where people are betting on whether someone will toss a sex toy at professional female athletes just trying to play basketball. Shit sucks.</p> <p>On August 2, police in College Park, Georgia, arrested 23-year-old Delbert Carver, the man who allegedly tossed the first dildo during the Valkyries/Dream game.&nbsp; According to law enforcement, he <a href="https://www.espn.com/wnba/story/_/id/45901403/wnba-fan-accused-throwing-sex-toy-faces-multiple-charges" target="_blank" rel="noopener">faces counts of disorderly conduct, public indecency, and criminal trespass</a>. In an affidavit, as reported by ESPN, Carver admitted that tossing the dildo onto the court was “supposed to be a joke” and that it was “supposed to go viral.” Sadly, it seems like it has, and copycats are now tossing more green dildos onto WNBA courts.</p> <p>Not only is this dangerous and annoying for players, but throwing sex toys onto the court of a WNBA game is <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a65614990/why-throwing-dildos-wnba-games/">clearly a misogynistic act against these women</a> who dare to be professional athletes. In an era when professional women’s sports are thriving, <a href="https://www.nielsen.com/insights/2023/womens-sports-viewership-on-the-rise/">with high ratings and stars being created</a>, it’s clear some young men, likely fueled by anti-women politics and the horrible online manosphere, feel empowered and even forced to “fight back.” Tossing dildos at women is done to embarrass them and remind them that, according to these shitbags, they are only sex objects who shouldn’t be playing basketball in front of adoring crowds of fans. Hopefully, WNBA security steps things up and we can stop this shit from happening in future games.</p>

We wanted to make a game in which players feel like real investigators of the occult, poring over manuscripts and reference materials by candlelight while the rain beats down outside. We’ve made a game that trusts our players to piece things together for themselves—to delve into the details, to follow the breadcrumbs and to notice what matters. We’re excited for you to play it and discover this cabinet of curiosities for yourselves.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2885870/Strange_Antiquities/" target="_blank">Steam page</a>:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>Become the custodian of a store dealing in occult antiquities. Explore the quaint and gloomy town of Undermere, where strange goings-on and dark mysteries abound. Find and identify arcane artefacts, use your collection to aid the townsfolk with their unusual problems — and remember to pet your cat!</p><p><strong>A Note From the Shopkeeper</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Dear Applicant,</p><p>I am pleased to offer you the role of Apprentice Thaumaturge at Strange Antiquities.</p><p>You show promise—a sharp mind and a strong stomach—exactly what this work demands. I need you to run the shop while I attend to other pressing matters. You will need a keen eye for detail as you provide the townsfolk of Undermere with occult objects for their arcane needs.</p><p>Undermere might seem unassuming at first—a serene little town on the edge of a grand lake. But it also sits at the edge of our world and the world beyond—and it falls on us to preserve reality’s frayed edge.</p><p>Permit me now to outline your duties—you’ll need to be up to speed from day one.</p><p><strong>On Your Duties in the Shop (Gameplay Mechanics)</strong></p><p>Every day, you will welcome new customers into the cosy, candle-lit interior of the shop. Their needs are unpredictable and often alarming, but never dull!</p><ul><li><strong>Study and Identify</strong> – Examine, identify and catalogue strange artefacts. Observation, deduction, and careful reference to our collection of illustrated tomes will serve you well. Mistakes can be… costly.</li><li><strong>Help… Or Hinder</strong> – When dealing with powerful items, your choices matter. Will you help someone with their problem, or curse them with a horrid affliction? In a small town like this, people remember your misdeeds.</li><li><strong>Explore and Discover</strong> – From time to time, you will have to leave the safety of the shop. Whether investigating rumors or retrieving artefacts, my well-loved hand-drawn maps will guide you to where you need to go.</li><li><strong>Solve and Uncover</strong> – Your day-to-day might already feel like a puzzle, but this store holds many more. Few know how old this building is, and fewer still know what secrets lie within its walls.</li><li><strong>Tending the Familiar</strong> – And, of course, <a title="Companies > Jupiter Corporation [31 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/jupiter-corporation">Jupiter</a>, the shop’s cat, demands daily affection. In return for his company, please oblige him with the occasional scratch behind the ears.</li></ul><p><strong>About My Absence (Narrative and Setting)</strong></p><p>These ravens are an omen. There is a sickness in this town and I intend to investigate it.</p><p>Barton Potter told me that his bad eye has been aching again. That can’t be a good sign. And a creeping dark has set up in Jack Hungerford’s house. I have business in Ravenglass but I will consult with the occult scholar, Verona Green, before I leave.</p><p>There are always forces at play that would see our beloved Undermere unmade. We stand between them and the threshold. If events take a turn, you may be called upon to take a stand.</p><p><strong>In Conclusion</strong></p><p>This shop is my life’s work. And, for the most part, it has been good to me. May it now offer you equal parts reward and mystery! But remember: some curiosities are best left untouched, and some visitors are not what they seem.</p><p>I look forward to your arrival.</p><p>Yours,<br>Eli White<br>Thaumaturge &amp; Proprietor<br>Strange Antiquities, Undermere<br>Purveyors of the Arcane Since 1683</p><p><strong>A Note from the Developers</strong></p><p>We are two brothers from the United Kingdom who have been making games together for over a decade. In 2022, we released our occult puzzle game <em>Strange Horticulture</em>, and the response has been incredible; from amazing reviews and award nominations to appearing in numerous best-of-the-year lists. Most importantly, it has been a joy to read the kind words left by so many of our players on Steam, where we are still rated Overwhelmingly Positive after close to 12,000 reviews!</p><p><em>Strange Antiquities</em> is not a sequel, not a direct one, at least. You’ll see some familiar faces, and maybe some plants will pop up, but it’s a brand new story. If you have a fondness for <em>Strange Horticulture</em> and the dark, but welcoming world we’ve created, know that you’ll feel right at home.</p><p>We want to thank everyone who has played <em>Strange Horticulture</em>, left us a review, told their friends, or supported the game in any way. It has been an amazing journey and we can’t wait to share the next chapter with you.</p><p>Many thanks,<br>Rob and John</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Strange Antiquities - Date Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ylk4JVnt2HA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/strange-antiquities-launches-september-17-for-switch-pc]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wait-are-we-not-all-keeping-our-pcs-on-top-of-our-desks.1264905/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Look, I’m on the record as <a href="https://aftermath.site/i-dont-understand-my-pc-which-i-built" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not being that great at being a PC owner</a>, but there is one thing I thought I knew: you keep your PC tower on top of your desk. This is for a variety of very normal and sensible reasons that I thought we all agreed to, but apparently not.</p><p>This question, which I thought firmly settled, was re-opened last night when Luke <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/lukeplunkett.com/post/3lvrmpaweqc2x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted to Bluesky</a> that he’d gotten a new PC (he gets them pre-built, unlike me, an <a href="https://aftermath.site/i-bought-the-wrong-graphics-card-and-i-am-full-of-regret" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">idiot</a>). Aftermath pal and <a href="https://aftermath.site/indulge-us-behind-the-scenes-of-aftermaths-branding" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">logo designer</a> Andrew Elmore <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/elmore.zone/post/3lvrqoprxmk2c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">replied</a> to praise Luke for “putting that sumbitch down under the desk where it belongs.”</p><p>But <em>does</em> it belong there? I have kept my PC on top of my desk since Kotaku ran an article in <a href="https://kotaku.com/console-repairmen-explain-why-cockroaches-love-ps4s-1794393470" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2018</a> about roaches getting into PS4s. “Warm, in an enclosed space and close to the floor, PS4s are great roach nesting grounds,” the article reads.</p><p>What else is warm and close to the floor? My PC tower, which is full of little holes and crannies perfect for roaches to get inside. I live in New York City, in an apartment above a bar; I wouldn’t say I have ever actively had a roach <em>problem</em>, but I definitely see those horrible giant ones from time to time, and I have occasional bursts of little roach activity when the weather changes, alongside the infrequent mouse. One of the worst realizations I had when I started living alone was that any pest in my apartment is <em>always</em> my problem, even if it goes into another room; it doesn't automatically become a roommate's problem once I can't see it anymore, because <em>I </em>own all the rooms. This makes me more anxious about pests than I was when I had roommates to come rescue me from them, so I take extra precautions, like keeping my PC on my desktop. I don’t want to deal with roaches or mice in my PC, and the easiest way to not have to deal with that horrible possibility is to keep it out of their reach.</p><p>Plus, the desk is cleaner than the floor! The floor is where all the dust and dirt goes to live, and where it could easily be sucked or swept into my PC tower. When my PC lives on my desk, I don’t have to worry about floor shit getting inside it. I also don’t have to worry about accidentally kicking or sweeping or vacuuming it when I clean, inadvertently damaging its many expensive, precariously-installed parts.</p><p>Of course, the desk isn’t the most efficient place for my PC to be. I’ll admit it takes up a lot of space. Especially now that I have a <a href="https://aftermath.site/iem-recommendation-hardware-regret" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">giant microphone</a> and its attendant gadgets, real estate is tight. I keep my tower on the same side as my mouse because it’s closest to an available outlet, so I do occasionally butt up against it when I’m playing games. But it also helps me manage space; I currently keep my ring light and my controller on top of it, and I sometimes put things I don’t want to lose up there too, like the case for my running headphones. Its top can serve as extra desk space, to offset the space it takes up.</p><p>Are you heathens keeping your PCs on the floor? Are your houses just cleaner or less pest-prone than mine? Are you better equipped to stave off the sudden burst of anxiety that something might get in there? I thought we were in agreement on this. What the hell, guys?</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/merge-maestro-addictive-roguelite-ios-puzzle-game"><h3>Oh No, Merge Maestro Is Going To Be A Problem</h3></a><p>Merge Maestro is an addictive, deck builder that's easy to pick up and surprisingly complex.

<figure><a title="Mina the Hollower" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/78b01dc5b84de/mina-the-hollower.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Yacht Club Games</em></figcaption></figure><p>Yacht Club Games kicked off today's Indie World showcase strongly by announcing that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mina-the-hollower">Mina the Hollower</a> is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/mina-the-hollower-yacht-clubs-retro-zelda-inspired-adventure-scores-switch-2-release-date">coming to both Switch 1 and Switch 2 on 31st October 2025</a>. And you might be wondering, <em>'what does a Switch 2 version of a pixel art game entail?'</em> Well, let us — and the developer — inform you.</p>
<p>In a blog post on <a href="https://www.yachtclubgames.com/blog/mina-the-hollower-launches-on-nintendo-switch-1-2-on-oct-31-play-the-demo-now-/">Yacht Club Games' website</a>, the team confirmed that the Switch 2 version of the game supports 120fps, an extremely tasty prospect for those with the new console. You can also spy 120hz and HDR output <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/mina-the-hollower-switch-2/">at the bottom of the eShop page</a>. And hey, there's a native Switch 2 demo, so that's worth checking out.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://youtu.be/Em_IP-6snrs?si=cpGJ6X0nKTk6ngyn">our friends over at GVG have a comparison video</a> of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/mina_the_hollower">Switch 1</a>'s 60fps release and the Switch 2's 120. Have a watch of it below.</p>

<p>And, since Mina the Hollower is all about a mouse, it would make sense to have <em>some</em> kind of mouse compatibility, right? Well, fear not, as Yacht Club Games seems to be teasing <em>something</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In Mina the Hollower, you ARE the mouse! But we heard that if you turn your Joy-Con 2 on its side while playing and move it around, <em>something</em> may happen.."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, well, well... Yacht Club Games is the Big Cheese of the retro throwback, so we expect great things, especially given that this one's clearly inspired by the top-down Game Boy Color games of the early '90s.</p>
<p><em>Will you be getting Mina the Hollower on Switch 1 or Switch 2? Let us know in the comments</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Battlefield 6 beta commenced earlier today, and it has been skyrocketing all day in social and streaming circles. The game has become one of the most highly anticipated first-person shooters to emerge in several years, and it’s looking like a strong turning point for a series that has found itself on rocky ground for almost a decade.</p>



<p>As the beta unravels, scores of fans are taking to Twitch and YouTube to watch streams as they await the <strong>open portion </strong>of the beta to kick off. As I write this, almost 850,000 people are watching the beta on <strong>Twitch alone</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-huge-numbers">Huge Numbers</h2>



<p>Battlefield 6 is being played by some of the most prolific streamers in the world right now, and they’re pulling in gargantuan numbers. At the time of publishing, the Battlefield 6 beta had 830,000 live viewers, which is something of a stunning record for the series.</p>



<p>Not only is it the most-watched Battlefield game ever released (not that it’s released yet), but it’s also effortlessly beating the peak viewership count for <strong>every major Call of Duty game ever</strong>, bar Call of Duty: Warzone.</p>



<p>Only the battle royale game stands between Battlefield 6 and total dominance.</p>



<p>For reference, here’s the ranking for peak viewer counts on Twitch:</p>



<ul>
<li>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III – 444,866</li>



<li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 – 481,586</li>



<li>Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War – 705,050</li>



<li>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II – 751,937</li>



<li><strong>Battlefield 6 – 844,723</strong></li>



<li>Call of Duty: Warzone – 1,613,626</li>
</ul>



<p>As the weekend approaches, could we see Battlefield 6 threaten Warzone’s record?</p>



<p>It’s worth stressing that Battlefield 6’s highest peak has also topped Rainbow Six Siege (583,166), Overwatch (634,296), Escape from Tarkov (566,684), and PUBG (597,663).</p>



<p>This is one heck of a high-performing game, and we’re on the first day of the beta. The sky might just be the limit for Battlefield 6.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Madden 26 is out now for Deluxe Edition owners, but Xbox users are having issues getting access to the game. </p>



<p>A quick search on social media—or a visit to my DMs—shows a number of players don’t have access to the game they purchased if they got it as part of the EA Sports MVP Bundle that included both Madden 26 and College Football 26. </p>



<p>The specific issue is that the game is showing as unowned. </p>



<p><strong>“For our Xbox MVP Bundle owners, we’re aware of an issue some are experiencing where they’re unable to access the game,” </strong>the <a href="https://x.com/MaddenNFLDirect/status/1953495214695338229" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Madden team posted</a>. <strong>“We’re working closely with Microsoft and plan to resolve this as soon as possible.”</strong></p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>For our Xbox MVP Bundle owners, we’re aware of an issue some are experiencing where they’re unable to access the game.</p><p>We’re working closely with Microsoft and plan to resolve this as soon as possible.</p><p>Updates will be threaded below as needed!</p></div>— MaddenNFLDirect (@MaddenNFLDirect) <a href="https://twitter.com/MaddenNFLDirect/status/1953495214695338229?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 7, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>One work around is that if you have EA Play, you can download the 10-hour trial. After that download completes, it <em>should </em>show that you own the full game and you’ll be all set. </p>

<p>If you don’t have EA Play or the workaround doesn’t work, you’ll have to simply wait for an update from EA and Microsoft on the matter.</p>



<p>Madden 26 is also available for PlayStation 5, PC, and Nintendo Switch 2. Those who bought the Standard Edition of the game have to wait until August 14 to play.</p>



<p>Have you had any issues accessing Madden 26 on Xbox or other consoles? Let us know down below, and take the discussion further in the official Insider Gaming forums.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> has been out for over two months now, which means players have had ample time to puzzle over and tease out every morsel of its lore. But there's still one ultra-rare item in the game that most players have probably never seen before, but which some in the community believe still holds an enormous secret: the Cord End.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you play Nightreign and, like me, had no idea what this even was until just now, here's the rundown: the Cord End is a legendary consumable item that only appears in big and small churches in Nightreign from breaking boxes. Its drop percentage is ridiculously low - just 0.035% - meaning most players will likely never even run into it. Its listed use is cryptic: "Gain entry somewhere." If you don't know where that somewhere is, the item is totally useless to you.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But for those in the know (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Use_Cord_End_in_Nightreign_for_Secret_Door">or those following our handy guide</a>), it's not too hard to find the secret door it opens. Hidden in a cliff wall in a ravine at the center of the map, there's a sealed entrance that only opens if you have the Cord End on hand. Inside is a strange statue of a girl, and three Sacrificial Twigs, talismans that allow the wielder to die exactly one time without losing runes or levels. It's an interesting reward, to be sure, but admittedly a little underwhelming given the ridiculous rarity of the Cord End required to get them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, granted, it's likely at least part of the Cord End's mystery is in adding lore details to Elden Ring Nightreign via its description and the statue of the girl in the chamber it opens. We won't cover that here, as the meaning behind it is pretty deep into endgame spoiler territory for Nightreign, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9FXm1IEwHY" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lore YouTuber VaatiVidya</a> has a great breakdown of what the Cord End is from a lore perspective and why it matters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But that all said, the lack of real mechanical payoff for such a rare find has players speculating that there's something more to this secret door. For the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1l7j5m9/follow_up_to_my_sacrificial_twig_theory/?share_id=LXYt4Qg7gPNfE7Cg27Cpo&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">last two months</a>, the community has been testing out theories around the Cord End and the Sacrificial Twigs. With a lack of any new or recent clues, the secret hunting had largely slowed down, but a cryptic post on the Nightreign subreddit recently fired up everyone's curiosity again, inspiring people to float new theories about how to do... something... with those twigs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The biggest barrier to finding anything is the sheer rarity of the Cord End. Some players are reporting <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1mft3jp/after_exactly_222_hours_got_my_first_cord/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">seeing their first one</a> after hundreds of hours of play. So anyone who wants to test theories has to get extremely lucky in actually getting a Cord End to begin with, and then also getting the exact perfect other circumstances they're looking for (specific bosses, certain locations appearing, certain characters in the party, and so forth) to test out whatever it is they want to test. So while it's unlikely that there's anything new to discover regarding the Cord End at this stage, there's at least a whisper of possibility in the fact that so few people are in a position to make that discovery to begin with.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Is it a secret? Is it merely lore? Is it something we'll be able to unlock in a future DLC, as some have theorized? Who knows! But what's genuinely cool here is that an ultra rare item is still sparking this level of curiosity and discussion and mystery in the community months after the game's release. Whether there's anything deeper to the Cord End or not, its enticing rarity is sufficient to get me, at least, fired up... if I can ever get one to drop.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We gave Elden Ring Nightreign a 7/10, saying that "when Elden Ring Nightreign is played exactly as it was designed to be played, it’s one of the finest examples of a three-player co-op game around – but that's harder to do than it should be, and playing solo is poorly balanced." Nightreign <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-finally-gets-duos-mode-with-patch-102-game-balance-adjusts-to-the-current-number-of-players">recently saw the addition of a duos mode</a>, and the game had <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-developer-thanks-fans-as-nightreign-and-shadow-of-the-erdtree-top-new-sales-milestones">sold five million copies</a> as of July.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

Alternatively, the premium Xbox Ally X will cost €899 (US prices to be confirmed).</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Dealabs cautions that this release date has only been verified via its sources for the machine's European launch — so there may still be some slight difference here for other markets, though likely not by much.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft is set to showcase more of the ROG Xbox Ally this month at Gamescom, with the handheld available to try publicly on Microsoft's trade show booth, alongside the highly-anticipated <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But whether this gives us a firmer grasp on Silksong's elusive release date remains uncertain. During June's Xbox Games Showcase 2025, Xbox president Sarah Bond stated that Silksong would be "available at launch and in Game Pass when Ally releases later this year" — leading many fans to believe the game was being lined up to arrive as a launch title for the handheld.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Hollow Knight: Silksong 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">However, writing on the game's official Discord, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-developer-responds-to-release-date-confusion-promises-launch-before-holiday-not-tied-to-xbox-handheld-arrival">Silksong developer Team Cherry subsequently clarified that the game was not sat waiting for the ROG Ally X to launch</a>. Instead, according to marketing manager Matthew 'Leth' Griffin wrote, fans should simply expect the game to arrive before the holidays.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I confirmed BEFORE Holiday," Griffin wrote, adding: "we are not tied to a console release." And just in case of confusion, when asked which holiday he was referring to, Griffin added: "Christmas yes."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-has-a-new-hollow-knight-silksong-demo-playable-at-gamescom">Silksong will be playable at Gamescom</a> on both the Xbox and Nintendo booths, in a big marketing push.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> has made an annual tradition out of adding horror icons as skins each October when spooky season rolls in. Last year it was Leatherface and Billy the Puppet, the year before that it was Michael Myers and Jack Skellington, and the year before that brought us Ash Williams. But it's looking like those lineups might pale in comparison to what's in store for us this year, as dataminers have collected evidence that both Jason Voorhees from Friday the 13th and Ghostface from Scream will be coming for us all during this year's Fortnitemares in October.</p><p>While no one has actually seen these alleged Ghostface and Jason Voorhees skins, some compelling evidence was found in the Fortnite game files with the new season update. For Jason, leakers found references to <a href="https://x.com/wensoing/status/1953356200487092312?s=46" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a new medallion named after him</a>, which is pretty clear cut. The evidence is slightly more circumspect for Ghostface--there's data about a new mythic item called a <a href="https://x.com/Wensoing/status/1953353415762776514" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"Stalker Knife"</a> which seems very much like it would fit with a Scream collab. That could instead be related to the existing Michael Myers collab, but Fortnite usually reserves new mythics for <em>new</em> collabs, not returning ones.</p><p>Regardless of what the reality actually is, it'll probably be a couple months before these rumors are officially confirmed or shut down, since Fortnitemares won't start until October anyway. In the meantime, though, there's plenty of new content to consume in Fortnite, what with the simultaneous launches of the new seasons of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-chapter-6-season-4-battle-pass-all-skins-and-rewards/2900-6856/" data-ref-id="2900-6856">Battle Royale</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-og-pass-season-5-all-skins-and-rewards/2900-6862/" data-ref-id="2900-6862">OG</a>.

                <p>Microsoft's wave of game cancellations continues today with the news that Just Cause developer Avalanche's day-one Game Pass release Contraband has been cancelled.

The announcement trailer used Steely Dan's "Do It Again," which debuted in the early '70s.</p><p>There <a href="https://avalanchestudios.com/jobs/1a5e9e06-029f-4f0f-81b0-5add9ff60c45" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">continues to be open positions posted on the company's website for Contraband</a>, but it's possible they will be removed in due time. The same could be true for the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/contraband" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official Contraband pages on Xbox.com</a> and <a href="https://avalanchestudios.com/games/contraband" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Avalanche's website that are still live</a>. </p><p>The reported cancellation of Contraband comes not long after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/" data-ref-id="2900-6726">Microsoft laid off 9,000 people, including cuts to Xbox</a> that led the other game cancellations and at least one studio closure. At the time, it was reported that Microsoft was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-and-quake-veterans-new-fps-loses-funding-with-microsoft-seemingly-to-blame/1100-6532939/" data-ref-id="1100-6532939">executing a portfolio review</a>, with some games not going forward or losing funding. Schreier said today, August 7, that Hideo Kojima's new game, OD, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lvt7yagsrk2d" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">remains in development.</a></p><p>Other games that got canceled recently at Xbox include Rare's Everwild, the Perfect Dark reboot (which also saw its studio shutter), and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-details-emerge-about-elder-scrolls-online-teams-reportedly-canceled-mmo/1100-6533760/" data-ref-id="1100-6533760">reportedly a new MMO from ZeniMax Online Studios.</a></p><p>Microsoft made these dramatic cuts even as its business was booming, a fact that CEO Satya Nadella acknowledged and said was due to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/what-microsofts-ceo-told-employees-about-ai-and-future-of-company-after-mass-layoffs/1100-6533420/" data-ref-id="1100-6533420">"enigma of success."</a> The cuts came at a time when Microsoft invests heavily in AI, with the company recently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/31/business/dealbook/meta-microsoft-ai-spending-shares.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pledging $120 billion</a>, up from $80 billion, to AI spending.</p>

Now, it looks like Blizzard will be making some major changes to the livestream's format.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/PezRadar/status/1951783322247688519" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><div dir="ltr"><p>S10 PTR is still a few weeks out.

But when the Season 10 Campfire Chat does arrive, it sounds like it will be different than what fans have become accustomed to.</p><p dir="ltr">"We are doing a big revamp for streams going forward to change up the format," Fletcher said. "Will have some adjustments on how we do PTR streams as well. The streams need some adjustments after a few years and [have] been wanting to readjust to better serve players."</p><p dir="ltr">This is all coming ahead of Season 10, which is at the end of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-2025-roadmap-highlights-new-crossovers-endgame-updates/1100-6530666/" data-ref-id="1100-6530666">Diablo 4's 2025 content roadmap</a> and is largely shrouded in mystery aside from the fact that it will bring updates to the game's Infernal Hordes endgame activity and introduce a new IP crossover.</p><p dir="ltr">Fletcher said earlier this summer that the Diablo team had heard the "warcries of wanting more change" from players, and that Blizzard "has been cooking" on bigger changes asked for by the community. What exactly those changes will be, and whether they will arrive alongside Season 10, are still unknown. However, a recent meeting attended by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-content-creators-just-got-a-secret-glimpse-of-the-games-future/1100-6533139/" data-ref-id="1100-6533139">Diablo content creators regarding Diablo 4's future</a> seems to imply some major changes are imminent.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4s-second-expansion-isnt-coming-until-2026/1100-6529452/" data-ref-id="1100-6529452">Diablo 4 is set to receive its second expansion</a> in 2026.

For context, the structural reform could be related to Bungie's Creative Studios </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/bungie-creative-leadership-team-integrated-into-playstation-studios-as-live-service-support-team">becoming fully integrated</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> with PlayStation Studios in October of last year, although Sony Interactive Entertainment also had a substantial </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-expectations-for-us-are-high-new-playstation-ceos-outline-their-vision-of-the-future">leadership shake-up</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The conversation started after an investor asked Sony to provide an update on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Marathon</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, after Bungie delayed it in June of this year </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/bungie-delays-marathon-after-tumultuous-early-reception-and-discovery-of-plagiarized-assets">following a tumultuous early reception</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, both internally and externally.

        <p>Announcement reportedly due at Gamescom.</p>

            <p>
ASUS' Xbox-branded ROG Ally - perhaps the closest we'll get to an official Xbox gaming handheld anytime soon, if recent reports are true - launches this October, says a reliable leaker.
</p>
<p>
Specifically, it's claimed ASUS is targeting a 16th October European release date for the Xbox ROG Ally and its beefier-specced sibling, the Xbox ROG Ally X. That's <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/rog-xbox-ally-on-connait-enfin-la-date-exacte-de-sortie-60340">according to Dealab's Billbil-kun</a>, who has a long history of accurate leaks.
</p>
<p>
Both machines were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsofts-xbox-branded-asus-handheld-finally-gets-an-official-reveal">officially unveiled in June</a>, when it was confirmed the Xbox ROG Ally would include an AMD Ryzen Z2 A processor alongside 16GB of RAM and 512GB of SSD storage, while the Ally X - described as a machine for "the most demanding players" - features an AMD Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme processor and 24GB of high-speed RAM.

<p>
At the time, ASUS would only say the machines were launching this "holiday" across select countries including the UK and US, and other details were limited. However, Billbil-kun recently claimed the Xbox ROG Ally will cost €599 (around £520), while the Xbox ROG Ally X variant is said to be priced at €899 (approximately £780). Pre-orders for both machines will reportedly begin on 20th August, with an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-handheld-consoles-rog-ally-and-ally-x-preorders-open-during-gamescom-report-says">official announcement expected during Microsoft's Gamescom showcase</a>, which begins at 2pm BST on the same day.
</p>
<p>
The Xbox ROG Ally and ROG Ally X, as we learned previously, are both powered by Windows 11, include a full-screen Xbox interface, and feature an aggregated gaming library with access to installed games from a range of PC stores, including Steam, Battle.net, and GOG. And, of course, the machines support Xbox Play Anywhere titles.
</p>
<p>
Xbox boss <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phil-spencer-discusses-potential-xbox-handheld-plans">long teased Microsoft's plans for an official Xbox gaming handheld</a>, and reports earlier this year suggested the company had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-next-gen-console-reportedly-targeting-2027-with-handheld-device-due-this-year">settled on a multi-pronged strategy</a> that would initially see it partner with a third-party to launch an Xbox-branded portable machine before the end of 2025 while it worked on its own in-house project to release sometime in 2027. However, later reports <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsofts-xbox-handheld-reportedly-sidelined-as-it-focuses-on-third-party-portable-devices">claimed a change in strategy</a>, with Windows Central saying Microsoft's internal handheld project had been "sidelined" in favour of more third-party partnerships, while The Verge went further, calling the project "essentially cancelled".
</p>
<p>
Curiously, however, Xbox president Sarah Bond <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-says-its-working-on-next-gen-xbox-consoles-youll-play-in-your-living-room-and-in-your-hands">recently announced the company was partnering with AMD</a> to "co-engineer silicon across a portfolio of devices including our next-generation Xbox consoles in your living room and in your hands". For now though, the only certainty is ASUS' handhelds, and we should get a confirmed release date very soon.

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/07/amon-is-borderlands-4s-axe-chucking-vault-hunter/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amon-is-borderlands-4%E2%80%99s-axe-chucking-vault-hunter-and-here%E2%80%99s-a-gameplay-overview.1264821/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Gearbox has put the spotlight on the beefcakiest of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> Vault Hunters, Amon the Forgeknight, showing off the character’s axe chucking abilities and role as the frontline tank of the party.</p>
<p><iframe title="Borderlands 4 - Official Gameplay Overview - Amon" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4lCbxjy0zI4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>As a Forgeknight, Amon can draw upon drones to quickly craft the weapons and gear that he needs. This includes a Forgehammer to smash enemies with, Forgeaxes to throw at and slice enemies, a Forgeshield to soak up damage, and more.</p>
<p>These Action Skillsdepend on which of the three skill trees you’ve levelled up, though, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Crucible (Cybernetics skill tree) – Wield the elemental might of fire and ice with Amon’s twin Forgeaxes, which deal Incendiary or Cryo damage by default, have multiple charges, and can be picked up to reduce their cooldown. The Forgeaxes make any damaged target Primed, causing them to explode in a damaging, bloody mess when killed.</li>
<li>Scourge (Vengeance skill tree) – Charge headlong into the fray as Amon summons his Forgeshield, which will soak up incoming damage and fill up a Vengeance Meter. Once you’ve absorbed the brunt of the incoming hurt, you can return the favor by firing back a Forgewave that consumes Vengeance to deal freezing Cryo damage.</li>
<li>Onslaughter (Calamity skill tree) – Wallop your foes in the face with Amon’s Forgefist, which dashes to your target to unleash an explosive Rocket Punch. The force of this Incendiary Melee Damage impact will Stagger most enemies, leaving them dazed so you can finish them off with a flurry of bullets.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/game-info/vault-hunters/amon/">view each tree in depth here</a>.</p>

<p>But here’s the thing. Amon’s Forgeskill trait gives him a secondary Action Skill, which comes with a separate cooldown, so you can really bounce back and forth between them. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Double-Edge (Crucible Action Skill equipped) – Throw a twinned Forgeaxe, dealing Cryo Damage to enemies it passes through and returning to Amon, dealing Incendiary Melee Damage on the way back.</li>
<li>Firewall (Scourge Action Skill equipped) – Deploy a Firewall that absorbs enemy projectiles, and grants friendly projectiles that pass through it increased damage and velocity. Absorbed damage is converted into Vengeance if Scourge is active, and enemies near Firewall get burned with Incendiary damage over time.</li>
<li>Molten Slam (Onslaughter Action Skill equipped) – Slam a Molten Forgehammer into the ground, dealing Incendiary damage to enemies in a large area.</li>
</ul>
<p>Amon is the third character that Gearbox has released a deep dive on, following on from <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/news/vex-spotlight/">Vex the Siren</a> and <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/news/rafa-spotlight/">Rafa the Exo-Soldier.</a> There’s just Harlowe the Gravitar to go, which will doubtless be coming soon, what with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/29/borderlands-4-gameplay-state-of-play-is-airing-tomorrow-30th-april-release-date-moved-forward/">Borderlands 4’s release date being set for 12th September</a>. There’s not much time left!</p>

<p>Reef Entertainment has released a new overview trailer for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/terminator_2d_no_fate">Terminator 2D: No Fate</a>, and sorry, but we know you're all excited for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Silksong</a> and whatnot, but this looks <em>bloody amazing</em>.</p>
<p>Clocking in at just over three minutes, the trailer takes us through some of the levels you'll be exploring, the types of gameplay at hand, and the modes available at launch. You can go through the campaign as standard, partake in a boss rush mode, an infinite mode, or an arcade mode to really get those nostalgia juices flowing.</p>
<p>Gameplay will be a mix of stealth and full-on action, with supplies hidden throughout the levels to aid in your progress. Multiple difficulty modes will also be available, including 'Easy Money', 'No Problemo', 'Hasta la Vista', and 'Judgement Day'. You know we're going straight for the latter.</p>
<p>Terminator 2D: No Fate launches on the Switch on <strong>31st October 2025</strong>. It's a bit odd that the trailer didn't include the Switch box art at the end, but we suspect there's some promotional campaign in place with Sony / PlayStation. Nothing to panic about.</p>
<p>We recently spoke to the developers behind the new title, so if you want a bit more information on what to expect and how the team came up with the project, be sure to check it out.</p>
