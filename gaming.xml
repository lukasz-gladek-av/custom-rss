<p>According to some folks in Japan, however (thanks, <a href="https://nintendosoup.com/japanese-users-complain-about-overheating-nintendo-switch-2-consoles-and-noisy-fans/">Nintendo Soup</a>), their consoles are actually overheating. Multiple users have taken to X to relay instances in which their games have crashed, the consoles' fans have gone into overdrive, or, in one case, their system simply became too hot to hold.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067gmupnx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>User <a href="https://x.com/x1010_q" tabindex="-1">@x1010_q</a> stated (via machine translation) "Switch 2 overheating. Too intense, I couldn’t even hold the console. Without a fan, you can’t play for long". Meanwhile, <a href="https://x.com/JPSjxSmUMy170" tabindex="-1">@JPSjxSmUMy170</a> simply said "Switch 2 is overheating; the fan noise is annoying".</p>
<p>It's not entirely clear whether the Switch 2 consoles are definitely, irrefutably overheating in these cases, however. As demonstrated with <a href="https://x.com/p_typhoon" tabindex="-1">@p_typhoon</a>'s tweet below, they merely mention that "The fan's going nuts" after an instance of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</a> crashing, but we can't say for sure that this is the route cause:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>First freeze on Switch 2.<br>
Talked to an old man in Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma, and it froze.<br>
The screen's still moving (background grass swaying in the wind), but I can't control anything.<br>
The fan's going nuts, so maybe it's overheating.<br>
Auto-save saved my butt...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's also important to keep in mind the environmental conditions in which the Switch 2 is being played. <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68567/~/nintendo-switch%26nbsp%3B2-dock-becomes-hot-and-stops-outputting-to-tv-or-charging">Nintendo itself advises</a> that users should "not place the console near a heat source, or in a location where heat can easily build up", while also ensuring that "the air vent on the dock is not covered or obstructed".</p>
<p>So this is clearly a <em>potential</em> issue that Nintendo is very much aware of. We can certainly attest to the console getting rather warm after a certain amount of time but – touch wood – we've not yet had any instances of the Switch 2 overheating.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>NetEase Games made a lot of significant <a href="https://wccftech.com/once-human-exceeds-230000-peak-players-since-release-devs-tease-major-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Once Human</a> announcements during yesterday's Global Annual Showcase. Annual version 2.0 is now available and every player can claim 11 Lightforge Ingots for free by participating in the new events and completing tasks. Players can earn additional rewards through in-game activities, such as playing the Dreamland Wonder mini-games, rescuing the giant Chefosaurus Rex, and checking in daily.</p>



<p>The developers also launched a new PvE scenario called Endless Dream. It's a Nightmare-themed world filled with bizarre, psychedelic elements, such as CRT TVs and abandoned amusement parks. This haunted, odd world is filled with secrets waiting to be uncovered.</p>



<p>The entire world map is available from the start in Endless Dream. This strange world is a shattered reflection of the subconscious, divided into Dream Zones and Nightmare Areas. To survive, players must face supernatural environmental hazards and be wary of the new Confusion mechanic.</p>



<p>Those who wish to purify the Dream Zones must contend with their guardians: Light Dreamers, Deep Dreamers, and the most lethal of all, Eternal Dreamers. These new Deviants include Agony, a humanoid/transformer hybrid that emits electricity; Misery, a statue with flowers growing within its body that attacks by detonating itself; and Naivety, an adorable teddy bear with a haunted TV in its belly.</p>



<p>Once Human players have the power to shape the land in the Endless Dream. They can freely build offensive and defensive structures without territorial restrictions. Exploring the world and conquering its nightmares unlocks additional traits and influences the outcome through a real-time, five-stage dynamic progression based on how efficiently players purge the nightmares. This results in one of multiple endings.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>NetEase also provided updates on console ports and a spin-off. When it comes to consoles, Once Human is set to launch in 2026 on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X, with the ports nearing completion.</p>



<p>As for the PvP spin-off, Once Human: RaidZone is set to launch on July 30 and it's all about combat. Players start with nothing and must gather weapons and building materials from the land. Forming alliances with other players is necessary, but only temporary. You must pick your allies carefully and be ready to turn on them when needed.</p>



<p>The entire RaidZone map is unrestricted, and players can strike each other's bases at any time. The Deviation Powers from the base game have also been reworked for the PvP experience, so players can unleash the might of Deviations on their foes.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/some-switch-2-units-are-overheating/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/some-switch-2-units-are-overheating-according-to-reports.1235811/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to several <a href="https://nintendosoup.com/japanese-users-complain-about-overheating-nintendo-switch-2-consoles-and-noisy-fans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reports</a>, most of which are coming from Japan, some Nintendo Switch 2 units may be overheating. At least, that's what users are assuming when they see sudden freezes and crashes while the console's fans run at max speed in the vain attempt to cool down the hardware.</p>



<p>This happens with all kinds of Nintendo Switch 2 games, from the most taxing ones like CD Projekt RED's Cyberpunk 2077 to way less complex titles like Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma.</p>



<p>A few reports came in from Western gamers, too. Reddit user NitroWalrus732 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Switch/comments/1l4918o/switch_2_overheating/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=post_body&amp;embed_host_url=https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/handheld-gaming/nintendo-switch-2-units-allegedly-overheating-users-report-issues-while-playing-cyberpunk-2077-and-less-power-hungry-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a>:</p>



<p><em>I've had my Switch 2 display a message saying that the system was overheating and entering sleep mode twice now, both times while playing Tears of the Kingdom Switch 2 Edition docked. I was also running at 2k resolution which probably wasn't helping but this is still worrying. Anybody else experienced this? Wondering if I could have a faulty system or maybe TotK is just that intensive.</em></p>



<p>If you're experiencing similar issues, there's not much that you can do except clean the air vents and turn off the console for a while to let it cool down. If the issues persist, you should send it to Nintendo for repair.</p>



<p>Regardless of such problems, the Nintendo Switch 2 continues to sell extremely well. According to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-likely-sold-more-than-5-million-units-in-june/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest estimates</a>, the hybrid handheld/home console may have surpassed 5 million units sold in June, although these are not official figures. Nintendo's own fiscal year forecast of 15 million units should be easily beaten by March 2026.</p>

It also unlocks in-game content for Donkey Kong Bananza. Most notably, this includes the Diva Dress costume for Pauline, which grants the ability to make the appearance of discs after defeating an enemy twice as likely. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What’s more, the Diva Dress is very noticeably styled after Pauline’s dress in Super Mario Odyssey, likely to further <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-developer-finally-confirmed-by-nintendo-sparking-questions-over-when-switch-2s-3d-mario-will-arrive"><u>speculation that Donkey Kong Bananza is indeed a prequel to the 2017 hit Mario game</u></a>, especially since both games have been made by the same team.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But that’s not all. By scanning either the new DK-Pauline amiibo, the Power-Up Bands from Super Nintendo World, or any of the other Donkey Kong series amiibo; solo Donkey Kong, Diddy Kong, King K. Rool, etc; gold “KONG” tiles with explosive power will appear. You can hurl these during gameplay to wreak extra havoc in the game’s many environments, and add an extra tactical edge to DK’s new adventure.</p></div><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Featured in this article</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo also confirmed during its dedicated <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVUidGTR8xg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Donkey Kong Bananza Direct</u></a> that the game supports every previously released amiibo. Scanning non-DK series figures will instead get you giant material balls, which you can also make DK throw to traverse certain stages.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Preorders on the My Nintendo Store UK include standard delivery for £1.99 or free shipping if your order hits £20 or more. If you were planning on ordering any other DK figures (like those above), or games, like the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-pokemon-legends-z-a-preorders-exclusive-mega-evolution-bundle-uk"><u>various bundles for Pokemon Legends: Z-A</u></a>, you may as preorder one of those now and save yourself a few pounds. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve checked by adding both items to my basket testing the checkout and, even though Pokemon Legends: Z-A is releasing later than the Donkey Kong &amp; Pauline amiibo on October 16 (meaning both will arrive via separate deliveries), shipping will still be free for the entire order.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The amiibo announcement follows a jam-packed Nintendo Direct showcasing Donkey Kong Bananza’s return to 3D platforming. New features include wild Bananza transformations, skill trees, a costume shop, and the creative DK Artist Mode where players sculpt and paint items and characters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Donkey Kong Bananza drops in just a couple of weeks, and with this amiibo, you’ll be more than ready to swing into action and have a cool figure in your display.</p></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jul 4, 2025 7:28 am</p></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-pauline-amiibo-up-for-uk-preorder-at-1699-with-bananza-bonuses]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Following "careful consideration", publisher EA and developer BioWare are shutting down Anthem in January.</p>
<p>Bioware is taking the servers for the beleaguered multiplayer shooter offline on 12th January, 2026. Given that it is a fully online game, and requires an internet connection to play, this means it won't be available in any way, shape or form beyond that date.</p>
<p>As of now, Anthem players will not be able to purchase any in-game currency. Instead, players will need to use up the last of their already acquired in-game funds, as the Bioware team gets ready to sunset the servers.</p>

<p>Anthem will be removed from the EA Play playlist next month, on 15th August. Meanwhile, if Anthem has been already purchased and in libraries, users will still be able to redownload the game and play until the servers shut down next year. </p>
<p>"We deeply appreciate your dedication, passion and support over the years and we'd like to thank you for that," Anthem's team wrote in a <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-au/games/anthem/news/anthem-game-update">post announcing the shut down</a>. It added the shut down has not resulted in any layoffs within the team. This will no doubt be a relief, given EA recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/despite-black-panther-cancellation-ea-still-has-at-least-three-marvel-games-in-the-works">cancelled its single-player Black Panther game and closed the developer behind it</a>, Cliffhanger Studios.</p>
<p>Anthem initially released in 2019, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-very-disappointed-in-anthem-launch-issues">had a rocky start</a>. In 2020, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-confirms-its-working-on-a-substantial-reinvention-of-anthem">Bioware then announced it was planning to overhaul its online shooter</a>, which the studio said would deliver a "substantial reinvention" of the core Anthem experience. The following year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-confirms-work-on-major-anthem-overhaul-has-officially-ceased">development on this major overhaul ceased</a>. Soon after, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/anthem-director-departs-bioware">Anthem's director Jonathan Warner announced he was leaving BioWare</a>.</p>

<p>As is good journalistic practise, I'll start with the bit I find the funniest, conceptually, especially if I imagine it as a newspaper headline. "Several towns have been moved closer to water". Rivers have also been widened, and bridges have been "reconsidered". This is all part of TaleWorld's efforts to reshape "the very veins of the continent", ostensibly to widen the maritime trade network, though I suspect it's actually just to give you more targets to boat batter.</p>
<blockquote><p>"For settlements now hugging rivers and coasts, danger sails closer — rival ports are now just a voyage away. To meet this new maritime threat, both parties and armies can now travel by water, gaining access to naval movement and combat."</p></blockquote>
<p>The world map is also being expanded with "a new rugged long strip of a south-facing coastline". Coincidentally, rugged long is also my stripper name. Here's the map:</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>TaleWorlds Entertainment</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Returning to coastline plundering, TaleWorlds have also detailed the part naval warfare will play in sieges. Namely blockades, which will be automatically formed after setting up a siege camp, as long as the siege target is a naval settlement and the besiegers have ships available. As a player, you can also reinforce besieged towns from water - "either by breaking through the blockade at the cost of some troops, or by attacking the fleet directly to lift it."</p>
<p>A few other bits of interest: If you dock and then go pottering about on land, you'll be able to summon your ships again from any coastal town. Sailing itself will be aided or hindered by wind speed and currents, and you'll have to contend with attrition, from hazards like storms and regular old disrepair, while you're out there.</p>
<p>How is Bannerlord these days? I played it for about fifty very good hours when it came out and haven't touched it since. Sin <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mount-blade-2-bannerlord-review">reviewed it back in 2022</a> and didn't reckon it was a meaningful upgrade from the previous. "I still enjoy Bannerlord because there's nothing else doing those open world battles," she wrote. "But almost everything else is a robotic, shallow grind offering no surprises, with a plethora of complaints that early access is supposed to iron out".</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mount-blade-ii-bannerlords-war-sails-expansion-is-terraforming-the-land-to-encourage-maximum-boat-bastardry]]></content:encoded>

			<p>More details about the <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-mmorpg-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">canceled</a> ZeniMax Online game have <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-07-03/microsoft-s-xbox-cancels-blackbird-an-upcoming-game-that-impressed-executives?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1MTU2ODYyNiwiZXhwIjoxNzUyMTczNDI2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTWVU2WjREV1JHRzAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.qsy2COuNIZabsf38JG6uvZ2JOF4hCCs1hdYhMXpS9pw&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">appeared</a> in a Bloomberg report, including that Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer had played it and loved it as recently as March. Here's the direct quote:</p>



<p><em>But Blackbird’s cancellation was particularly shocking because it had blown away executives at Xbox just a few months ago. During the demonstration in March, Spencer was enjoying the game so much that Matt Booty, the head of Xbox Game Studios, had to pull the controller away so they could keep the meeting going, according to two people who were in the room.</em></p>



<p>One of Phil Spencer's most endearing traits to gamers is that he is a well-known gamer himself. He has previously admitted to playing many online games, from Diablo IV to Fallout 76 and even ZeniMax Online's own The Elder Scrolls Online. </p>



<p>So, why was the game canceled? The report sheds no light on the specifics, leaving everything to speculation. If it's true that Phil Spencer himself had enjoyed his time with the game, it appears very likely that financial considerations - perhaps mandated from above - led to this outcome.</p>



<p>It's a shame, though, based on the details provided by Bloomberg. There were reportedly some challenges early on with the new engine, but those appeared to have been surpassed by now, and there were 300 developers on the project. They delivered the vertical slice in March to move to full production and tentatively ship the game (once codenamed Kestrel, later renamed to Blackbird) in 2028.</p>



<p>The game was reportedly a third-person online shooter not unlike Destiny (except for the different camera perspective). The setting was sci-fi with a flair of noir, and it put a big emphasis on movement, with player characters able to double jump, dash in the air, use a grappling hook, and even wall climb in superhero-like fashion.</p>



<p>Even the Bloomberg reporter, Jason Schreier, saw footage of the vertical slice and claimed to be impressed. This lends credence to the statement shared by Alex Tardif, former Lead Graphics Programmer at ZeniMax Online Studios, who <a href="https://wccftech.com/canceled-zos-mmorpg-was-heading-in-a-great-direction-and-new-engine-had-found-its-footing-says-lead-graphics-programmer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> the game was heading in a great direction. Needless to say, it all makes it even more weird that a company as flush as Microsoft would cancel a game that its own Gaming CEO, Phil Spencer, had appreciated, only because it would have been expensive to produce. It sounds like no project is ever truly safe from the axe at this point.</p>

With the Premium Pen, you can create handwritten notes and email them to other devices. It feels remarkably similar to writing on actual paper.

The 16GB model is only $10 less than the bundle version; the 32GB model is $5 less; and the 64GB edition is actually the same price. So why would you willingly give up the $60 Fabric Folio and $20 AC adapter?</p><p>You probably shouldn't <em>unless </em>you have a device that's eligible to trade in toward the new Scribe. The non-bundle version is eligible for an additional 20% discount when you trade in a device. Your old Kindle is the obvious choice, but Amazon also accepts other devices, including Fire tablets, Fire TV Sticks, and even some Apple products.</p><p>With a trade-in, you'll get the value of that device <em>and </em>an additional 20% discount on your new purchase. That's a substantial savings. Trade-in values vary considerably, but the extra 20% is worth $52 to $62--and that's automatic. Here are the new prices, not including your trade-in.</p><ul><li>16GB -- $208</li><li>32GB -- $224</li><li>64GB -- $248</li></ul><p>It doesn't matter if you trade in a Fire Stick worth $3 or the original Kindle Scribe 16GB model for $85. But it is worth noting that if you own the original 2022 Scribe and want to upgrade, that $85 figure is what Amazon offered me, effectively lowering the price of the 2024 model to $123.</p></div>                      </div>   </div><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0F9NMHGFT,B0F9N9DCHZ,B0F9NDJ4R5,B0CZ9VFQ2P,B0CZ9TDDN6,B0CZ9T2C6B&amp;tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">See all Kindle Scribe Prime Day Deals</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/4ksexRp" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Browse Prime Day Kindle Book Sale</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/hz/audible/mlp/membership/premiumplus/prime?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Audible Premium Plus Deal - Get 3 Months Free</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/hz/subscribe/ku?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kindle Unlimited Deal - Get 3 Months Free</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Buds-Wireless-Charging-Case/dp/B085WTWYS4?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon Echo Buds with ANC</a> -- $45 (<del>$140</del>)</li></ul><p>If you take advantage of the Kindle Scribe deal and have never tried <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/hz/subscribe/ku?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kindle Unlimited</a></strong>, you can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kindle-unlimited-sign-up-deal-amazon-prime-day/1100-6524603/" data-ref-id="1100-6524603">get your first three months for free</a>, which grants access to a library of over 4 million books, comics, graphic novels, manga, and more.</p><hr><p>Some Kindle Unlimited titles also include audiobook versions that can be listened to on your Kindle.

<figure><a title="Helldivers 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/813674842bbb6/helldivers-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Arrowhead Game Studios, SIE</em></figcaption></figure><p>Yesterday, Arrowhead Game Studios shell-shocked the games industry – announcing it would be bringing its PvE third-person shooter <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/helldivers_2">Helldivers 2</a> to the Xbox. Yes, the Sony-published game exclusive to PlayStation on consoles, is now making its way to Microsoft's hardware.</p>
<p>Given the timing of all this, there are now (<em>unsurprisingly</em>) some Helldivers calling for a Switch 2 port, with threads on <a href="https://x.com/KirPinkFury/status/1940824347587010622">Reddit and social media popping up</a> – asking the folks at Arrowhead to "let everyone in", in reference to Nintendo players:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Nintendo Switch 2 has all the credentials to handle Helldivers, if Steam Deck can do it, the new Switch will do it without any problems"</p>

<p>Again, it's the Switch 2's recent release that's given <em>some</em> fans hope as the game is now dropping on Xbox next month. As you might also expect, there are plenty of other opinions about the possibility of something like this happening – with many Helldivers ruling it out due to how demanding the online multiplayer title can be (especially in its more hectic moments). However, other players think it should happen:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I got over 550 hours on my Steam Deck, let 'em in, I say"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sony Interactive Entertainment is behind series like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mlb_the_show_25">MLB The Show</a>, which is already available on other platforms, but it's also a sport-licensed game. Helldivers is obviously <em>different</em> in that respect with live service updates, and the community has played a huge role in sustaining the popularity of the game.</p>
<p>For now, Helldivers can expect reinforcements to arrive on Xbox this August. You can find out more about this particular version of the game on <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/07/helldivers-2-is-officially-releasing-for-xbox-this-august">our sibling site Pure Xbox</a>.</p>

                <p>Nintendo has rolled out new updates for both <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild/" data-ref-id="5000-107502">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> and its sequel, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/" data-ref-id="5000-497748">Tears of the Kingdom</a>. The latest patches are fairly minor, primarily addressing a few issues related to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-use-zelda-notes-app-for-tears-of-the-kingdom-and-breath-of-the-wild/1100-6532180/" data-ref-id="1100-6532180">Zelda Notes</a> service for the Nintendo Switch 2 Editions of both games.</p><p>According to Nintendo's <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/25568/kw/breath%20of%20the%20wild" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">patch notes</a>, the new updates resolve a bug that can occur when attempting to use certain Daily Bonus perks. Specifically, Nintendo says it has "fixed an issue in which the player was unable to use the Daily Bonus effects 'Health Recovery' or 'Hearty Meal' if they had increased their hearts to the maximum number."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Following this week’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-july" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft layoffs of around 9,000 people</a> – which led to cascading cancellations of projects like <em>Perfect Dark</em>, <em>Everwild</em>, and an unannounced Zenimax MMO – Communications Workers of America, the union that represents thousands of games workers across Microsoft, has confirmed that some under its umbrella have been impacted (<a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-activision-blizzard-layoffs-survival-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unlike in early 2024</a>, when they were entirely unaffected by a separate set of mass layoffs).</p><p>“We are deeply disappointed in Microsoft’s decision to lay off thousands more workers, including union-represented CWA members, at a time when the company is prospering,” president Claude Cummings Jr said in a statement <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/cwa-statement-layoffs-microsoft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published on CWA’s website</a>. “We will be bargaining with the company over these layoffs, and CWA district vice presidents Mike Davis and Derrick Osobase will remain directly involved in ensuring that our members are supported and treated with dignity throughout this process.”</p><p>Workers within Zenimax’s QA union, who were granted anonymity on the basis that they were not authorized to speak publicly, said Microsoft provided the union no forewarning about the layoffs.</p><p>“Zenimax sent the union an email [yesterday], after they already started letting go/deactivating people in other departments,” one union member told Aftermath.</p><p>CWA and Microsoft initially boasted a mutually beneficial relationship while the latter was attempting to get its purchase of Activision Blizzard across the regulatory finish line. The organizations hashed out a legally binding union neutrality deal <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/source/2022/06/13/cwa-microsoft-announce-labor-neutrality-agreement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">back in 2022</a>, which CWA said at the time would “give employees a seat at the table and ensure that the acquisition of Activision Blizzard benefits the company’s workers and the broader video game labor market.” Multiple rounds of layoffs later, that relationship has soured, with CWA and represented workers issuing <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-union-hits-out-at-heartless-microsoft-gaming-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">increasingly harsh critiques</a> of Microsoft over the years.</p><p>CWA-affiliated workers also <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-zenimax-cwa-union-contract-negotiations-strike" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accused Microsoft of dragging its feet</a> where Zenimax QA union contract bargaining was concerned, though the two sides <a href="https://aftermath.site/zenimax-union-contract" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">finally came to terms at the tail end of May</a> after nearly two years at the table. Now, only a month later, layoffs have led to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-07-03/microsoft-s-xbox-cancels-blackbird-an-upcoming-game-that-impressed-executives" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a project cancellation</a> at Zenimax Online Studios, the creator of <em>Elder Scrolls Online</em>, which <a href="https://aftermath.site/zenimax-online-studios-union" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has its own multidisciplinary union</a>. Yesterday, Zenimax Online Studios president and <em>Elder Scrolls Online</em> director Matt Firor also <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-veterans" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced he was leaving the company</a> after more than 18 years.</p><p>“Right now, we are living through a moment of profound corporate consolidation and disruption,” Cummings said in today’s statement. “In times like these, union organizing is not just a tool for protections in the workplace; it is essential to workers’ survival, and one of the strongest defenses we have against unchecked corporate power. This news will not slow the movement for a video game industry that works for those who make it what it is today.

<figure><a title="Zelda" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/35617b657a7b2/zelda.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has today released brand new updates for the Switch 2 and Switch versions of <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Breath of the Wild</a></strong>.</p>

These latest patches, which bump TotK to Version 1.4.2 and BotW to Version 1.8.2, resolve not only "several issues" but also fix some issues tied to the "<strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/poll-so-have-you-used-zelda-notes-yet">Zelda Notes</a></strong>" in the Switch 2 versions of each game.</p>

<p>From the team behind Mario Party</p>

<figure><a title="Mario Party Jamboree" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/db5b9f7032a23/mario-party-jamboree.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Following the confirmation of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>'s developer earlier this week, it seems a team has now been officially linked to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</a>.</p>
<p>As highlighted by GamesRadar+, it's the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/mario_party">Mario Party</a> team Nintendo Cube (<a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-16-nintendo-switch-2-part-2/?srsltid=AfmBOooGCk57N3GDMX0le3VmJfxJCweIkRoBIVul0Ub8rUyz_XgdkjgN">seemingly alongside involvement from Nintendo EPD</a>) – with the Japanese developer recently posting this information on its company website:</p>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Cube" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/691dd3106ae85/nintendo-cube.large.png"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nintendo Cube (which has <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/09/mario-party-dev-ndcube-has-officially-changed-its-name">co-developed multiple titles with Nintendo EPD</a> previously) has also worked on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_party_jamboree">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a> and more recently the "complete" version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/animal_crossing_pocket_camp_complete">Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp</a>. And if you've played <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/clubhouse_games_51_worldwide_classics">Clubhouse Games: 51 Worldwide Classics</a>, you might have noticed how the avatars (<em>and generally relaxing vibe</em>) are somewhat similar, so it all checks out!</p>
<figure><a title="Clubhouse" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/08a9218bc84c5/clubhouse.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>So, now you at least know who you were supporting when buying this paid game (which originally had some people calling for it to be a free "pack-in" title). This same developer has been working on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Super Mario Party Jamboree - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV</a> – arriving later this month on <strong>24th July 2025</strong>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>You want your games to play the smoothest they possibly can — but sometimes, screen technology gets in the way. That’s why some of the latest TVs and handhelds feature <em>variable refresh rate</em> (VRR) screens that can compensate when your graphics can’t deliver a consistent 60 or 120 frames per second.</p><p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has a VRR screen — and originally, Nintendo advertised that the Switch 2 would also work with your VRR-capable TV. But Nintendo soon <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/oliemack.bsky.social/post/3lmxv4nwjp22g">scrubbed mentions of docked VRR</a> from its website, and on May 16th, it apologized. “Nintendo Switch 2 supports VRR in handheld mode only,” the company <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/nintendo-apologises-for-error-with-mention-of-switch-2-vrr-tv-support">told <em>Nintendo Life</em></a><em>, </em>apologizing for “the incorrect information.”</p><p>But I’ve just confirmed that the official Nintendo Switch 2 dock <em>does</em> support VRR — by plugging the Steam Deck into it.</p><p>In fact, we found multiple rival handhelds can output 4K at 120Hz with both HDR and VRR if you plug them into the Nintendo Switch 2 dock. I saw the same with the Lenovo Legion Go S with SteamOS, and an Asus ROG Ally X <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/30/24329005/bazzite-asus-rog-ally-x-steam-os-editorial">with Bazzite</a>, each outputting to my Samsung S90C TV. We got the idea from Reddit, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1lnh0fe/psa_switch_2_dock_supports_vrr_and_hdr_on_steam/?share_id=Pge9JSi-B5Dxocskxn-Yu&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1">where u/DynaMach</a> and others have reported VRR working this way.</p><p>It’s not particularly <em>practical</em> to play a PC handheld via Nintendo’s dock, because you’ll need a female-to-male USB-C extension cable and you’ll need to continually hold it against Nintendo’s spring-loaded platform to keep it from getting ejected — but I just so happened to have one of those cables lying around.</p><p>And before you ask, yes, I did actually test that 4K VRR actually works at up to 120 frames per second — I didn’t just trust SteamOS’s flag that it was supported. I downloaded <a href="https://github.com/Nixola/VRRTest">the open-source VRRTest tool</a> and messed with various settings, just to check that intermediate framerates between 48fps and 60fps and 90fps all stayed smooth on my TV as the framerate fluctuates.</p><p>So if the Switch 2 supports VRR, and the dock supports VRR, why does Nintendo not offer VRR display output from the Nintendo Switch 2?</p><p>It would be a boon in many games, whether we’re talking about games like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> that don’t run at 60fps on Switch to begin with, or even games that only occasionally dip below that threshold (say, 55fps) where that dip currently manifests as a big stutter in your gameplay.</p><p>Personally, I think it’s possible Nintendo just doesn’t think the Switch 2 is ready to put it on the big screen.</p><p>Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review"><em>Digital Foundry</em> found “clear problems”</a> even in the Switch 2’s handheld VRR mode, including judder in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and <em>No Man’s Sky</em>’s 40fps “performance” modes, as well as <em>Hitman: World of Assassination’s</em> unlocked-but-capped 60fps mode — although Nintendo’s own Welcome Tour showed proper VRR support.</p><p>“Clearly the feature is in there and working, because the Welcome Tour proves it, but the actual implementation in other games so far is disappointing,” <em>Digital Foundry</em>’s Rich Leadbetter <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uQ5CMfFc7c&amp;t=2332s">explained on the channel’s podcast</a>.</p><p>But if you’re looking for technical reasons why Nintendo might not pass along VRR to the official dock, Leadbetter tells me he hasn’t yet heard a good theory. He does believe, however, that Nintendo probably made an honest mistake when it wrote, then apologized for writing, that the Switch 2 would support VRR in TV mode. He doubts that Nintendo axed the feature at the last minute.</p><div><p>This is just the latest technological weirdness around the Switch 2’s launch, like we saw when testing the Switch 2’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/695915/switch-2-usb-c-third-party-docks-dont-work-authentication-encryption">semi-locked-down USB-C video output</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/693182/nintendo-switch-2-webcam-mystery-1080p-480p-uvc-iso-bulk-ugreen-elgato">why the best webcams didn’t work</a>.</p></div><p>But as before, Nintendo is staying silent: it didn’t have a comment for our story.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/report/697937/nintendo-switch-2-vrr-steam-deck-rog-x-ally-120hz]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This week sees the debut of Crunchyroll’s summer season of anime, and one of the streamer’s new lineup of shows has become the focal point of online discussion not for the content of its story, but for its subtitles, which appear to include a line explicitly mentioning ChatGPT.</p><p>On Tuesday, Bluesky user pixeldoesthings uploaded a screenshot of Cyangames’ and studio Gokumi’s VR video game-centric action anime, <em>Necronomicon and the Cosmic Horror Show</em>. In their screenshot, the lower third of the anime’s German subtitles read, “ChatGPT said:Wenn ich die Welt von hier an weiter genießen kann.” According to <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2025-07-01/crunchyroll-german-necronomico-and-the-cosmic-horror-show-subtitles-listed-chatgpt/.226206" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Anime News Network</em></a>, the dialogue line appears at the end of the premiere episode of the anime around its 19:12 timestamp.&nbsp;</p><p>“Beyond disappointed to find <em>Necronomico and the Cosmic Horror Show</em>'s subs on Crunchyroll are blatantly and openly ChatGPT,” pixeldoesthings wrote in the post. “This is not acceptable. How can we be expected to pay for a service that clearly doesn't care about the quality of its products?”</p><p>As <em>ANN </em>notes, as of July 2, the German subtitle line no longer includes “ChatGPT” in its subtitling; however, for many, the damage was already done. Pixeldoesit’s post has since been cross-posted from BlueSky to Twitter, leading to an outcry from anime fans wondering if the streamer was caught blatantly using ChatGPT, rather than hiring human subtitlers.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking with Aftermath, a Crunchyroll spokesperson provided an official statement this morning saying, “We were made aware that AI-generated subtitles were employed by a third-party vendor, which is in violation of our agreement. We are investigating the matter and are working to rectify the error.”</p><p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/26/24081180/crunchyroll-president-purini-anime-funimation-shutdown-sony-merger-decoder-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Verge</em></a> in February 2024, Crunchyroll President Rahul Purini mentioned that the company was experimenting with machine-learning technology to "improve and optimize [their] processes" for delivering subtitles in more languages worldwide at a faster rate compared to the original Japanese release date of seasonal anime. The following March, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/anime/24092569/crunchyroll-ai-subtitles-funimation-account-updates-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Polygon </em></a>asked whether Purini’s stance on AI had changed in the wake of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/funimations-app-will-officially-sunset-in-april" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crunchyroll’s merger with then-competitor Funimation</a>—a merger that led to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crunchyroll-president-responds-to-concerns-over-lost-digital-copies-due-to-funimation-merger" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fan outcry over losing digital anime content they once owned on Funimation</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Purini reiterated to <em>Polygon </em>that the anime company wasn’t using AI in its subtitling, despite subscriber worries over his February 2024 statement, which had hinted at the possibility that the streamer <em>would </em>implement machine-generated subtitles.</p><p>“AI is new, we are curious to see what it can do, what it cannot do, to understand it better,” Purini told <em>Polygon</em>. “Quality is of paramount importance for us, and if we find out the technology is not to the level that it can create the best subtitles we want for our fans, then we will wait until the technology gets there. And if it never gets there, then it never gets there.”</p><p>When <em>Polygon </em>asked how and when Crunchyroll might implement AI-generated subtitling and closed captioning into the company’s localization workflow, Purini declined to comment on a timeline.&nbsp;</p><p>“We still don’t know if we can get them done,” Purini said. “It’s really, really early testing so far.”&nbsp;</p><p>The widespread outrage within the anime community over obvious ChatGPT-produced subtitles for a lesser-known show highlights a long-standing concern. Many worry that, like the <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2025-01-23/shogakukan-releases-novelous-light-novel-manga-app-using-ai-assisted-translation-in-u.s-canada/.220391" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">manga</a>,&nbsp; <a href="https://aftermath.site/disney-universal-midjourney-ai-lawsuit-case-copyright" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">film</a>, <a href="https://www.inverse.com/entertainment/ai-in-movies-tv-op-ed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TV</a>, and <a href="https://aftermath.site/fortnite-ai-darth-vader-star-wars-epic-games-sag-aftra" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">video game industries</a>, anime may also be showing signs of increasingly relying on AI for faster production and higher output.</p><p>Anime fans’ collective outrage over <em>Necronomico and the Cosmic Horror Show</em>’s ChatGPT-generated subtitles shows they recognize the vital role of human translators and localizers. After all, it's these human beings’ expert skills and training that have contributed to Crunchyroll’s lofty position as the leading platform for anime fans, not AI.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-is-pulling-the-plug-on-anthem%E2%80%99s-servers-in-2026.1235571/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>EA has announced that they are sunsetting <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/anthem">Anthem</a>, shutting down the game’s servers on 12th January 2026, after which the online-only title will no longer be playable.</p>
<p>In preparation of this, Anthem and premium currency have all been removed from sale.</p>


<p>This comes “After careful consideration” and gives roughly half a year’s notice of the shutdown. The BioWare Team sign off by saying “We deeply appreciate your dedication, passion and support over the years and we’d like to thank you for that.”</p>
<p>Honestly, I’m surprised that EA kept the servers running this long, given how Anthem was one of the most ignominious flops of the past decade.</p>
<p>After a troubled development, Anthem launched on 22nd February 2019 to a generally poor reaction, struggling with performance, bugs, and generally failing to excite in the same way that rivals like Destiny 2 and The Division were managing at the time. The insider&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/04/04/bioware-admits-and-pledges-to-address-workplace-issues-after-anthem-expose/">tales of the game’s troubled conception at BioWare</a> emerged immediately, the company retreating into its shell after announcing that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/04/25/anthems-roadmap-act-1-delayed/">the Act 1 roadmap had been seriously delayed</a>.</p>

<p>As the continued development of the game was handed over to BioWare Austin, it took half a years before the game’s first event, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/05/30/anthem-cataclysm-event-revealed-pts-live-next-week-everything-we-know/">Cataclysm</a>, was added, followed by smaller seasonal in-game events. It was clear that something dramatic was needed to revive the game’s fortunes and the hope was that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/02/10/bioware-reinvent-anthem-ps5-new-seasons-cheap-deal-game-offer-ps4-xb1/">Anthem NEXT</a> could be that, those plans shattered by the slower pace of development through the pandemic in 2020, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/02/24/anthem-next-cancelled-no-more-updates/">EA eventually pulled the plug in 2021</a> around the game’s second anniversary.</p>
<p>That effectively consigned Anthem to the history books, and it’s hard to believe that many people have been playing at all over the past five years. I’d have totally believed you if you told me that servers were already shut down in 2022 or ’23.</p>
<p>The silver lining is that, if you do want to play a game with some pretty great Iron Man style flying, you’ve still got the rest of this year to do so.</p>
