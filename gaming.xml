            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/21/thrustmaster-h-e-a-r-t-controller-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Everyone’s looking for an edge, and in gaming, that can come down to the tech and peripherals you surround yourself with. Thrustmaster are one of the most reliable and long-running peripheral-makers in the game, and control has always been their calling card. Their all-new HEART Controller pulls together a raft of their knowledge, with Hall Effect analogue sticks and mechanical buttons designed to make this the fastest, most precise weapon in your arsenal.</p>
<p>The Thrustmaster HEART Controller – H.E.A.R.T. standing for Hall Effect Accurate Technology here – is a USB-A wired controller for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One and PC. There’s a lovely braided wired cable which connects to the controller via a standard USB-C port. It boasts the traditional Microsoft asymmetrical stick layout, and it’s a wholly plastic build, appearing in black and white, with an RGB lighting strip running across the middle. It looks smart, if a little understated.</p>



<p>In the hand, it’s a lighter offering than the official Xbox controller, though that’s not that surprising with no onboard batteries to contend with. The hand grips are a touch more angular at the end, and noticeably so when you pick it up, but once they’re resting in the palm of your hand they’re as comfortable as you’d hope.</p>
<p>The analogue sticks are the stars of the show, though. Hall Effect sticks use magnets to track movement rather than physical connections that can wear out and cause drift. You can tell Thrustmaster’s expertise here, and they feel tight and incredibly responsive in use. I’ve played a heap of Overwatch 2 and Marvel Rivals with them, and you feel empowered by these sticks, firing off salvos with pinpoint accuracy. Well, as much accuracy as your thumbs can muster, anyway.</p>

<p>The mechanical face buttons and cross-shaped D-Pad are also excellent, with a great tactile feel and reassuring click when used. The Y button on our review unit seemed to take a little while to bed in, but I’ve had no issues with it at all in the thirty to forty hours since.</p>

<p>Now onto the weaker elements: the shoulder buttons and triggers. Both of these inputs feel cheap in comparison to those on the front of the HEART Controller. Some of that comes down to the light plastic that they’re made out of, but equally, the shoulder buttons, and particularly the one on the right, feels, and sounds, cheap. The triggers are certainly as responsive as you’d want, but I really missed the ability to lock them out for playing FPS titles like you can with recent controllers like the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/04/turtle-beach-stealth-ultra-pro-controller-review/">Turtle Beach Stealth Ultra Pro</a> – admittedly a significantly more expensive controller.</p>
<p>There are two additional buttons on the rear, and you can program these on the fly using the mapping button on the controller. They sit really nicely under the fingers, and I just like the way they feel. In fact, they’re much better to press than those found on Thrustmaster’s pricier <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/19/thrustmaster-eswap-x2-pro-controller-review/">eSwap X2</a>.</p>
<p>The Mapping and RGB light buttons, though, are in the worst place possible. They sit above the Menu and Option buttons on the front of the controller and by doing so, they’re just where you expect to find the Menu and Option buttons. Every time I wanted to use either of the menu buttons, I found myself changing the lighting colour, or doing nothing at all. These absolutely needed to be placed somewhere else, and it seems unbelievable that no one else had the same issues with them during testing. I did mostly learn to live with it, but having to think about which one is the right button isn’t good for staying immersed in your game.</p>

<p>You can really tinker with the setup here though, whether on the fly – you can map the buttons and cycle through a small number of RGB lighting options via the buttons on the controller – or in the ThrustmapperX Software which is available on both PC and Xbox.</p>
<p>At £90, the Thrustmaster has to truly sell itself as being an upgrade over your regular Xbox controller, and though the analogue sticks, face buttons and rear buttons are well designed and feel great, the triggers and shoulder buttons just didn’t do it for me. In terms of competition, you’re one step away from Microsoft’s Elite 2 Core controller, but while it certainly feels more premium in your hand, there continue to be significant question marks about its reliability. I don’t think you’ll have any of those problems with the HEART Controller. If you want a wired controller for the reduced latency, that’s definitely a key selling point here, but if your budget will stretch to it, the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/19/thrustmaster-eswap-x2-pro-controller-review/">Thrustmaster eSwap X2</a> is a far superior product, and you can now buy HALL Effect stick modules for it as well.</p>

The film became a global phenomenon, and is <em>the</em> shining artifact of the Disney Channel Original Movies (DCOM) golden age.</p><p>From the release of <em>Brink</em> in 1998 to <em>Camp Rock</em> in 2008, DCOMs were at their best over that illustrious decade. Why? Yes, they followed a standard cookie cutter formula. But it’s clear the producers and story creators were given a high degree of latitude (for better or worse) to throw crazy ideas at the wall and see what stuck. That’s a far cry from the sequel and IP-driven content we’re inundated with today.</p><p>True to its name (Disney Channel <em>Original</em> Movie), originality makes these movies memorable. If you’re a millennial who watched TV as a kid, there’s a solid chance you’re hit with a tidal wave of nostalgia at the mention of <em>Eddie’s Million Dollar Cook Off</em> or listening to the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PowwTH4TmYA&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PowwTH4TmYA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DCOM theme song</a></span>.</p><p>In celebration of <em>High School Musical</em>’s final year as a teenager, we compiled a list of golden era Disney Channel Original Movies that are worth rewatching–for the laughs, tears, smash singles, memes, and WTFs.</p></div></div><div><p>There’s a common formula for DCOM sports movies: a protagonist with a passion; a pushy, emotionally dense (and often misogynistic) dad who doesn’t understand it; a secret the protagonist keeps from friends and/or family in pursuit of this passion; a pivotal moment where the dad finally understands and supports their child; and the hero achieving ultimate victory over the villain, made possible by their dad’s eventual support.</p><p><em>Brink</em> is the first DCOM to assemble these ingredients–making it the mother of all DCOM sports films–and it may have very well cooked the best dish out of them. Capitalizing on the massive popularity of Tony Hawk and extreme sports in the 1990s, the story centers around Andy “Brink” Brinker and his friends who deem themselves “Soul Skaters.” The SoCal squad is driven by their love of the game, which is why they find a natural rival in Team X-Bladz, a skate crew that shreds for money and fame. Val, the leader of X-Bladz played by Sam Horrigan, excels as the underhanded, detestable, and at times VERY unserious villain. In a heated confrontation, he tells the Soul Skaters, “It’s like open season on your butts.”</p><p>Much worse, he almost kills (yes, kills) Brink’s friend Gabriella when she speed races Brink down a huge hill. Val secretly tosses gravel onto the road, which she trips on and proceeds to slow-motion roll for 15 seconds of movie time. Ouch. It’s giving the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HNvsdwFnfc&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HNvsdwFnfc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ricky Bobby-Jean Girard crash</a></span> in <em>Talladega Nights</em>, unironically.</p><p>The image that social media remembers most from this movie is when the camera pans to X-Bladz team member Boomer (Walter Emanuel Jones) after a standoff with Brink and crew, revealing his <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@onlyninetieskidsknow/video/7217915556236758315?lang=en&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@onlyninetieskidsknow/video/7217915556236758315?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">comically bad hairline</a></span>. But that’s not even the best Boomer moment! Later, Brink confronts Val about what he did to Gabriella while he’s eating lunch with the X-Bladz. After Brink throws a chocolate shake in Val’s face, Boomer <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/fn9oXl9tyG0?t=210&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/fn9oXl9tyG0?t=210" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pulls a “Supa Hot Fire”</a></span> and switches sides, leaving with his former adversary.</p><p><em>Brink</em> is cornball, sentimental, and concludes with an epic race between Brink and Val. It lands all the right tricks and is definitely worth a re-watch.</p></div><div><p><em>Smart House</em> walked so <em>Black Mirror</em> could run. I’m being serious.</p><p>The iconic DCOM centers around teenager Ben Cooper (Ryan Merriman), who wins a contest to move him and his family into a new home dubbed “the Smart House.” It comes with state of the art smart technology, headlined by PAT, a virtual assistant that can make any food you want, write the school bully’s paper for you, create an i<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZktzLbnen8M&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZktzLbnen8M" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mpromptu dance moment</a></span> to “Slam Dunk (Da Funk)” with your buddies, and throw the ultimate party to impress your crush. What could possibly go wrong?</p><p>Turns out, a lot.</p><p>As Ben’s dad slowly falls for the creator of the home, Sara Barnes (Jessica Steen), PAT becomes too smart for anyone’s benefit, and evolves into a sinister maternal figure. She comes to life as a hologram, and at one point locks and bolts the family into the home for their “protection.” In a truly terrifying scene, a giant-sized version of PAT appears in the living room, whips up a tornado-hurricane and eerily sings “Hush Little Baby” to the family. To make it creepier, that lullaby stems from a much sweeter home video of the kids’ (now deceased) mother doing the same. </p><p><em>Smart House</em> is a quarter of a century ahead of its time, and a cautionary tale for humans relying too much on technology to power their lives that still feels pretty poignant today.,</p></div><div><p>In the 1970s, a white South African named Mahree Bok (Lindsey Haun) girl goes to America to stay with a Black family as part of an exchange program and is surprised to learn that apartheid doesn’t exist there. You can’t help but cringe at the premise of <em>The Color of Friendship</em>, especially given that it’s a DCOM that was released in 2000. That’s what you’d be surprised by how Black director Kevin Hooks and Black writer Paris Quallers are willing to go all the way there by refusing to pull any punches in its effective depiction of race relations in this movie that’s based on a true story.</p><p>When Mahree arrives in America, she awkwardly refuses to shake hands with her homestay mom Roscoe Dellums (Penny Johnson Jerald), and laughs in uncomfortable hysterics when she meets her Congressman homestay father Ron Dellums (Carl Lumbly), shocked that someone in power can be Black. Through a series of events, which includes a young Black girl named Piper Dellums (Shadia Simmons) offering a self-sequestered Mahree food, the veil of Mahree’s ignorance slowly lifts, and the two realize they have a lot in common. One of the more impactful scenes features Mahree teaching Piper the various classifications for black people in South Africa. In it, the N-word is mentioned twice in a TV-G rated DCOM!</p><p>Shit gets really real when Steve Biko, an actual South African anti-apartheid activist, is killed by the police. Mahree responds: “Who cares? Just some crazy terrorist who killed himself.” Piper flips out, rightfully so, and Congressman Dellums teaches her about the vicious cycle of apartheid. It is then that Mahree understands how the system oppresses Black people and what the Black liberation movement in South Africa is fighting for.</p><p>Not your average Disney movie, huh?</p><p>Just look at <em>Remember The Titans</em>: Another Disney movie about desegregation in 1970s America that came out in 2000 and is based on a true story. Unlike <em>The Color of Friendship</em>, <em>Remember The Titans</em> stars one of the greatest actors ever (Denzel Washington), and is widely considered a classic. However, it’s impossible to ignore how Gary Bertier and Julius Campbell simply “solve” racism at a late night practice when they yell “left side, strong side” to each other. From there, racial tensions dissipate.</p><p><em>The Color of Friendship</em> ends with Mahree heading home to her racist parents in South Africa, revealing to the famly’s Black maid Florathat she secretly embroidered the Black liberation flag in her jacket. Racism isn’t solved. In fact, it’s very much still present and Mahree may find herself in danger if she expresses her new viewpoints.</p><p><em>The Color of Friendship</em> is the most un-Disney Disney movie on this list, which was perhaps made possible by being hidden away on the smaller screen. While the film does imply racism is a thing of the past in America, the way it demonstrates how ignorance is developed, educates young viewers on apartheid, and showcases the commonalities between all people (regardless of the color of their skin) makes <em>The Color of Friendship</em> a fascinating re-watch.</p></div><div><p>If you’re searching for a good-bad movie, <em>Luck of the Irish</em> is for you. It’s got basketball, lucky coins, evil leprechauns, good leprechauns, a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZnZzbMRMjA&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZnZzbMRMjA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">slavery joke</a></span> (yikes), and a rendition of “This Land Is Your Land” performed by the entire school to put a button on this 86 minute-long roller coaster ride.</p><p>While the film is seemingly designed to celebrate Irish culture, its means for getting there are questionable. With Heritage Day approaching, the luckiest kid in the neighborhood Kyle (played by <em>Smart House</em>’s Ryan Merriman) asks his parents about their ancestry over dinner. They’re suspiciously dodgy, refusing to provide a straightforward answer. Meanwhile the walls of the dining room are painted a ludicrously green color, his dad dons a green flannel, and the salad his mom serves is one giant green lettuce leaf. Kyle really can’t take a hint.</p><p>When Kyle loses his lucky coin, his world turns upside down. His mom shrinks into a tiny leprechaun and assumes an accent, revealing their Irish heritage in the process. Why were his parents so keen on hiding it? Apparently, it’s because Irish people in America are oppressed. Were they oppressed? It’s unclear exactly.</p><p>One thing that <em>is</em> clear: <em>Luck of the Irish</em> is a pot of gold at the end of our DCOM rewatch list rainbow.</p></div><div><p>Based on Shakespeare’s <em>Twelfth Night, </em>the film follows Andrea, a teenage motorcross enthusiast who secretly suits up as her injured brother Andy to pursue her motocross dreams. A tale as old as time.</p><p>Along the way, the best and hunkiest rider on the circuit, Dean, makes a deal with Andrea to help her improve on the bike in exchange for putting in a good word with his crush Faryn. Andrea then likes Dean, and after the final race, it is revealed that Andrea is actually pretending to be her brother. Sound familiar? Well, that’s because the plot is pretty much the exact same as <em>She’s The Man </em>with a different sport. Only, <em>Motocrossed</em> came first.</p><p>Watching the will-they-won’t-they dynamic unfold between Andrea and Dean (in a strictly heteronormative DCOM universe) is just as entertaining as any big jump on the bike. The sexual tension is palpable when Dean is training her and utters: “I’m gonna work you until you can’t get out of bed.” </p><p>Andrea outmaneuvering Cartier—the physically abusive French villain with a name that prevents you from ever forgetting he’s French—in the final race is espresso powder atop the creme brulee (we see you Zeke from <em>High School Musical</em>).</p></div><div><p>Eddie Ogden (Taylor Ball) is the Ken Griffey Jr. of the lowly Groundhogs little league team in this DCOM staple, and he’s got the backwards cap and lefty power swing to prove it. Unfortunately for him, his cooking and baking interest is which he is constantly derided for by his stereotypically browbeating Disney dad Hank Ogden (Mark L. Taylor) and best friend DB (Orlando Brown). In fact, during the second of two(!) food fights that occur, DB wrestles Eddie to the ground and yells “I’d rather play ball like a man than cook like a girl.” Sheesh. Eddie does find support from his mom and the home economics teacher Mrs. Hadley (Rose McIver), whose sarcasm and comedic timing rival that of a young Chandler Bing.</p><p>The biggest fork in the road moment comes when Eddie must choose between playing in the championship game and competing in the Bobby Flay-hosted cook off. He initially elects baseball but ultimately decides to bolt for the kitchen (with some coaxing from a supportive DB).</p><p>Amidst the insanity of the best hitter in the league taking his talents elsewhere, Hannah, the Groundhogs’ gold glove shortstop, is caught in the on-deck circle by her mom who had assumed she was cheerleading the entire time. Rather than ream her out for playing a “boy’s” sport on a “boy’s” team, she accepts Hannah, which causes Eddie’s dad to rethink his, er, bigotry. He intentionally gets himself thrown out of the game for arguing with the umpire and joins his son at the cook off.</p><p>Eddie winds up losing, but he wins something a lot more valuable: a dad who can show him how to crack an egg with one hand.</p><p>It’s worth noting that Ball knocks it out the park with a confident, charismatic, and surprisingly composed performance for a teenager called on to display a high level of physicality. Ball never became a big acting star because he apparently decided to leave the profession and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.instagram.com/benj_watch/?hl=en&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.instagram.com/benj_watch/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">focus on playing drums</a></span> for the band Tragic Forms. If you ask me, he pulled a real Eddie Ogden. </p></div><div><p>Riding the wave of the popularity of early aughts boy and girl bands like ‘Nsync and Destiny’s Child, <em>The Cheetah Girls</em> (and its sequels) contains some of the best music you’ll find in the DCOM universe. Alongside Raven-Symoné and Sabrina Bryan, established pop stars Adrienne Bailón and Keely Williams (members of 3LW) comprise the group, providing significant credibility… and vocal range. Not to mention, the legendary Whitney Houston is a producer on the film.</p><p>“Cinderella” is a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qURdm4_QZI&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qURdm4_QZI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">certified banger</a></span>, and ironically enough, is about how the Cheetah Girls don’t want to be like the famed Disney princess by waiting around for love. They want to go out and find it themselves. This subversion of the typical Disney tale is appropriate given the diversity of the cast and their characters’ backstories: Galleria (Raven-Symoné) is the daughter of a black woman and Italian man; Chanel (Bailón) is Latina and the daughter of a single mother; Dorinda (Bryan) is white and grew up in a New York City foster home; and Aqua (Williams) is a black girl from Texas.</p><p>The authenticity of the dialogue is notable and the singing numbers feel especially spectacular, seeing as they’re shot like 90s/early aughts music videos. <em>The Cheetah Girls</em> is a fun artifact to re-examine and it makes one long for an era when the biggest news story <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx0k8lvqhlQ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx0k8lvqhlQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is a dog trapped in an NYC manhole</a></span>. Don’t worry! Toto is saved by singing, of course.</p></div><div><p>Similar to <em>Smart House, </em>in that it’s way ahead of its time technologically, and grapples with the philosophical questions surrounding the use of said tech, <em>Pixel Perfect</em> has a depth seldom reached by a DCOM.</p><p>The movie’s teenage protagonist Roscoe (Raviv Ullman) sets out to find a new lead singer for his best friend Sam’s (Leah Pipes) band that can dance. He takes an unconventional route in casually creating Loretta Modern (Spencer Redford), an artificially intelligent hologram. She’s composed of the looks, voices, and dance moves of the world’s most renowned musicians, as well as Sam’s ears. Weird.</p><p>As Roscoe upgrades and takes care of Loretta, it becomes clear that he loves her (sparking jealousy in Sam), and she has real desires and feelings. She wants to feel the rain on her skin. She grows angry at Sam when the two argue over whether or not she’s real. She desperately asks Roscoe, “Why am I never good enough for you?”</p><p>The line between consciousness and unconsciousness (from a sentient standpoint) is blurred in <em>Pixel Perfect, </em>in a way that mirrors certain AI technology today. That alone makes this DCOM classic worthy of careful consideration. </p><p>Still, the film’s core argument is about love. Roscoe’s dad poignantly asserts that “the more you try to find that kind of perfection in people, the more meals you will eat alone.” While AI can help us tremendously, there’s something innately human (and loveable) about our imperfections. </p></div><div><p>My favorite <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/why-corbin-bleu-wikipedia-pages-2019-1&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-corbin-bleu-wikipedia-pages-2019-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">random Disney fact</a></span>: In 2016, Corbin Bleu, who portrays Troy Bolton’s bestie Chad Danforth in <em>High School Musical</em>, had the 3rd most translated Wikipedia page in the world. He only trailed Barack Obama and Jesus Christ. </p><p>Is this why <em>High School Musical</em> is worth a rewatch? No, but it does speak to just how much of a global phenomenon the movie is, spawning sequels, a concert tour, a TV show series on Disney Plus, and super duper star talent (see: Zac Efron and Olivia Rodrigo).</p><p>Most great DCOMs have either a compelling story, magnetic characters, or catchy music. Sometimes, they exhibit two of these qualities. <em>High School Musical </em>captures all three. Troy and Gabriella (Vanessa Hudgens) meet on vacation and tear the cabin down with a karaoke rendition of “Start of Something New.” They then go their separate ways and unexpectedly reunite when Gabriella transfers to Troy’s school.</p><p>In many aspects, the film is an homage to <em>Grease</em>, as it depicts the protagonists connecting away from home (and judgement) and leaving their perceived social boxes to pursue something different. Gabriella’s solo performance of “When There Was Me And You” as she winds the East High halls is Sandy’s (Olivia Newton-John) “Hopelessly Devoted To You” from the 1978 classic film. And the final epic ballad “We’re All In This Together” is analogous to “We Go Together” in both name and spirit.</p><p>“Stick To The Status Quo” captures the mind of a high schooler to a tee: the nightmare scenario of revealing a secret to friends and being rejected for it. What’s great about <em>High School Musical</em> (one of the things, at least) is that there isn’t a clear-cut best song. Upon rewatch, “What I’ve Been Looking For (Reprise)” resonated with me most. The lyrics are simple, but they adequately capture what it means to find your person. You’ve searched for a while, and finally they show up when and where you least expect it (like at a rustic ski lodge in Utah on New Year’s Eve), and the rest is history. Nothing beats that.</p><p>19 years following its release, <em>High School Musical </em>still hits like Coach Bolton’s (Bart Johnson) <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaPG7dRHmLo&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaPG7dRHmLo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">viral line read</a></span>. Also, shout out to Ashley Tisdale as Sharpay, because you can’t write about <em>HSM</em> without mentioning her.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Recently, Sony confirmed that it had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-cancels-two-games-including-a-live-service-god-of-war-report/1100-6528869/" data-ref-id="1100-6528869">canceled a live-service game that was in the works at Days Gone developer Bend Studio</a>. A developer at the studio has now responded to the news, thanking fans for the outpouring of support and confirming that the team still wants to make "cool sh**."</p><p>"I'll keep this short," community manager Kevin McAllister <a href="https://x.com/vikingdad278/status/1880403782976307623" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a>. "Thanks for the love and support everyone, especially to those that have reached out. P.S. We still plan on creating cool sh**."</p><p>Bend's live-service game was never announced, nor was the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-cancels-two-games-including-a-live-service-god-of-war-report/1100-6528869/" data-ref-id="1100-6528869">supposed live-service God of War game said to be in development at Bluepoint, which was also canceled</a>. Sony confirmed the game cancellations in a statement to<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-16/sony-cancels-two-more-playstation-projects" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> Bloomberg </a>recently, saying the projects were scuttled "following a recent review."</p><p>Back in 2023, Sony management said it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-is-halving-the-number-of-playstation-live-service-games-that-it-aims-to-launch-by-march-2026/1100-6519039/">would only go ahead with six live-service games in the near future, down from a dozen.</a> At the time, management said it was attempting to focus on quality over quantity. Plenty of games that begin development are never seen through to release; this is part of the normal creative process.</p><p>But what was <em>not </em>normal was Sony's high-profile shutdown of the multiplayer live-service game Concord and the closure of its developer, Firewalk. Sony pulled the plug on the game just after launch, going on to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-shuts-down-concord-permanently-shutters-dev-firewalk-studios/1100-6527460/" data-ref-id="1100-6527460">refund all players</a>.</p><p>Bend Studio's latest release was 2019's Days Gone, which is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/still-holding-out-hope-for-days-gone-2-time-to-move-on-sony-dev-says/1100-6524585/" data-ref-id="1100-6524585">unlikely to get a sequel.</a> In June 2024, Bend said the studio was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/still-holding-out-hope-for-days-gone-2-time-to-move-on-sony-dev-says/1100-6524585/" data-ref-id="1100-6524585">making a new IP</a>, which could have been the canceled live-service game. In the absence of a Days Gone game sequel, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-game-days-gone-moving-forward-with-movie-adaptation-report/1100-6506677/" data-ref-id="1100-6506677">Days Gone biker movie is now in development.</a></p>

"Making a joke out of our art and possibly tarnishing the reputation of our voice actresses and actors is not worth the extra money we can make [on PC]."</p><p dir="ltr">TeamKill hasn't made any comments regarding their stance on fan art, but one can assume that any NSFW Code Violet art won't be met with enthusiasm from the game's creators.</p><p dir="ltr">Code Violet launches on PlayStation 5 sometime in July.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/horizon-mmo-canceled-report</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-and-ncsoft-reportedly-cancel-unannounced-horizon-mmo.1087590/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/horizon-mmo-canceled-report<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>An MMORPG based on Sony and Guerrilla Games' successful IP&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>has apparently been canceled. The project was reportedly a collaboration between Sony and&nbsp;<em>Guild Wars&nbsp;</em>studio NCSoft.</p>

<p>Bear with me on this one. Back in 2023, Sony and NCSoft <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-and-ncsoft-announce-strategic-partnership-to-collaborate-in-various" rel="nofollow">announced a "strategic partnership"</a>, and that partnership was reported to include a&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>MMO, with leaker Kurakasis <a href="https://x.com/Kurakasis/status/1741262087647543736" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">pointing to job listings</a> for something called "Project H" (also "Project Skyline") in December that same year.</p>

<p>Now, however, Korean publication <a href="https://news.mtn.co.kr/news-detail/2025011314314667267" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">MTN</a> (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/looks-like-horizons-unannounced-mmo-has-been-quietly-cancelled" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a>) has reported that Project H has been canceled following a project review at NCSoft, along with several other titles in development at the company.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/horizon-mmo-canceled-report-aloy.jpg?itok=HnasnYjv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/horizon-mmo-canceled-report-aloy.jpg?itok=WfRjSZmL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>An MMO based on&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>has apparently been canceled.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, all of this should be taken with a pinch of salt, because Sony and NCSoft never officially announced the&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>MMO in question, so naturally, it also hasn't officially been canceled.</p>

<p>However, cancelling such a project would fit in with what appears to be a wider retreat from the live service market on Sony's part. Earlier this week, the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-live-service-games-canceled" rel="nofollow">canceled two live service games</a> in development at Bluepoint and Bend, with the former reportedly being a&nbsp;<em>God of War&nbsp;</em>spinoff.</p>

<p>The retreat is likely inspired by the colossal failure of hero shooter&nbsp;<em>Concord</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-shutting-down-refunds" rel="nofollow">shut down just two weeks after it launched</a> last year. The game's developer would go on to be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-shuts-down-two-studios-including-concord-creator" rel="nofollow">closed down by Sony</a>, along with Neon Koi, previously known as Savage Game Studios.</p>

<p>It's also worth noting that assuming this MMO was actually in development, it's probably not the&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>multiplayer game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/guerrilla-working-on-multiplayer-horizon-game" rel="nofollow">announced back in December 2022</a>, as that's in development at Guerrilla itself rather than a third-party studio (although that could well end up being canceled too).</p>

            <p>The relaxing fish catchin' and scratchcard gamblin' of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/webfishing">Webfishing</a> proved itself deeply attractive to anyone looking for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fishing-games-dont-come-much-cuter-than-the-animal-crossing-style-island-of-webfishing">an easygoing escape</a>. So it makes sense at least one other developer is looking to apply the same lo-fi principles to their own "hangout game". The simply titled <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sledding-game">Sledding Game</a> looks like a chill afternoon of standing around on mountains with your mates and going for a big slide downhill every now and again. It's still early in development, as you can tell from the trailer below. But you'll be able to embody penguins, frogs, and polar bears as they drink hot cocoa in log cabins and ragdoll into one another willy-nilly. Other cute animals are to be confirmed, but I am putting my money on an dopey-faced ermine. </p>

<p>You'll earn points while sledding down the mountain (at one point we see the sledder grind a rail) and then use these points to buy cosmetics like "hats, jackets, scarves, goggles" as well as stickers for your sled. You'll be able to make snowmen, get into snowball fights, and ride a ski lift back up the mountain when you inevitably wipe out on an unexpected slope. "Whether you're racing to the bottom or taking it slow, the hill is all about fun, friends, and freedom," says the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3438850/Sledding_Game/">Steam page</a>.</p>
<p>The game's creator, a solo developer professionally branded as "The Sledding Company", has been posting devlog videos on TikTok since December. They demonstrate <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sledding_game/video/7459466030050479402">how players will get off the ski lift</a> and pay sorrowful tribute to an <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sledding_game/video/7458729542614584619">endless field of frog corpses</a>. "My main inspiration is mainly from Webfishing, which I guess is inspired by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/animal-crossing">Animal Crossing</a>," said the dev in <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sledding_game/video/7450006703212350766">the video announcing the game</a>, before asking for suggestions from viewers. "I don't really know where to go with this project, I just think it's a fun little game-slash-playground-thing." </p><p>The creator also has plans to add 100-player lobbies with proximity voice chat and text chat, which seems a tad ambitious for a small-scale messabout like this. Not to mention a surefire way to emperil the "cozy" and low-key vibe the game seems to be aiming at. Webfishing has 12-player lobbies, for example, and already has to contend with the spectrum of online (mis)behaviour that comes with chat rooms. Even <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/faaast-penguin">Faaast Penguin</a>, a more chaotic party game about going downhill in the snow, taps out at 40 players (and it limits player chitchat to emotes). Although the Sledding Company does add that the 100-player plan is not set in stone, saying: "until further testing, this will just be a guess".</p>
<p>However it turns out, I like when devs show their work like this. I know it can simply be a good marketing strategy for smaller studios and lone developers (people like to watch funny videos on apps that annoy the United States government, it turns out) but ragdolls are always appreciated. And watching developers run headfirst into bugs is doubtless reassuring for fellow struggling game designers otherwise doomscrolling into the abyss. </p>
<p>Sledding Game doesn't have a release date yet, but we'll keep an eye on these penguins for you. It looks like they require supervision anyway.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Competitive ITV show Hell's Kitchen is now blowing up as an experience in Roblox, with a cartoony version of Gordon Ramsay at the fore.</p>
<p>Since its debut last month, ITV's first-ever Roblox experience has had over 20m visits from aspiring chefs, and boasts 450k daily active users happy to have the show's celebrity chef express disdain at their dishes.</p>
<p>As with Hell's Kitchen on telly, those who participate in the official Roblox experience will be popped onto either the Red or the Blue team. And, while I haven't seen word that Ramsay will call users an "Idiot Sandwich", his Roblox counterpart still shares his disappointment if food isn't up to snuff.</p>

<p>Towards the end of last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-adding-further-parental-controls-as-its-belated-push-to-improve-child-safety-continues">Roblox announced further tools designed to improve the safety of its young audience</a>. These tools included the ability for parents to remotely manage their child's account, view their child's friends list and limit the amount of time made available to play.</p><p>This move followed frequent criticism that the platform was not doing enough to ensure the safety of its audience, which is predominantly children. In July of last year, it was revealed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-reported-13316-instances-of-child-exploitation-last-year">Roblox itself had reported 13,316 instances of child exploitation in 2023</a>, and that more than two dozen people had been arrested for abusing minors following contact in-game.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Origin, EA's universally-disliked PC storefront and launcher launched <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-reveals-steam-rival-origin">back in 2011</a>, will finally shut down this year, on 17th April.
</p>
<p>
EA has, of course, long since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-ditching-origin-brand-with-new-ea-desktop-app-as-part-of-ongoing-rebranding-efforts">replaced Origin with the EA App</a>, which isn't much better. 
</p>
<p>
From mid-April, any PC users still using Origin will need to switch in order to continue accessing their library of games and gameplay data.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://help.ea.com/en/help/ea/ea-app/update-operating-system-for-ea-app/">statement</a> on EA's support website, the publisher states that it is finally killing off Origin as "Microsoft has stopped supporting 32-bit software". 
</p>
<p>
"If you use Origin, you need to upgrade to the EA app, which requires a 64-bit version of Windows," EA notes.
</p>
<p>
If you have a relatively new PC with a 64-bit version of Windows, downloading the EA App now and ensuring your game saves are ported over is probably a good idea. 
</p>
<p>
Cloud saves should carry across automatically, though games without cloud support will need manual save migration. 
</p>
<p>
Don't have a 64-bit PC? Then it's bad news. "To run a 64-bit version of Windows, make sure your PC has a 64-bit-capable processor," EA helpfully states. "If your PC doesn’t have one, you'll need to use a newer computer to play your games on the EA app."
</p>
<p>
EA typically <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-ea-is-returning-to-steam">also now launches its PC games on Steam</a>, of course, including last year's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ea-sports-fc-25">EA Sports FC 25</a>.

			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 CPU will not be a massive problem for ports and multiplatform games, as additional optimization work will get these games running decently on the system.</p>
<p>Famiiboards user MattAgain, who is a known developer who has worked in the video game industry for a long time and provided some valuable insights in the past, recently <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/future-nintendo-hardware-technology-speculation-discussion-st-new-staff-post-please-read.55/post-1572401" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commented</a> on the newly revealed system, highlighting how the Switch 2 CPU, while being the part that deviates the most from the standard set by the system overall, is not going to be cause of concern for developers, as no one making a Switch 2 game from the ground up is complaining about it. The only small complaints have come from developers working on ports, which will apparently require a bit more CPU optimization work, compared to how relatively easily graphical resources can scale to the GPU. This additional CPU optimization work, however, isn't anything that shouldn't be expected, going from a power-hungry x86 to a mobile ARM CPU. So, for the time being, the system's CPU shouldn't be an impediment, and, as a whole, <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/future-nintendo-hardware-technology-speculation-discussion-st-new-staff-post-please-read.55/post-1572486" target="_blank" rel="noopener">porting</a> a PlayStation 5 game to the Nintendo Switch 2 is going to be much easier than porting a PlayStation 4 game to the original Switch, which is great news.</p>
<p>The fact that porting games to the Nintendo Switch 2 should be easier than porting games to its predecessor is definitely great news, as this should allow third-party developers to support the system with ease. Very few games have been confirmed for the new Nintendo consoles, but according to rumors, plenty of big publishers are looking into supporting the console heavily, such as Microsoft, who is reportedly working on ports of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2, Halo: The Master Chief Collection, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-hall-effect-diablo-iv/">Diablo IV, Fallout 4 and even Starfield</a>. According to a recent report, basically, every third-party developer is considering supporting the system with their most ambitious AAA titles.</p>

            <p>Steam are throwing a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/category/strategy_real_time">Real-Time Strategy Fest</a> this week, encompassing discounts and demos, and people who like clicking on Orc-emitting huts are eating well. Of the new strategy game demos I've spotted so far, the one that interests me most is Calyx, in which you are at war with a mass of alien vegetation, which expands toward your base in a blossoming, suffocating avalanche of green moss and purple tendril. It seems a bit raw at the level of controls and performance, but the concept is very promising: basically, imagine if <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/creeper-world-4-is-a-triumph-of-consistency">Creeper World 4</a> were a bit more like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ground-control-game">Ground Control</a>.

<p>The premise: you are the sole surviving crew member aboard an Avaris Corporation deep-space mining vessel. After a century in cryosleep, you're woken by the shipboard AI and unceremoniously bundled off to the surface of a lifeless planet in search of ore. Then you discover that the planet ain't so lifeless.</p>
<p>The basic flow here is a mixture of tower-defencey base-building and surgical incursions upon a decentralised, enveloping threat that steadily and insidiously paints the map its colour. You'll need to set up turrets and a robust power grid to keep them online. But you'll also need to build tanks, artillery and so forth so that you can clear distant canyons of invasive plants before they become a problem. There are different kinds of plants, which correspond in some ways to the unit types of a traditional RTS, but the thrill of Calyx, I think, is pitting a regular strategy game toolset against a foe that doesn't play by the same rules.</p><p>The demo includes a tutorial level and "an alpha quality, mid-game level to show how the final experience might feel". Creators Studio 568 <a href="https://www.studio568.co.uk/about">were founded</a> by three, pretty seasoned developers with credits at Epic Games, Lionhead and Natural Motion.

<p>NCSoft’s Horizon MMO, codenamed Project H, has reportedly been canceled.</p>



<p>That’s according to the South Korean website <a href="https://news.mtn.co.kr/news-detail/2025011314314667267" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MTN</a> (via <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-horizon-mmo-developed-by-ncsoft-has-reportedly-been-cancelled.1087482/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ResetEra</a>), who say that at least three projects at NCSoft had been canceled, including Project Pantera, Project H, and Project J. According to widespread rumors, Project H was the codename of the Horizon MMO, which would be later called Skyline.</p>



<p>According to the report, both Project J and Project H were canceled at the beginning of the year, with its developers being notified that they’d been moving to different teams across the company.</p>



<p>In late 2023, NCSoft announced a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-and-ncsoft-global-business-partnership/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">global business partnership with Sony</a>, spearheaded by SIE’s Jim Ryan and NCSOFT’s Taekjin Kim. </p>



<p>The Horizon MMO shouldn’t be confused with Horizon Online, another Horizon project in development at Guerrilla Games, which is forecasting up to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/guerrilla-games-1-million-players-horizon-multiplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one million players on the title</a>. The Horizon Online Multiplayer title was&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-multiplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a>&nbsp;in 2022 as a “online project set in the Horizon universe.” A recent job listing suggests that the title <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-online-multiplayer-game-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">could launch in 2025</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Project H’s cancellation marks the third project this month reportedly canceled. Last week, Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier reported that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-live-service-games-cancelled-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">two live-service games were canceled</a>, one at Bend Studio and the other at Bluepoint. According to the report, Bluepoint’s game was a live-service God of War game.</p>



<p>As of 9 May 2023, the&nbsp;Horizon&nbsp;series has sold over 32 million copies worldwide, over 8.4 million of which are for Horizon Forbidden West.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/horizon-mmo-by-ncsoft-may-have-been-canceled-according-to-a-new-report.1087545/</guid>

			<p>The Horizon MMO that was <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-mmo-game-reportedly-in-the-works-supposedly-made-by-sony-and-ncsoft/">reportedly</a> in the works by Korean development studio NCSoft may have been canceled alongside other projects, according to a new report that's been making the rounds.</p>
<p>Korean publication <a href="https://news.mtn.co.kr/news-detail/2025011314314667267" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MTN</a> shared an exclusive report last week, as posted on<a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-horizon-mmo-developed-by-ncsoft-has-reportedly-been-cancelled.1087482/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> ResetERA</a>, which confirms how some of the studio's projects, which include Project H, the Horizon MMO, have stopped development following a feasibility review. Developers assigned to these projects, according to MTN, were notified about the end of development and to prepare for internal transfers late last year and at the beginning of 2025. Some of these canceled projects have also disappeared from the company's organizational charts, so it definitely looks like development has been terminated for good.</p>
<p>As the Horizon MMO was never formally announced, it is unlikely that an announcement will be made regarding the end of development. Still, this is definitely not a good look for Sony right now, whose push into live service games seems to have only brought disastrous results, with the failed launch of Concord last year and the recent cancelation of two other games in development by Bluepoint Games, who was developing a <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-live-service-canceled/">God of War live service game</a>, and Bend Studio. The Horizon multiplayer game, whose first look came with some leaked footage back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-multiplayer-early-footage/">2023</a>, on the other hand, is still in development, so Sony is still going ahead with expanding the franchise beyond the single-player boundaries set by the first two main entries in the series.</p>

            <p>An MMO based on Sony's Horizon IP has reportedly been cancelled.</p>
<p>We first got wind of a Horizon MMO in 2022, when a report stated the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-mmo-reportedly-in-the-pipeline">project was in the works at Guild Wars' NCSoft</a>. At this time, a source familiar with both Sony and NCsoft said the two companies had "tentatively agreed to pursue a business partnership in which [NCsoft] will create new games using Sony's promising game IP".</p>
<p>A year later in 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-report-of-horizon-mmo-ncsoft-and-sony-announce-strategic-partnership">Sony and NCsoft publicly announced a strategic partnership</a>, designed to "expand beyond console and broaden PlayStation's reach to a wider audience". While neither company referenced Horizon as part of the announcement, it was widely believed the series was a key part of the collaboration.</p>

<p>Since then we've heard little more, other than <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-mmorpg-is-now-essentially-confirmed-to-be-in-development-job-listing-suggests">job listings shared in 2023 which appeared to confirm the Horizon MMO was in development</a> with the codename Project Skyline (with the initial codename being Project H).

"Among them, 'H' and 'J' have already disappeared from the company's organisational chart," reads a translation of the report.</p>
<p>The Horizon MMO was reportedly set for a release on PC and mobile. Eurogamer has reached out to NCSoft and Sony with regards to today's report.</p>

            <p>
Nintendo has become the latest company to pull its advertising from a major Japanese broadcaster, after reports of a sex scandal involving the former frontman of a popular boyband and a female employee.
</p>
<p>
The <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a> maker is currently in the midst of an advertising campaign for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</a>, and had been subject to calls from fans to join a growing boycott of the high-profile Tokyo-based Fuji Television, <a href="https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOUF214EX0R20C25A1000000/?n_cid=SNSTW001&amp;n_tw=1737435375">Nikkei</a> reports (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendo-suspends-commercials-on-major-japanese-tv-network-amidst-sex-scandal/">Automaton</a>).
</p>
<p>
Fuji TV has been accused of setting up a June 2023 meeting under false pretenses between an unnamed female employee and Masahiro Nakai, a prominent actor and former lead of boyband SMAP.

<p>
It is alleged that Fuji TV falsely told its employee that she would meet Nakai at a company dinner alongside other attendees. In reality, the female presenter found herself meeting Nakai alone, and she was sexually assaulted.
</p>
<p>
According to Japanese newspaper reports, Nakai subsequently paid the woman 90m yen (around £470k) in an out of court settlement, which became public knowledge last month. Nakai has since issued an acknowledgement of "shortcomings".
</p>
<p>
For its part, Fuji TV has denied it deliberately set up the meeting, and begun an internal investigation to address concerns of a culture where male celebrities were given access to its female employees.
</p>
<p>
The channel will now replace regular TV advertising with public service announcements from non-profit organisations.

Capcom have declared that they hope to bring down the recommended PC specs for open world dinosaur-tipping simulator <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, just a month before release day on 28th February, and a few weeks ahead of the final open beta. Much like an exhausted hunter applying a carving knife to the flanks of a steaming heap of Rathalos, they shall trim and whittle their prize to its essential organs - hmm, actually we never see the concluding butchery in Monster Hunter games, now that I think of it. You just waft your knife around dramatically while the slaughtered quarry peacefully disappears and chunks of dino component materialise in your inventory.</p> <!--more-->
<p>I guess chopping off horns and tails in the preceding fight counts as "butchery", but this process is quite stagey too, somewhat scripted, a little bit... canned. Ugh, I am getting lost in the permutations. I no longer know how to make this metaphor work. Like a hunter fleeing a Rathalos that was actually only <em>playing</em> dead, I must make a terrified leap to the next paragraph.
</p>
<p>
The news comes via Capcom's <a href="https://x.com/DEMonsterHunter/status/1880661617249034446">German Xitter account</a>, as reported by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-updates-on-monster-hunter-wilds-performance-improvements-is-aiming-to-lower-pc-gpu-requirements">Eurogamer</a>, who note that Monster Hunter Wilds' existing PC system specs have "raised a few eyebrows" - especially given the last beta's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/buggy-monsters-in-monster-hunter-wilds-have-sparked-a-wave-of-low-poly-animal-adoration">slight tendency to make the monsters look like angry Dali paintings</a>. Capcom say they're focussing on the game's recommended GPU requirements, while also trying to improve performance. Here's a screenshot of the current PC specs from Steam, for context.
</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/PC-system-specs-21st-Jan-2025.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">

<p>
Seeking guidance from the gods, I ran those specs by our hardware editor James. Our remote-working format made it impossible to ascertain whether his eyebrows were raised, but he didn't seem to think the requirements were excessive. He did suggest that 140GB was quite a lot of SSD space, and that the recommended specs only allowing for 60 FPS with frame generation is a bit weird. And that the minimum GPU requirement is on the beefy side. Me, I'm still goggling at 16GB of RAM. I hear this is pretty standard nowadays, for a game with all three "A"s, but in my head, 8GB is still the norm for minimum spec.
</p><p>
I'm interested to know what you all think should be the minimum and recommended specs for a game of Monster Hunter Wilds stature right now. Both in terms of your own setups, and more abstractly in terms of what you consider a fair price for all those frames and pixels. Come, let us explore this vexing question as in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_men_and_an_elephant">parable</a> about the blind men feeling their way around the elephant, trying to ascertain its complete form. Wait a minute, this elephant has wings. It's that bloody Rathalos again.

			<p>While the cosy genre for some might mean a spot of farming or a touch of interior design, it’s tower defence that remains my calm, happy place. I’m not sure what that says about me, but it’s fair to say that IDUN – Frontline Survival puts you in that zen zone of constant watchfulness, laying down destructive towers while the hideous alien hordes attempt to overrun your defences. Ahhh, so cosy.</p>
<p><iframe title="IDUN: Frontline Survival - Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2eea98br6hc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You play Security Officer Ham, who’s literally having a nap on the job when you’re introduced to him. This is the only rest he’s getting though, with a grotesquely rude awakening when vermin start to attack your mining post. You have to rely on your trusty flamethrower turret and Ham’s shotgun to make it out alive. There’s a cool sci-fi story running through IDUN’s tower-centric action, presented with great-looking character art to back it up.</p>


<p>The narrative drive helps to get you dug in with IDUN’s different mechanics, from controlling multiple hero characters, alongside moving and shifting your towers to deal with threats in the moment. As with the best tower defence games, IDUN forces you to face huge swarms of incoming enemies and hold them off, and it’s a lot of fun doing so.</p>


<p>The thing is, this isn’t so much a tower defence game as it is an RTS defence game. It merrily skewers the two genres together, and if you’re a fan of either it’s a winning combination that takes very little time to get you hooked. You move your towers and heroes as you need them, and it maintains a frantic pace that isn’t often found in the defence genre.</p>
<p>The only downside to moving your towers around is that you potentially lose some of the strategy and decision-making that you do when placing things permanently. In return though, I really like the addition of hero characters that you can use to plug gaps and turn the tide in your favour, and the increased pace lends IDUN – Frontline Survival its own feel.</p>
<p>There’s resource collection to think of too, and it’s often like spinning a very angry plate, balancing the need to control resource nodes while protecting your drilling equipment and base. Collecting enough resources unlocks upgrades mid-mission, from extra towers to permanent upgrades. This gives you a constant flow of improvements and decisions to make, and you have to hope that you’re making the right one to deal with the incoming threats.</p>

<p>Things can become a little too hectic at times, and there were moments where I lost my hero characters amongst the writhing enemy hordes. That said, it’s so enjoyable, that you can look past the occasional foible. You can call down additional artillery fire to give you a boost when things are looking desperate, and you’ll probably find yourself using it every single chance you can.</p>
<p>IDUN – Frontline Survival is no joke, pushing you to the limit in terms of enemy numbers and resources. On Medium difficulty you’ll be up against it by the third level, but in turn it feels really well balanced, and victory is hard won and rewarding.</p>

<p>You can upgrade your crew using resources won through successfully completing missions, increasing their health, range, fire rate and more. In addition to that, there’s a vast number of different turrets and additional weaponry you can install from your space station, keeping things interesting as you progress, and hopefully helping you through to the other side.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		IDUN – Frontline Survival is an RTS/Tower Defence hybrid that sells the concept incredibly well. While there’s a few rough edges, if you’re a fan of either genre, it’s an edge-of-the-seat blast. 	</p></div>

			<p>There are some major strategy and simulation games that will be released this year, including the eagerly-awaited release of Civilization VII. If you're looking for a new strategy or simulation game, you'll want to keep your eyes on some of the titles on this list that are set to be released later this year. Without further ado, here are Wccftech's five most anticipated strategy and simulation games of 2025.</p>
<p><em>Previously on Wccftech's Most Anticipated Games of 2025: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-fighting-games-of-2025-off-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fighting</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-action-games-of-2025-excellence-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Action</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-indie-games-of-2025-retro-and-vibrancy/">Indie</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-roleplaying-games-of-2025-heroes-and-monsters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RPG</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-horror-games-of-2025-new-scares-inbound/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horror</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-sports-and-racing-games-of-2025-in-the-fast-lane/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sports and Racing</a></em></p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Civilization VII (February 11, 2025)</h2>
<p>The year is starting off really strong with <a href="https://wccftech.com/civilization-vii-announced-summer-game-fest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Civilization VII</a> from Firaxis. For some, it may feel like Civilization VI was released just a couple of years ago, but it was actually launched in 2016. Now, we are seeing a new era of Civ, with the latest game in the franchise set to be released on February 11, 2025. This game will be widely available, with those on Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and even Nintendo Switch able to get it in the future. For those who have pre-ordered the Deluxe Edition or the Founder's Edition, you'll get access to this title a full five days before the full release of the game, getting an advantage over those who will be waiting for the official release date, especially if you plan to play against them in multiplayer. You can check out the official PC system requirements <a href="https://wccftech.com/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-system-requirements-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Two Point Museum (February 27, 2025)</h2>
<p>The Two Point franchise has had some fantastic games, including Two Point Hospital and Two Point Campus. The latest iteration in the franchise allows you to become a museum owner, and is set to be the most ambitious in the franchise. For those who enjoyed the previous games in the franchise, you'll definitely want to keep your eye on this one. Especially if you've had dreams of owning your own museum, this will allow you to do just that. Two Point Museum is set to release on February 27 on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Football Manager 25 (March 2025)</h2>
<p>If playing the actual game of football doesn't do it for you, but you enjoy the management of creating your own teams and having them compete, Football Manager is the way to go. The game was originally set for <a href="https://wccftech.com/football-manager-25-announced-launches-november-26/">release last year</a> as usual, being an annual series, but has since been delayed by the developers, with the game now set to release sometime in March. For those interested, Football Manager 25 will be released on most systems, including the Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and even the Nintendo Switch.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Alliance of the Sacred Suns (2025)</h2>
<p>If you enjoy a 4X Strategy game set in space, then you'll want to keep your eyes peeled on Alliance of the Sacred Suns. It begins with your coronation as the new head of an empire, with the game ending when you die. Between the start and the end, you have a lot of major choices to make to ensure the survival of yourself as well as your empire. There are feuding houses, attempts at usurping the throne, and much more to keep you on your toes. At the moment, this game doesn't have a set release date but is due to come out later in 2025.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Commandos: Origins (March 2025)</h2>
<p>Commandos: Origins is that perfect hit of nostalgia that is set to be released later this year. This game is a long-awaited sequel in the Commandos franchise, a series that hasn't received a new release since 2006. There have been HD remasters of some of the classics in 2022, but this is a brand-new story that takes you back to the start of the elite force, where you get to experience their origin stories for the first time. It's set to be released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC in March; meanwhile, you can<a href="https://wccftech.com/commandos-origins-demo-released-for-pc-and-xbox-series-sx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> check out a demo</a> (available only on PC and Xbox).</p>

            <p>One piece of worldbuilding advice I've always found useful is to go at least one level deeper than the obvious. To wit: why have a lantern, asks <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mohrta">Mohrta</a>, when you can have a horrible vulture-esque creature called a lantern beast that lives on your head to light up the dark for you? "Found a good'un," I wrote in Slack shortly after playing Mohrta's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2881610/Mohrta/">Steam demo</a>. "It's so rad and strange!". Well, that's the pitch, reader. It's a "nonlinear FPS game blending action, exploration, and light dungeon crawling". Very rad. Very strange. Nom nom.</p>

<p>It's a world of stumpy, cowbell-wearing pet giraffes and ferocious avian nightmare bastards. These aren't things I'm used to dealing with on daily basis, so I naturally sought something to ground myself. Luckily, you start with a very nice, comfortingly chunky pistol with an excellent alt fire that unloads a full clip at whatever you're pointing at. Your sword also has an alt fire, as all good swords should. These use mana, which you can restore with a big sippy from your flask. And so you progress. Looking at things and going "oh yeah, that's cool", shooting very fast things that want you dead, and taking big sippies.</p>
<p>Between the vaguely futuristic modern and medieval bits, and the very strange horse your character rides, my mind naturally went straight to Wolfe's Book Of The New Sun. This is likely more recency bias than anything else, but there's definitely a sense of thick, somewhat pulpy history to the world, and I'm very curious to find out more about it. What's interesting is how the lore blurb would fit equally well for a modern military shooter, albeit one with a few supernatural elements:</p>
<blockquote><p>"A special military group known as "The Hayward" was formed to investigate and destroy the anomalies within The Strange. For years, the Hayward had done an admirable job of monitoring, handling, and reverse-engineering elements of the Great Strange into their work. Among these Hayward operatives is where your remains found new life."</p></blockquote>
<p>You'll often hear people say "graphics don't matter", but rarely the same about features. I must then conclude that most people care about features. As such, here are Mohrta's:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Adventure through an atypical take on the FPS genre.</li>
<li>Play through the game's five enormous and differently-themed dimensions in any order you choose.</li>
<li>Soak in the otherworldly atmosphere and lovingly-crafted level design.</li>
<li>Fight though a myriad of highly-detailed environments that push the limits of GZDoom.</li>
<li>Explore unusual settings, characters, and enemies fleshed out in beautiful signature Scumhead detail, featuring designs by Osiol.</li>
<li>Acquire a huge roster of weapons, each with multiple functions and utility.</li>
<li>Upgrade your weapons and gear, and choose a custom loadout that best suits your playstyle.</li>
<li>Over 50 diverse enemies and 20 challenging boss fights to dodge, shoot, and strike through.</li>
<li>Befriend a huge cast of strange and loveable NPCs, each with their own quests and storylines.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>This one's out sometime this year. It's from Oisol and Scumhead, who did <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/if-you-like-short-steampunk-snes-style-rpgs-give-dystopian-freebie-franzen-a-shot">Franzen</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marvel-snap">Marvel Snap</a> is back online, following its unexpected ban in the US.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-snap-gets-surprise-us-suspension-as-stateside-tiktok-ban-takes-effect">digital collectible card game was banned in the US alongside TikTok</a>, due to its publisher Nuverse being owned by TikTok owner ByteDance.</p>
<p>At this time, developer Second Dinner said the ban was every bit as much a "surprise" to the Marvel Snap team as it was to players, too. It went on to state it would do everything it could to get the game back up and running as quickly as possible. Second Dinner has now achieved this, and Marvel Snap is back online in the US.</p>

</figure>
<p>The developer is now "working to bring more services in-house and partner with a new publisher" to ensure this kind of surprise ban does not happen again.</p>
<p>Calling this move the "start of a new era" for the card game, the Marvel Snap team acknowledged players may have "more questions than answers". However, it assured its followers on social media that it would keep them updated with more details on the matter "as soon as possible".</p>
<p>There are still some remaining issues following Marvel Snap's suspension. Replying to users on X, Second Dinner said it is still working on restoring the game's App Store availability, adding this "may take some time".</p>
<p>It additionally noted "in-app purchases remain unavailable but the team is working on it". In the meantime, it said web shop purchases are all in working order, so players can go there for now.</p>

<p>Following its release, Marvel Snap won itself scores of fans, including many on the Eurogamer team. It was soon nominated for a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-ragnarok-sweeps-bafta-nominations">number of awards at prestigious events including the BAFTAs</a>.</p>
<p>Our Donlan was especially taken with Marvel Snap on its debut, praising the game for giving him some welcome moments to pause and reflect.</p>
<p>"Whenever I lose a game - and I lose all the time - I get to spend a pleasant few moments working out what went wrong, picking over my deck, and swapping cards in and out. There's a reward for being bad at the game. How kind," he wrote in his feature <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-of-2022-marvel-snap-offered-the-best-moments-of-reflection">Games of 2022: Marvel Snap offered the best moments of reflection</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Former Rare artist Kevin Bayliss has responded to Donkey Kong's redesign seen in the Mario Kart segment of the Switch 2 announcement.</p>
<p>As fans quickly spotted, the gorilla has received a bit of a redesign for the next karting game. He now looks closer to his film design and the retro design by Shigehisa Nakaue, with a cuter looking face.</p>
<p>Bayliss, who redesigned Donkey Kong for the SNES game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-country">Donkey Kong Country</a>, responded to a fan video spoofing the new look.</p>

The latest set for the popular card game, <em>Disney Lorcana Archazia's Island</em>, will introduce more beloved characters for collectors and players alike.</p>

<h2>The Disney Lorcana Archazia's Island Announcement</h2>

<p>In an official press release, Ravensburger showcased some card and product artwork for <em>Disney Lorcana Archazia's Island</em>.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/disney-lorcana-archazias-island-booster-box.jpg?itok=NhG-0Zti 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/disney-lorcana-archazias-island-booster-box.jpg?itok=cNIMY_dm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The first of these are the booster boxes. The artwork shows Encanto's Mirabelle, Bolt sporting a steampunk-esque leg attachment, Belle from Beauty and the Beast stepping into her father's footsteps with an engineer's outfit and an electric tool, The Mad Hatter brewing some tea, and Iago with his brazen scowl.</p>

The card sleeves sport both Cinderella and Ursula. One game mat features Tigger in a pirate outfit covered in rope high in a crow's nest. The other features the superhero team, Big Hero 6, in full costume.</p>

<p>As for the starter decks, they are appropriately on theme. The first shows Belle and The Beast and appears to be a Ruby and Sapphire deck. The Beast is more dapper than normal, sporting a glowing quill and even a monocle. I suppose Belle has rubbed off on him in the best way. The second starter deck sports Iago and Jafar and is an Amethyst and Steel deck.</p>

The aptly named <em>Reign of Jafar</em> involves the villain taking over Archazia's island, corrupting it into a menacing fortress.</p>

Well, if the art of the next set is anything to go on, something more nostalgic. The third set, <em>Fabled</em>, features a more classical version of Mickey and Minnie Mouse in medieval garb riding horses. The set will most likely be fairytale-themed with some early 1920s animation deep cuts thrown in for good measure.</p>

<p>Disney Lorcana Archazia's Island will be released in March 2025. <em>Reign of Jafar</em> will be released on June 6, 2025, with pre-release events happening on May 30, 2025. <em>Fabled</em> will be released sometime in Q3 of 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/is-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-a-sequel-answered/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is set to be released on February 4, introducing the world to one of the best RPGs slated for 2025. On social media and across the internet, gamers have been abuzz about the impending release, causing all manner of questions to surface about the open-world RPG.</p>



<p>In this guide, I’m addressing one of those questions: ‘Is Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 a sequel?’ That ‘2’ might be a bit of a giveaway, but let’s dive into the topic below and answer that question in full.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-is-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-set-after-kingdom-come">Is Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 Set After Kingdom Come?</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</a> is a direct sequel to the first game. It’s set mere months after the ending of the first game, which was released in 2018. In Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, players assume control of Henry of Skalitz once again, slotting them into a very familiar perspective, provided they’ve played Kingdom Come Deliverance.</p>



<p>KCD2 is as instant a follow-up game as you could ever hope to play. Many themes from the first game roll over into the second title, and it’s as though you’re picking the story up right where you left it at the end of Kingdom Come Deliverance.</p>



<p>That means you’ll recognise returning characters, and understand various plots and quests, and you’ll also be familiar with many of the game’s mechanics, such as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-lockpick-in-kingdom-come-deliverance-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lockpicking</a> or making potions <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-make-saviour-schnapps-kingdom-come-deliverance-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like Saviour Schnapps</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-you-need-to-play-kingdom-come-first">Do You Need to Play Kingdom Come First?</h2>



<p>In 2018, Kingdom Come Deliverance was released to a popular enough reception, despite being a relatively gruelling and realistic game that punished average gamers worldwide.</p>



<p>This story-rich, open-world game turned heads because it was so immersive and such a faithful representation of the setting, leaning on real people, places, and events to enrich the game.</p>



<p>That being said, it’s not <strong>necessary </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/do-you-need-to-play-kingdom-come-deliverance-before-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to play the first Kingdom Come Deliverance</a> before Kingdom Come Deliverance 2. This is because the developer, Warhorse Studios, has done a remarkable job with the writing of the second game, working in flashback sequences, conversations that dive into the first game’s history, and nods to the story of the opening title.</p>



<p>If you’ve not played Kingdom Come Deliverance (2018), you should be fine starting with Kingdom Come Deliverance 2.</p>



<p>That being said, the first game is stellar, and it shouldn’t be missed.</p>

<p>If you’re an avid social media user, you might have heard the debate recently regarding the ‘legitimacy’ of Elon Musk’s gaming successes. In recent weeks, claims from the enigmatic and eccentric billionaire surfaced, suggesting that he’s one of the top-ranked players in both games – and he appeared to have the numbers to back those claims up.</p>



<p>However, his bold claims attracted the attention of content creators familiar with the games he plays, and the holes in his story started to show quite quickly. In a follow-up conversation with a YouTuber named NikoWrex, Elon Musk admitted that he cheated in both games to get to where he is.</p>

<p>It’s no big secret that Elon Musk is an avid gamer. In the summer of 2023, Musk appeared in a live chat on Twitter (which was still <strong>named </strong>Twitter back then) and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elon-musk-diablo-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">started talking about his obsession</a> with Diablo 4, which had just been released at the time.</p>



<p>A couple of months later, he became one of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elon-musk-stream-success/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most instantly successful streamers</a>, broadcasting his Diablo 4 gameplay to a concurrent viewer count of more than <strong>1.3 million </strong>users. That act alone marked him as one of the most-watched streamers in history.</p>



<p>Since then, Musk’s gaming habits have been relatively public, and weeks ago, the topic of him being a ‘top 20 player’ in Diablo 4 surfaced once again. He was quickly investigated and called out by streamers like Asmongold, who promptly fell into a social media beef with the tech billionaire and close friend of President Trump.</p>



<p>Now, in a series of DMs exchanged between Elon Musk and NikoWrex, it has been confirmed that all this time, Elon Musk was cheating.</p>

<p>A bunch of screenshots have surfaced online showcasing the full conversation between Elon Musk and NikoWrex (thanks, <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/102692/elon-musk-confirms-he-cheated-to-become-top-player-in-path-of-exile-2-and-diablo-iv/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TweakTown</a>). In these screenshots, Musk admits that ‘it’s impossible to beat the players in Asia’ if you’re not <strong>sharing your account </strong>with other users.</p>



<p>Account sharing is a prohibited action under the terms of service for many online games, and if it isn’t, it’s a morally corrupt concept. It’s exactly what it sounds like – you share the details of your account with other users who play when you’re busy, sleeping, working, or something like that.</p>



<p>Musk said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The top accounts in Diablo or PoE require multiple people playing the account to win a leveling race.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Musk does insist that he’s still a cracked gamer, though:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>No matter how you cut it, a sub 2 min clear of the hardest level in Diablo is very fast. My run is posted to X. Very few mistakes were made.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Following the discourse, Elon Musk’s ex-wife took to social media to defend him, explaining:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Just for my personal pride, I would like to state that the father of my children was the first american druid in diablo to clear abattoir of zir and ended that season as best in the USA.</p>



<p>He was also ranking in Polytopia, and beat Felix himself at the game. I did observe these things with my own eyes. There are other witnesses who can verify this. That is all.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>However you think of his exploits in Diablo 4 and Path of Exile, it seems that Elon Musk is a talented gamer. </p>
