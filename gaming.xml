            <guid>1448962</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s one of my favorite times of the year – when game developers come out like Santa’s elves and show off what they’ve been working on in their hidden little workshops. That’s right, it’s time for another Steam Next Fest, and for the February Steam Next Fest of 2026, there are over 3,500 demos for people to try.</p><p>With all those demos to try, no one can play them all. But to help you out I’ve spent the last few weeks trying a bunch of them, and I’m here to point out 10 of the demos you really should check out. Some of them are popular, some of them are obscure, and I’ve tried to capture a variety of genres here so that there’s something for everyone.</p><p>With all of that here are ten of the best and most interesting February 2026 Steam Next Fest Demos.</p><h3><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3265700/Vampire_Crawlers_The_Turbo_Wildcard_from_Vampire_Survivors/" rel="nofollow"><em>Vampire Crawlers</em></a></h3><p>There were two dungeon crawlers in this Next Fest that fought for space in this top 10, and <em>Vampire Crawlers </em>beat out the boomer shooter inspired <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4176460/Dungeons_of_DUSK/" rel="nofollow"><em>Dungeons of Dusk </em></a>by New Blood in a messy match. <em>Vampire Crawlers's </em>sheer energy and style plays near perfectly mixing dungeon crawlers, roguelite deckbuilding, and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/vampire-survivors" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7938a993-0699-46f6-b76d-06acb4234348" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Vampire Survivors </em></a>IP into a cascade of fun.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vampire-crawlers-cards_0.jpg?itok=1tkZfocq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vampire-crawlers-cards_0.jpg?itok=LIEokzDE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p>It has some distinct and unique ideas that play differently in spots like the Crawler cards, and it feels really good to play. This was a demo I lost hours in, in a way that I never really have with <em>Vampire Survivors </em>itself.</p><h3><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3559900/Voidling_Bound_Demo/" rel="nofollow"><em>Voidling Bound</em></a></h3><p>I originally came across <em>Voidling Bound </em>last year, as they released their demo originally last spring. I’m happy that I can now talk about this monster taming/collecting game in this article, because it is a lot of fun. It takes that idea of finding and collecting monsters and turns it into a third-person shooter as you take control of the little creatures, called Voidlings, and explore and battle on different missions.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/voidling-bound.jpg?itok=tJvzQsyI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="810">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/voidling-bound.jpg?itok=2tV3NWFY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="506">
                  

  </picture><p>The controls are snappy, the combat fluid, and the variation in creatures and abilities intriguing. <em>Voidling Bound </em>is at its best in its exploration levels, but there’s fun in its hoard levels as well, and the mixture makes for a compelling proposition.</p><h3><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3110830/Bobo_Bay_Demo/" rel="nofollow"><em>Bobo Bay</em></a></h3><p>Sticking with cute little creatures, if you want a less action-packed game with little dudes, <em>Bobo Bay </em>might be up your alley. This is a game that takes inspiration from raising sims, and the Chao Garden from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/top-7-3d-sonic-games" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2dc244cb-c7c9-44f5-8d24-6555e3a2dce4" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Sonic Adventure </em></a>and has you raising these little creatures around and putting them into competitions.&nbsp;</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bobo-bay-fight.jpg?itok=lD5mliUg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="810">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bobo-bay-fight.jpg?itok=C3NDisBO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="506">
                  

  </picture><p>Get them trained up, fed up, and put them into competitions that their skills are best suited to and eventually into even bigger projects. Beyond that there’s a cheerful energy that infuses the game, and it's fun to move around in a way that a lot of games just don’t have.</p><h3><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4268760/Battlestar_Galactica_Scattered_Hopes_Demo/" rel="nofollow"><em>Battlestar Galactica: Shattered Hopes</em></a></h3><p>From the persistently cheerful realm of <em>Bobo Bay</em>, we go to the darkness of space, and that no less of the 12 Colonies. In command of a small fleet escaping the Cylon destruction, you must guide them through tough decisions and difficult battles as you attempt to rejoin the Battlestar Galactica with your own ship and the civilians you are protecting. More than anything, <em>Shattered Hopes </em>captures the feel of the modern <em>Battlestar Galactica </em>with the grimness, the desperation, and the constant need to keep moving.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlestar-galactica-shattered-hopes.jpg?itok=uj5_HDa1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlestar-galactica-shattered-hopes.jpg?itok=PLiZG6kb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p>It’s not the highest production tie-in, nor are its battles incredibly complicated, but they are tense, short, and designed to press you to make decisions and accept tradeoffs before you are able to jump away.</p><h3><em>Fading Echo</em></h3><p>This is a fast-paced action-adventure RPG game where you find yourself in control of elements and able to reshape the world around you with it. Turn into a ball of water like Samus’ morph ball and use that to put out fires or bounce around and through the water.&nbsp;</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fading-echo.jpg?itok=mdxtIuij 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1061">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fading-echo.jpg?itok=xsKkxWgF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="663">
                  

  </picture><p>Add in some cheek, and other elements to play with and <em>Fading Echo </em>is a lot of fun to move around, to explore, to solve puzzles, and fight in.</p><h3><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2704090/Celestial_Return/" rel="nofollow"><em>Celestial Return</em></a></h3><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/celestial-return.jpg?itok=sblx-iZI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="810">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/celestial-return.jpg?itok=Y6vi61jc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="506">
                  

  </picture><p>A story-driven RPG experience, <em>Celestial Return </em>posits a dark, and intriguing world where you play as a burnt-out detective who decides to care one last time. <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/disco-elysium" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="989e82b0-e77a-495c-9583-e4576fdec8c0" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Disco Elysium </em></a>meets <em>Blade Runner </em>with an intriguing way of handling luck by treating dice as a resource used for just about everything, and they come in a variety of forms. Combine that with a unique aesthetic and this is a must-play game.</p><h3><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4356650/Darkhaven_Demo/" rel="nofollow"><em>Darkhaven</em></a></h3><p>Like many of my generation, I grew up with <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/diablo-2-resurrected" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e6b5f480-dae1-474d-b3b6-92fd42fb08ac" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Diablo 2</em></a>, and that game is still shaping things with its new expansion and everything else. Somewhere along the way though, the ARPG genre kinda decided that it had already reached peak and just began doing small tweaks on the same format. Don’t get me wrong, I love games like <em>Torchlight </em>too, but I also wonder if anyone was going to ever move the line.</p><p>Well, some of the <em>Diablo </em>and <em>Torchlight </em>crew are back with <em>Darkhaven </em>and their big idea is essentially to mix the ARPG with survival games. Take the items and quests and mix that with the building and destructible world of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/minecraft" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="f896d9a3-1981-402e-9f6e-c0b67ed170cd" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Minecraft</em></a>, and you know what it? It works. The whole part of the world being so changeable creates significant differences in how the game plays, and new exploration options. Building here is kept simple so you aren’t tracking 30 things, and it gives the game a distinct feel.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/darkhaven.jpg?itok=nIuHOwds 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="810">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/darkhaven.jpg?itok=NeOZvf44 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="506">
                  

  </picture><p><em>Darkhaven</em>’s demo here is rawer than others, as the game is also <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/moonbeastproductions/darkhaven-an-action-rpg-with-dynamic-worlds/" rel="nofollow">currently on Kickstarter </a>seeking funding for another year of development. Right now what you have is a pre-alpha where you can see a lot of the seams and raw edges showing, but there’s a lot of promise here and room for something that is very different from what came before.</p><h3><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4210280/Titanium_Court_Demo/" rel="nofollow"><em>Titanium Court</em></a></h3><p>The most surreal game I experienced throughout Next Fest, <em>Titanium Court </em>is out there and it is weird in many many ways. The fourth wall gets leaned on, the world in it is odd, and its got weird-as-hell characters and interface interactions at times that delight in their surreal absurdism.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/titanium-court.jpg?itok=xgKpB8kJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="810">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/titanium-court.jpg?itok=Itwh8yBa 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="506">
                  

  </picture><p>While that might be enough to get interest, what you’ll find underneath is a deep strategy matching game that is unique in how it plays. The closest in someways is something like <em>Drop Dutchy</em>, but this focuses on match-3 type mechanics, and how different types of blocks and your subjects all interact as you try to maximize returns, minimize invasions, and find your way through a bizarre and compelling narrative.</p><h3><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4291770/Windrose_Demo/" rel="nofollow"><em>Windrose</em></a></h3><p>One of the interesting things you can watch at times on Steam is the population of survival-craft players. They emerge from one and will seemingly migrate en masse to another game. Sometimes you can even predict what the next one will be – and <em>Windrose </em>looks like it.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/windrose.jpg?itok=GsRTaaV_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="810">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/windrose.jpg?itok=dQvXCM1N 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="506">
                  

  </picture><p>And I mean, why not? It looks good, it's a golden age of piracy themed survival game, and it plays pretty well too. It has a bit more combat depth then many of these games, but features all the same tracks you would expect while having a few different things and a focus on sailing and finding treasure that you don’t see elsewhere necessarily in the genre. Arr Matey, hoist the jolly roger and prepare to battle as we seek revenge on Blackbeard himself!</p><h3><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2537470/Vultures__Scavengers_of_Death/" rel="nofollow"><em>Vultures - Scavengers of Death</em></a></h3><p>Have you ever wondered, what would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/resident-evil-20-years-later" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="cbe64463-3b9a-42c5-9a0c-c274b905de74" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Resident Evil </em></a>be like if it was turn based? Well you don’t need to really wonder any more, as <em>Vultures – Scavengers of Death </em>here presents a pitch-perfect take on the '90s horror styling turned into a tactics type experience. Seek what is causing the infected mutants (totally not zombies) to cause problems while managing your scarce resources and gathering more.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vultures.jpg?itok=SgWv3yMQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1061">

  </picture><p>Avoid combat where you can, beat enemies where you must, and wonder – what is that around that corner?</p></div><div><p><span><div>

<p>For years now, Valve fans have been making jokes about the company’s slow transition from game maker to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/civis/threads/the-team-fortress-2-steam-haberdashery-and-general-store.1163738/">glorified digital hat</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/10/valve-upends-the-cs2-item-marketplace-with-new-trade-up-update/">knife paint marketplace</a>. This week, though, a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/02/new-york-sues-valve-for-enabling-illegal-gambling-with-loot-boxes/">lawsuit brought by the state of New York</a> argues that Valve’s in-game loot box sales amount to an illegal gambling outfit worth tens of billions of dollars.</p>
<p>Lawyers who have looked into the particulars of the case tell Ars that the state faces an uphill battle in convincing courts that this portion of Valve’s business legally constitutes gambling. That said, there are a few elements of the case that might make Valve legally vulnerable to the state’s arguments.</p>
<h2>What is gambling, anyway?</h2>
<p>For a game to legally be counted as “gambling” in most jurisdictions, it has to pass a three-part test: a player has to pay money (1) for an outcome that’s materially determined by chance (2) in the hopes of receiving something of value (3). While buying a key to a loot box in a Valve game easily passes those first two tests, New York’s legal case will likely hinge on whether the random cosmetic items players get from those loot boxes constitute “something of value” for statutory purposes.</p>
<p>Even though loot box purchasers don’t know what item they’ll get, the fact that they know they’re getting <em>something</em> for their money could matter legally. “Gambling traditionally means risking money and possibly getting nothing,” Foundation Law Group Counsel Jonathan Loiterman told Ars. “Here, buyers can’t lose their stake in the traditional gambling sense; they always receive an item. That looks more like buying a randomized product than placing a bet.”</p>
<p>In this way, Valve’s loot boxes are more akin to physical “blind box” toy sales or collectible card packs than a game like blackjack or roulette. In the real world, these kinds of randomized sales “are not considered gambling because the stated value of what you receive is unchanging,” Hoeg Law Firm attorney Richard Hoeg told Ars. “You pay for a pack of cards, you get a pack of cards.”</p>

          
                      
                  </div>

              If Valve’s loot boxes are a form of gambling, then buying a pack of Pokémon cards probably is as well.

<p>That “stated value” logic can sometimes be even stronger in the digital realm, where the randomized items you get from a loot box are locked to your account and can’t easily be resold. “Digital sellers usually try to get around this by stating that everything sold has zero cash value, so you are always getting ‘nothing,’” as Hoeg put it.</p>
<h2>Come to our Marketplace</h2>
<p>Where Valve might have some unique legal exposure, lawyers tell Ars, is in its operation of the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/market/">Steam Marketplace</a>, where players can trade in-game items for Steam Wallet funds. Operating that kind of official exchange for players to extract value from items won “starts to look a lot more like gambling,” Hoeg said.</p>

<p>“The problem here is 100% the ability to resell the items from the loot boxes,” attorney and <a href="https://lawofthegame.com/">video game law expert</a> Mark Methenitis tells Ars. “A loot box/gacha mechanic is fine when you can’t turn around and resell the items because you’re not getting something of value. When Valve is also providing a marketplace for those items, they’ve added the third element.”</p>
<p>Still, Loiterman said that the existence of the Steam Marketplace resale market “matters, but it’s not decisive” in this case. While taking a commission on digital item sales “strengthens the argument that these items have economic value,” that fact alone “doesn’t transform a randomized purchase into gambling,” he added.</p>

<p>Part of the problem for New York’s argument is that the Steam Wallet funds players receive for selling their items can only be spent on the Steam platform, putting them a few steps away from cold, hard cash or even casino chips. And while New York’s lawsuit argues that players can get cash out of their Steam Wallets by buying and reselling Steam Deck hardware in the real world, that argument is not a legal slam dunk.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
            
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>“Calling it gambling because a user could, through several indirect steps, convert an item into cash risks stretching gambling law beyond its traditional limits,” Loiterman said. “If New York’s theory wins, it raises uncomfortable questions about things like Pokémon cards or promotional games (e.g. McDonald’s Monopoly). Courts will be cautious about going that far.”</p>
<p>New York also argues that Valve tacitly endorses third-party services that allow players to easily “cash out” their Steam inventories for real money. Whether Valve is culpable for the existence of those services is still an unsettled question in the law, Methenitis said, as it has been at least since he <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=987056">wrote about the legal implications of <em>World of Warcraft</em>‘s third-party gold resellers</a> nearly two decades ago.</p>
<p>“I think companies have a pretty strong [legal] argument if they make some attempts to police [third-party resellers]—they obviously can’t fully control what people do outside their platform,” Methenitis said. “But if they turn a blind eye to it and allow it, I think they could be found liable.” Loiterman agreed that Valve “providing the tools that enable those [third-party] markets and tolerating them creates some degree of responsibility.”</p>
<h2>“Judges tend to be cautious…”</h2>
<p>In the end, the lawyers Ars spoke to were generally skeptical that courts would determine that Valve’s loot box system constitutes illegal gambling. Cases making similar arguments about other loot box systems have failed in other jurisdictions, “in part because gambling laws were drafted with casinos and lotteries in mind,” Loiterman said. “Judges tend to be cautious about breaking from an emerging consensus.”</p>
<p>Hoeg agreed that “the entire question [in this case] is novel, and… the courts are (small-‘c’) conservative institutions, not generally wanting to adopt novel arguments without direction from the legislative branches.” Even if Valve’s loot box system “may start to smell a bit like gambling,” Hoeg said he would “honestly be surprised if the courts went along with the characterization without a new law aimed at it.”</p>
<p>“I view it as a weak case offered primarily for political grandstanding/coverage over real legal effect,” Hoeg concluded. “We shall see, though.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>The <em>Resident Evil</em> series, historically, has been about a lot of things. Zombies, obviously, but also the global ravages of a feckless pharmaceutical company and, in its own often-campy way, the politics surrounding that. You might remember, for example, that time all of Raccoon City <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr-aVIri1Mo&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>got obliterated by a nuclear bomb</u></a>. Charged imagery, to be sure, but was <em>Resident Evil 3</em> trying to say anything weighty or consequential with it back then? And what is <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em>, in returning to that setting, trying to say with it now? On the latest Aftermath Hours, we attempt to answer those questions.</p><p>This time around we’re joined by two critics who’ve played through <em>Requiem </em>and <a href="https://www.theringer.com/2026/02/25/video-games/resident-evil-has-always-been-horrifying-and-hilarious-requiem?ref=aftermath.site"><u>articulated their thoughts about it</u></a>: freelancer and Aftermath columnist Joshua Rivera and Polygon editor-at-large Giovanni Colantonio, whose <a href="https://www.polygon.com/resident-evil-requiem-review/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>review of <em>Requiem</em></u></a><em> </em>– which put the game in conversation with the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki – has drawn some pretty vocal criticism these past few days. We discuss whether or not the text of the game actually supports that kind of close thematic read.</p><p>We also discuss <em>Resident Evil</em> more broadly: where it’s coming from, where it’s going, and of course, where <em>Requiem </em>fits into all of that. The series has spent its past few installments promising a fresh start; does <em>Requiem </em>actually deliver, or is it lured astray by the siren’s call of Leon Kennedy-flavored nostalgia? And during an era that’s decidedly post-zombie, what makes this series, in particular, so enduring?</p><p>Finally, we come up with some truly diabolical remake ideas for old-school games and conclude that there’s actually no such thing as a long or short game. Who needs to stick around for 100 hours when you can make your own ending whenever you want to?</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Spotify</u></a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Apple</u></a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts.

<!--kg-card-end: html-->
<p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Giovanni:</strong> It’s tough because there are specific moments – and this is the tough thing about a pre-release write up – I want to point to that are off limits for now, and there’s a question to be had about “Eh, maybe that should wait [until after release] to have the full scope of the thing.” I’ve always heard [Hiroshima and Nagasaki] referenced in terms of <em>Resident Evil 3</em>; I’ve heard people talk about that. I’ve never quite bought into it. I’ve always thought of it like the ‘90s and “Cool guys don’t look at explosions.” Everything blows up in these games. I never paid much mind to that.</p><p>There are a couple moments in <em>Requiem </em>that I do think kind of, to varying degrees of explicitness, at least reference it. Not saying it specifically, but there is one case where I think it does actually point to it in a way that’s surprising. But I started thinking about it [in terms of] “Is this a game that is looking back at what happened in <em>Resident Evil 3</em> and looking at it through the lens of a greater tragedy?” I was doing research into that, and I found an old research paper from 2019 that was focused on [original<em> Resident Evil </em>director] Shinji Mikami’s work. It was a piece about unpacking a lot of that post-war feeling in his work. I don’t know that I even necessarily fully agree with that research paper. There were some parts of it where I was like “<em>Dino Crisis</em> fits into this? I don’t know. Seems like a stretch.”&nbsp;</p><p>But I think it got the wheels turning, and with some of the symbols and lines that are in <em>Requiem</em>, I got to thinking about if this is a game about Leon dealing with a trauma that is referencing the trauma [of nuclear devastation]? And are we supposed to take it as he’s experiencing this long aftermath of this trauma that’s coming from a real place of anxiety?</p><p>So that’s how I got onto that train of thought, and I do think there are things you can point to that are there. I think the question that arises, though, is: Even if that stuff is there, is <em>Resident Evil</em> equipped to talk about that in any way? I’ve been thinking about that a lot in the past couple days. This has always been a series that has political undertones in its lore. There’s an evil Big Pharma company, and it’s making bioweapons and trading those with the US government.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpas81Pd97Q&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Zombie president</u></a>!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Giovanni: </strong>Yeah, there’s weird threads. They’ve always been kinda funny, but there’s also stuff in there that’s very strange and pointed. A distrust for authority is baked into all of Shinji Mikami’s work – even <em>Dino Crisis</em>. So the question that arises for me that I haven’t fully unpacked yet is, even if that’s what the reference is – and I think it’s fair to say “Eh, that’s probably a stretch” – is <em>Resident Evil</em> as a series, a goofy thing, equipped to deal with something like that? And is any triple-A game?&nbsp;</p><p>Josh, you wrote something that I really love; you say that even if games reference something like this, what do you <em>do </em>in the game? What does the gameplay come down to at the end of the day? <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em>, at the end of the day, is a big, fun shooting action game where you’re killing zombies, and zombies are the bodies of the dead. How do we feel about that [in this context]?</p><p>Josh, is there space for <em>Resident Evil</em> as you’ve talked about it, as a work of pure schlock, to talk about things and reference them, or should we take it as being a little too dumb to really say anything serious about this – and interpreting it that way is kind of a fool’s errand?</p><p><strong>Joshua:</strong> I think it’s a fool’s errand. I also think the series is capable of [aspiring to something more serious] if they wanted to. My example in support of this is actually <em>Resident Evil 7</em>, which opens with a very clear <em>Texas Chainsaw Massacre</em> homage. There’s some hicksploitation going on there. And it has a scene at the very end where you link with the mold, which is the evil presence – it’s very silly – that’s made these people what they are. That neglect from this pharmaceutical company poisoned these people’s land and turned them into monsters. You get to speak with the real Jack Baker, a sympathetic, tragic figure. </p><p>I think the game means that. I think the people behind the game were interested in some type of pathos because that’s part of what they wanted to do with that game: ground you not just in Ethan Winters and the first-person [perspective], but also relating to these characters as you would in the first-person.&nbsp;</p><p>So I do think the games are capable of it; I don’t think this game is interested in that. I don’t think it’s crazy for someone to see what you saw, Gio, and to consider it in relation to the game. But I do think there is a matter of scope and justification. That’s a big check that you write – that anybody writes if they’re pulling from something outside of the text. The sticking point for me, then, is “How do I justify referencing a real historical tragedy and also a people in connection to that tragedy?”</p><p>The first thing I would go to is just a simple question of visual language. I think about 9/11; because of the generation we’re a part of, most people in the creative workforce are about our age or older. We have a visual language for how a city falls apart. We have a very specific image culturally for what that looks like. So if we are going to show a city falling apart, that is what we’re gonna think of and that is what we’re gonna replicate. Does it mean that the work in which we do that is about that? Not necessarily. Then again, this is also a matter of interpretation and intent. They could be totally separate things. This is what [the concept of] death of the author talks about.</p><p>For example, <em>The Avengers</em>. That’s very much a movie about “What if we could stop 9/11?” That’s not necessarily what the people who made that movie were thinking, but that’s kind of what’s in that movie. Or the new <em>Superman </em>movie – maybe less so. I think that movie has different aims.&nbsp;</p><p>You put even more of a burden of proof on yourself when you also invoke a people and a place and a culture in addition to the imagery of a historical event. That’s where I’ve got my guard up. I’m gonna call out something specifically, and it was not something that was in your review; this is something I saw in defense of your review from people who read it, and it really bugged me. People were like “It makes sense and it’s natural to think of Hiroshima in a work made by Japanese people featuring a bombed city.” It’s one of those “Listen to yourself” moments. Natural for you. That is your only frame of reference for this place, this people, this culture. You swap out any other atrocity with any other group of people, and fuck you, you know? “It’s natural for this Latino man to be evoking colonialism and the conquest of Borinquen.” Listen to yourself.&nbsp;</p><p>I think what’s interesting – and what I struggle with a little bit in your reading, Giovanni – is that you do evoke the Hibakusha [bombing survivors]. We know how Japanese culture evokes that imagery. They were a protected class. There is a very sober and sacred evocation of these people and what they went through. If we think this is something that is being referenced, I think we would also see that somber, careful treatment [in <em>Requiem</em>]. And I don’t think that’s there. So for me, that’s not where I would go.</p><p><strong>Giovanni: </strong>Yeah, fair enough. I think that’s a really interesting way to read it, because yeah, I agree: If we are talking about survivors, this is a tough series to put that into! And again, I do think there are little references to it – there are things to my read that that’s coming from – but I don’t think that necessarily means that’s what the game is about. </p><p>I would actually argue, and I want to make this clear: I think the game, if we’re giving it an About, is very broadly about trauma. It’s about Grace experiencing it on this micro scale, dealing with the loss of her mother; it’s about Leon dealing with it on a larger scale of “All these people in this city that I was sworn to protect are gone.” It’s having two characters face that in very different ways – almost a fight or flight response between them. That’s what I would say the game is actually about, and that’s the wider point that I would point to if we were getting into that.&nbsp;</p><p>But yeah, I agree: If the intent is to invoke this [real-world tragedy], it’s certainly not terribly respectful. And I think that’s a good point, to be like “Well, you would think that they would be more respectful if that was the case.” I think that’s legitimate. </p><h2 id="recommended">Recommended</h2><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/resident-evil-requiem-nintendo/"><div><p>Nintendo’s Trailers Of Violent Games Are Full Of (Purposefully?)

Now, that's no longer the case.</p><figure role="group">

<p>In the Switch version, however, both of those tickets are simply automatically handed to you upon beating the Elite Four, at least according to the aforementioned Japanese speedrunner's playthrough of the game.</p><p>This means that you'll have the chance to confront Deoxys, Ho-Oh, and Lugia over the course of a normal playthrough rather than needing to be in the right place at the right time, which is great news for those of us who chronically miss these kinds of events.</p><p>Just in case you missed the news, <em>Pokemon FireRed and LeafGreen </em>were <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-firered-leafgreen-switch" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="057d121c-d519-4dfa-af54-03ce59fa9f52" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">re-released on Switch today</a> as part of the franchise's 30th anniversary.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Game Boy is back but it only plays music from the Kanto region. Nintendo is spending nearly $2 billion on stock buybacks from Japanese banks. And the cool-looking <em>He-Man</em> brawler finally has a release date. It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news, rumors, and culture.</p> <p>I was up until 3:00 a.m. playing <em>Marathon</em> last night and I’m currently paying for it. There have been lots of complaints about everything from the UI to the ammo economy, but I think <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-ammo-pvp-ui-bungie-feedback-server-slam-2000674385">a lot of the complaints so far are kneejerk reactions to a rough onboarding process</a>. The real problem is that nobody’s on proximity chat. <a href="https://x.com/ethangach/status/2027261704556429662">It’s ruthless out there</a>. Tau Ceti IV is no post-apocalyptic Calabrada.</p>

 <h2>The Game Boy Jukebox is pricey but adorable</h2> <p>It was revealed during today’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-30-anniversary-stream-recap-winds-waves-2000674383"><em>Pokémon</em> 30th Anniversary Presents</a> and it might be the oddest little lo-fi gadget of 2026. The Game Boy Jukebox plays music instead of games, and only from the original <em>Red</em> and <em>Blue Pokémon</em> games, and only if you insert one of 45 small cartridges corresponding to the track you want. It’s absurd, but I respect it.</p> <p>Also, it’s $70. Which is less respectful and even more absurd. I won’t buy one, but I definitely want one. Maybe DIY chiptune artists can do some really cool homebrew hacks with it. If nothing else, it will look perfect on a shelf since we’re probably not getting an actual Game Boy classic device from Nintendo anytime soon. The Jukebox <a href="https://x.com/videogamedeals/status/2027392133242462559/photo/1">goes on sale later today</a>.</p>

 <h2><em>D</em><em>i</em><em>s</em><em>gaea</em> gets a surprise action-RPG spin-off</h2>  <p>It’s called <em>Disgaea Mayhem</em> and it turns the long-running tactical JRPG series into a real-time brawl-fest. You play as a candy-loving mercenary who can wield all the weapons you’d find in your standard<em> Disgaea</em> entry. I’m not gonna lie, the action looks floaty and stiff in the trailer, but there are lots of big numbers, and I’m sure endless dungeons to grind. It hits Switch, PS5, and PC this summer.</p>

 <h2>It’s raining XP in <em>Fallout 76</em> after the game’s 66th update</h2> <p>As <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fallout/fallout-76-adjusted-roughly-50-events-and-activities-for-the-latest-free-update-with-more-xp-for-higher-levels-and-shorter-timers-we-tried-to-concentrate-on-the-broad-strokes/"><em>PC Gamer</em> reports</a>, all the in-game events have been buffed. The XP they award now scales with your level; some of them are shorter, so they feel less tedious and unrewarding, and revised icons make it easier to tell which event is which on the map. It might be time to go back to Appalachia for a bit.</p> <h2>Nintendo is doing a massive $1.9 billion stock buyback</h2> <p>That’s a lot of cash to burn making anxious investors happy. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/sustainable-finance-reporting/nintendo-plans-around-19-billion-share-sale-by-kyoto-bank-others-sources-say-2026-02-27/"><em>Reuters</em> reports</a> that it’s mostly big institutional banks like MUFG Bank and the Bank of Kyoto selling shares back to Nintendo following political pressure to have companies insulate one another less from outside shareholders.</p>

 <h2>The new retro <em>He-Man</em> beat-em-up finally has a release date</h2>  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Fr8DPSD9E">A new trailer</a> confirms the Saturday-special-looking <em>He-Man and the Masters of the Universe: Dragon Pearl of Destruction</em><em>&nbsp;</em>will be out April 28 across console and PC. It looks cool as heck and very old-school, though hopefully it plays better than some of the other licensed retro brawlers in recent years. It’ll be out just a month and change shy of the new movie’s arrival in theaters.</p> <h2>A former Xbox executive gives the new one some advice</h2> <p>“I wish her all the best,” Xbox’s old E3 tattoo artist Peter Moore <a href="https://gamesbeat.com/for-the-new-xbox-ceo-listening-is-good-peter-moore-interview/">told <em>GamesBeat</em></a> about new Microsoft Gaming CEO Asha Sharma. “She’s in a position right now where–keep your head down. Fly low. Avoid the radar. Learn, listen. Spend a lot of time internally. Travel the world. Meet with the studio heads. Do the classic listening tour, which a lot of executives do. I think she’ll be fine. She’s gotta explain AI and her background. That’s a minefield. I would, for me, avoid talking about that if you possibly can. But I wish her all the best.”</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/project-windless-chicken-protagonist-patrik-methe-2000674111">Gamers are picking sides in the unexpected gambling lawsuit against Valve</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/demon-tides-steam-review-impressions-platformer-3d-2000674085"><em>Demon Tides</em> has the wonderfully breezy spirit of a classic PlayStation platformer</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/project-windless-chicken-protagonist-patrik-methe-2000674111">The makers of <em>Project Windless</em> didn’t expect its swole chicken to steal the show at this month’s State of Play</a></strong></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Legend of <a href="https://twitter.com/BalatroGame?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@BalatroGame</a> DrSpectred aka Balatro University hits the naneinf with No Jokers Equipped and a 755 card deck <a href="https://t.co/oaadtzqGPe">pic.twitter.com/oaadtzqGPe</a></p> <p>— Yung Skrrt™ (@yungskrrt) <a href="https://twitter.com/yungskrrt/status/2025393531125465102?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 22, 2026</a></p></blockquote>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/amazon-god-of-war-tv-series-enters-production-first-look-kratos-atreus/</link>
            <guid>1448854</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Amazon Prime Video</strong> has revealed our first look at <strong>Kratos</strong> and <strong>Atreus</strong> in the upcoming <strong>God of War TV</strong> series led by <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/first-god-of-war-tv-series-details/">Ronald D. Moore</a></strong>, which we had previously learned was set to start filming in <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-god-of-war-tv-show-begins-filming-march-2026/"><strong>March 2026</strong>,</a> has already kicked off with actors <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-show-amazon-prime-ryan-hurst-kratos-cast/">Ryan Hurst</a></strong> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/callum-vinson-will-play-atreus-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-show/"><strong>Callum Vinson</strong> </a>in full costume and makeup for their roles.</p>



<p>The image clearly depicts a scene from the very beginning of the <strong>God of War (2018)</strong> game, where Atreus and Kratos go hunting immediately after burning the ashes of Kratos' wife and Atreus' mom. Kratos is testing Atreus, to see if he is capable of making the journey that they are about to embark on to spread the ashes at the highest peak in all nine realms.</p>



<p>Of course, we know that the full journey encapsulates so much more than that, but as far as this first look goes, it's a pretty solid and iconic choice. The opening of the 2018 game is emotional and heavy, and this is a great callback to make for fans of the games, while also being a solid shot of the characters in their main roles of father and son.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>With all of that said, the first comment under this photo, which is that this "<em>Looks like a cosplay from E3 2018</em>," and some of the other negative comments are not entirely out of line in their displeasure. God of War fans understand the importance of the scene, the costuming and makeup teams have clearly done a great job with getting everything about the look of Kratos and Atreus right, but at least in a single screenshot, it does not have the sense of magic and mythological wonder that the same scene in the game carries.</p>



<p>Maybe it's the fact that this is just a still image, with no music to support it, and that we have yet to hear how either actor sounds in these roles. Maybe once all those missing pieces are included, it'll actually look and feel how we might expect a God of War TV adaptation to look and feel.</p>



<p>Or maybe we'll start to see that when we see the rest of the cast in full makeup and costume. The most recent addition to the cast came earlier this week with <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-amazon-series-rebel-moons-ed-skrein-will-play-baldur/"><strong>Ed Skrein</strong> getting tapped to play <strong>Baldur.</strong></a> and now that the show has entered production, we'll hopefully soon learn who will be filling the last major role yet to be publicly revealed, <strong>Freya</strong>.</p>



<p>As a reminder, here's the list of the show's cast so far: </p>



<ul>
<li>Ryan Hurst - Kratos</li>



<li>Callum Vinson - Atreus</li>



<li>Alastair Duncan - Mimir</li>



<li>Danny Woodburn - Brok</li>



<li>Jeff Gulka - Sindri</li>



<li>Teresa Palmer - Sif</li>



<li>Ólafur Darri Ólafsson - Thor</li>



<li>Max Parker - Heimdall</li>



<li>Mandy Patinkin - Odin</li>



<li>Ed Skrein - Baldur</li>
</ul>

He joined in 2018, and after a two-year stint at Polygon, he rejoined <em>The Verge</em> in May 2025.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>There’s a sale happening at Woot that’s delivering Black Friday-esque deals on video games through March 5th. The <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://electronics.woot.com/plus/video-games-for-all/" rel="sponsored">“Video Games for All” sale</a> includes discounts on physical games for most modern consoles, making it a great time to treat yourself (or a pal) to some titles that you’ve been waiting to see big price drops for. There are also deals on gaming accessories like totes, controllers, and more. Through February 27th at 11:58PM CT, you can score an additional 20 percent off products looped into this sale by entering the code <strong>LEVEL20 </strong>at checkout (it caps at $30 total off your order).</p><p>Everyone’s tastes are different, but some picks in this sale that especially vibe with me include <em><a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/silent-hill-f-amazon-exclusive-day-one-edition/" rel="sponsored">Silent Hill F</a></em>, which is fun and very different beast from Bloober Team’s <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake (less item hunting, more countering enemy attacks). Of course, who can argue against the pure fun contained within the <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/super-mario-galaxy-super-mario-galaxy-2z-3" rel="sponsored"><em>Super Mario Galaxy</em> double-pack</a> for Switch that includes the original title and its sequel? It’s always cliché to say that there’s something for everyone here, but I think it’s actually true this time.</p><div><p id="more-deals-and-discounts"><h2>More deals and discounts</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>Sometimes, a rug or table can pull the room together. In the event that doesn’t work, <strong>Govee’s Pendant Light</strong> might just be the ticket. This height-adjustable smart light makes for a fun upgrade in your home, and it’s now selling at its lowest price yet at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Govee-Three-Layer-Compatible-2700K-6500K-Adjustable/dp/B0FHQ3JQ9C/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>. Normally $149.99, it’s down to $109.98. The dimmable LED enclosure is shielded by a smokey, translucent shell, and it’s capable of displaying three different lighting configurations at once. In other words, you can create some interesting color combinations if the mood strikes, or simply use it as a regular light. It can go between 2700K and 6500K color temperatures, and it’s Matter-compatible so it ties in neatly with plenty of smart home ecosystems.</span></li><li><span>There is always a new set of wireless earbuds to consider. Companies launching in the $200 or so price range have their work cut out for them because there are already well-established leaders, but it’s another story for the sub-$50 models. Despite the low price, they can be mighty impressive. An example of that is the <strong>Skullcandy Dime 3 earbuds</strong>, which are just $19.88 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Skullcandy-Wireless-Earbuds-Microphone-Bluetooth/dp/B0CFCQVZS6/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSKULLCANDY-DIME-XT-3-TRUE-WIRELESS-IN-EAR-SOFT%2F13825259413" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a>, and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fskullcandy-dime-3-true-wireless-earbuds-black%2FJ3GTFHVJ9P%2Fsku%2F6580352%2F" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a> (originally $34.99) in multiple color schemes. This price has been available for much of this month, but in case the right time to buy for you is now, these offer up to 20 hours of battery life thanks to their lanyard-equipped charging case. Other features include multipoint pairing, letting you tether to more than one device over Bluetooth simultaneously. The Dime 3 also offer built-in Tile tracking, which is possible through the Tile mobile app.</span></li><li><span>So much for the Super Bowl being when the biggest TV deals land. <strong>LG’s 48-inch C5 OLED TV</strong> is currently selling at its best-ever price at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DYQ41RHB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, costing $819.99 (this model was $999.99 at the beginning of this month). Currently, it’s just about $80 cheaper than the smaller 42-inch version, and almost $400 cheaper than the 55-inch version.

              <p>When it became obvious there was going to be no new mainline&nbsp;<em>Pokémon</em> game in 2025, it raised a huge question about what would happen to the <em>Pokémon</em> TCG. The three-yearly cycle had become so normal that the card game was built around it, releasing sets themed around the new monsters and mechanics added to each new gaming entry, so what would it do when that was taken away? The answer, it turned out, was the revival of Mega Evolution, loosely tied into the events of <em>Pokémon</em>&nbsp;<em>Z-A</em>, but mostly just doing its own nostalgic thing. But now we know that <em>Pokémon</em>&nbsp;<em>Winds</em> and&nbsp;<em>Waves</em> won’t be out until 2027! So what then? Step forward, the 30th Anniversary Set.</p> <p>During the <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-30-anniversary-stream-recap-winds-waves-2000674383">30th anniversary Pokémon Presents</a>, among its lacking assortment of announcements, there was a brief appearance of the <em>TCG—</em>albeit a very opaque one. The one solid piece of information we received was that the new cards will—for the first time ever—release simultaneously worldwide. Cards are usually released in Japan first, in the country’s own bespoke sets, and then repurposed for the rest of the world in differently arranged and titled collections.</p>

 <p>The minute-long inclusion showed a range of favorite cards from the last 30 years, often in non-English versions, before faux-interrupting itself to reveal Mew and Mewtwo seemingly on some sort of LSD trip. But nothing tangible, nothing we could infer. Could it be the case that this wasn’t a gallery of old faves, but potentially cards that will be included in the new sets?</p>  <p>That’s what’s being claimed by some sites, like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wargamer.com/pokemon-trading-card-game/30th-anniversary-set-classic-cards"><em>Wargamer</em></a>, convinced that the cards shown will be part of this celebratory series of sets. And you can see why, given the clip is so infuriatingly uninformative, and especially the choice to show the classic cards in very many different languages, and then finishing on the news that it will release simultaneously worldwide. It seems to speak to this international approach.</p>

 <p>I’m not convinced. I think the intention here was to fly through the TCG’s 30-year history, given the cards appeared in chronological order, beginning with that classic Chonkachu #58 and the infamous holo Charizard from the Base Set (although here shown as Glurak, its German name), before jumping to a French Palkia Lv. X from <em>Diamond </em>&amp;<em> Pearl</em>‘s Great Encounters and a Japanese Lugia from Wind from the Sea (2008 and 2002 respectively). We then get a Spanish Uxie Lv. 55 from Legends Awakened (also 2008), followed by the briefest glimpse of both halves of the Darkrai &amp; Cresselia Legend from <em>HS</em> Triumphant (2010), a Genesect EX from 2013’s Pokémon Blast, and a Chinese Solgaleo GX (2017 for the English version). Finally there’s a burst of four: Pikachu &amp; Zekrom’s Tagteam from 2019’s Team Up in Thai, Zacian V from 2020’s Sword &amp; Shield base set in Korean, Arceus VSTAR from 2022’s Brilliant Stars in Indonesian, and finally a silver-edged Amazing Rare Raikou from Pokémon’s 2020 arrival in Chinese.</p>

 <p>The only oddity in there is that Chinese Solgaleo GX, as at that point the game hadn’t launched in China. It was, however, released as part of the Chinese Storming Emergence Radiant set in 2022, making it a&nbsp;<em>really</em> weird pick for this montage. My suspicion is less that this is an indication of a new version of the card, and more that someone made a cock-up.</p> <p>There is of course precedent for re-releasing classic cards as part of an anniversary collection. For the 25th birthday in 2021, Celebrations was released which included the 25-card Classic Collection featuring reprints of various cards from the previous years, marked by a Pikachu head. Then there was 2016’s XY Evolutions that was primarily made up of reprints of Base Set cards, infuriatingly similar to the originals but for a tiny set symbol. So, yeah, it’s entirely possible.</p>

 <p>We’ve reached out to Pokémon to see if we can get any clarification, but given <a href="https://www.pokebeach.com/2025/11/celebration-collection-set-name-trademarked-for-the-pokemon-tcg"><em>PokeBeach</em> is claiming</a> the sets won’t start releasing until October of this year, it seems likely the company will keep quiet about it until nearer the end of this Mega Evolutions era.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Marathon Server Slam Playtest is finally here, and it gives players a huge glimpse into what the full game will be like at launch. From early quests to the full roster of guns, there’s plenty for fans to dip their feet into, but there does seem to be one major point of confusion.</p>



<p>The maps. When you load up the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/marathon/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/games/marathon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon</a> Server Slam Playtest and prepare for a run, you’ll see three maps available: Perimeter, Dire Marsh, and Outpost. There’s no trouble accessing the first two, but Outpost seems to be causing some problems.</p>







<p>If you’re confused, then don’t worry, you’re in the right place. Here’s whether you can access the Outpost map during the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-play-marathon-server-slam-playtest-dates-times-platforms-content/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-play-marathon-server-slam-playtest-dates-times-platforms-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon Server Slam Playtest</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-access-the-outpost-zone-in-the-marathon-server-slam-playtest">Can You Access The Outpost Zone In The Marathon Server Slam Playtest?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Take your pick. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Unfortunately, despite it appearing on the map selection screen, you cannot play on the Outpost map during the Marathon Server Slam Playtest. </strong></p>



<p>It might come as a disappointment to some fans out there, especially since it’s teased for all to see, but Bungie did warn players which maps will be playable during the Playtest—and Outpost didn’t make the cut. </p>

</ul>



<p>Still, it does pose a new question for fans of the Server Slam: When will Outpost be playable? </p>







<h2 id="h-when-will-outpost-be-playable-in-marathon">When Will Outpost Be Playable In Marathon?</h2>



<p><strong>The Outpost map will be fully playable when Marathon releases on March 5, 2026. It will be one of the three maps available at launch, alongside both Perimeter and Dire Marsh.</strong></p>



<p>With that in mind, it’s honestly quite crazy that Bungie made two of the three maps playable during what is essentially a glorified beta test for the game. That doesn’t leave a whole lot left to uncover when the game officially releases, but there is still the largely unknown endgame map—the Cryo Archive. </p>

</ul>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/bungie/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/bungie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bungie</a> have described this as the ultimate endgame for Marathon, and it should be playable just a few weeks after launch. Fingers crossed that it’s worth the wait, and that Outpost is just as fun to explore as the other two maps.</p>

<p>If you can’t get enough of the real-life Pokémon Trading Card Game, then you need to get ready for a Pokémon 30th Anniversary TCG Set, and early release period details are out for it.</p>



<p>Collectors everywhere don’t care how many new Pokémon sets are released in the TCG; packs will be bought, cards will be pulled, and binders will be stacked. We learned so much from the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-presents-february-2026-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon&nbsp;Presents&nbsp;February 2026 showcase</a>, and one of the biggest surprises was the announcement of a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-30th-anniversary-tcg-set-revealed-for-2026-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">30th anniversary set</a>.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-pokemon-s-30th-anniversary-tcg-set-coming-out-release-period-explained">When Is Pokémon’s 30th Anniversary TCG Set Coming Out? Release Period, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Pokémon Company has indicated that the set is arriving at some point in 2026, but based on historical data, it’s believed the set is destined for a Fall 2026 release—between September and November.</strong></p>



<p>Everyone hates vague release windows, especially ones that span a full year!</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming:</strong> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/7-things-we-learned-from-pokemon-winds-pokemon-waves-first-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">7 Things Learned From Pokémon Winds &amp; Waves Trailer</a></li>
</ul>



<p>But a closer look at dedicated Pokémon TCG social media pages might give more useful insight into when it’s arriving. Pokemon TCG Restocks &amp; News said: “If it follows the past Celebrations set, it will likely release in the fall!”</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If it follows the past Celebrations set, it will likely release in the fall!</p>— Pokemon TCG Restocks &amp; News (@PokemonRestocks) <a href="https://twitter.com/PokemonRestocks/status/2027388937170268503?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 27, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Furthermore, Pokémon Deals, Stock &amp; News UK offered a similar sentiment:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“They just said 2026. I expect around September/October.”<a href="https://x.com/pokemondealsuk/status/2027387540752237017"></a></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Obviously, this doesn’t mean it’s guaranteed, but with Perfect Order and Chaos Rising arriving next, we know the 30th Anniversary set isn’t releasing anytime soon. A Fall 2026 window looks very likely, so it would be wise to assume it’s another few months off yet.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">They just said 2026 😅 I expect around September/October</p>— Pokémon Deals, Stock &amp; News UK (@pokemondealsuk) <a href="https://twitter.com/pokemondealsuk/status/2027387540752237017?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 27, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>

<figure><figcaption>Inject it into our veins. Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Pokémon 30th Anniversary TCG Set is expected to be a reprint of many of the TCG’s most iconic cards over the last three decades, immortalized with a special 30th anniversary logo or stamp.</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming:</strong> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-winds-and-waves-gen-10-starters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">All Pokémon Winds &amp; Waves Starters</a></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s every card shown in the set reveal trailer to give you an idea of what’s coming:</p>



<ul>
<li>Charizard (Base Set)</li>



<li>Lugia (e-Series Crystal)</li>



<li>Palkia Lv. X</li>



<li>Uxie (Diamond &amp; Pearl)</li>



<li>Giratina &amp; Darkrai (Legends)</li>



<li>Genesect EX</li>



<li>Solgaleo GX</li>



<li>Zacian V</li>



<li>Pikachu &amp; Zekrom GX (Tag Team)</li>



<li>Raikou (Amazing Rare)</li>



<li>Arceus VStar</li>
</ul>



<p>This is merely a taster of what’s likely to be a full 200-300 card set, littered with Holos, Full Arts, and many more insanely valuable rares—there’s got to be some Charizards, right?</p>

            <p>
Retro specialist Evercade has unveiled a bit of a treat for Rare fans: a cute little handheld device featuring 14 of the legendary British developer's games, spanning right back to its earliest days.
</p>
<p>
Officially known as the Super Pocket Rare Edition, it's a <a href="https://www.hypermegatech.com/rare-edition/">vaguely Game Boy shaped handheld</a> sporting some eye-catchingly vibrant primary hues (basically, the standard Super Pocket with a bit of Rare flair). It's got a 2.8" 320×240 IPS Screen, a 3.5mm headphone jack, and supports USB-C charging. Additionally, it's fully Evercade compatible, meaning you're not just limited to its 14 included games - it also works with the company's library of 75+ cartridges, covering over 650 titles.

<p>
But it's the included games you'll probably be most curious about, and Evercade has pulled together a pretty nice selection - albeit heavily favouring Rare's early 8-bit output, when it was still known as Ultimate Play the Game. You do get the studio's much-loved platformer Banjo-Kazooie alongside the likes of Battletoads, but after that we're firmly in the realm of classics like Knight Lore, Atic Atac, and Lunar Jetman. Here's the list in full:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Banjo-Kazooie (64-bit console)</li>
<li>Conker’s Pocket Tales (8-bit handheld console)</li>
<li>Battletoads in Battlemaniacs (16-bit console)</li>
<li>Battletoads (8-bit console)</li>
<li>Cobra Triangle (8-bit console)</li>
<li>R.C. Pro-Am II (8-bit console)</li>
<li>Slalom (8-bit console)</li>
<li>Snake Rattle ‘n’ Roll (8-bit console)</li>
<li>Solar Jetman: Hunt for the Golden Warpship (8-bit console)</li>
<li>Atic Atac (home computer)</li>
<li>Jetpac (home computer)</li>
<li>Lunar Jetman (home computer)</li>
<li>Knight Lore (home computer)</li>
<li>Gunfright (home computer)</li>
</ul>
<p>
And if you're wondering how much this adorable little nostalgia machine might set you back, the (officially licensed) Super Pocket Rare Edition will cost £49.99/€59.99/$69.99 when it launches this June. And if that's got you sufficiently tempted, <a href="https://www.hypermegatech.com/retailers/">pre-orders are now open</a>.
