            <p>
It's taken a while to get it sorted, but developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/gsc-game-world">GSC Game World</a> has finally managed to fix Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl's wonky A-Life system as part of the post-apocalyptic shooter's latest massive update - meaning players can now expect a bit more life to their wasteland adventure as NPCs live their simulated lives and pursue their own goals. Oh, and official modding tools are here too, but you'll need to clear some considerable space to install them.
</p>
<p>
Starting with A-Life, it's been the beating heart (or possibly the brain) of the Stalker series since its debut in 2007, creating a more dynamic, and more emergent, post-apocalyptic landscape by simulating NPCs - stalkers, bandits, mutants, and more - that move around the world, hunt, fight, and interact even when offscreen. Stalker 2's version of A-Life was supposed to take things even further, but like much of the game at launch, was pretty broken.
</p>
<p>
GSC <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-2-dev-gsc-game-world-explains-for-the-first-time-what-went-wrong-with-a-life-20-and-why-it-was-removed-from-the-games-description-on-steam">previously explained</a> much of Stalker 2's A-Life weirdness was down to optimisation hurdles, with the studio ultimately having to significantly reduce the size of the area around players that A-Life worked in order improve performance. Some <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-receives-first-major-patch-including-a-life-fixes">initial fixes arrived shortly after release</a>, but it's only now, some seven months later, the system is finally working as intended.

<p>
As per the studio's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/525346350588494399?l=english">latest patch notes</a>, today's huge 1.5 update - AKA the Guns &amp; Looting update - now simulates life for all characters, and not just those in the player's view. NPCs will "continue to live their lives and pursue their goals in the Zone until they meet their end", and can be encountered resting or interacting in different locations. Additionally, players can meet the same stalkers after some time.
</p>
<p>
There's a lot more besides A-Life, though; patch 1.5 introduces new features (players can now experience the Water Electric Tornado anomaly out in the Zone, for instance, and acquire the Kora handgun and Three-Line Rifle), as well as AI and combat improvements, balance adjustments and bug fixes, plus various quality of life additions. That's alongside the release of official modding tools for Stalker 2, which are <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/stalker-2-zone-kit">currently available via the Epic Games Store</a>. Interested parties might want to brace themselves, however; you'll need somewhere in the region of 700GB harddrive space to install them.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer, if you're wondering, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review">gave Stalker 2 three stars</a>, calling it a "mess of bugs and jank that nonetheless stays faithful to the open world survival shooter of yesteryear."

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i-tested-12-switch-2-cases-and-these-are-the-best.1228416/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>You might find it kind of sad to put a hard-earned gadget into a protective case. To me, it’s freeing. Using a case relieves me of the worry that it will accumulate tons of little scratches. So, I wasted no time testing cases on the new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686603/nintendo-switch-2-review">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, and it didn’t take long for me to find one that I think is the best.</p><p>I tried several types of cases on the Switch 2. I tested flimsy shells that snap or slide onto the Switch 2 to provide a simple, aesthetically pleasing barrier from scratches to the console and its Joy-Cons. I also tried slim cases that have one job: to protect the console when it isn’t in use.</p><div><h2>What I look for in a Switch 2 case</h2><section><p>We use each Switch 2 case as it was designed to be used. We follow the instructions included to get the best fit and protection, noting along the way when a feature works better than expected, or worse. We don’t perform drop tests (I’m using my personal, and thus treasured, Switch 2 unit), but we try our best to find weak points in each case.</p></section><section><p>Installing a case should be easy, not cumbersome. Given the Switch 2’s hybrid design, a multi-step process for attaching a case is expected, but it should be easy to achieve a successful installation every time with little effort.</p></section><section><p>Since a lot of tech cases are made before said technology is even publicly available, I’m watching like a hawk to make sure the cases that I try actually fit the Switch 2. Even a millimeter’s difference isn’t good enough for me or you.</p></section><section><p>Some cases come with compromises, such as not allowing the Switch 2’s Joy-Con 2 controllers to be detached. Others block the kickstand, and/or prevent the console from fitting into its original dock for playing on a TV. Compromises are fine as long as you know what they are beforehand. I think most people want to access the Switch 2’s unique features, so I’ve focused mostly on picks that retain them, although I may include some picks that limit them.</p></section></div><p>I just listed my high standards for form-fitting cases made to fit the Switch 2 while it’s in use. However, the bar for slim zip-up/clasp cases is lower. They just need to protect the console and, ideally, provide some extra value, like a pocket for cables or cartridge storage.</p><div><nav><h2>In this article</h2><ul><li><a href="#the-best-switch-2-case-for-both-handheld-and-docked-play">The best Switch 2 case for both handheld and docked play</a></li><li><a href="#the-best-slim-protective-switch-2-cases">The best slim, protective Switch 2 cases</a></li><li><a href="#the-best-form-fitting-shells-for-the-switch-2-in-handheld-mode">The best form-fitting shells for the Switch 2 in handheld mode</a></li><li><a href="#what-s-coming-next">What’s coming next?</a></li></ul></nav></div><p>As for my favorite case, I didn’t want to make any major compromises; I wanted one that’s just as good for handheld mode as when docked, which is why I think the <strong>Dbrand Killswitch</strong> is the best model overall. I published a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/686719/dbrand-killswitch-switch-2-case-review">full review of the Killswitch</a>, but the skinny is that while it’s perhaps more expensive than some may hope to pay, the level of protection and versatility it offers is worth the cost.</p><div><p id="the-best-switch-2-case-for-both-handheld-and-docked-play"><h2>The best Switch 2 case for both handheld and docked play</h2></p></div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->60</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>Very secure fit</li><li>Makes the Switch 2 feel more like a Steam Deck (in the best ways)</li><li>Clever dock adapter</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>Chunky dock adapter</li><li>Not the most affordable case</li><li>Front protection only comes in the $80 tier</li></ul></div></div></div><p>The least expensive Killswitch tier <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdbrand.com%2Fshop%2Fkillswitch%2Fnintendo-switch-2-cases" rel="sponsored">costs $59.95</a> and includes a rear cover for the console and a small piece to adhere to its kickstand for a matching style, plus Joy-Con 2 grips, all of which securely latch onto each component. It also includes a skin for your hardware. There’s no piece of the Killswitch that feels like it’ll incidentally wiggle off. </p><p>Unfortunately, the Switch 2 console case makes it impossible to fit into the dock. However, Dbrand includes its workaround adapter that fits into it, essentially acting as a USB-C extender. It’s a fairly elegant solution that works as intended. The only downside is that it leaves your Switch 2’s screen exposed instead of concealed by the dock’s plastic wall. It’s a little clunky, but I’m willing to forgive it because it allows the Switch 2 to retain its docking functionality.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->5</strong><span><cite>Photo: Cameron Faulkner / The Verge</cite></span></p></section><p>The tier I recommend for most Switch 2 players (especially those who will often throw their console into a bag) is the $79.85 “Travel” tier, which includes a semi-transparent travel cover that protects the front of your console during transit, or just for safekeeping when you aren’t using it. The cover fits around the front of your Killswitch-equipped console, securing around the back with a tough bungee cord latch. This tier also includes a pair of analog stick grips and a tray that holds 10 Switch cartridges and fits neatly within the travel cover.</p><p>I couldn’t post this without addressing the controversy surrounding the Killswitch’s design, specifically that it allows the Joy-Con 2s’ magnets to break away without pressing their release buttons. If you hold your Killswitch-equipped Switch 2 parallel to the ground solely by either of the Joy-Con 2 controllers and give it a shake, the entire console portion is likely to detach. This could obviously cause serious damage to the console. Dbrand insisted in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/1lhvtyw/killswitch_joycon_detachment_update/">lengthy Reddit post</a> that most players don’t (and shouldn’t) hold their consoles this way. I <em>can</em> easily replicate the issue, though I didn’t notice it during my testing, mainly because I’m a worrywart who’s perhaps unnecessarily gentle with tech. However, I could see this being a more pressing issue if you have, say, a younger kid who roughhouses with technology. Either way, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/1ljlhwy/joycon_detachment_update_part_2_were_fixing_it/">Dbrand later confirmed on Reddit</a> that all buyers are getting improved Joy-Con 2 covers that should fix the issue.</p><div><p id="runner-up"><h3>Runner-up</h3></p></div><p><strong>Genki’s Attack Vector</strong> case is similar in some ways to the Killswitch, as it consists of three pieces: one that goes around the console, and two pieces that wrap around each of the Joy-Con 2 controllers. The <a href="https://www.genkithings.com/products/attack-vector">$49.99 kit</a> improves on the Killswitch with swappable modular grips that come in three sizes to let you customize how the Joy-Con 2 fits in your hand. It follows a small, medium, and large model, with the smallest adding some minor ergonomic benefits, and the largest being what large-handed folks will likely gravitate toward to make the Switch 2 comfier to hold. Its large, palm-filling grip feels as good to use as the Killswitch, but it’s a very close race and I’d be smitten to use either.</p><p>However, one notable downside with the Attack Vector is that the Joy-Con 2 sleeves can be pulled off with relative ease, unlike Dbrand’s. Their fit is accurate, technically, and they won’t fall off during normal use. But they’re not as secure as I want them to be.</p><p>Also, Genki advertises that you can keep the Attack Vector on when you insert your console into the Switch 2 dock, but its launch unit doesn’t work as intended. Genki addressed complaints on forums that the case doesn’t fit the console perfectly, and is working on a fix that it expects to finish in July. It will ship a replacement middle piece to all who have already purchased the case, and those who buy the case going forward will receive the fixed product.</p><div><p id="the-best-slim-protective-switch-2-cases"><h2>The best slim, protective Switch 2 cases</h2></p></div><p><strong>Power A’s slim zip-up case </strong>for the Switch 2 is a simple and inexpensive way to keep your console safe when you aren’t using it. It’s not a hard case, so it won’t survive catastrophic damage, but it’s a fine choice if you don’t want to add a bunch of heft. To that end, it’s one of the slimmest cases that I have tried. </p><p>At just <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F69R7LLR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">$19.99</a> (half the cost of <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fnintendo-switch-2-carrying-case-screen-protector-multi%2F6625926.p%3FskuId%3D6625926" rel="sponsored">Nintendo’s official carrying case</a>), protection alone would be sufficient, but it offers safe storage for up to 10 Switch cartridges, too. The cartridge holder has a soft bottom that protects the screen, and it can also fold into a tent, allowing the Switch 2 to rest against it (the Switch 2 already has a kickstand for this).</p><p>This case doesn’t suffer from a negative trait that’s common among other slim cases (some of which are pricier than PowerA’s): being able to press on the Joy-Con 2 joysticks from the outside. Other cases might allow your Switch 2 to suffer some joystick damage unbeknownst to you, but not this one, as well as the ones listed below.</p><p>For $10 more ($29.99), <strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/680463/belkin-nintendo-switch-2-charging-case-battery">Belkin’s slim case</a></strong> is better-looking than PowerA’s and is made with better materials. It has a carrying strap, a large mesh pocket, and a secret compartment for an Apple AirTag or similar Bluetooth tracker, all of which the PowerA case lacks. Belkin’s case can carry 12 cartridges, and it’s only slightly thicker than the PowerA case, likely to compensate for whatever cables or small gizmos you might stuff into its pocket. It features deep grooves to fit the Joy-Con 2’s triggers, and its outer shell prevents accidental presses on the joysticks. It comes in dark gray, cream, and a fun green shade.</p><p>Belkin sells a $69.99 version of its slim case that features everything above and includes a 10,000mAh 20W battery for keeping the Switch 2 charged while it’s inside the case. The company says the battery can fully charge the console 1.5 times. The battery results in a thicker case, and its bespoke compartment only holds the specific Belkin model that’s included, so you won’t be able to swap in a different, faster-charging battery. Neither of those may be deal-breakers for you, but are worth keeping in mind.</p><div><p id="runners-up"><h3>Runners-up</h3></p></div><p>JSAUX makes a relatively slim zip-up Switch 2 case that absolutely pops with color. Expressiveness is its main appeal, as this <strong><a rel="sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/Carrying-Compatible-Nintendo-Switch-Protective-2/dp/B0F2F38LZK?ref_=ast_sto_dp&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20">$25.99 case</a></strong> slouches on other features you might want. Once it’s opened, all there is to see is a velcro strap that secures your Switch 2. Underneath it is a fabric tray stitched into the case that can hold 12 game cartridges. Like the Belkin and PowerA cases, this one prevents accidental pressing on the Joy-Con 2 sticks through its shell. It’s a little too light on features to recommend broadly, and it’s thicker than the other models.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.genkithings.com/products/sleeper-case">Genki’s $42.99 Sleeper Case</a></strong> is a <em>very </em>tough soft case. Its wool-wrapped shell doesn’t have nearly as much give as other slim cases. Plus, its screen guard can carry up to 18 cartridges. However, I dislike how much the Switch 2 moves around when you shake the case (the fit is snug if you have the company’s Attack Vector case equipped). Notably, Genki’s Neil Trachy, who handles marketing and media relations, shared with <em>The Verge</em> that a production error may impact how well its zipper works in the long run, and that a free fix is coming in July for all who’ve already purchased one. The fix will be implemented for all future purchasers of the case. </p><p>“Our Sleeper Case was upgraded to a waterproof zipper last minute and unbeknownst to our production team, the adhesives used were not binding well to the zipper. [...] While the case is still rock solid, the weak point will be the glue that holds it all in place.”</p><div><p id="the-best-form-fitting-shells-for-the-switch-2-in-handheld-mode"><h2>The best form-fitting shells for the Switch 2 in handheld mode</h2></p></div><p>The <strong>Killswitch</strong> is the best case for handheld mode because it allows you to remove the Joy-Con 2 controllers and includes an adapter to easily connect to the dock. Plus, it offers kickstand access.</p><p>If you don’t <em>ever </em>plan to connect your Switch 2 to its dock or detach its Joy-Cons, or it’ll be a rare occurrence, you might pick an all-in-one shell that fits completely around the console.

It fits around every nook and port of the Switch 2, with openings for its speakers and air intake. It gets bonus points for fitting around the edges of the Joy-Con 2 while providing more pronounced grips, which may be a boon for those who experience hand or wrist pain while holding the console in handheld mode.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">All your weapons here are plasma rifles, if you think about it.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Crisol: Theater of Idols aims to blend Bioshock with Resident Evil-style gameplay in a horror FPS influenced by classical Spanish folklore. I crawled through abandoned streets, popping zombie-like enemies with guns that used my blood for bullets, ducking in and out of derelict storefronts looking for the ever-reliable genre staple bolt cutters, and dodging powerful enemies along the way. While Crisol showed more to set itself apart from stalwarts in the genre during my hands-on demo, its weapon designs and distinct aesthetic in particular left me interested to see more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Exploring a horrific, reimagined version of Spain called Hispania, Crisol’s world and character designs blew me away – especially the guns. Here, your blood is your health <em><strong>and</strong></em> your ammo, so reloading each gun triggers a spine-tingling reaction like when your handgun’s handle bristles with little needles, drawing blood from your hand, or when needles stick out of the base of your double-barrelled shotgun’s barrel, waiting to trade health for survival.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This push-and-pull forces you to keep tabs on both to keep yourself from wasting either and landing yourself in a sticky situation. You can pick up healing syringes to help restore ammo, but Crisol also encourages you to drain the blood from dead bystanders, killed by your mysterious foes, to heal and reload.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Crisol also encourages you to drain the blood from dead bystanders, killed by your mysterious foes, to heal and reload.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The gun designs themselves are cool too; gilded with red accents, they add a gothic pop of color that stands out, but doesn’t clash with the environments I saw in my short demo. The environments, on the other hand, didn’t have nearly as much character to them. While the trailer promises some pretty cool-looking set pieces, the dark streets of Hispania I wandered didn’t offer much deviation from the norm. That’s surprising considering just how well-designed the enemies and guns are.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Crisol: Theater of Idols Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Crisol doesn’t waste any time throwing you into the action. Within seconds of picking up the controller, lurching, puppet-like enemies stumbled towards me. Low light revealed unsettling details in their mask-like faces as they approached, eventually collapsing under my gunfire. Each enemy I encountered (or at least each one I was able to kill) reacted based on which part of their body I shot; crawling headless after I kneecapped them, and popped their heads. Both of the blood-soaked firearms I tried have an older feel to them, more like the oomph of the original BioShock than the punchy crack of the guns found in most contemporary shooters, though Crisol’s trailer (and weapon wheel) promise a seemingly diverse arsenal of sanguine shooters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After making my way through a few city blocks, absorbing blood from dead bodies and popping zombie-like critters blocking my path, I came across a locked gate with a winch. Locked by a padlock with a chain – classic! Like clockwork, I set out looking for the bolt cutters I’d found in half a dozen survival horror games before. But before I could start looking, some kind of gigantic, arcane cyborg – a towering mass of blood-soaked bones and clanking machinery with a mask of a woman’s face crying blood – picked me up and tossed me around.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/24/03-1750729005759.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The beast chased me down the street to the window (conveniently) of the hardware store, but couldn’t touch me once I dove in. Safe for now, I grabbed the bolt cutters from the back storeroom and every coin in the cash register and set out to snip the chains that kept me from safety. But the beast was back at my heels practically the moment my feet hit the dirt road, hurling threats my way as it hunted me down.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I hope Crisol doubles down on these two different kinds of survival horror to produce layers of tension between the blood-for-bullets combat and high-stakes stealth in the full release.&nbsp;</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Crouching to minimize the noise I made, I found a shortcut through a fish store, making a bunch of noise at one end before cutting through the store, snipping the chains, and cranking away at the winch to open the gate in front of me. I heard the creature thudding towards me, and just pushed away in the quick-time event faster, hoping I could squeeze through instead of running back to cover. The gate opened with just enough time to spare; I rushed out of the courtyard to safety, the gate snapping shut before my assailant could catch me.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/24/07-1750729018828.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">This puzzle-like stealth section, though very simple, added a lot to my demo. I can see the ways this could evolve into a tense blend of stealth and shooting if I eventually need to dodge bigger enemies at the same time as popping the smaller, stoppable ones with my sanguine arsenal. I hope Crisol doubles down on these two different kinds of survival horror to produce layers of tension between the blood-for-bullets combat and high-stakes stealth in the full release. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While I enjoyed my demo well enough, I felt like I hadn’t seen anything new beyond the Bloodborne-like, health-for-ammo trade-off and some really cool weapon and enemy designs. I’m sure puzzles and progression will begin to differentiate themselves from Resident Evil as the game gets more complex. But I didn’t get to see much of that in this demo, which was clearly very early in the campaign. Still, I have a feeling Crisol: Theater of Idols will be worth checking out for its distinct take on survival horror with a Spanish flair.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/crisol-theater-of-idols-is-a-horror-fps-influenced-by-spanish-folklore]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/roblox-accused-of-allowing-sexual-exploitation-in-four-separate-lawsuits.1228404/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>From February to May, personal injury law firm Anapol Weiss <a href="https://www.anapolweiss.com/roblox-lawsuit-attorneys/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed four separate lawsuits</a> on behalf of children who were allegedly exploited by adults on the platform. The law firm said it’s “investigating hundreds of similar cases” and plans to file additional lawsuits in the coming months.&nbsp;</p><p>The most recent lawsuit was filed in May in the Superior Court of California on behalf of a 16-year-old girl who, according to the filing, met a “serial predator who was on an FBI watch list for previously targeting children on <em>Roblox</em>” in the game. Throughout the 82-page complaint, the law firm details claims of exploitation and abuse in <em>Roblox, including </em>Bloomberg’s extensive reporting into <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Roblo</em>x’s “pedophile problem”</a> andHindenburg Research’s 2024 report that accused the platform of inflating metrics and called it a “<a href="https://hindenburgresearch.com/roblox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pedophile hellscape</a>.” <a href="https://ir.roblox.com/news/news-details/2024/Roblox-Refutes-Misleading-Claims-in-Hindenburg-Report-2024-IsPnj4offj/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox called</a> Hindenburg Research’s report “misleading” and disputed several claims made in the Bloomberg report, with a spokesperson telling the outlet, "The long-term growth and longevity of Roblox depends on our ability to provide a safe and civil experience for our users." <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-02/roblox-rolls-out-more-child-safety-tools-on-its-game-platform?embedded-checkout=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox continues to roll out safety tools</a> as pressure mounts from outside groups.</p><p>In the complaint filed in May, Anapol Weiss alleges that the alleged predator, who is not named, “engaged in innocent conversation but gradually escalated to sexual topics and explicit exchanges.” He convinced the girl to move their conversations off <em>Roblox</em>, and eventually to meet in person, where the complaint says he sexually assaulted the girl and forced her from Indiana to Georgia. The girl escaped to a police department, according to the complaint.</p><p>“Plaintiff has suffered unimaginable harm,” Anapol Weiss wrote. “Her innocence has been snatched from her forever. Tragically, what happened to her is far from an isolated event. Indeed, Plaintiff is just one of countless children whose lives have been devastated as a result of Roblox’s gross negligence and defectively designed app.”</p><p>The firm’s three other lawsuits — two filed in April 2025, in California and Texas, and another filed in February in New Jersey — make similar claims. The three previous lawsuits also name Discord as a defendant for its alleged role in allowing child abuse to proliferate on its platform.</p><p>Roblox maintains that it’s committed to the safety of children on its platform. <em>Roblox</em> itself is more popular than ever, reaching n<a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/grow-a-garden-roblox-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ew concurrent player records</a> consistently over the past several weeks. The platform is an essential app for many children, a place where they’re able to be social and creative. But court dockets over the past year paint an alarming picture of the app’s underbelly, revealing a deep, and, seemingly, systemic issue. Since January, United States police have arrested at least a half dozen people who allegedly used <em>Roblox</em> to find and exploit children, including <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ord.185914/gov.uscourts.ord.185914.9.0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coercing minors into making pornography</a> and <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/air-force-member-charged-sexual-exploitation-nine-year-old-child-long-island" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paying children for</a> sexually explicit photos, according to court documents reviewed by Aftermath.</p><p>In April, <a href="https://www.myfloridalegal.com/newsrelease/attorney-general-james-uthmeier-fights-protect-children-online-subpoenas-roblox-child" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier subpoenaed Roblox</a> for information about how the game is used by kids age 16 or younger, as well as for documents showing how Roblox protects children from “mature content.” The attorney general's office, via the subpoena, is also looking for communications to and from Florida users reporting abuse and communication with the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children, among other things. “We are issuing a subpoena to Roblox to uncover how this platform is marketing to children and to see what policies they are implementing—if any—to avoid interactions with predators,” Uthmeier wrote in a news release.&nbsp;</p><p>In a similar move, <a href="https://www.njoag.gov/ag-platkin-sues-messaging-app-discord-for-unlawful-practices-that-expose-nj-kids-to-child-predators-and-violent-sexual-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New Jersey Attorney General Matthew J. Platkin announced in April</a> that he’s suing Discord over “for deceptive and unconscionable business practices that misled parents about the efficacy of its safety controls and obscured the risks children faced when using the application.”</p><p>Alongside the new safety initiatives, in May Roblox hired former Lego Group executive Dr. Elizabeth Milovidov <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/05/roblox-head-of-parental-advocacy-dr-elizabeth-milovidov" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as the company’s parental advocacy lead</a>, a role designed to help Roblox “empower families to help children use technology safely and responsibly.” The latest safety updates allow parents to block people and specific games on a child’s <em>Roblox</em> friends lists; previously, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/roblox-parental-controls-friend-blocking" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to Mashable</a>, parents had to block an entire game rating or maturity level, not on a game by game basis. Parents also have a more detailed look into their kids’ <em>Roblox</em> activity, showing information like the most played games. In March, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/ai/humans-still-surpass-machines-roblox-has-been-using-a-machine-learning-voice-chat-moderation-system-for-a-year-but-in-some-cases-you-just-cant-beat-real-people/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox also announced</a> it's been deploying an AI tool to detect problematic voice chats. <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2024/11/major-updates-to-our-safety-systems-and-parental-controls" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A <em>Roblox</em> update from November</a> added new parental controls and restricted communication for children under 13.&nbsp;</p><p>A Roblox spokesperson shared the following statement with Aftermath:</p><blockquote><p>As a policy we cannot comment on pending litigation. With that being said, Roblox is deeply committed to the safety and well-being of our community and helping protect children is&nbsp;a top priority.&nbsp;We invest significant resources in advanced technology, including robust filters and human moderation teams, to detect and address inappropriate content and behavior and do not allow user-to-user image sharing on our platform. We partner with law enforcement and other organizations aimed at combating the sexual exploitation of children around the world, and we will continue to evolve our safety practices to promote a secure and positive experience for everyone on our platform.&nbsp;</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/lies-of-p-overture-review"><h3>Lies Of P: Overture Is The Best Parts Of The Game Executed With Confidence</h3></a><p>Lies of P: Overture proves the success of the first game was no fluke, and establishes a bold house style.</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/roblox-sexual-exploitation-of-children-lawsuit-safety]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Nintendo has announced through its Nintendo Today app that The Legend of Zelda movie will no longer <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/28/the-legend-of-zelda-movie-will-arrive-in-cinemas-in-march-2027/">arrive in cinemas in March 2027</a>. Instead, a brand new release date of May 7th, 2027 has been given. The only reason that has been given is that this delay is due to production reasons, and no further information has been provided apart from that.</p>



<p>The movie is a collaboration between legendary game creator Shigeru Miyamoto and renowned film producer Avi Arad – he led Marvel back from bankruptcy in the mid 90’s pushing licensing deals for film and television, prior to the company’s sale to Disney, and has continued to have producer credits on Sony’s extended Spider-Man universe of films, while Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes and The Maze Runner trilogy’s Wes Ball is on board as director.</p>
<p>Announcing the project in late 2023, Miyamoto said on social media, “I have been working on the live-action film of The Legend of Zelda for many years now with Avi Arad-san, who has produced many mega hit films.</p>
<p>“I have asked Avi-san to produce this film with me, and we have now officially started the development of the film with Nintendo itself heavily involved in the production. It will take time until its completion, but I hope you look forward to seeing it.”</p>

<p>There are no details of any cast announcements for The Legend of Zelda movie, nor is there any details of what story this movie will have. We do not know if the movie will adapt one of the games or be an original plot, introducing new elements to The Legend of Zelda lore.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Rob Yescombe, the writer behind films like Outside the Wire and Jackpot!, and games like <a href="http://wccftech.com/review/rime-when-in-doubt-follow-fox/">RiME</a> and The Invisible Hours, has secured the rights for The Invisible Hours after developer Tequila Works was <a href="https://wccftech.com/tequila-works-auctions-off-its-brand-and-ips/">shuttered and auctioned off the rights to their IP</a>.</p>
<p>Yescombe secured the rights to The Invisible Hours in the auction, and now plans to remaster the VR game, presumably for modern headsets like the Meta Quest 3 and PS VR2, and develop a screen adaptation of it, though it's unclear if he intends to make a film or TV show of the game.</p>
<p>"<em>I adored making The Invisible Hours</em>," Yescombe said in a press release. "<em>Truly, the best creative experience of my life. Fans still reach out to me, even after all this time - they love it as much as I do. The VR hardware market has grown massively since 2017 - multiple millions of units - making The Invisible Hours a prime candidate to remaster for a new generation</em>."</p>
<p>Yescombe is currently trying to find partners to help him bring The Invisible Hours back, which, if he's successful in doing so, would be a happier ending compared to the one Tequila Works and all of the studios' titles currently have, which is the one where they were all sold at auction.</p>
<p>While he's right that the player base of VR owners is bigger than it was in 2017 when the game was first shown and in 2018 when it launched, it's still not the booming market that many developers have believed it could be. In 2025, VR has been a year away from being the next big thing for more than a decade at this point.</p>
<p>We'll see if Yescombe can find a partner and/or studio to remaster The Invisible Hours. Or at the very least, a studio willing to work on the screen adaptation, which could potentially be the more lucrative option for the murder mystery.</p>

<p><i>Warmachine</i>, a tabletop wargame that initially came to life to focus on balanced and competitive gameplay, has been around since 2003 under Privateer Press, until last year when Steamforged Games announced that they had <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/steamforged-games-acquires-warmachine-and-whole-iron-kingdom-ip-0" rel="nofollow">bought the IP</a>. <em>Warmachine</em> had recently moved into a new edition of the rules, and SFG has continued to run with that, kicking off a <a href="https://steamforged.com/en-gb/blogs/brands/iron-kingdoms-manifesto-part1?srsltid=AfmBOoqbPX8-yaogfTtpMsWSffAvNYYnSy0vGEqaKdAeX5njSJbqbpHm" rel="nofollow">roadmap</a> of new and exciting releases. These releases began with a brand-new 2-player starter set, which we reviewed <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warmachine-2-player-starter-set-review-metal-and-magic" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>The Gravediggers are a new army under the Cygnar faction, and can trace their history back to the early days of <em>Warmachine</em> in 2003. The Gravediggers come from a group known as the Trenchers, who were a theme army in the original <em>Warmachine</em> and grew and developed through the various editions of the game. Now, under Steamforged Games, the Gravediggers bring the Trenchers back with a unique twist: they can airdrop weapons, supplies, and even Warjacks into the battlefield, letting them react to the changing landscape and keep your opponents on their toes.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warmachine-gravediggers-core-and-auxiliary-expansion-sets-2.jpg?itok=bFIAVlEI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warmachine-gravediggers-core-and-auxiliary-expansion-sets-2.jpg?itok=_v3MY3Up 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Warmachine</em> Gravediggers Core Expansion includes a whole host of new units to add somre new tricks to your army.</figcaption></figure>

<p>The Gravediggers Command Core Expansion Set includes a force that can be played out of the box, but you will have to make some choices on force construction, unlike the Gravediggers Command Starter Set, which will get you straight into the game. But if you're looking for a larger force, or you already have the command starter and want to expand, then the Core Expansion will suit you well.</p>

<p>The Gravediggers Core Expansion Set contains:</p>

<ul><li>Major Grant Vargus (Warcaster)</li>
	<li>Lieutenant Stella Barron (Character Solo)</li>
	<li>Gravedigger Rangers A (Unit)</li>
	<li>Gravedigger Rangers B (Unit)</li>
	<li>Trollkin Express Sniper (Command Attachment)</li>
	<li>Heavy Machine Gun Crew (Solo)</li>
	<li>Mantlet (Light Airdrop / Defense)</li>
	<li>Gun Mages (Unit)</li>
	<li>Blocker (Light Warjack / Heavy Airdrop)</li>
	<li>Skirmisher (Light Warjack / Heavy Airdrop)</li>
</ul><p>Leading the box from the front is Major Vargus, who has Fleet and Evasive to allow them to get to the front quickly and attack with their powerful Balefire Cannon with D3+1 shots. They also give other Cohort units in their battlegroup Fleet, which lets them spend 1 focus point to add 2 speed that turn. Their feat also gives nearby friendly units +3 armor, allowing you to set up a gunline in the face of the enemy and hamper the power of their return fire. Vargus is backed up by Lieutenant Barron, who, once per turn, can use their Battle Plan ability to give a friendly model a bonus from a choice of 3, like Sneak, which gives a nearby unit with concealment, stealth.</p>

<p>The box comes with 3 units, 2 units of 5 Rangers, and a unit of 3 Gun Mages. The Gun Mages can deploy further forward than normal at the start of the game, and come armed with Magelock Pistols, which can fire 3 different types of ammo, giving them either +3 range, an additional dice on attack (then discarding the lowest), or an Electro Leap, which can damage another enemy nearby to their target. The Rangers come in units of 5, and each has 3 heavy rifles and 2 machine gun-armed Rangers. The Rangers can dig in to give their unit concealment and combine their attacks for brutal strikes against resistant enemies.</p>

They can make a free attack once per turn if an enemy comes within 8 inches, and their weapon's tracer round attack ignores stealth, and lights up enemies,s making them easier for your other units to hit. A Trollkin Express Sniper is also included and can only be attached to a Ranger unit. The Trollkin ignores concealment and cover when making attacks, and when targeting warjacks, they can pick the damage column when they hit. They also give the unit their attached to a once per game&nbsp;Cautious Advance ability, where the unit makes a full advance, digs in, and then performs combat actions.</p>

<p>The box completes with airdrop units and has 2 of the 3 Heavy Airdrop warjacks (with the third, the Raider, in the Auxiliary Expansion), and the Light Airdrop Manlet. These units can arrive as part of the Heavy and Light Airdrop command cards, and appear 1 inch away from the unit playing the command card. The warjacks in this set can come in under the control of Vargus (who doesn't have a Warjack in this set, but can use one from other sets), or under the control of Stella, the Rangers, or Gun Mages.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warmachine-gravediggers-core-and-auxiliary-expansion-sets-4.jpg?itok=wuRHM26G 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warmachine-gravediggers-core-and-auxiliary-expansion-sets-4.jpg?itok=xUiv-mhu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The <em>Warmachine</em> Gravediggers Auxiliary Expansion offers some specialized units to your force and rounds off the airrop command card options.</figcaption></figure><h2>Warmachine Gravediggers Auxiliary Expansion Set</h2>

<p>The Gravediggers Auxiliary Expansion Set, like the Core Expansion detailed above, can be used by itself with some choices out of the box or combined with the Command Starter (or any other Gravedigger set). This expansion adds more specialized units and completes the options for the Light and Heavy airdrop command cards (if you've picked up with Command, Battlegroup, and Core sets, you will have all of the airdrop options).</p>

<p>The Gravediggers Auxiliary Expansion Set contains:</p>

<ul><li>Colonel Allison Jakes (Warcaster)</li>
	<li>Gravedigger Commandos (Unit)</li>
	<li>Commando Officer (Command Attachment)</li>
	<li>Captain Argo Brock (Character Solo)</li>
	<li>Beaker (Character Heavy Warjack)</li>
	<li>Raider (Light Warjack / Heavy Airdrop)</li>
	<li>Fuel Canister (Light Airdrop)</li>
</ul><p>The Auxiliary Expansion Set is commanded by Colonel Jakes, the highest-ranking Gravedigger available. Jakes likes to synergize with multiple units, using abilities like Butcher's Bill, which allows you to advance 3 inches and attack with a nearby unit, if one of your units was damaged that turn. This combines with the Synergy spell, which provides a cumulative bonus (capping at +3) on melee attacks and melee damage to each subsequent model hitting a unit. Backing up Jakes is the warjack Breaker, with an empowered arc node, which reduces the cost of spells channeled through it by one. Breaker is extremely durable, removing an additional damage when the repair action is used on it, along with the ability to spend a focus point once per turn to remove D3 damage, further boosted by being resistant to corrosion, electricity, and fire.</p>

Their rate of fire D3 chain gun is effective against medium and large models, and they can draw fire from nearby friendly units with their Shield Guard ability. The Commandos in this set are a unit of 3 Grunts and 2 Support Troopers, and also come with the Command Attached, Commando Officer. As you would imagine, the Commandos can forward deploy, and they can also deploy in any of our control phases after the first turn with their Ambush ability. When attacking, if they hit and fail to damage, they always deal 1 damage, and they can drop a smoke template as an action to avoid return fire. If the unit has the Officer attached, they get access to the Mission Objective ability once per game, which gives all members of this unit +2 to hit and damage a chosen unit for the rest of the turn.</p>

<p>The Auxiliary Expansion closes with a Raider warjack, that is the third type that can be deployed using the Heavy Airdrop command card (along with the Blocker and Skirmisher from the Core Expansion) and the Fuel Canister from the Light Airdrop command card, which can be deployed instead of the other Light Airdrop options from the other Gravedigger sets.</p>

<h2>Warmachine Gravediggers Core and Auxiliary Expansion Sets Final Thoughts?</h2>

<p>If you're just starting out in your <em>Warmachine</em>&nbsp;or Gravediggers journey, then I do encourage you to start with the Gravediggers Command Starter, which gives a solid impression of the faction and a good core for starting out. After that, adding in either the Battlegroup Box for extra warjacks, or the Core or Auxiliary Expansion sets adds some real flair for what the faction can do. The Core Expansion Set adds a lot of unit options, empowering your gunline, whereas the Auxiliary Expansion adds some synergies with Jakes and the sneaky options of the Commandos. If you are serious about the Gravediggers, then you will want to purchase all 4 boxes, which will give you access to everything currently released for the Gravediggers (except the massive Boom Boom McCoy warcaster), which will give you a lot of army creation options, especially for your light and heavy airdrops.</p>

<p>The standout units from the Gravediggers Core and Auxiliary Expansions Set for me are the Commandos and Rangers. I love how they capture the airborne nature of the real-world units, but beyond that, the Rangers Trollkin Express Sniper is a lot of fun (for you, not your opponent).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Asmodee has announced a new strategic partnership. The <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/asmodee-rebrands-for-30th-anniversary-with-inspired-by-players-label" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">recently rebranded</a> tabletop publisher has signed a deal with Maestro Media, which will provide the company with extensive tabletop game distribution in English-speaking territories.</p>

<h2>The Asmodee Maestro Media Distribution Agreement</h2>

<p>In an official press release, Maestro Media has agreed to an exclusive distribution partnership with Asmodee. Under this agreement, effective immediately, Asmodee will be the exclusive distributor of all English-language versions of Maestro Media's products across the United States, the United Arab Emirates, and South Africa.</p>

As part of their new "Inspired by Players" label, the tabletop giant is pushing forward with bringing high-quality tabletop games to players worldwide. It's an apt label considering their recent announcements of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/asmodee-group-announces-catan-sixth-edition-is-out-now" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Catan Sixth Edition</em></a> and the acquisition of the co-op zombie franchise <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/asmodee-acquires-zombicide-ip-from-board-game-publisher-cmon" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Zombicide</em></a> from CMON.</p>

<p>This strategy aligns with Maestro Media's recent activities. The company, founded in 2015, has earned a reputation of bringing various established IPs into the tabletop space. Those include the board game <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-donald-duck-happy-camper-board-game-celebrates-characters-90th-anniversary" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Donald Duck: Happy Camper</em></a><em>,&nbsp;The Binding of Isaac: Four Souls</em>, a board game adaptation of the iconic Stanley Kubrick movie <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/2001-space-odyssey-board-game-tasks-you-with-outsmarting-hal-9000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em></a>, and the Kickstarter smash success <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/maestro-media-announces-clash-of-clans-epic-raid-board-game-based-on-hit-mobile-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Clash of Clans: The Epic Raid</em></a>.</p>

<p>“Partnering with Asmodee is a defining moment for Maestro Media,” says Javon Frazier, CEO and Founder of Maestro Media. “As we enter this next stage of growth, we’re focused on expanding the ways fans connect with our games—and there’s no better partner to do it with. Asmodee’s reach, reputation, and commitment to quality align perfectly with our vision of continuously creating unforgettable, community-driven experiences. We’re honored to keep growing alongside them.”</p>

<p>At time of writing, there are little details on product availability and release timelines for Maestro Media's catalog.</p>

                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/rematch/" data-ref-id="5000-654961">Rematch</a> is quickly becoming one of my favorite games of 2025, despite it still feeling a smidge like it's in early access. The choice to transform the fantasy of playing football (soccer for the American folks!) from the traditionally tactical experience seen in most other football games into more of a high-action, mechanically complex throwdown with an emphasis on pulling off acrobatic plays and heroic saves is very cool. It's led to incredibly rewarding moments and crushing defeats, and riding the wave of those two extremes is a big reason why I enjoy games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/rocket-league/" data-ref-id="5000-397027">Rocket League</a> or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/apex-legends/" data-ref-id="5000-492612">Apex Legends</a>. It's also why I love Blue Lock, a manga/anime often cited in comparison to Rematch.</p><p dir="ltr">"We did see A LOT of players referencing Blue Lock, more than we expected, actually!" Rematch creative director Pierre Tarno told me via email. "We didn't really know it was so popular--it wasn't a major inspiration for the game, though internally some of us do enjoy both manga and anime!"</p><p dir="ltr">For the unfamiliar, Blue Lock is about 300 Japanese high school football players getting locked away in a black site training facility overseen by the mysterious mastermind Jinpachi Ego. Ego tells the group they'll be put through a series of trials, all in hopes of honing one of them into the world's best striker--someone so egotistical that they'd sacrifice Japan's irresponsible emphasis on teamwork to selfishly score goals no matter what and lead the Japan national team to victory. The other 299 failures will never be allowed to play on any Japan team again, ending their football careers in the country.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4521621-ss_bbe8507b799511b9008af67ac5c32115a9765abf.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521621" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4521621-ss_bbe8507b799511b9008af67ac5c32115a9765abf.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521621"></a><figcaption>When Rematch was first announced, I remember immediately thinking it looked like Blue Lock.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4521621-ss_bbe8507b799511b9008af67ac5c32115a9765abf.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">A lot (and I do mean, <em>a lot</em>) of what you can do in Rematch is similar to what characters do in Blue Lock (who themselves are written to emulate the flashiest, most well-remembered traits of famous football players, turned up to 11). Like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGDAX9Qty4E">Meguru Bachira</a>, you can master dribbling and fast step-overs to cut through the defense single-handed, only passing the ball to teammates who challenge your imagination of what you can do. Like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW1jQQkZU9I">Seishirō Nagi</a>, you can pull off skillful ball takedowns and utilize misdirection, ball control, and acrobatic flair to become a goal-scoring genius. And like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0a6RXxjPpts">Shōei Barō</a>, you can intercept passes meant for teammates (or outright take the ball from them while they're trying to dribble), scoring the goal yourself to steal the show as the match's heel. The opening cinematic of Rematch might highlight the opposite values, but the <em>mechanics </em>of the game allow you to play with ego.</p><p dir="ltr">Even the rules and setting of Rematch emulate Blue Lock--one of the earliest (and fan-favorite) arcs focuses on 3v3, 4v4, and 5v5 match-ups where every player is trying to score, there are no off-sides, and the high-tech facility that all the players are contained in verges on futuristic.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4521622-ss_f27b62620af398202c73f3f4990a0e3be34bba4b.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521622" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4521622-ss_f27b62620af398202c73f3f4990a0e3be34bba4b.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521622"></a><figcaption>Pass? When the goal is right there? I don't think so.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4521622-ss_f27b62620af398202c73f3f4990a0e3be34bba4b.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">A quick search for "Rematch Blue Lock" will reveal a ton of clips on TikTok and YouTube of people emulating the manga/anime by doing something really cool solo and not passing the ball to their teammates, even when the entire defense collapses upon them. And I can't count the number of times I've been up against or playing alongside someone who has used the character creator to make their player incredibly pale-skinned with short, stark-white hair and a black uniform sporting number 11 (like Nagi), or to give their tan-skinned player dark, medium-length hair with dyed yellow tips and a blue uniform with number 8 (like Bachira).</p><p dir="ltr">Obviously, not every person playing Rematch is doing so because they like Blue Lock. I'm sure most of them are like Richard Wakeling, who <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/rematch-review-unbelievable-tekkers/1900-6418378/">reviewed Rematch for GameSpot</a>, and came to Rematch because they loved playing the sport in real life (or are just fans of Sloclap's work!). But there is clearly a not-insignificant portion of the playerbase that is jumping into Rematch to embrace their egotistical Blue Lock fantasies and play the hero of the match who scores all the cool goals or pulls off clip-worthy dribbling.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4521623-ss_e751d318ace64865838880dc103d363f5955258c.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521623" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4521623-ss_e751d318ace64865838880dc103d363f5955258c.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521623"></a><figcaption>A lot of people in Rematch think they're Nagi.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4521623-ss_e751d318ace64865838880dc103d363f5955258c.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">And yet, despite all those clear parallels, Rematch is not developer Sloclap's attempt to emulate Blue Lock. It's not the team's attempt to emulate really any singular story centered around football.</p><p dir="ltr">"The setting and art direction really came from the pillars of the game, rather than from specific pieces of media," Tarno said. "Rematch is a game about the joy of playing football with your friends, about how individual talent is necessary but never sufficient, and at the end of the day, it’s the collective that matters. The focus on teamplay and positive sportsmanship is what drove our choices on setting and art direction: a colorful, positive vision of the future."</p><p dir="ltr">Sloclap is hoping Rematch has a positive future itself, and the team is already working on updates to the game beyond the soon-to-come cross-play.</p><p dir="ltr">"Emergent strategies and mechanics started appearing [during the beta], but they consolidated during launch week," Tarno said. "Most of them are valid and should not be removed, but one exploit we'll be removing is the 'dolphin jump,' in which players exploit the outfield dive to move faster even when they've run out of stamina. We're considering advanced ways that could be used to optimize movement speed and stamina usage, but this one looks really weird and will be removed!"</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4521624-ss_ecb74312d4bcd03a49529d5d287a76e077aedb41.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521624" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4521624-ss_ecb74312d4bcd03a49529d5d287a76e077aedb41.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521624"></a><figcaption>The goalkeeper deserves more options to stop the multitude of shots that strikers can take.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4521624-ss_ecb74312d4bcd03a49529d5d287a76e077aedb41.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Much like other online multiplayer games that came before it, Rematch is evolving as more players jump in, and Sloclap has noted that its vision of Rematch may change to match players' expectations. That probably doesn't mean a Blue Lock crossover is coming (but we live in a post-Fortnite world, so who knows), but other aspects of the game are changing to reflect a shift in focus--such as the way 5v5 has ceased to be the "standard" mode, despite Sloclap setting it up to be the default way to play ranked matches.</p><p dir="ltr">"The initial vision we had for the game was a 5v5 experience, which features more tactical configurations, more challenge in making precise passes, and [more development of] your vision of the game dynamics," Tarno said. "The 3v3 game mode is very popular, however, and we're seeing a lot of players requesting a 3v3 ranked queue, so it's really a matter of taste for players."</p><p dir="ltr">On that, I agree with the herd. I know Sloclap wants 5v5 to be the experience for Rematch, but the game feels a lot more tactical and strategic when played on the tighter 3v3 and 4v4 fields, and it's easier for the player who's keeper/sweeper to call out the action, stay engaged, and feel useful on the smaller field.</p><p>Maybe just give the keeper the ability to pull off a last-ditch shachihoko fish kick to save the ball like Blue Lock's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GmwocGtH14">Gin Gagamaru</a>? That would be cool!</p>

                <p>It's come to light that the Xbox 360--a console originally released in 2005--has just received a new system update. Reddit user trackwalker said they booted up their Xbox 360 to find that the dashboard was updated.</p><p>What's new? That's not exactly clear, but replies to trackwalker's post on Reddit mention <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox360/comments/1ljh196/comment/mzjq2t8/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">game thumbnail images no longer appearing stretched out.</a> Others are pointing out that the dashboard now prominently displays ads for the Xbox Series X|S consoles, encouraging people to "experience next-gen performance" by upgrading to a new system.</p><p>The Xbox 360 store <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-xbox-360-store-shuts-down-for-good-today/1100-6525372/" data-ref-id="1100-6525372">officially closed in July 2024</a>, at which point hundreds of games and content for them vanished. <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/news/xbox-360-update-2025" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">TrueAchievements reported</a> that also at this time, a number of tiles related to the store got dumped as well, making the dashboard overall look pretty lackluster.</p><p>Any backward-compatible Xbox 360 (and original Xbox) games remain available for purchase on Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox.com. Online multiplayer support, meanwhile, depends on publishers and developers for Xbox 360 games and wasn't affected by the store's shuttering.</p><p>The Xbox 360 generation was a high point for Xbox, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-360-sales-reach-80-million-units/1100-6415644/" data-ref-id="1100-6415644">more than 80 million units sold.</a> The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-confirms-xbox-one-sales-were-less-than-half-of-the-ps4/1100-6506476/" data-ref-id="1100-6506476">Xbox One, released in 2013, reportedly sold worse</a> and the <a href="https://x.com/zhugeex/status/1420141968546537472" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Series X|S is understood to have underperformed the Xbox 360 as well.</a> Microsoft is now <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-president-shares-new-details-on-next-gen-xbox-console/1100-6532502/" data-ref-id="1100-6532502">developing a new home console with AMD</a>, in addition to pursuing new branded handhelds like the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rog-xbox-ally-x-impressions-green-with-envy/1100-6532506/" data-ref-id="1100-6532506">upcoming Xbox ROG Ally.</a> Microsoft also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/meta-quest-3s-xbox-edition-vr-headset-limited-edition-bundle/1100-6532660/" data-ref-id="1100-6532660">partnered with Meta for an Xbox-branded VR headset.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The third-person PvPvE dungeon crawler RPG Dungeon Stalkers is now hosting its final beta test ahead of its launch <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2468730/Dungeon_Stalkers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a>. Interested fans can simply join the playtest by requesting access via the store page.</p>
<p>This final beta, which will close on Tuesday, July 1st at 6:59 PM Pacific Time, includes the following improvements over previous test phases:</p>
<ul>
<li>New stalkers Liyan and Shinobu added (total 9 stalkers available)</li>
<li>Light extraction rule (no item loss upon death) implemented for quick match and PvE mode</li>
<li>New rune system that allows stalker growth</li>
<li>New Camp system that allows item crafting and upgrade</li>
<li>Stalker ultimates have been improved</li>
<li>Running is now available for a more enjoyable game experience</li>
<li>Kill camera and report system added</li>
</ul>
<p>In Dungeon Stalkers, players choose one of the nine playable characters, each with their own story, personality, and skills, and descend into the Witch's cursed dungeon. They can enter alone or with trusted companions in teams of up to three. As they explore, gather loot, and fight off corrupted monsters and rival Stalkers, their ultimate goal is to escape alive. But no two runs are alike due to the Witch's Curse system, which alters the dungeon conditions dynamically with each session, changing the odds and the challenges.</p>
<p>As characters take damage, this is visually represented by degraded armor, which enemy players can spot, adding tension and strategic depth as well as influencing how and when players engage in PvP combat. Two modes are available: a more casual PvE experience focused on fun or a hardcore, competitive PvPvE dungeon run.</p>

PS4 and Xbox One players can take advantage of this offer, but since the Enhanced Edition is only available on current-gen consoles, you won't be able to play it until you upgrade to PS5 or Series X|S. </p><p>It's worth noting that you won't necessarily miss out on the free Enhanced Edition if you preorder a physical copy. Bandai Namco is offering the Enhanced Edition as a free upgrade to owners of the original when it launches alongside Little Nightmares 3 on October 10. So you'll be missing out on early access, not the game itself.</p><p>All physical and digital edition preorders come with the Dark Six Costumes Set to customize the appearance of the game's two protagonists.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4521433-littlenightmares3mirroredition.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521433" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4521433-littlenightmares3mirroredition.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521433"></a><figcaption>Little Nightmares 3: Mirror Edition</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4521433-littlenightmares3mirroredition.jpg"></figure><div title="6532712 - Little Nightmares 3 Preorders" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3749" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6532712 - Little Nightmares 3 Preorders" data-collection="">                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FDS8LWCH,B0FDS4GBN1,B0FDSJYFQ3&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FDS8LWCH,B0FDS4GBN1,B0FDSJYFQ3&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FDS8LWCH,B0FDS4GBN1,B0FDSJYFQ3&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Little Nightmares 3 Mirror Edition | Amazon Exclusive</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FDS8LWCH,B0FDS4GBN1,B0FDSJYFQ3&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FDS8LWCH,B0FDS4GBN1,B0FDSJYFQ3&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FDS8LWCH,B0FDS4GBN1,B0FDSJYFQ3&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$110 | Releases October 10</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FDS8LWCH,B0FDS4GBN1,B0FDSJYFQ3&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon-exclusive Mirror Edition</a> costs $110 and includes all of the digital content found in the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FDTN2KQS,B0FDR7G47V,B0FDR9641P,B0FDR8H4LN&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$60 Deluxe Edition</a> as well as a handful of collectibles.

She also finds a quirky yet brilliant sidekick to sheepishly help her optimize her Ironheart suit, with an interesting twist. After meeting McGillicuddy (Alden Ehrenreich) and visiting his shady bunker full of black market weapons, Riri gets him to confess that his name is actually Ezekiel Stane. And he has a Ziploc bag full of the ashes of Obadiah Stane—his father!</p><p>Those who have been MCU fans since it began with the first <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mcu-raza-return-wandavision-iron-man-vision-spin-off-tv-1851740404&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mcu-raza-return-wandavision-iron-man-vision-spin-off-tv-1851740404"><em>Iron Man</em> movie</a></span> in 2008 will remember Obadiah (Jeff Bridges) as the ruthless Stark Industries executive who orchestrated Tony’s kidnapping in Afghanistan and horrifyingly pulled the arc reactor out of the Stark Industries founder’s chest. In the show, Ezekiel says he is 36 years old, which would make him roughly 17 when his father was killed by Iron Man. That’s still young enough for him to have developed the sort of trauma that’ll turn someone into the type to hoard weapons of mass destruction as a “hobby.”</p><p>Interestingly enough, Ezekiel tells Riri that he and his father weren’t close (hence the Ziploc bag urn) and references his father’s nefarious Iron Monger alter ego. However, in <em>Iron Man</em>, it’s never publicly revealed that Obadiah was the Iron Monger, which could suggest Ezekiel either had intimate knowledge of his father’s crimes from being involved, or that he was told about them later in life. Either way, <em>Ironheart </em>adds a cool expansion to the MCU history books—without making that the central appeal of an already great show. </p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/ironheart-iron-man-obidiah-stane-ezekiel-stane-disney-1851785091]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Like the first game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> has several Easter eggs waiting to be discovered, and one of the best is tied to your birthday. If you happen to be celebrating another spin around the sun, the game will pick up on this and the next time you decide to take a break, you'll be greeted with a heartwarming scene that features the main cast. Just don't get too excited about the birthday cake, as it's about to suffer a terrible fate in this short celebration. At least Higgs is here to save the day--for once.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPF8GgmWW6c" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yPF8GgmWW6c" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>This is a fun treat for players because you can say that Norman Reedus, Lea Seydoux, and several other famous Hollywood faces personally wished you a happy birthday. Sure, they're playing characters inside of a video game, but it still <em>technically</em> counts. It shouldn't be too surprising to see an Easter egg like this in Death Stranding 2, and with the game out this week, players will likely be unearthing a few more secrets in the weeks to come.</p><p>Death Stranding had its fair share of them, with some of the highlights being references to game director Hideo Kojima's work on the Metal Gear Solid series, nods to classic literature, and plenty of cameos.

<figure><a title="TRON: Catalyst Review - Screenshot 1 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157009/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>No matter how much I learn about the workings of computers, it will always be Tron in there. Little programs, running around on the Grid, trying to keep the whole system from falling apart. So, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tron_catalyst">Tron: Catalyst</a> felt right up my street. It does a great job of visually replicating that digital world and there is a great idea at its core. Unfortunately, the gameplay didn’t quite live up to the premise. By the end, I was left feeling like the program needed more time to compile.</p>
<p>Tron: Catalyst starts strong – we are introduced to a courier program named Exo who, due to a package exploding in her hands, begins glitching. Her glitches cause her to relive loops of time over and over, a power she uses to escape from prison and uncover a conspiracy surrounding the approaching reset of the Grid. There are competing factions trying to preserve or destroy the Grid; Core seeks to control the Grid with brute force while Automata seek to impart free will to all programs.</p>
<figure><a title="TRON: Catalyst Review - Screenshot 2 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157015/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>It's a great set up and it immediately got me hooked on the story Tron: Catalyst was telling, with perhaps the best implementation of time travel mechanics I’ve seen (and you’re talking to a guy with a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/chrono_trigger">Chrono Trigger</a> tattoo), with Exo able to relive loops over and over to get the right outcome. It isn’t just a case of “you ran out of hit points so you restart the loop” either – there are points where it is necessary to restart a loop of your own free will to get a new outcome after you’ve gotten new information.</p>
<p>There are some fun characters to interact with throughout. Most have voice acting and their cutscenes play out through static images with text beneath them. It all feels a bit basic and some of the dialogue is a bit stiff, but it does the job of moving the plot forward. In the second half of the game, when the timeline opens up and you can do more to manipulate outcomes to your advantage, you get to not just interact with these people but truly help them, which is where Tron: Catalyst finally comes to life. Because they let me get to know everyone in the first half of the game, I was extra motivated to help them when I finally got the chance.</p>
<figure><a title="TRON: Catalyst Review - Screenshot 3 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157012/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The problem comes down to the gameplay. Unlike <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tron_identity">Tron: Identity</a>, Catalyst is a top-down isometric action game, so you’ll spend a lot of time fighting other programs to get where you need to go. Combat is relatively tame. You can attack, block, or dodge. Eventually, you get the ability to replicate the code of other programs, which can give you stronger attacks or greater speed. It isn’t exactly necessary – you can get through the whole game just by hitting everything in your base form – so it doesn't really inject much depth into an already shallow system.</p>
<p>Combat is never terribly difficult, but it becomes significantly easier once you unlock the ability to inflict massive damage on a parry, to the point where even some bosses go down in one hit. The rest of the skill tree feels unnecessary once you’ve powered up your parry ability. It feels unbalanced and highlights my biggest complaint about the game – outside of the story, everything feels unfinished and half-baked. You really shouldn’t be able to hit one button to win most fights.</p>
<p>This is especially true of the vehicle sections in Tron: Catalyst. Early on you get access to a light cycle, the iconic vehicle from the <strong>Tron</strong> films. This should have been a highlight, but it never handles well. It floats in a way that doesn’t make sense, especially given that light cycles in the films travel in straight lines and handle with sharp, 90-degree turns. It is even worse during the light jet segment, where the controls will suddenly reverse if you turn too far in one direction. This part of the game was the one that took me the most time to finish. It left me shouting in frustration. This is Tron, after all. I should be <em>loving</em> the light cycle, not dreading every time I load it up.</p>
<figure><a title="TRON: Catalyst Review - Screenshot 4 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157010/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Visually, I found myself unimpressed with Tron: Catalyst. Even with the bright neon lights replicating the feel of the original Tron movie, there were points where the visuals were too dark to see where I was going, causing me to get stuck behind walls or by stairs. The problem was worse in handheld mode, but it didn’t happen enough to be anything other than a minor annoyance. Just another example where Tron: Catalyst felt unpolished. The true sin the developers committed was not letting me adjust the camera angle. It gave the game a static feeling that I wanted to rebel against.</p>
<p>So, the combat is lackluster and the vehicle portions just feel wrong. Yet, I can’t bring myself to pan this game completely. This is a case of a developer not finding the right genre for the game they want to make. If Tron: Catalyst had been a visual novel with the ability to flip between chapters as you restart loops, it could have been great because there is greatness in here. The narrative is good and the time-travel concept is honestly one of the best I’ve seen, but neither gets the chance to shine. Instead, they are wrapped up in a shallow combat system, frustrating vehicle sections, and bland visuals.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Tron: Catalyst isn’t a terrible game, but it is definitely in the wrong genre. Its engaging setting and excellent time-travel mechanics carried me far beyond the point where I got bored of the shallow combat system and frustrating vehicle sections. Despite the visuals and story feeling very Tron, it doesn’t capture the same feel of the movies. Honestly, if you can’t make a light cycle fun to ride, you have no place making a Tron game.</p></section>

Trade-in Materials are categorized under the Special Items/Other tab. <strong>If you want to sell all your junk fast, press Triangle/Y to bring up the sub-menu, and then select <em>Sell All Trade-in Materials</em></strong>.</p><h2 id="h20983"><a id="2"></a>What else can be sold?</h2><p>It’s unlikely that you’ll run out of Zenny. Just completing hunts can provide more than you need. If they don’t, selling Trade-In Materials will yield a hell of a boost in funds. All that being said, you do have the choice to sell other things. Everything from ores and ingredients to weapons and armor can be traded for Zenny.</p><p>While there are certainly a lot of options, <strong>I would prioritize selling any low-rank armor you made and ingredients that you have a ridiculous amount of</strong>. Weapons can always be upgraded to higher rarities. Special items and materials you forage can be given to Item Traders for other rare assets. Even monster parts can be used to smelt ores if you don’t have any applicable weapons or armors to forge. Remember not to sell everything just because you can–plenty of stuff has other uses with the many mechanics of this game!</p><hr><p><br><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs. </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-zenny-trade-in-material-1851785064]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Behind every great manga series is an artist, or mangaka, who more often than not opts to hide their face and let their work speak for itself. In print, readers will spot their presence in playful author blurbs tucked inside volumes or the prefaces of their new chapters in weekly magazines like <em>Shonen Jump</em>, where artists like Eiichiro Oda write bite-sized anecdotes about their week, accompanied by a quirky caricature of themselves. However, when the spotlight of their work demands more exposure—be it a fan event or a press interview tied to their anime—many mangaka go to impressive lengths to conceal their faces.</p><p>Contrary to the fame-forward culture of Western “auteurs,” where directors gladly bask in the limelight during press tours, many mangaka choose to keep a low profile for a simple reason: they like their privacy. Between <a href="https://gizmodo.com/jujutsu-kaisen-leaks-271-manga-spoiler-culture-2000503868" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">toxic fandom backlash</a>, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/racists-are-trying-to-make-dan-da-dan-the-latest-front-in-their-culture-war-2000536054" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">culture war dogpiling</a>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/a-thousand-death-threats-against-a-popular-anime-creato-631792221" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">online threats over creative choices</a>, and <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2009-04-09/woman-arrested-for-threatening-one-piece-creator-oda" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">death threats</a>, keeping their face out of public view isn’t vanity, it’s protection. When the industry already <a href="https://kotaku.com/hunter-x-hunter-berserk-nana-vagabond-hiatus-manga-1849184744" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blurs the line between work life and private life</a>, that boundary becomes essential.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ChnkvDUQqv4?feature=share" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it’s also amusing</a> when a creator like <em>Nier: Automata</em> director Yoko Taro’s career, which has leaned into anonymity, leads to improvising a new disguise after he <a href="https://kotaku.com/yoko-taro-mask-nier-automata-emil-lost-anime-expo-2023-1850603039" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lost his titular mask at Anime Expo 2023</a>. Who doesn’t love a good disguise? In the spirit of that, here’s my top five favorite mangaka disguises. Honorable mention goes to <a href="https://gizmodo.com/witch-hat-ateliers-creator-shares-her-inspirations-and-aspirations-for-its-anime-2000514254" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Witch Hat Atelier</em> creator Kamome Shirahama</a>, who, during a virtual interview for her anime adaptation, sent over a headshot so absurdly charming it had me doubled over laughing.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Kamome Shirahama/KODANSHA/ Witch Hat Atelier Committee</span></figcaption></figure><h2>Dandadan’s Yukinobu Tatsu</h2><p>As a creator who got his start as an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/chainsaw-mans-influence-can-already-be-felt-beyond-its-anime" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">assistant to mangaka like <em>Chainsaw Man</em> creator Tatsuki Fujimoto’s <em>Fire Punch</em></a> and fellow assistant <a href="https://kotaku.com/hell-s-paradise-manga-shonen-jump-seinen-yuji-kaku-horr-1848618482" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yuji Kaku’s <em>Hell’s Paradise: Jigokuraku</em></a>, <a href="https://dandadan.fandom.com/wiki/Yukinobu_Tatsu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yukinobu Tatsu</a>’s series <a href="https://aftermath.site/dandadan-anime-science-saru-netflix" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Dandadan</em></a> quickly strapped a rocket to his back, propelling him into the mainstream. Instead of opting for one of his characters to digitally stand in for himself, as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Rr_asBvOB8&amp;t=1667s&amp;pp=0gcJCdAJAYcqIYzv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fujimoto does with Pochita</a>, Tatsu’s disguise is both puzzling and provocative. It’s just a mask with eggs and sausages on its face. I’ve no clue what compelled him to make a <em>Purge</em>-adjacent breakfast mask his visage, but I can’t fault him for choosing a disguise that gets me in the mood for a Denny’s Grand Slam whenever I see him make a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@vizmedia/video/7426415811906112811" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">video appearance to promote <em>Dandadan</em>’s anime</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Fullmetal Alchemist’s Hiromu Arakawa</h2><div><figure><p><iframe title="Interview with Hiromu Arakawa, author of &quot;Fullmetal Alchemist&quot; (2017) [EngSub]" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9W2z9RqAtAM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiromu_Arakawa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hiromu Arakawa</a> is, without exaggeration, one of the greatest mangaka to ever do it. She’s the mind behind <em>Fullmetal Alchemist</em>, a series whose anime adaptation is often considered the gold standard thanks to its tight plotting, emotionally resonant characters (especially its women), sharp political themes, and side-splitting moments of levity. Despite being a goat, Arakawa, ever the unapologetic farm girl, fully leans into her roots in the most charming way possible: disguising herself as a bespectacled cow. Whether it’s her author’s headshot or her face superimposed in video interviews, she always appears as a bookish bovine. It’s funny, it’s adorable, and it makes her long-running milk agenda in <em>FMA</em>—where she insists Ed could’ve outgrown his short king phase with a proper calcium intake—all the more iconic.&nbsp;</p><h2>Jujutsu Kaisen’s Gege Akutami&nbsp;</h2><div><figure><p><iframe title="【公式】漫道コバヤシ#74 漫画大賞2020グランプリ 芥見下々『呪術廻戦』-蒼-" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CoE6ptLsfaA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Before the <a href="https://aftermath.site/jujutsu-kaisen-magneto-xavier-gojo-geto" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Jujutsu Kaisen</em></a> fandom went full nutso mode over how the story wrapped up—raging about character deaths, narrative choices, and backseat quarterbacking over how they would’ve written it—<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gege_Akutami" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gege Akutami</a> was already well acquainted with the dark side of success. Few modern mangaka have endured the level of fan backlash Akutami has, all for creating one of today’s most popular shonen series.&nbsp;</p><p>Long before the firestorm, though, Akutami leaned into anonymity early in the most on-brand way possible: showing up to interviews in full <a href="https://jujutsu-kaisen.fandom.com/wiki/Kokichi_Muta" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mechamaru</a> cosplay. Akutami’s disguise isn’t just clever, it’s a perfect meta nod. The cyborg character remotely operates the automaton from the safe refuge of his hidden base. Not even his allies know what his real face looks like. Akutami also gets bonus points for his commitment to the disguise.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sony has revealed the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PS Plus</a> monthly games for July 2025, as well as detailing some of what will happen to mark and celebrate the 15th anniversary of the subscription service, which launched in a very different guise all the way back in 2010.</p>
<p>Let’s not mess about, though. PS Plus this month includes Diablo 4, and two other games, which are…</p>


<p><span>What are the PS Plus July 2025 Monthly Games?</span></p>
<p>There’s a solid trio of titles for PS Plus this month, which includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Diablo IV</strong> | PS5, PS4</li>
<li><strong>King of Fighters XV</strong> | PS5, PS4</li>
<li><strong>Jusant</strong> | PS5</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/06/08/diablo-iv-review/"><strong>Diablo IV</strong></a> is the headline act here, with Blizzard’s latest action RPG title looking to completely overhaul how it taps into online features, building more of a live game to compliment the moreish loot hunting. There’s been a bunch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/03/diablo-iv-season-of-loot-reborn-review/">seasons</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/25/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-dlc-review/">expansion</a> content added to the game since launch in 2023, but at the time Gamoc said, “Diablo IV is almost shockingly refined, with an absorbing story and addictive gameplay. The shift to always online and connected play might turn some away, and the level scaling can make combat a little same-y, but on the whole, this is still Diablo at its best. It plays very well, offers tonnes of options for tailoring your character and acquiring that all important hunt for better and better loot will keep you coming back for more.”</p>


<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/02/15/king-of-fighters-xv-15-review/"><strong>King of Fighters XV</strong></a> revived the long-running fighting game series, back in 2022. SNK’s storied series had gone pretty quiet through the previous decade, but came back with a hefty punch. Dom said in our review, “King of Fighters XV marks an excellent return for the series, modernising it at nearly every turn. While we await a story that’ll finally do justice to the characterful roster, it stakes a claim to SNK’s past with an eye firmly on the future.”</p>

<p>Alas, we have no review of Jusant to draw upon, but Don’t Nod’s climbing game was certainly fascinating to see developed and released. It’s both an action-puzzle climbing game where you try to clamber up the side of a huge tower, but it’s also a meditative journey because of this, with secrets from a lost civilisation to uncover.</p>
<h2>What’s happening for the PS Plus 15th Anniversary?</h2>
<p>Sony has pulled together a bunch of new game trials for PS Plus Premium members, some special offers, exclusive Valorant content, and PS Tournaments. Oh, and a free weekend!</p>
