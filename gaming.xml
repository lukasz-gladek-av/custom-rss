            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cataclismo-delayed-early-access<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Cataclismo</em>, an upcoming RTS from&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>publisher Hooded Horse, has been delayed by a few days, and the decision has also been made to release the game in Early Access.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1422440/view/4222769301380727215" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam news post announcing the changes</a>, Hooded Horse and developer Digital Sun say that the delay, which will see the game launching on July 22nd, is intended to "get everything in place for a successful [Early Access] launch".</p>
<p>The devs also say that Early Access was chosen to "polish the game alongside our community", calling this model "the perfect tool" to ensure that the finished product is as good as it can be, a position with which I'm sure&nbsp;<em>No Rest for the Wicked</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-rest-for-wicked-ceo-early-access-comments">Thomas Mahler would agree</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cataclismo-delayed-early-access-siege.jpg?itok=qT4QjPuY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cataclismo-delayed-early-access-siege.jpg?itok=Ma4PNYYT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Siege RTS&nbsp;<em>Cataclismo&nbsp;</em>is being pushed back a few days.</figcaption></figure><p>Although it's not explicitly mentioned, it's not hard to imagine that Hooded Horse and Digital Sun have chosen to launch&nbsp;<em>Cataclismo&nbsp;</em>into Early Access partially as a result of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/manor-lords-sales-two-million">success of the publisher's city-builder&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords</em></a>.</p>
<p>The two studios say that the Early Access period for&nbsp;<em>Cataclismo&nbsp;</em>will be "short", and it sounds like the game will have plenty of stuff to do.</p>
<p>At launch,&nbsp;<em>Cataclismo&nbsp;</em>will feature a campaign complete with a tutorial and eleven levels, with more coming before the 1.0 launch. It'll also offer a skirmish mode across "two different levels and biomes", as well as an endless play mode and a level editor.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Cataclismo</em>, it's a hybrid real-time strategy and tower defense game created by the folks behind roguelike shop management sim&nbsp;<em>Moonlighter</em>.</p>
<p>During the day, you'll build up your defenses and gather resources with "Lego-inspired mechanics", and by night, you'll use the traps, fortifications, and troops you've amassed to defend your stronghold from encroaching horrors.</p>
<p><em>Cataclismo&nbsp;</em>will boast a realistic physics model that allows you to crush enemies beneath falling bricks, and when the full release arrives, it'll also offer a full 30-hour campaign "with VA and cutscenes".</p>
<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Cataclismo&nbsp;</em>when it launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1422440/Cataclismo/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a> on July 22nd. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

The program lets you earn coins you can use to buy games on PSN, as well as collect virtual figurines that can only be viewed inside of the PlayStation app. And the whole thing has been broken since the beginning of June.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196181" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="180" data-playlist="196181,196230,193348" data-current="196181"><div><p>The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21718.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>If you’re a normal person, you’re probably wondering what the hell PlayStation Stars even is. Assuming you forgot or were never aware to begin with, like seemingly most PlayStation players at this point, the program was an overhaul of PlayStation Rewards that launched back in 2022. Players could get coins for buying games or completing “campaigns” that challenged them to play certain types of games in exchange for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/playstationstars/comments/1cflr4p/stars_collectible_showcase/#lightbox&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/playstationstars/comments/1cflr4p/stars_collectible_showcase/#lightbox" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bespoke collectibles</a></span>. These would be added to a virtual book shelf that ranged from callbacks to the platform’s history to branded cross-overs like Spider-Man Adidas. </p><p>Still, it’s a nice way to earn cash back that eventually adds up. We first started noticing issues <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/playstationstars/comments/1d9kl56/playstation_stars_not_working/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/playstationstars/comments/1d9kl56/playstation_stars_not_working/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">around June 6</a></span>, when PlayStation Stars, accessed via small icon on the home screen of the PlayStation mobile app, wouldn’t open. Instead, players were greeted by an error message: “PlayStation Stars is currently experiencing issues. Our engineers are aware of the issue and working on a solution.”</p><p>The timing was especially odd, since Sony was running a bunch of PlayStation Stars promotions alongside its mid-year Play Days sale event. This meant there were certain collectibles and awards that could only be earned by purchasing and playing certain games during the event. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.truetrophies.com/news/playstation-stars-points-offline-june-2024&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.truetrophies.com/news/playstation-stars-points-offline-june-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to PlayStation Support</a></span>, users would continue to accrue points and collectibles even while the program was down, though they wouldn’t be able to see any of it, let alone track what was still incomplete.  </p><p>25 days later, the program is still broken. As users on the PlayStation Stars subreddit <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/playstationstars/comments/1dq23nm/will_playstation_stars_be_down_longer_than_the/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/playstationstars/comments/1dq23nm/will_playstation_stars_be_down_longer_than_the/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">have been predicting</a></span>, that puts it beyond the 23 day outage that PSN infamously suffered back in 2011 following an unprecedented hack. During that period, PS3 players were unable to play games online, buy them digitally, or use any of the console’s social features. Once service was restored, Sony apologized by giving players free games and a month of PS Plus on the house. </p><p>PlayStation Stars wasn’t hacked, doesn’t cost money, and is used by far fewer people, so its outage is hardly a scandal in the scheme of things. It’s just very strange, and Sony hasn’t yet clarified what exactly the problem is nor when the rewards program will be back up and running. The company did not respond to a request for comment. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-lays-out-plans-to-combat-switch-2-scalping.916260/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-lays-out-plans-to-combat-switch-2-scalping/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>With the highly anticipated release of the Nintendo Switch 2 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-successor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next year</a>, the company’s president has unveiled a significant plan to combat scalping. This plan is a reassuring step for players who often face the challenge of securing a new console on launch day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During an earnings call, Shuntaro Furukawa, the President of Nintendo, recently addressed the issue of scalping for their next console. As per <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-says-it-wants-to-avoid-switch-2-scalping-by-making-enough-to-meet-demand/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VGC</a>, Furukawa addressed three main pointers:</p>



<ol>
<li>Nintendo will make sure that they provide an appropriate amount of stock so that the supply matches the demand.</li>



<li>Furukawa stated that they will consider the “circumstances in each region”.</li>



<li>Semi-conductor shortage will not be an issue for the Switch 2&nbsp;</li>
</ol>



<p>Scalping, or the reselling of consoles at inflated prices, is a frustrating reality of new releases. It forces many players to shell out far more than the intended price for the device. A direct instance of this was seen during the PlayStation 5 launch, with consoles sold at 2 to 3 times the market retail price. Players left with no other option, had to purchase at these inflated rates. This plight, where players are compelled to pay exorbitant prices due to scalping, is a situation that resonates with many.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Three main factors contributed to the shortage of consoles at retail. Firstly, the console was released during the pandemic, which had already caused production issues globally. Secondly, there was a shortage of semiconductors, further delaying production. Lastly, Sony’s limited drops allowed scalpers to dominate the market, leaving genuine buyers empty-handed. It’s crucial to understand these factors to anticipate the availability of the Nintendo Switch 2.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The next game in the Halo franchise has a new lead designer. First spotted by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwhwa83K3-U" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rebs Gaming</a>, 343 Industries has hired Dan Gniady as the new lead designer for Halo 7, or whatever they decide to call the game. </p>



<p>Gniady previously worked as a lead designer on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sega-cancels-hyenas/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hyenas</a> at Creative Assembly, and as a designer at Bungie for a decade. During his time there, he worked on both Destiny titles as well as various expansions for the games.</p>



<p>“After speaking with a ton of cool teams about rad projects I’m getting a shot to work with the Chief and friends,” Gniady posted on his LinkedIn page last month. “I love Halo and am very excited to be a part of adding to its legacy.”</p>



<p>Halo 7 is in development at 343 Industries and appears to be using Unreal Engine based on another job posting. No other details or confirmation about the state of the next game in the franchise has been announced by Microsoft as of writing.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-modder-restores-secret-ending-scrapped-by-cd-projekt<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><em><strong>Spoiler Warning: This article contains some spoilers for the ending of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt alongside a handful of minor spoilers from The Witcher book series.</strong></em></p><p>A <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">Witcher 3</a> modder has discovered and restored a huge chunk of gameplay cut from the beloved role-playing game's ending by developer CD Projekt.</p><p>This extended ending, outlined by YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3GMtR7U_hI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">xLetalis</a> and modded by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoSPKfadbmawD0zH13mxLnA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">glassfish777</a>, begins after protagonist Geralt's fight with Witcher 3's main antagonist, <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/Eredin">Eredin of The Wild Hunt</a>. Geralt is pulled away from this fight after his victory by potential partner and powerful sorceress Yennefer of Vengerberg in the actual game, but in the cut content instead wakes up in a tent, being seen to by two doctors.</p><p>A restored cutscene here shows the pair making a bet over whether or not Geralt lives, and the witcher wakes up with his own snappy response: "I'll take that bet." He eventually leaves the tent and encounters Yennefer in a scene with varying dialogue depending on if players entered a relationship with her or fellow sorceress Triss Merigold.</p><p>Geralt can ask who won the war here, and Yennefer responds by explaining the Skelligans fled the war after the death of Crach an Craite, whose death during the battle wasn't mentioned again in the full game.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt Cut Ending Content</h3></div></output><p>Subsequent scenes show just how much CD Projekt scrapped here, as entire groups of miscellaneous background characters are fitted with their own dialogue. Some are veterans of Cintra, for example, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-books-reading-order">a story from the book series</a> and Nilfgaard's first venture north, while others have unique dialogue about murdering someone.</p><p>Geralt then attends Crach's funeral, meeting Triss on the way. This too has varying paths depending on <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/King's_Gambit">who became the new king or queen of Skellige</a>. Further interactions show a conversation between Yennefer and Triss and Geralt meeting The Lodge of Sorceresses.</p><p>It's this final point which has the most dramatic story change to the main game and general Witcher lore, however. The Lodge is essentially a secret society of powerful sorceresses who seek to control the myriad countries of The Continent from behind the scenes, only featured briefly in Witcher 3 as Geralt reunites them to help fight The Wild Hunt. After the battle, however, it's not mentioned again. But Yennefer betrays The Lodge in this version.</p><p>She does have a complex relationship with its members, told throughout myriad books and games, but Yennefer's decision comes as part of a deal to save Ciri, as she essentially sells them off to Nilfgaardian emperor Emhyr var Emreis, who seemingly plans to kill them.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Geralt can respond in three different ways, which again unfold to grander repercussions, but he doesn't appear to be particularly happy with Yennefer regardless of the option chosen. Witcher fans will likely long debate whether or not this should have happened in the game, and why it was removed in the first place.</p><p>This sequence took place immediately after what's essentially the final boss fight though, and preceding another intense scene where Geralt and Yennefer rush across an island as monsters emerge from portals all around them, so it was perhaps just cut for the sake of pacing.</p><p>This deleted content is the first major discovery following the release of REDkit: <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-3-official-mod-support-arrives-this-month">an official modding tool for Witcher 3 released by CD Projekt in May 2024</a>. The developer announced REDkit in November 2023, saying "it will allow you to create your own experiences in the game by making something completely new or editing existing quests and content."</p><p>It didn't say anything about fans digging up its own scrapped content, however, and more does exist. CD Projekt has previously commented on cut missions related to Iorveth from The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings, for example, so perhaps fans will revive that and other sequences too.</p><p>REDkit has otherwise been used to create some wild and wacky mods for Witcher 3, including <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/forget-roach-this-witcher-3-wild-hunt-mod-lets-you-ride-a-vicious-fiend">one that lets Geralt ride an enormous fiend instead of Roach</a> and another that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/get-a-taste-of-the-witcher-remake-with-mod-that-puts-original-games-maps-in-the-witcher-3">recreates the original game in Witcher 3's engine</a> ahead of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-remake-will-be-open-world-cd-projekt-red-confirms">an official remake</a>.</p><p>Mods will be the only new content coming to Witcher 3 going forward, of course, as while the game received <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/Biggest_Changes_in_the_Next-Gen_Update">a PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S update in December 2022</a>, it otherwise won't get any more official content as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/every-cd-projekt-red-game-in-development">CD Projekt focuses on its wealth of other incoming projects</a>.</p><p>The highly anticipated next mainline Witcher game, codenamed Polaris, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-4-polaris-development-cd-projekt">is currently in development</a> but won't arrive until <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-4-polaris-is-at-least-three-years-away">2025 at the absolute earliest, and probably later</a>. There are two other Witcher games on the horizon too, including <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-remake-will-be-open-world-cd-projekt-red-confirms">the aforementioned remake of the original Witcher</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/witcher-spin-off-project-sirius-has-a-new-framework-following-development-restart">a multiplayer spin-off</a>.</p><p><em>Image Credit: </em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3GMtR7U_hI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">xLetalis</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoSPKfadbmawD0zH13mxLnA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">glassfish777</a> on YouTube</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

            <link>https://aftermath.site/fallen-aces-episode-one-impressions</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fallen-aces-is-like-playing-a-noir-comic-book.916236/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/fallen-aces-episode-one-impressions<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Every time the question “what games are you looking forward to?” comes up on our <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/aftermath-hours" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">podcast</a>, I freeze a bit. With the decimation of studios like <a href="https://aftermath.site/eidos-deus-ex-embracer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eidos Montreal</a> and <a href="https://aftermath.site/bethesda-closure-microsoft-arkane" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arkane Austin</a>, they aren’t making a lot of “Riley games” anymore–i.e., immerse sims, full of vents to hide in and multiple ways to tackle a level. Early access game <em>Fallen Aces </em>isn’t scratching all of those itches for me, but it’s reaching some of them.</p><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1411910/Fallen_Aces/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Fallen Aces</em></a> is an episodic noir detective story from New Blood, with one episode out and two more to go. The setup is familiar stuff: you play as a down-on-his-luck detective in a grim city, and someone wants you dead. The cutscenes are told through comic book-style panels, and the rest of the art style reflects that too. Enemies and interactive objects are two-dimensional, an effect that’s weird at first but gives the world a cartoonish, almost whimsical vibe that meshes well with its pulpy dialogue and offsets some of the brutal violence you get up to as you fight your way across the city.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Fallen Aces: Episode 1 Release Date Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vTWta2kwHzM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>You don’t <em>have</em> to fight, though. In the spirit of the immersive sim, <em>Fallen Aces </em>sets up a situation and lets you figure out how to deal with it, not funnelling you into combat or stealth. In the opening scene, the hotel where you live is overrun by gangsters. You can battle them all, punching and kicking and making use of whatever weapon is at your disposal. Or, you can sneak through vents and over rooftops to escape unscathed. I found myself employing both options, picking off enemies one by one in a shadowy area where enemies were spread out, and in another going to town on everyone with a combination of thrown trash cans and a board with some nails in it.</p><p>I’ve seen some players call the combat simplistic, but it kept me on my toes through the number of enemies and weapon durability meaning my favorites would often break during a fight, leaving me to scramble for a backup plan. I used my fists a lot, striking and dodging like a showboating boxer. There’s firearms, but their ammo is limited and takes up your inventory space, making them not my preferred option. For me, fights felt fast-paced and exciting without ever being overly challenging.&nbsp;</p><p>The usual early access caveats apply: while I had a lot of fun in my several hours with the first episode, I’d understand players wanting to wait to see the whole story through, or to see what changes based on player feedback. (However, New Blood writes that the price of the game will go up as more episodes get added.) For me, a quick, personality-filled romp was just my speed, and I’m happy to have finished what the game has on offer and then take a break until there’s more.</p><p><em>Fallen Aces</em> isn’t <em>exactly</em> an immersive sim; another early access detective game with a unique art style and a strong atmosphere, <a href="https://aftermath.site/shadows-of-doubt-indie-detective" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Shadows of Doubt</em></a>, hits those notes a bit louder for me. But it’s cool that we’ve got at least two very Riley games in the works, and that early access means there’s more to come for them both.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Kunitsu-Game: Path of the Goddess Preview – Dancing swords in the moonlight]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/01/kunitsu-game-path-of-the-goddess-preview-dancing-swords-in-the-moonlight/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kunitsu-game-path-of-the-goddess-preview-%E2%80%93-dancing-swords-in-the-moonlight.916221/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/01/kunitsu-game-path-of-the-goddess-preview-dancing-swords-in-the-moonlight/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>We need more games like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess">Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</a>. I’m not talking about its specific blend of gameplay – though a few copycats wouldn’t go amiss, if you ask me –but rather that it’s Capcom that’s making it. With so much focus on AAA games that take the better part of a decade to produce, it’s always refreshing to see smaller teams within major publishers producing niche and inventive games that have become the preserve of indie developers in recent years. Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess is one such game, and could be a real surprise for anyone that dances on over when it comes out later this month.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess - &quot;Soh&quot; Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5LvYXyFdYLM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>How to describe Kunitsu-Gami is a tricky one, though. There’s so many elements at play, but you can see the shadows of Monster Hunter, Pikmin, Kingdom: Two Crowns and plenty more besides dancing across its backlit tapestry. And that tapestry is a gorgeously woven rendition of Japanese mythology and religion that skips and dances across your screen.</p>


<p>The game’s story sees you trying to cleanse Mt. Kafuku of the defilement by twisted and evil spirits known as the Seethe. As the Seethe spread across the mountain, it consumed small villages dotted across the slope, leaving villagers cocooned while creepily many-handed growths have sprouted at various points around each locale.</p>


<p>It’s your quest, as Soh, to guide the divine maiden Yoshiro through each village, free their inhabitants, and fight back against the waves of the Seethe that attack at night. There’s a clear divide between daytime and night, with the former all about rapid exploration and preparation, and the latter then takes on the tone of a tower defence game as you protect the Maiden from attack.</p>
<p>There’s plenty to do during the preparatory phase, as you race around the map trying to destroy core patches of corruption and free villagers –&nbsp;you earn a bonus for clearing everything within a village, in the form of a new Tsuba Guard ability that could be a flashy attack, a group buff, or more. You also have to decide how far Yoshiro should move through the village along the main path of corruption that needs cleansing, triggering her ritualistic dance toward the utterly consumed Torii gate at the end of the stage.</p>
<p>Yoshiro will only be able to move so far in a day, though, and if she can’t reach a gate in time, the Seethe will spew out once again, so a village cleansing level will often require multiple day-night cycles to overcome and feature multiple gates to cleanse. So you need to spot the most defensible points, light beacons to illuminate the surroundings, fix up barriers and more in order to prepare. You also need to give any rescued villagers a class defining mask to let them fight alongside you. From an axe toting Woodcutter, to an archer, or an Ascetic that can slow and debuff enemies, and beyond, you’ll have to make choices based on the kinds of Seethe coming out of the gate, and the place them to cover paths and attack lanes. Thankfully, you can very quickly switch their roles and move them during the night, adapting to the oncoming waves.</p>

<p>You also have Soh himself, who is a master of “dancing swords” combat. Through the few levels I played, I would often race right into the action and unleash my simple sword attack combos, while having the villagers set up more to defend Yoshiro and clear up anything that snuck past me. The main trouble at this early point was with the flying Seethe, as I had yet to unlock Soh’s bow to more easily take them down, but there were further challenges that emerged, such as an enemy that would buff and protect the Seethe around them.</p>
<p>After successfully cleansing a stage, that village then becomes a hub that you can revisit, upgrade, and apply improvements to Soh and the various mask classes you have. Running around the now serene mountainside villages, you can assign the villagers construction and repair tasks that will be completed after your next mission, rewarding you with the materials and currency needed to then improve your kit. There’s also a tent for Yoshiro to hang out in, and visiting her will let you add upgrades for the masks you’ve collected so far, swap between Tsuba Guard abilities, and so on.</p>

<p>But then there’s the Festering Seethe, giant monsters that bring out those Monster Hunter and Pikmin comparisons, as you and a small band of villagers step into their arenas and seek to do battle. The most imposing of these that we faced was an oversized centipede monster that would rampage around a darkened arena, occasionally knocking gross grubs from the ceiling to attack Yoshiro. It’s a battle of health bars, as you once again need to protect Yoshiro and fight off smaller Seethe, but also have to deal damage to the main boss and, in the case of this particular beast, during the right times.</p>
<p>There’s plenty of depths to the tactics and strategy in Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess that I wasn’t able to explore during my hands on time, but I already love the game’s blend of gameplay, visual stylings and overarching tone. It’s a game that at many points can look serene and in complete control as Yoshiro performatively progresses through a stage, but feels like a madcap dash and struggle to get everything done and prepared just in time to keep her safe in the fight against the Seethe.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-seamless-co-op-mod-dlc-updated<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>An&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>seamless co-op mod has been updated to add&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>support, which means it's now theoretically possible to play through the entire DLC in a single co-op session.</p>
<p>The aptly-named Seamless Co-op mod&nbsp;was updated yesterday, with a rewritten version adding support for the open-world RPG's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-dlc-release-date">recently-released DLC</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The downside, however, is that Seamless Co-op is in beta for&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>. The devs say that the mod has been completely rewritten and thus "requires extended beta testing", urging&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>PC players to "be understanding" if they check it out.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-seamless-co-op-mod-shadow-of-the-erdtree.jpg?itok=8Xf6UNJ4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-seamless-co-op-mod-shadow-of-the-erdtree.jpg?itok=8lH_5rq6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Get ready to experience&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>with your squad in tow.</figcaption></figure><p>In theory, this mod should allow you to journey through the Land of Shadow with your friends without needing to send them home after bosses, but since the mod is in beta, some teething troubles should be expected.</p>
<p>However, the base game's mod theoretically allows players to continue playing alongside one another as part of a continuous session. This means that players who die won't be returned to their home worlds, and if players vanquish a boss together, they'll remain in the same world.</p>
<p>Everyone in a session can mount and ride Torrent, and NPC dialogue will be synchronized across players, as will map waypoints.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, in theory, all of this is now possible for&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>, but you'll have to copy across any save data you have from the base game, as saves for&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>and the&nbsp;Seamless Co-op mod are technically treated as different entities.</p>
<p>You can find detailed instructions on how to install the mod, as well as any other steps you might need to take, over on the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/510?tab=description" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nexus Mods page for Seamless Co-op</a>.</p>

<p>The DLC launched last week to rapturous reviews and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-sales">strong sales</a>, although some players are divided on its difficulty and PC performance. From Software and publisher Bandai Namco have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-update-easier">since issued an update</a> that adjusts the difficulty curve slightly, although it's unlikely to address every player concern in this area.</p>

            <p>
Star Citizen developer Cloud Imperium Games (CIG) must pay more than £27k to a disabled former employee who brought a discrimination claim against the company.
</p>
<p>
The case, filed by Star Citizen senior programmer Paul Ah-Thion, revolves around a return-to-work policy that also involved work from the company's new central Manchester office location - some 15 miles from its previous Wilmslow location. 
</p>
<p>
Ah-Thion, who previously worked in-office at Wilmslow, brought the case after his requests to work remotely rather than travel into central Manchester were denied and he was subsequently terminated.

<p>
CIG had previously allowed Ah-Thion and other employees to work remotely for several years, but in 2022 decided to take a "tougher" stance on remote work, <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/cloud-imperium-games-discriminated-against-disabled-employee-with-return-to-office-policy">Game Developer</a> reported.
</p>
<p>
The tribunal dismissed "rather retrospective" claims by CIG that Ah-Thion's performance had been a concern, and decided that allowing him to work from home would have been a "reasonable adjustment".
</p>
<p>
CIG's penalty of £27,748 includes more than £14k of lost earnings, and £12k compensation for injury to feelings.
</p>
<p>
"I've been fighting this by myself for two years, and being autistic made the whole process especially challenging," Ah-Thion said. "But we're lucky to have the employment tribunal system, where an ordinary person can actually find justice without having to bankrupt themselves on legal fees.
</p>
<p>
"It was clear to me from the start that CIG didn't want people to work from home after the expense of their new Manchester office, and worked backwards from that to retroactively conjure up reasons why my request should be denied, something they continued to do right up until the final tribunal hearing - all while ignoring disability legislation. It was gratifying that the tribunal saw through them as easily as they did."
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted CIG for comment. 
</p>
<p>CIG has now raised more than <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/funding-goals">$711m</a> in funding for Star Citizen, its long-in-the-works space MMO. In 2022 it laid out <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-citizen-developer-lays-out-increasingly-ambitious-five-year-plan">ambitious plans for growth in the UK</a>, including the opening of the aforementioned Manchester studio, with a plan to grow the company's then-400-person team to 1000 by 2026.</p>

The developers that appear on camera seem to suggest that,though they’re currently planning for the new <em>Crazy Taxi </em>to be a massively multiplayer game, the team currently lacks programmers with the skills to build the infrastructure. Development on the new <em>Crazy Taxi </em>game seems early days, and as such, the interview partially functions as a call for more developers to join Sega and help make the title. As spotted by <em>Automaton</em>, the <em>Crazy Taxi </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://hrmos.co/pages/sega/jobs?category=2010249489979686912&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://hrmos.co/pages/sega/jobs?category=2010249489979686912" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recruitment page</a></span> has several listings calling the game a “large-scale online title.”</p><p>The team featured in the interview also use language that seems to suggest that plans <em>could </em>change if they don’t work out, but that this is the current direction for the <em>Crazy Taxi </em>revival. The game is currently being developed in Unreal Engine 4 and, as such, will feature a realistic city as one of its maps, as well as a theme park. The goal seems to be to amplify the realism of the environments on this new engine in order to increase the sense of chaos as players barrel through places that are deeply familiar to them.</p><p><em>Crazy Taxi</em>, as folks might remember, has largely been a single-player series with a focus on style (and branding) over realism, which makes some of these statements just a <em>wee </em>bit strange. First arriving in arcades, where it remains pretty popular to this day, <em>Crazy Taxi </em>was eventually released to consoles, but even then, its multiplayer was fairly limited in its later entries, and its visual identity has always remained fairly intact. Sega’s current revival of the series seems to throw many of these tenets out in order to reinterpret them for a modern audience, and I wish em’ the best of luck with that Herculean task.</p><p>Which isn’t to say I’m not on board with some of the stuff that Sega is saying, but merely suggesting that for diehard fans that really wanted the <em>Crazy Taxi</em> series to come back, something this new and distinct will feel heretical. I think most folks probably wanted a version of the game that lives up to their childhood memories of it. Then again, I do know that people, like myself, have enjoyed the variant of <em>Crazy Taxi </em>that exists as a minigame in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/infinite-wealth-like-a-dragon-review-kasuga-yakuza-1851190269&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/infinite-wealth-like-a-dragon-review-kasuga-yakuza-1851190269"><em>Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth</em></a></span>, so maybe this is exactly what the series needs.</p><p>I’m definitely down for making <em>Crazy Taxi </em>a massively multiplayer game, which could live up to the “crazy” in the series’ moniker. Trying to imagine a dozen or so taxis manically faring people up and down a realistic San Francisco brings a faint smile to my face, and if it’s well done, Sega could actually be onto something here. It seems like we won’t see the fruit of Sega’s labor for a while still as it figures out how viable a massively multiplayer <em>Crazy Taxi </em>is, but when we do, I hope it looks and sounds like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNHoWdid7ag&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNHoWdid7ag" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a hundred taxis blaring The Offspring</a></span> as loud as possible.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Much of that has to do with her place in the expansion’s overarching story—in many ways, <em>Dawntrail</em>’s main character feels like Wuk Lamat, rather than the Warrior of Light. Unlike past expansions, the player is not the center of the world. Instead, it is the player’s job to help Wuk Lamat through her trials and tribulations.

All of these factors have combined to capture the hearts of Warriors of Light everywhere. </p><hr><p>If you too want to enjoy the charms of everyone’s favorite Hrothgar, <em>Dawntrail</em> is currently in Early Access for players who pre-ordered the expansion.

        <p>President Shuntaro Furukawa also says successor won't be impacted by semiconductor shortage</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Nintendo has announced plans to avoid scalping with the release of the Switch's successor by meeting customer demand.</p>
<p>In a general Q&amp;A at a recent shareholders meeting as reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-says-it-wants-to-avoid-switch-2-scalping-by-making-enough-to-meet-demand/">VGC</a>, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa told investors that it would combat resellers by providing enough hardware for retailers to meet demand.</p>
<p>He also noted that Nintendo is no longer affected by the semiconductor shortage, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nintendo-sales-dip-3-6-percent-to-usd13-1bn-due-to-semiconductor-shortage">which partly caused the company's sales to dip in 2022.</a></p>
<p>"At present, we do not believe that the shortage of components will have a significant impact on the production of the successor model," Furukawa said.</p>
<p>In May, Nintendo confirmed that while it <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nintendo-no-switch-2-before-april-2025">"[hasn't] yet discussed the launch timing"</a> for its next console, Furukawa confirmed that the platform holder would <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nintendo-breaks-silence-on-switch-2-promises-announcement-by-april-2025">make an announcement about the Switch's successor by April 2025</a>.</p>

My name is Ruslan Sartykov, and I’ve been working at Nexters for three years now as a key member of the marketing art production team. Today, I’ll share some insights on this profession-within-a-profession. I feel that those in the rapidly expanding mobile games sector will find a lot of food for thought here, as graphic design and visual presentation plays an enormous role in the marketing of such titles. In this presentation, my goal is to break down the core elements of this career path, its importance in the market today, what skills you’ll need to break into the industry and your future career prospects.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What makes a 2D Marketing Artist?"><span>What makes a 2D Marketing Artist?</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So, what exactly does a 2D Marketing Artist do on the daily? They’re a specialist in creating visual materials for marketing campaigns. In my case, for mobile games. All those flashy graphics you see on store pages, announcing which characters you can collect? That’s me. The Marketing Artist’s tasks include developing attractive images that will be used to promote on websites, social networks and other platforms. It’s a key role, as those initial promo pieces are often the first thing a potential player sees. The success of the game and its whole marketing strategy can hinge on the artist’s work.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Main Responsibilities and Tasks"><span>Main Responsibilities and Tasks</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The key responsibilities of a 2d Marketing Artist include the creation of marketing materials for advertising banners, icons and posters, as well as elements that video editors will need for assembling into trailers and other promotional footage, including background and character art, item renders, game UI and beyond. This specialist 2D role works closely with directors, producers, the PR team for the game and its broader brand and product teams to create materials that support the overall promotional strategy for the game. One of the key challenges of the rule is to adapt content to fit the many platforms and formats for advertising. It’s a job that has demanded a lot of flexibility and knowledge on specifics and marketing trends from myself, and it’s a challenge that newcomers should be prepared for.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Required Skills and Competencies"><span>Required Skills and Competencies</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To be truly successful in this field, a 2D Marketing Artist must have a broad range of skills. First and foremost, you’ll need artistic skills and training. Drawing, composition and color theory are the obvious cornerstones. Technical skills are also vital - you’ll need to be proficient at working with the industry standard graphics packages, such as Photoshop, Illustrator or Blender 3D. A new demand of many companies is skills in working with generative AI, but this comes second to human artistic talent.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Being well versed in the fundamentals of marketing and advertising goes a long way, too. It helps greatly in creating materials that effectively capture an audience’s attention, and requires an analytical mind. No two marketing campaigns are identical, and creating materials based on past creative’s work is often a key part of the job, using gathered metrics to identify that styles worked or not. Much as you might want to avoid them, meetings with directors and producers are vital in understanding the big picture.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Work Process"><span>Work Process</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Every set of new marketing materials goes through a multi-step production process. First, the director brings the crew in for a brainstorming session, outlining the creative concepts you’ll be focusing on. The team will discuss and supplement those foundational ideas, and with a final plan drawn up, the artists get to work. It’s important to be able to work with a team, respond to feedback, make edits and adapt your work (however perfect it may already be) to the customer’s wishes. Time management is also important, and you’ll likely be expected to work under tight deadlines - last-minute changes in marketing plans are common in this business.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Career Opportunities"><span>Career Opportunities</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There’s a clear progression route within this line of work. Entry-level positions include junior marketing artists, where newcomers can develop their skills and experience fresh out of school. With time, experience and a few successful campaigns to put on your resume, you can progress to becoming a senior marketing artist, a specialist (if you find a particular niche) or even team leader, if you’re a people person. It's a field where hard work and continually working on your skill-set can open up great opportunities for professional growth and promotion.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It’s also not unusual for marketing artists to end up working on a game directly, given that the marketing team are so heavily involved in the creation of character, environment and UI art, with their concepts coming straight from the core game team. Whether working solely on the marketing or close to the development team, expect surprises. A good marketing artist is a flexible creature.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Challenges and Features of the Profession"><span>Challenges and Features of the Profession</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Every profession faces its own unique set of challenges. As a 2D marketing artist, I’ve encountered a rich and exciting range of creative and technical difficulties, requiring constant self-improvement adaptation. This is a job where you’ll have to think on your feet. New technologies and trends will affect your work, and you’ll be constantly learning and implementing new approaches to your daily routine. This adaptability is now more vital than ever, with the advent of generative AI making its way into the standard artist’s workflow. You’ll be expected to research these new technologies and implement them to accelerate and improve the quality of your output. As a personal example, my team has been actively experimenting with Stable Diffusion and MidJourney, and we’re always looking for new opportunities for improvement.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In many ways, marketing art is blazing a trail for the product itself, from the point of view of both mechanics and the implementation of new technologies. The marketing team are able to be more agile, implementing and testing new technologies on tangential materials, and able to pass on knowledge of what works to the core game development pipeline. A good marketing team works closely with the developers, after all.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Conclusion"><span>Conclusion</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With all that said and done, I must reiterate that a professional 2D marketing artist for a mobile studio is a highly agile role. It demands a complex combination of artistic and technical skills, a broad understanding of marketing and what sells well to specific audiences, plus the ability to work as part of a team.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It’s not easy, but it’s an interesting and dynamic profession, with great prospects for career advancement, vertically or laterally, as well as a continually interesting challenge for an artist. I hope to see you and many others joining this booming field in the near future!</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/crazy-taxi-reboot-will-be-an-open-world-mmo-sega-says.916167/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crazy-taxi-reboot-open-world-mmo<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sega has revealed that its upcoming&nbsp;<em>Crazy Taxi&nbsp;</em>reboot will take some risks in terms of direction, with the project supposedly taking the form of an open-world driving MMO that has a multiplayer focus.</p>
<p>Per a new video released by Sega (with additional reporting by the ever-reliable <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/new-crazy-taxi-title-will-be-an-open-world-massively-multiplayer-aaa-game-according-to-sega/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Automaton Media</a>), the studio is currently working out the specifics of the&nbsp;<em>Crazy Taxi&nbsp;</em>reboot's gameplay and how it will work with "many players at once" (that's Automaton's wording).</p>
<p>Sega's goal is to make the project feel like classic&nbsp;<em>Crazy Taxi&nbsp;</em>while still introducing new mechanics and systems, so if you're a&nbsp;<em>Crazy Taxi&nbsp;</em>fan and you're feeling miffed by the change in direction, you might not have too much cause to worry.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sega-crazy-taxi-reboot-gameplay.jpg?itok=lKltAfXH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sega-crazy-taxi-reboot-gameplay.jpg?itok=ZKBPd9l6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Crazy Taxi&nbsp;</em>is looking to reinvent the franchise, but it will stick close to the original's gameplay.</figcaption></figure><p>In the video (which is entirely in Japanese, so we're looking to Automaton for translation), Sega employees currently working on&nbsp;<em>Crazy Taxi&nbsp;</em>discuss their vision for the game and what they intend to achieve by making it.</p>
<p>Producer Kenji Kanno says the team is making a "completely new" version of&nbsp;<em>Crazy Taxi</em>, while his team members mention multiple different maps for the game, including a realistic city, an area inspired by the West Coast, and a theme park-style zone.</p>
<p>Additional information is available via some <a href="https://hrmos.co/pages/sega/jobs?category=2010249489979686912" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recently-created Sega job listings</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<em>Crazy Taxi&nbsp;</em>(which, once again, are in Japanese), calling for staffers to assist with an open-world racer built in Unreal Engine with a massively multiplayer focus.</p>
<p>It might not sound like the&nbsp;<em>Crazy Taxi&nbsp;</em>you're used to, but the footage we see in the video, as well as what was shown <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/game-awards-2023-recap-check-out-all-news-trailers-and-reveals">during last year's Game Awards</a>, seems to hew pretty close to the series' trademark fast-paced arcade racing action, at any rate.</p>

<p>We still don't know exactly when the&nbsp;<em>Crazy Taxi&nbsp;</em>reboot will arrive (which feels pretty appropriate for a taxi game, am I right?). For that matter, Sega has yet to officially unveil the game in full.</p>
<p>Hopefully, we'll learn more about this&nbsp;<em>Crazy Taxi&nbsp;</em>project in the coming months. Stay tuned for more, and in the meantime, if you're in a nostalgic mood, you can grab the original&nbsp;<em>Crazy Taxi&nbsp;</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/71230/Crazy_Taxi/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">right now on PC via Steam</a>.</p>

			<p>Former Bungie veteran&nbsp;Dan Gniady is leading the development of the next "Halo experience".</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwhwa83K3-U" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted</a> by YouTuber 'Rebs Gaming', Microsoft's Halo studio 343 Industries has hired a new lead game designer back in April of this year. While Gniady's work experience at 343 doesn't include any juicy details about this Halo "experience", there is reference that might interest Halo fans. "Doing game direction on a Halo experience", the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan-gniady-aa5b887/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Linkedin resume</a> reads. "Giving the Covenant back their bomb". We've included a screenshot of the resume in case it gets pulled or edited.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/next-halo-343.png"></a></figure>

<p>Prior to his work at 343 Industries, Gniady served as Lead Gameplay Designer at Sega's Creative Assembly, at which he worked at the <a href="https://wccftech.com/sega-cancels-hyenas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">canned Hyenas</a>. Before joining Creative Assembly, Gniady fulfilled various positions at Bungie, including producer on the original Destiny and its expansions as well as Destiny 2 and its first expansion - The Curse of Osiris. Aside from his role as producer, the nearly a decade-long Bungie veteran worked as a Gameplay Designer on Destiny 2: Warmind, Forsaken, the Black Armory weapon foundry , Season of the Drifter, Shadowkeep, and Beyond Light.</p>
<p>Microsoft has yet to officially confirm a new Halo installment, but late last year, a journalist <a href="https://wccftech.com/343-industries-new-halo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claimed</a> that 343 Industries is actively working on a new entry within Unreal Engine. "What I can say that I know anyway is, yes, they do have a team [at 343 Industries] working on the next Halo campaign", Seasoned Gaming's editor-in-chief Ains said. "It is part of that restructuring that is building the next generation of Halo on Unreal [Engine]".</p>
<p>Some months back, a resume of a former art director at 343 Industries mentioned work on the "next" Halo. As <a href="https://wccftech.com/ue5-powered-new-halo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> back then, this new Halo might very well be in Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>We'll update you as soon as we learn more about Xbox's Spartan's and, more in particular, John-117.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/mortal-kombat-1-player-loses-money-after-winning-the-esports-tournament/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>It’s a familiar feeling, the rush of victory, the urge to celebrate. But what if that celebration made a loss more significant than your win? This cautionary tale unfolded at a recent Mortal Kombat 1 esports competition, causing a lot of laughter and a significant financial loss. </p>



<p>CEO 2024, the latest installment of the beloved esports competition, was a battleground for the fighting genre from June 28-30. Mortal Kombat 1 stood out among the games, not just for its intense competition but for a hilarious post-victory mishap. The winner of the Mortal Kombat 1 competition found themselves in a pickle after celebrating a bit too enthusiastically. The mishap involved a chair and an exorbitant light.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Mortal Kombat 1 Pro Dyloch was the player who emerged victorious at the competition, and you can tell it wasn’t the easiest of tasks after seeing the way he celebrated his win. Right after serving up the finishing blow, Dyloch’s adrenaline rush led him to toss a chair out of the arena. The chair landed on a costly light, which cost way more than the prize money for the competition. In fact, the cost of the light was nearly five times the amount Dyloch was set to receive.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To put things into perspective, Dyloch was set to receive $565 for winning the Mortal Kombat 1 competition, and the light he destroyed was worth $ 2,992, as pointed out by CEO <a href="https://x.com/Jebailey/status/1807145856337854633" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Alex Jebailey</a>. </p>



<p>This means that Dyloch owes CEO $2,427 after winning the competition. And Dyloch will have to pay up as Debailey is<a href="https://x.com/Jebailey/status/1807117772087824600" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> not bailing him out of this one</a>. However, Dyloch’s recent post on Twitter states that he will be <a href="https://x.com/RezDyloch/status/1807141924387615037" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">taking responsibility</a> for the light as he flexes his new victory belt to the audience. </p>



<p>The moral of the story is that composure is essential, and this incident serves as a powerful lesson for all esports enthusiasts.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><figcaption>In other news, characters from the upcoming Mortal Kombat 1 DLC were recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mortal-kombat-1-dlc-characters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked online</a>. In the comments, let us know what you felt about this Mortal Kombat 1 esports mishap. </figcaption></figure>

The first "Act" of this new approach--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-destiny-2-is-ditching-seasons-for-less-predictable-episodes/1100-6520642/" data-ref-id="1100-6520642">Episodes comprised of three Acts each</a>--has wrapped up its story, but players have noted that the new Episode-based structure doesn't feel all that different to seasons so far. According to Bungie, there's much more on the way, and the new setup is enabling it to build one of its biggest Exotic missions ever, which will release later in 2024.</p><p>"We're going to finish some threads off, but we're also going to start opening up some doors to new stories to be told," game director Robbie Stevens said to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fps/destiny-2-the-final-shape-edge-feature/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>. According to Stevens, Act 2 will introduce "a completely new set of activities" on top of the new Breach Executable activity and will take players deeper into Nessus as the planet transforms. Act Three will see a new Exotic mission debut, one that Stevens described as being an ambitious step forward for Bungie.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Destiny 2: The Final Shape Review</p>
      </div>
<p>"We have an Exotic mission coming in Echoes Act Three," Stevens said. "It is one of the biggest Exotic missions we've ever built, and it's only possible because of this new content cadence. The ability for us to build this massive Exotic mission--literally one of the biggest--it wouldn't have been possible in the past. This is where we see the [development] team taking the opportunity, their willingness to change, their willingness to adapt to this new cadence with us, and really seize the opportunity to expand Nessus, expand this world."</p><p>Echoes is designed to serve as an epilogue to The Final Shape campaign that examines the fallout of the Light and Darkness Saga's conclusion in greater detail. While Bungie has big plans for Year 11 of Destiny 2, Stevens explained that the studio is aiming to tie up several character stories and "open up some doors" for the franchise. We've already seen the first glimpse of this new approach, as a new Vex antagonist called The Conductor is at the center of Echoes, and the next Episode focuses on fulfilling the Eliksni prophecy of the Kell of Kells and putting an end to the Scorn baron Fikrul, once and for all. Finally, Episode Three will see players <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2s-post-final-shape-future-includes-the-dreadnaught-and-a-tease-of-codename-frontiers/1100-6524116/" data-ref-id="1100-6524116">return to Oryx's Dreadnaught flagship</a>.</p><p>While the first Act of Echoes is over, Destiny 2 players can look forward to two weeks of PvP fun <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2s-iron-banner-extends-to-two-weeks-with-more-changes/1100-6524577/" data-ref-id="1100-6524577">when the Iron Banner returns</a>. Now a longer event, earning some of the rare loot from that multiplayer mode will be a little easier thanks to the extended duration of Iron Banner and several other tweaks to how it functions.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-citizen-discrimination-tribunal<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Cloud Imperium Games, the studio behind&nbsp;<em>Star Citizen</em>, has been ordered to pay $35,000 in compensation to a disabled worker against whom the studio has been found to have discriminated.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/cloud-imperium-games-discriminated-against-disabled-employee-with-return-to-office-policy" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Game Developer</a>, programmer Paul Ah-Thion took Cloud Imperium to tribunal following the instatement of a return-to-work program that didn't include any kind of provision for him and his disability.</p>
<p>Ah-Thion initially worked at Cloud Imperium's Wilmslow office, which was closed during the COVID-19 pandemic, necessitating that Cloud Imperium employees work remotely. When Cloud Imperium sought to relocate to Manchester, Ah-Thion requested to work from home indefinitely, but was denied.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-citizen-discrimination-tribunal-starship.jpg?itok=1fL2Whbb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-citizen-discrimination-tribunal-starship.jpg?itok=irYYolnq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Cloud Imperium Games is the studio responsible for space sim&nbsp;<em>Star Citizen</em>, which still hasn't seen a full release.</figcaption></figure><p>According to a judgement document sent to Game Developer, Ah-Thion made several requests to CIG to continue working remotely on a permanent basis, but all of the requests were denied, culminating in his dismissal in 2022.</p>
<p>CIG's argument during the tribunal was that Ah-Thion had failed to fulfil his professional obligations as a result of working from home, and that he was "unable to meet certain job criteria" (that's Game Developer's wording) like training junior employees.</p>
<p>However, the tribunal found that these claims were incorrect, and that by refusing to make adjustments to accommodate Ah-Thion, CIG acted in a discriminatory manner.</p>
<p>The tribunal ordered Cloud Imperium to pay Ah-Thion £27,748 in compensation, a figure which works out at around $35,000.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-citizen-discrimination-tribunal-hangar.jpg?itok=S6oXTN1d 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-citizen-discrimination-tribunal-hangar.jpg?itok=jupxDN_Q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Cloud Imperium will have to pay Paul Ah-Thion tens of thousands of dollars in compensation.</figcaption></figure><p>This decision comes as several publishers and gaming companies ratchet up their efforts to create accessible hardware and software for gamers with accessibility concerns.</p>
<p>These efforts include Sony adding <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-adding-accessibility-tags-to-playstation-store-on-ps5">accessibility tags to entries on the PlayStation Store</a>&nbsp;and creating an <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-5-access-controller-brings-accessibility-this-december">entire controller based around accessibility</a>, as well as games like <i><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-accessibility">Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2</a>&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/god-of-war-ragnarok-accessibility-options-revealed">God of War Ragnarok</a>&nbsp;</em>featuring extensive accessibility options.</p>
<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Star Citizen</em>, which has been in production for thirteen years at time of writing, a concrete release date doesn't look like it's any closer to being announced, although Cloud Imperium has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-citizen-roadmap-release-2024">said that it will release a roadmap</a> leading up to the game's 1.0 launch this year.</p>

  <p id="1PM0yu">Sega is going through one of those phases when it decides it wants to be Sega again — the Sega of blue skies, killer arcade cabinets, and the glorious unfulfilled promise of the Dreamcast.</p>
<p id="xsOx1O">Last week, the publisher released the first original <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24185483/super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble-review-interview">Super Monkey Ball</a> game in a decade. At the Game Awards last December, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game-awards-tga/23993016/sega-jet-set-radio-streets-of-rage-shinobi-crazy-taxi">the company announced</a> an initiative to bring some of its classic game franchises back to life, including new games in the Jet Set Radio, Shinobi, Golden Axe, Streets of Rage, and Crazy Taxi series.</p>
<p id="5Ogq1m">That was a fan-pleasing move, though many questioned how (or, indeed, whether) Sega intended to make these games relevant for a modern audience. We now have a partial answer, as far as Crazy Taxi is concerned.</p>
<p id="m01KgF">Sega is moving to staff up the development team making the new Crazy Taxi, and in a <a href="https://hrmos.co/pages/sega/jobs?category=2010249489979686912">series of job adverts</a>, the game is consistently referred to as a “large-scale online title,” “open world,” and a “massively multiplayer driving game.” The original is a tight, fast-paced arcade driving game about ferrying passengers around a city map as fast as possible.</p>
<div id="Pe1o1o"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0VHYLJR9pNg?rel=0&amp;start=80" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="Jdw4S9">In an ad seeking a <a href="https://hrmos.co/pages/sega/jobs/10">lead game designer</a>, Sega says the project is “aiming to become a global hit, primarily in the North American market.” Sega would prefer its new lead game designer to have experience in both “car game production” and “multiplayer action battle production.” The game is being made in Unreal Engine.</p>
<p id="cZPKOh">Sega also posted a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLQsitFYpg8">recruitment video</a> (in Japanese) featuring producer Kenji Kanno — the director of the original game — and other developers. In the video (according to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/segas-crazy-taxi-reboot-is-a-massively-multiplayer-driving-game/">VGC</a>), the developers talk about adapting the classic Crazy Taxi gameplay for a world with multiple players set on a “theme park-like” city map. Brief work-in-progress clips from the Game Awards announcement video show multiple cabs trailing sparks as they drift around a San Francisco-style city.</p>
<p id="Pth8HD">The news may set off alarm bells about overreach — can a game series that last saw a home console release <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazy_Taxi_3:_High_Roller">in 2002</a> really support a “global hit” in the 2020s, however much nostalgia there is for it? On the other hand, Crazy Taxi’s frantic gameplay and joyously garish style seems well suited to a bustling, competitive online world, and might even support a battle royale-style mode. The idea of a more over-the-top, arcade-coded rival to the likes of Forza Horizon — or, to put it another way, a <em>Fortnite</em> on wheels — doesn’t seem so crazy after all.</p>
<p id="NJqs0t">The new Crazy Taxi — like the reboots of Jet Set Radio, Shinobi, Golden Axe, and Streets of Rage — does not yet have a release date.</p>

On their release in November 2020, both the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X were incredibly scarce, thanks to an imperfect storm of covid, global chip shortages, and supply chain issues. At the same time, the three-year-old Switch was also having supply issues, and consoles that <em>were</em> available were quickly snatched up by scalpers. But Nintendo reckons it’s in a position to ensure that’s not a problem with next year’s release of the Switch 2.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196230" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Cool New Retro Console Is A Great Gift For Atari Fans" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="217" data-playlist="196230,191491,196143" data-current="196230"><div><p>This Cool New Retro Console Is A Great Gift For Atari Fans</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21779.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>In a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/qa2406.pdf&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/qa2406.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent shareholder call</a></span> (pdf), Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa was reminded that he said a year ago that he would put in place measures to prevent resellers from blocking customer access to the (technically unannounced) new console, and asked what had been done thusfar.

Rather splendidly he added, “Indie games are essential to increasing the appeal of our platform, so we would like to continue to strengthen these activities in future.”</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>According to Steam <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/753/charts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">data platform SteamDB</a>, the Steam user count reached 36,928,521 yesterday, which represents a new all-time peak. Naturally, the user count is a little lower right now, but it's still hovering at around 33.5 million.</p>
<p>This breaks the record set by Steam users back in March, when the total concurrent user count reached 36,354,393, representing a leap of almost three million over the previous month. Perhaps not coincidentally, March is also when the last major Steam sale took place.</p>

Alex ‘’Dyloch’’ Ruiz had just cemented his place in the <em>Mortal Kombat 1 </em>grand finals at the Florida-based fighting game tournament when he decided to get up, grab his chair, and casually fling it into the audience in what might be one of the least hype and most damaging pop-offs in fighting game history. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195697" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Mortal Kombat 1" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="170" data-playlist="195697,196049,196653" data-current="195697"><div><p>The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Mortal Kombat 1</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195697/195697_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195697/195697_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195697/195697_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195697/195697_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21194.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The damage happened at the end of the Winners Bracket. Ruiz, playing as General Shao, had just stomped Curtis “Rewind” McCall’s Reiko to send his opponent down into the Losers Bracket. As the chair was flung out of the ring it smashed into a light fixture, sending shards of glass flying.

<p>Despite the overwhelming reception to the game, along with its free-to-play nature and launch this summer for everyone, there’s still mystery surrounding The First Descendant. For instance, what’s the game’s multiplayer like? Is The First Descendant multiplayer?</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-the-first-descendant-multiplayer">Can You Play The First Descendant Multiplayer?</h2>



<p>First and foremost, The First Descendant is a cooperative looter-shooter in which up to four players can team up and work together to dominate mobs of enemies and challenge bosses in Void Intercept battles. Alongside the raid-type boss content in The First Descendant, you may also participate in Consecutive Survival and Consecutive Defense, in which you must work together to survive hordes of enemies for as long as possible.</p>



<p>Lastly, and perhaps most importantly for most players, is that you can play the entire campaign cooperatively with the same number of players. You never have to struggle through a particularly challenging section of the game, as you can enlist the help of a friend!</p>







<h2 id="h-is-the-first-descendant-pvp">Is The First Descendant PvP?</h2>



<p>The First Descendant does not offer a PvP mode, as the game primarily focuses on a cooperative experience. This information was confirmed by developers Beomjun Lee and Minseok Joo, the Producer and Director, respectively, at Nexon Games. They set out to create a cooperative PvE game, first and foremost, and intend to stick with that design plan.</p>



<p>Furthermore, their insistence on sticking to the original PvE plan means there’s little to no chance of a PvP mode coming to The First Descendant in the future. Of course, never say never, but it isn’t very likely.</p>
