            <p>Sony has shared a new job vacancy for a Mobile Platform Architect at PlayStation Global.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://boards.greenhouse.io/sonyinteractiveentertainmentglobal/jobs/5078757004">listing</a>, which was spotted by <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/98435/sony-developing-playstation-mobile-platform/index.html">TweakTown</a>, shows the company is looking for an engineer to design a PlayStation platform which will focus on "developing, publishing, and operating free-to-play mobile games".</p>
<p>Among the responsibilities, the successful candidate will be expected to assist the platform's engineering team with "technical leadership and guidance", contribute to the mobile platform's roadmap, establish "pipelines and processes to facilitate the delivery of high-quality software" and track" technical innovations, changes, and trends affecting mobile game development".</p>

<p>"An individual in this role will spearhead the design and implementation of this platform; work in partnership with internal teams to connect mobile games to PlayStation services; and ensure that all mobile games meet PlayStation's quality standards," the listing states.</p>
<p>Sony has previously dabbled with the mobile gaming market, publishing the likes of the PlayStation app, the PS Remote Play app, endless-runner <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/run-sackboy-run-review">Run Sackboy! Run!</a> (pictured below), top-down puzzle game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-free-to-play-uncharted-mobile-app-unlocks-exclusive-uncharted-4-multiplayer-rewards">Uncharted: Fortune Hunter</a> (above), and AR app God of War: Mimir's Vision.</p>
<p>However, these forays have never met the heights of other mobile releases, such as Genshin Impact and Pokémon Go. In 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uncharted-fortune-hunter-is-shutting-down">Uncharted: Fortune Hunter was shut down by developer Naughty Dog</a>. While it never specified why it was retiring its mobile spinoff, low player numbers were likely a factor.</p>
<p>
However, it appears the company is still set on reversing its fortunes in the future, with mobile undoubtedly being an important part of the market to crack. </p>

            <p>
Deadlock, the unannounced but previously-leaked hero shooter from Half-Life maker Valve, has been spotted again in a fresh leak. And, this time, we can now see gameplay footage of Deadlock in action.
</p>
<p>
Leaked <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/images-leak-of-valves-next-game-and-its-an-overwatch-style-hero-shooter">details of Deadlock sprung onto the internet last week</a> via images posted to social media and a report from longterm Valve reporter Tyler McVicker, which claimed that Deadlock was currently in closed testing. 
</p>
<p>
It's from this ongoing test that gameplay footage has now also leaked - showing off Deadlock's training mode, more hero characters, and the existence of BioShock Infinite-style skyrails you can hook onto and ride around on.
</p>

<p>
Even Deadlock's setting looks rather BioShock Infinite-like, with period advertising for brands of cigarettes and wide open town squares. 
</p>
<p>
The leaked footage shows off a number of training modes in which the player can acclimitise to the game's controls, test character movement and abilities, and then learn Deadlock's lane system. 
</p>
<p>
Heroes shown include the imp-like winged Ivy, who can slow and stun enemies while buffing allies, dapper fire demon Infernus who can deal fire damage over time, sneaky robot Haze and gothic sniper Vindicta. Several heroes are labelled as "great for new players!", presumably to get newbies started.

</span></p><p>You can watch the leaked footage via the embed above, for now - though Valve has already begun removing links to it.</p>
<p>
Previous reporting suggested Deadlock was Valve's next "major" project, and that it has been in development in one form or other since 2018. There's no word yet on when it'll be formally revealed.
</p>
<p>Deadlock isn't the only game due soon with a BioShock Infinite vibe.  Wasteland 3 developer InXile's upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inxiles-clockwork-revolution-is-a-time-bending-rpg-which-owes-a-lot-to-bioshock-infinite">Clockwork Revolution appears so visually similar</a> that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioshock-infinite-trailer-producer-highlights-similarities-with-clockwork-revolution">publisher Microsoft had to issue a statement</a> clarifying "any similarities are unintentional".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/kingmakers-trailer-wreak-havoc/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Kingmakers is shaping up very nicely, if the latest trailer is anything to go by. In the ‘Wreak Havoc’ trailer, Kingmakers’ destructive capabilities are laid out for all to see, with viewers witnessing a hulking tank smashing effortlessly through medieval buildings from the 13th century. There are shots of a dirtbike-riding soldier blasting through a crowd indiscriminately with an AK-47, and the same character wielding a shotgun and taking down horseback warriors.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-kingmakers-is-wild">Kingmakers is Wild</h2>



<p>In our recent interview <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingmakers-interview-ultimate-medieval/">with the developers behind Kingmakers</a>, we learnt that this ambitious title has been dubbed ‘the ultimate medieval fantasy game’. It’s a mix of third-person action and RTS elements, with players assuming control of a character sent back in time to alter history by topping ancient rulers in their stalwart castles.</p>



<p>The latest trailer revealed a little more about how players will accomplish those goals. Mostly, they’ll be wielding modern weaponry and slaying out against waves of medieval soldiers desperately trying to survive with swords, shields, bows, and spears. This new trailer perfectly showcased the most destructive elements of Kingmakers, showing how players can fully collapse a building with a well-placed shot from a grenade launcher, or by driving a main battle tank clean through the side of the thing.</p>

</p></figure>







<p>Despite featuring elements that border on the bizarre, Kingmakers is a legitimate title that takes itself seriously, and it has been in development for several years. It doesn’t have a release date, but it’s fast becoming one of the most wanted games on Steam.</p>

            <p>
MultiVersus beta players will be given a free premium battle pass for the fighting game's first season.
</p>
<p>
Last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/multiversus-to-shut-down-until-2024-with-no-refunds-for-paying-players">open beta was shut down until the game's full launch</a>, with no refunds given to players, although progress and content will carry over.

</p>
<p>
Now, in a <a href="https://multiversus.com/en/news/multiversus-developer-series-welcome-back-rewards-battle-pass-and-economy-changes">new blog post</a>, developer Player First Games has revealed returning players from the beta will receive access to the season one premium battle pass for free - provided they log in to MultiVersus by 11th June.
</p>

</figure>
<p>

In addition, any returning players will receive a special edition Snow Suit Finn character variant, a special edition Rising Stars ringout, and a special edition Banana Guard announcer pack.
</p>
<p>
Speaking of Banana Guard, players who complete the game's new tutorial - a seven-day reward calendar - will receive the character for free. Completing all seven days will add the Lady Banana Guard variant.
</p>
<p>
So what's included in the premium battle pass? The big draw is playable character <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/multiversus-adds-the-matrixs-agent-smith-jason-voorhees">Jason Voorhees from Friday the 13th, revealed earlier this week</a>.

</p>
<p>
Player First Games has increased the number of high-value items in both the free and premium tiers. Premium currency - Gleamium - is available in both tiers, with the premium tier including enough currency to get the next battle pass. Each season of the battle pass will last eight weeks and the final tier will be repeatable for those who reach it early and wish to keep earning rewards.
</p>

 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Warner Bros</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
It's unknown how much the premium battle pass will cost, though as above it's free for returning players.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, the blog post details the four different currencies and how to acquire them:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Perk currency - used to unlock in-game perks, gained through gameplay and the battle pass</li>
<li>Fighter currency - used to unlock characters, gained through gameplay and the battle pass</li>
<li>Prestige currency - used to unlock exclusive cosmetics, gained by acquiring cosmetics</li>
<li>Gleamium - used to unlock cosmetics, emotes, battle passes and more, gained in events, the battle pass, or direct purchase</li>
</ul>

<p>
Currencies from the beta no longer included here will still be usable. Gold will be swapped for commemorative cosmetics.

 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Warner Bros</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
MultiVersus launches on 28th May across PC (Steam and Epic), PlayStation 5, PS4, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S, with cross-platform and cross-progression play.
</p>
<p>
"Characterful fighters, a good skill ceiling, and a co-op emphasis with real depth makes Warner Bros. MultiVersus a very pleasant surprise," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/multiversus-review-more-than-just-another-super-smash-bros-clone">Eurogamer MultiVersus open beta review from last year</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/kingdom-hearts-4-nintendo-switch-2-reveal/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Alongside the previous entries in the series, Kingdom Hearts 4 may release on Nintendo Switch 2, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>Speaking on X/Twitter, reliable insider Midori discussed the fourth entry in the series, revealing that it may be <a href="https://x.com/MbKKssTBhz5/status/1792956511435526341" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released on the next Nintendo hardware</a> alongside its predecessors. As only<a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-hearts-switch-outrageous-prices/"> cloud versions</a> have been released on the original Switch, it would definitely be great to have native ports of the entire series on the upcoming console.</p>
<p>Midori also revealed other <a href="https://x.com/MbKKssTBhz5/status/1792956382884278387?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1792956382884278387%7Ctwgr%5E27bffc5c203bb2be18bde81cc84daa2b4a49e58f%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ffinalweapon.net%2F2024%2F05%2F21%2Fkingdom-hearts-iv-reportedly-has-online-features-might-come-to-switch-2%2F">interesting tidbits</a> about Kingdom Hearts 4. Apparently, the game, codenamed Quattro (four in Italian), looks very different from the reveal trailer and will have some small online features. More outside IP collaborations are also being planned for the series in the future.</p>
<p>While Midori has proven to be extremely reliable in the past, especially regarding SEGA and Atlus leaks, we have to take what has been revealed on Kingdom Hearts 4 with a grain of salt. With Final Fantasy XVI and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth now out, the fourth entry in the series is Square Enix's next major release, so hopefully, we won't have to wait long to see more of it.</p>
<p>The latest main entry in the series is Kingdom Hearts III, now available on PC and consoles. You can learn more about it in Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-hearts-iii-the-end-has-come/">review</a>.</p>

<p>The First Descendant was revealed in 2022, and by today, prospective fans are still waiting for a confirmed release date. It’s expected to drop in 2024, and Nexon is hard at work polishing the highly anticipated title ahead of the impending launch. Recently, Nexon released a deep dive into the game’s story, revealing the key concepts of the setting, outlining some of the game’s lore, and explaining what makes The First Descendant so unique.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-becoming-the-first-descendant">Becoming The First Descendant</h2>



<p>The First Descendant is being pieced together by a South Korean studio, and it has been in development for a few years. It’s poised to be an epic, Unreal Engine 5-driven game that incorporates elements of the looter-shooter genre and traditional RPG titles. In the latest video uploaded to showcase the game, Nexon’s representatives outlined the core concept of The First Descendant:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Humanity has embraced the destiny left by their predecessors, the ‘Ancestors’, and have become the Descendants. The Vulgus (an alien race) started a war to fulfill the will of their predecessors, the survival of their species. The mission of the Colossi (large beings) cannot be revealed, but they consider it a curse.</p>



<p>The First Descendant’s universe begins with the clash of those who inherited the fate of their predecessors. Whether this tragic fate can be severed in this generation, or will be passed on to the next generation, all depends on the Descendant, who will become the player’s avatar.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s a lofty and ambitious concept that has the makings of a fantastic story, but from what we’ve seen so far in terms of gameplay isn’t turning heads too dramatically. In some ways, it looks like a typical third-person shooter that’s even reminiscent of titles like Gears of War at times. In The First Descendant, players will control ‘the ultimate and most powerful tactical force of humanity,’ using a series of unique abilities to overcome some immense enemies, and various play styles and approaches to missions are encouraged.</p>



<p>Here’s the full video:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="The First Descendant - Story Deep Dive | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/i66htX5ouGU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>One gripe that prospective fans have with The First Descendant is that it’s an ‘always online’ game, despite there being solo gameplay elements present in the title. It’s an adventure that can be played cooperatively, but playing solo won’t switch off those always online requirements.</p>

<p data-characters="161" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">It’s not just Steam that <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> is coming to, as according to prominent leaker MbKKssTBhz5, a special crossover is also set to arrive in <em>Fortnite</em>. </p> <p data-characters="377" data-current-count="377" data-injectable="false">When discussing the news that the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/kingdom-hearts-games-make-steam-debut-on-june-13/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Kingdom Hearts</em> series will launch on Steam</a> on June 13, MbKKssTBhz5 revealed that they believe a new platform isn’t the only place we’ll see <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> this year, suggesting that not only could it come to Nintendo hardware, but to other games too, specifically mentioning that <em>Fortnite</em> was “part of this initiative.”</p> <p data-characters="198" data-current-count="575" data-injectable="true">Unfortunately, they don’t have any more information about what it could include or when it could happen, but my mind immediately goes to a Sora character skin, and a Keyblade harvesting tool. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I heard Fortnite was part of this initiative. But I didn’t have any other information on collaboration or date for the collaboration.</p>— みどり (@MbKKssTBhz5) <a href="https://twitter.com/MbKKssTBhz5/status/1792975164684063118?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 21, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="376" data-current-count="676" data-injectable="true">Of course, the idea of <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> arriving in <em>Fortnite</em> makes a ton of sense. <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> is all about Disney characters, and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/disney-invests-1-5-billion-in-epic-to-create-persistent-universe-connected-to-fortnite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Disney now owns a $1.5 billion stake in Epic Games</a>. What better way to maximize your revenue than to create a crossover with a property you already control, rather than working with an outside identity on licensing agreements or revenue shares?</p>
 <p data-characters="271" data-current-count="271" data-injectable="false">As for when this crossover could happen, it would make a lot of sense to do it around the release of <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> on Steam, but that is just three weeks away, and we would usually see more concrete rumors about a potential crossover by now if that were to be the case. </p> <p data-characters="279" data-current-count="550" data-injectable="true">The other suggestion is that it could be around the release of <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/kingdom-hearts-4-release-date-characters-and-everything-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Hearts IV</a></em>, but with it not scheduled to launch until 2025, that seems like a long time to wait. We may get new trailers this year though, which may be a better time to drop some themed cosmetics in <em>Fortnite</em>. </p>
 <p data-characters="270" data-current-count="270" data-injectable="false">Remember though, this is a leak and is definitely not confirmed, so make sure to take it with a hefty pinch of salt. In the meantime, we still have a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/fortnites-new-fallout-content-is-more-salt-in-the-wound-for-fallout-76-fans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Fallout</em> crossover</a> event to enjoy in <em>Fortnite</em>, so there are plenty of opportunities to spend your V-Bucks in the future. </p>

Smash Bros. fighters have an almost equal chance of winning a match, creator Masahiro Sakurai has said.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/masahiro-sakurai-launches-new-youtube-channel-on-game-development">Sakurai's YouTube series is still going strong</a>, with his latest video discussing balance in fighting games - something the Smash Bros. games have seen their fair share of controversy around.
</p>
<p>
The video includes win rate data from across the globe, revealing the highest win rate is 51.43 percent and the lowest win rate is 47.18 percent. It means all 87 characters sit within this win/loss ratio, hovering around an equal 50 percent chance of winning.

<p>
Sakurai doesn't reveal which characters are at the top and bottom of this scale - this remains top secret - but, in his words, "any fighter has a shot at winning".
</p>
<p>
As he explains in the video, creating fighters is a balance between uniqueness and competitive balance. Should all characters be too similarly balanced, the game would be boring. "Average and mediocre are the same thing," says Sakurai. Equally, too much uniqueness means "you'll naturally end up with mixed reception".
</p>
<p>
"If you balance purely based on fighter strength, their abilities quickly start to level out," says Sakurai. "Hence, I advise our team to keep fighters unique by amplifying shortcomings to offset advantages."
</p>

<p>
Smash Bros. has certainly been accused of imbalance in the past. GameCube title Melee included <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/meta-knight-return-confirmed-for-super-smash-bros-wii-u-and-3ds">Kirby character Meta Knight</a>, who was deemed too powerful and banned from professional tournaments.

</p>
<p>
Similarly, when sassy witch Bayonetta was introduced in Super Smash Bros. on Wii U and 3DS, many found her to be overpowered.
</p>
<p>
Still, Sakurai notes the internet can be "an echo chamber of sorts" that perpetuates opinion. "If people want to prove their point, they're best off settling it in an actual match," he says.
</p>
<p>
Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is the latest game in the series, released on Switch back in 2018. It's the third highest-selling game on the system, behind Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Animal Crossing: New Horizons.

            <p>XDefiant, Ubisoft's free-to-play Call of Duty-like arena shooter, launched yesterday. However, the game has already faced its share of issues, with matchmaking being shot (pun not intended) leaving many unable to access it at all.</p>
<p>As users reported being met with an <a href="https://x.com/WHOH/status/1792971353534148865">"Unable to Find Match"</a> alert, Ubisoft acknowledged players were struggling to join a game, stating: "Please bear with us while we look into servers and matchmaking!"</p>
<p>Things got so bad, developer Mark Rubin - who previously worked on the Call of Duty series prior to his role as XDefiant's executive producer - shared a post on social media last night, showing a hamster clinging on desperately to an out of control wheel. "Matchmaking servers go boom!" he wrote.</p>

<p>Rubin additionally assured his followers that the team was "working on it", and the <a href="https://x.com/PlayXDefiant/status/1793044381076685170">most recent update over on the XDefiant account</a> is that Ubisoft is "seeing progress on the matchmaking servers".</p>
<p>"We will continue to monitor the situation and keep you updated," it said.</p> <div>

<p>XDefiant has walked quite an uneven path to launch. The game was initially revealed as Tom Clancy's XDefiant <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splinter-cell-ghost-recon-and-the-division-merge-in-ubis-6v6-free-to-play-fps-xdefiant">back in 2021</a>, but Ubisoft later announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-drops-tom-clancys-name-from-xdefiant">dropping the prefix</a> following criticism from Tom Clancy fans. Essentially, the Tom Clancy fanbase felt the XDefiant announcement strayed too far from the franchise's serious military themes and formula.</p>
<p>With the Tom Clancy name dropped, XDefiant went on to have a number of tests, but not always very successfully. In fact, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-may-extend-xdefiant-closed-beta-over-horrible-server-experience">one beta was described as having a "horrible" server experience</a> by Rubin himself.</p>
<p>XDefiant then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-free-to-play-shooter-xdefiant-delayed-due-to-console-certification-issues">missed a planned launch</a> last year due to console certification issues. It subsequently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-delays-free-to-play-shooter-xdefiant-again">received another delay</a> in October, this time because of "inconsistencies in the game experience".</p>

            <p>We just got a new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-release-date">Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree</a> story trailer yesterday. As is their druthers, FromSoft have at once made the events it depicts feel of earth-shattering importance while providing basically no concrete information. A lot of people will be putting out gargantuan theory posts right now, rambling on about Miquella, the Crucible, the Golden Order blah blah. This is all a distraction. Anyone with eyes can tell you that the primary movers and shakers of this final chapter in the Lands Between are a secret faction of hitherto secret spear people. You're likely confused, and that's understandable. As the foremost authority <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-kind-of-pot-is-elden-rings-pot-boy-we-asked-an-expert">on ephemeral nonsense</a> in Elden Ring, I’m the only one who has your back here.</p>

<p>The first ill omen portenting toward the encroaching spear-mageddon that threatens to consume <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a>’s world is cleverly disguised as just ‘a bunch of blokes with spears’. If you look closely, you’ll notice single bloke with an axe. This is what tipped me off, you see. If everyone had spears, I wouldn’t be so suspicious, but this this single axe feels like a such a fat carp hastily painted red and herring-shaped. It’s meant to convince us the spear people aren’t taking over, but I know better.</p>
<p>After a close-up shot of another soldier pulling his - you guessed it - spear from a corpse. We’re treated to this telling shot:</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/elden-spears-2.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>FromSoftware</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It’s like they’re not even trying to hide it anymore! Look at the corpse! Also, look at how uniform the formation is. If you trace each spear point to its opposite point, you might begin to notice a sort of sigil-code taking shape. In spear-ish, this code translates to: Look at all these spears! Which is a sort of bullish rallying cry meant to reinforce notions of spear-iority. Truly fiendish. Here’s the next shot:</p>

<p>Yes, Messmer, the DLC’s new antagonist, I know, I know. But what’s that he’s got clutched in his hand? It’s spears all the way down! Spear-oboros! I’m honestly too overcome with revelations for words, so I will leave the shot-by-shot analysis here, partly to leave the remaining spears for you to discover, but mostly because this shitpost had run its course by the second paragraph. I hope this was of use to you intrepid lore hunters, but if it wasn’t, I’m keen to highlight that my headline has the words ‘Elden Ring’ and ‘rated’ in the title, which I assume is how my writing will be judged from here on out.</p>

			<p>Next month's planned Xbox Showcase will be interesting for fans of the Xbox 360-era JRPGs, it's been claimed.</p>
<p>That's what Xbox Era co-founder @Shpeshal_Nick shared on X/Twitter some hours ago. "If what I’ve heard is true, fans of Xbox 360-era JRPGs will have something to look forward to at the showcase", the insider <a href="https://x.com/Shpeshal_Nick/status/1793113945018105857" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> on X. No additional details have been shared, but Xbox boss Phil Spencer has openly been talking about bringing more games to Xbox from Japanese developers. JRPGs that spring to mind include Mistwalker's excellent <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-odyssey-available-xbox-one-bc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lost Odyssey</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/blue-dragon-available-xbox-one-bc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blue Dragon</a>, Eternal Sonata, Enchanted Arms, but also the Last Remnant, and several others. Back in January of this year, the insider was <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-state-of-play-january-31st/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">right on the money</a> regarding the PlayStation State of Play broadcast.</p>
<p>The upcoming Xbox showcase has yet to be detailed, but Microsoft has confirmed that it will be showing off several upcoming first-party titles. Recent rumors suggest <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-will-be-shown-next-month-recent-rumors-might-have-been-outdated-says-insider/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that The Initiative's Perfect Dark reboot will be present during the event</a>.&nbsp; "Like our double-feature last year with Starfield Direct, immediately following the Showcase we’ll be airing a special deep-dive into the next installment of a beloved franchise", Microsoft announced last month. "We can’t say much, so for now we’ll call it the Xbox Games Showcase followed by&nbsp;<mark>[REDACTED]</mark>&nbsp;Direct."</p>
<p>"This will also be our first Showcase featuring games from our portfolio of studios across Activision, Blizzard, Bethesda and Xbox Game Studios, in addition to titles from our third-party partners."</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/events/xbox-games-showcase" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Games Showcase</a> will air on June 9 at 10 am PT. The showcase will be followed by a special "Direct" broadcast.</p>
<p>We'll update you as soon as we learn more about the Xbox showcase.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/multiversus-season-1s-battle-pass-and-playable-jason-are-free-for-returning-players/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=multiversus-season-1s-battle-pass-and-playable-jason-are-free-for-returning-players<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="384" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>MultiVersus</em> is doing a lot to win over not just new fans, but all the old players from the game’s open beta. Multiple new characters, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/jason-voorhees-and-agent-smith-are-joining-the-joker-in-multiversus-first-proper-season/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">such as Jason Voorhees and Agent Smith</a>, have been confirmed for its first proper season, alongside a PvE mode, and now developer Player First Games has revealed how returning players can claim a bunch of free content, including the battle pass.</p> <p data-characters="669" data-current-count="669" data-injectable="true">Like similar free-to-play games, <em>MultiVersus</em> has two kinds of battle passes: a free one for all players and a premium pass you need to pay for that offers additional rewards. According to <a href="https://multiversus.com/en/news/multiversus-developer-series-welcome-back-rewards-battle-pass-and-economy-changes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official website</a>, if you played the original beta, you’ll automatically unlock the premium battle pass, which means you’ll also get access to the game’s <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/multiversus-fans-are-split-on-jasons-ridiculously-chunky-design/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">incredibly chunky Jason</a>. It sounds like a good deal to me, especially since Player First Games is promising it has bumped up the number of high value rewards in both battle passes. However, you will need to log into <em>MultiVersus</em> by June 11, two weeks after its May 28 launch, to take advantage of the offer.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Player First Games</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="537" data-current-count="837" data-injectable="true">Player First Games is also offering returning players a few other special pieces of content—a Snow Suit Finn variant, a Rising Stars ringout, and a Banana Guard announcer pack—and these ones aren’t under any time limit; you’ll get them whenever you log in for the first time. In addition, there’ll be a seven-day reward calendar for any players who beat the tutorial, with the final unlock being a playable Banana Guard from <em>Adventure Time</em>. I’ll let you decide whether that’s a worthwhile reward or not.</p>
 <p data-characters="649" data-current-count="649" data-injectable="true">Speaking of rewards, Player First Games has decided to give its in-game economy something of an overhaul. There are still too many types of currency in my opinion—four of them to be exact—but the premium currency, Gleamium, will now be included in both the free and premium battle passes. Originally, Gleamium had to be bought with real money, and a significant number of unlockables could only be purchased with Gleamium. During the beta, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/it-costs-255-to-unlock-everything-in-multiversus-that-cant-be-earned-by-playing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VGC</a> deduced that it would cost roughly $250 / £200 to acquire everything the game had to offer at the time. Sure, <em>MultiVersus</em> is free-to-play so it needs to earn money somehow, but this just felt extreme.</p>
 <p data-characters="678" data-current-count="678" data-injectable="false">With Gleamium now obtainable through play, this should mean players won’t feel as pressured to spend more and more money on certain unlockables. Plus, completing the premium battle pass will ensure you have enough Gleamium to purchase the next season’s battle pass, so that’s already an improvement. However, we don’t know how much unlockables will cost or how much grinding will need to be done to acquire characters, costumes, and the like if you don’t want to spend money. <em>MultiVersus</em> seems to be doing everything right to rejuvenate interest, but a demanding grind and obnoxiously high prices for items could very easily push people away again.</p>

  <p id="uZrQA6"><strong>Chapter 5 Season 3</strong> of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/fortnite-guide"><em>Fortnite</em></a>, formally called <strong>Wrecked</strong>, appears to be focused on using huge vehicles to get around a desert wasteland.</p>
<p id="ssQdms">Hot on the w-heels of a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/fortnite-guide/24097617/chapter-5-season-2-battle-pass-skins-list-c5s2">Greek methology-themed season</a>, <em>Fortnite</em> Chapter 5 Season 3 will also feature a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24159107/fallout-fortnite-epic-games-bethesda-softworks">Fallout crossover</a>.</p>
<p id="2JSekB">We’ll break down the expected <strong>release times</strong> for <em>Fortnite</em> Chapter 5 Season 3 (based on your time zone) and explain <strong>when Fortnite downtime is supposed to end</strong>. You’ll also get a summary of what to expect from the new <em>Fortnite</em> season.</p>
<hr id="JwdP9P">
<h2 id="7GPqID"><strong>What time does Fortnite downtime end and Chapter 5 Season 3 release in your time zone?</strong></h2>
<p id="CsgMrl"><em>Fortnite</em> Chapter 5 Season 3 is set to launch on <strong>Friday, May 24</strong>, at the same time around the world. Based on the launch times of previous seasons, we can make a strong educated guess for when <em>Fortnite</em> will go down and come back up again.</p>
<p id="uG3CVn">Server downtime typically starts around 2 or 3 a.m. EDT and<strong> typically last about four hours, </strong>give or take. That means we can reasonably expect <em>Fortnite</em> Chapter 5 Season 3 to go live at the following times depending on your time zone:</p>
<ul>
<li id="hRirtL">
<strong>1 a.m. - 4 a.m. PDT</strong> for the west coast of North America</li>
<li id="Prdg5A">
<strong>4 a.m. - 7 a.m. EDT</strong> for the east coast of North America</li>
<li id="ifpyl6">
<strong>9 a.m. - 12 p.m. BST</strong> for the U.K.</li>
<li id="BZSPRs">
<strong>10 a.m. - 1 p.m. CEST</strong> for western Europe/Paris</li>
<li id="TI0AFn">
<strong>5 p.m. - 8 p.m. JST</strong> on Japan/Tokyo</li>

<hr id="Vt4bPg">
<h2 id="HwO1KL"><strong>What to expect in Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 3</strong></h2>
<p id="2Z0gDJ">So far, the known quantities for <em>Fortnite</em> Chapter 5 Season 3 are the name (“Wrecked”) and the much-ballyhooed Fallout collaboration, which will see you get your hands on some Power Armor. Whether this is an item or a skin is yet to be confirmed, but you can briefly see it in action in the following embedded post on X:</p>

<p id="S51BT1">Elsewhere, an official teaser trailer suggests a sandstorm will bring about an apocalyptic desert theme:</p>
<div id="JTlulA"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZEBEWByhvwk?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="3G8mjH">Meanwhile, the <em>Fortnite</em> X account teased the possibility of a new bus, replete with video footage of a (real) monster truck jumping over a (real?) bus. This dovetails with what longtime <em>Fortnite</em> leaker ShiinaBR (who has a sturdy track record for this sort of thing) <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1791879277278847265">said on X</a>: that monster trucks are coming to <em>Fortnite</em> as of Chapter 5 Season 3.</p>

<p id="ALK5r8">Tying into all of the above, datamines from the <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1790029042264997986">HYPEX account on X</a> suggest “sand landmarks” or a dedicated desert biome, as well as a steam train makeover for the map’s snaking locomotive.</p>
<p id="5ra1Sb">There’s also the suggestion of collaborations with Metallica, Fall Guys, and Pirates of the Caribbean. That said, based on the game’s track record, take these tie-ins with a pinch of salt — and if they do appear, could be in non-battle royale modes, and / or will appear later in the season.</p>
<div id="9J7KrF">
<blockquote data-dnt="true">
<div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>SEASON 3 INFO &amp; LEAKS SO FAR  </p><p>• THEME &amp; DATE: Post-Apocalyptic / May 24th<br>• COLLABS: Metallica, Fall Guys, Pirates of the Caribbean &amp; More..<br>• UI UPDATES: Each item in the shop will have its own timer<br>• Lead-up Mini Event with a huge sandstorm &amp; lightning<br>• Sand Landmarks… <a href="https://t.co/r40pYAPMnV">pic.twitter.com/r40pYAPMnV</a></p></div>— HYPEX (@HYPEX) <a href="https://twitter.com/HYPEX/status/1790029042264997986?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 13, 2024</a>
</blockquote>


</div>
<p id="pKLwhX">There’s plenty to look forward to then. The other thing of note — and this is pure speculation on our part — is the season launches day-in-date with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24157385/furiosa-review-no-spoilers-george-miller-anya-taylor-joy"><em>Furiosa</em></a>, making it primed for a possible Mad Max crossover. There has been no indication of that so far (from developer Epic Games or otherwise) but we’d be surprised if that doesn’t appear at <em>some</em> point.</p>

			<p>It's been nearly three years since the <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-leak-lists-final-fantasy-vii-ix-remake-half-life-2-remastered-mgs2-hd-and-lots-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">memorable GeForce NOW leak</a> confirmed the existence of a Final Fantasy IX Remake. While most of the games included in NVIDIA's list ended up being announced, some of them never were.</p>
<p>This includes the remake of the ninth mainline entry in Square Enix's Final Fantasy series. However, rumors have persisted despite the lack of any official announcement. In early June 2023, a leaker on ResetEra suggested Final Fantasy IX Remake <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-ix-remake-playstation-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would be a PlayStation exclusive</a> featuring <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-ix-remake-traditional-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">traditional gameplay</a> instead of the action combat used for the Final Fantasy VII Remake. That same leaker <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-ix-remake-ready-release-prettier/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> the game was almost ready to be released and would sport updated models and prettier graphics, although it was not a big-budget remake like Final Fantasy VII. Around two months ago, another leaker <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-ix-remake-faithful-modest-budget/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">added</a> that he heard the same - it will be a faithful remake with a relatively modest budget.</p>
<p>Yesterday, leaked Midori joined the chorus, <a href="https://x.com/MbKKssTBhz5/status/1792748529418682523" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirming</a> that Final Fantasy IX Remake is indeed in development at Square Enix. However, the Final Fantasy X Remake is not, at least for now.</p>
<p>Midori first gained credit <a href="https://wccftech.com/sega-games-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as a SEGA leaker</a>, but recently also <a href="https://wccftech.com/zelda-botw-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talked</a> about Nintendo possibly making a new version of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild for the upcoming Switch 2 console. This is the first time Midori provided a Square Enix leak.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Final Fantasy IX originally launched in 2000 for Sony's PlayStation 2 console. It returned the franchise to a medieval setting called Gaia, following the futuristic worlds seen in the previous installments. In the story, players follow a thief named Zidane Tribal, who kidnaps Princess Garnet Til Alexandros XVII as part of a ploy by the neighboring nation of Lindblum. He joins Garnet and a growing cast of characters on a quest to bring down her mother, Queen Brahne of Alexandria, who started the war.</p>
<p>The Final Fantasy IX Remake could debut at the next PlayStation Showcase, which is expected to air sometime next week.</p>

        <p>Ubisoft veteran Cristian Pana to lead Amazon's first internal development studio in Europe</p>

    </div>


  

    

</header>  <div>



            <p>Amazon Games has opened its first studio in Europe, led by former Ubisoft managing director Cristian Pana.</p>
<p>Headquartered in Bucharest, the new studio will focus on supporting Amazon's growing portfolio of games and joins already established development teams in Orange County, Montreal, San Diego, and Seattle.</p>
<p>Studio head Cristian Pana has over two decades of experience at Ubisoft in multiple roles, having started out in QA in 2004 leading to various producer roles before becoming managing director of Ubisoft Bucharest from 2020 to 2024.</p>
<p>"I'm thrilled to join Amazon Games at a time when the team is actively building across an exciting roadmap," said Pana.</p>
<p>"I've built and led outstanding teams in the past and I know this area of Europe is a hot spot for some of the very best talent in gaming."</p>
<p>VP of Amazon Games Christoph Hartmann added: "Expanding our internal development teams into Europe was a natural next step for us as we tackle our brand portfolio.</p>
<p>"Bucharest is known as one of the top emerging European cities for game development and we look forward to tapping into the rich talent pool."</p>

			<p>INGAME STUDIOS announced that its 'organized crime shooter' Crime Boss: Rockay City will land <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2933080/Crime_Boss_Rockay_City/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a> on June 18 after around fifteen months of Epic Games Store exclusivity on PC.</p>
<p>Additionally, a new DLC called Cagnali’s Order will drop on all platforms (PC and consoles). The expansion pack includes four dystopian missions in which the Rockay City Police Department is joined by an evil mega-corporation's robotic police squad. Bursting with new enemies, a new boss, and playable characters, Cagnali’s Order forms the backbone of the expansion package (which also includes a reworked gaming system, levels, weapons packs, heists, and more).</p>

<p>As I <a href="https://wccftech.com/crime-boss-rockay-city-feels-like-a-half-baked-rushed-heist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mentioned</a> when the game first launched in late March 2023, Crime Boss: Rockay City felt very rushed at the time. However, INGAME STUDIOS has since released many free updates that improved the game. Jarek Kolář, Head of Development at INGAME Studios, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>We are so thankful to the growing community for sticking with Crime Boss as we work tirelessly to improve and build upon the game. Crime Boss: Rockay City coming to Steam is another huge leap forward for the game, and we welcome people to revisit Rockay with fresh eyes. We’re so excited for the future of Crime Boss.</em></p>
<p>There's also a special offer for Steam users: for a limited time, Cagnali's Order and the previous DLCs (Dragon’s Gold Cup, Heavy Hitters Weapon Pack, and Tactical Weapon Pack) will be available for free.</p>
<p>The developers have also promised to release more content throughout this year and the next. There's even a roadmap available <a href="https://visitrockaycity.com/roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the official website</a>. Update 10, titled Baker's Angels, is said to add unique boss skins and more, while Update 11 (Legends) will introduce new characters, among other things. Update 12 (Nightmare) will add a Horde mode to Crime Boss: Rockay City. Lastly, Q1 2025 will see the release of a new multiplayer missions and more.</p>

			<p>Tencent's Team Jade (formerly known as TiMi Studio Group) has released a brief Summer Game Fest teaser for its upcoming tactical first-person shooter Delta Force: Hawk Ops. A special stream event is scheduled for June 7th at 14:00 PDT, and the game will be playable during Summer Game Fest Play Days from June 8th to June 10th.</p>
<p>The video teaser is focused on the game's 'Black Hawk Down' campaign mode, which is being developed with Unreal Engine 5. Weirdly enough, that won't be true for the other two modes available in Delta Force: Hawk Ops, which will presumably be made in Unreal Engine 4 instead.</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Large-Scale PvP Mode - Havoc Warfare:</strong> Compete as part of a large team on massive maps, featuring authentic terrains and including military vehicles, tanks and helicopters in a grand war.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Extraction Mode - Hazard Operations:</strong> Squad up and take on other teams or AI-controlled mercenaries and royal guards in the Hazard Operations, the most tactical take on the popular extraction genre to date. Random events across massive maps will keep players engaged, as well as selecting challenging PvE-focused missions as part of the experience.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>While Delta Force: Hawk Ops is scheduled to launch as a free-to-play game on PC, consoles, and mobile, the Black Hawk Down campaign mode will be only available on PC and consoles.</p>
<p>On PC, NVIDIA RTX owners <a href="https://wccftech.com/dlss-3-coming-to-project-mugen-delta-force-hawk-ops-out-now-in-fort-solis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can look forward to DLSS Super Resolution and DLSS Frame Generation support</a>.</p>

                <p>Just over three decades ago, Midway's NBA Jam was a monster hit in arcades that rivaled Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter II. Arcades have largely fallen by the wayside since the days of NBA Jam's dominance. However, the spirit of the game is being revisited in NBA Superstars, a new arcade game from Raw Thrills and Play Mechanix that recreates the over-the-top style of NBA Jam. And to further connect the two games, NBA Jam announcer Tim Kitzrow is lending his voice to NBA Superstars as well.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4r22l5Zl90" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/p4r22l5Zl90" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>All 30 NBA teams are represented in NBA Superstars, which features modern players including LeBron James, Stephen Curry, Nikola Jokic, Giannis Antetokounmpo, and more. One of the updated changes for this title is that NBA Superstars will feature three-on-three games as opposed to NBA Jam's two-on-two contests.</p><p>The arcade cabinet for NBA Superstars also represents a significant step up from the NBA Jam era. It features a 75-inch screen, marquee lights that simulate camera flashes, and team-specific color-coordinated RGB LEDs. Additionally, players will be able to create their own online accounts that can keep track of their records and statistics via QR codes that can be scanned by the game.</p><p>NBA Superstars will be released in arcades this summer. But if you'd rather bring the arcade action to your living room, Arcade1Up's NBA Jam home arcade cabinet features multiple versions of the classic basketball game.

            <p>
Even without the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-overturns-helldivers-2-psn-requirement-following-backlash">whole PSN debacle</a>, Helldivers 2 has had hectic few months, with developer Arrowhead pumping out wild, game-changing updates at a furious pace. But it looks like the studio is finally ready to ease off a bit, and has said it feels a "slightly lower [update] cadence... will benefit both us, you, and the game."
</p>
<p>
Arrowhead CEO Johan Pilestedt first <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-balancing-has-sometimes-gone-too-far-ceo-admits">hinted at some adjustments</a> to the studio's current development strategy at the start of May, when he said he would be talking to the team about in-game balancing, agreeing that changes had perhaps "gone too far" in recent months. And another strategy shift has now been confirmed by Helldivers 2 community manager Twinbeard on Discord (thanks <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/helldivers-2-studio-wants-to-slow-down-the-pace-of-updates-we-feel-a-slightly-lower-cadence-overall-will-benefit-both-us-you-and-the-game/">PC Gamer</a>) when discussing an ETA on the game's next update.
</p>
<p>
"We want to take some more time for this one and potentially between future patches," Twinbeard explained, "since we feel cadence has probably been a bit too high to be able to maintain the quality standard we want and you deserve."

<p>
"Patching a lot can easily disrupt work flow and takes more resources than you might think," he added. "It needs planning, implementing, monitoring, possible tweaking in hotfixes etc. For this one we prefer to stretch it out a little, hopefully with a good result."
</p>
<p>
As to how this slower schedule might look compared to the studio's previous release strategy, Twinbeard says that's still undecided. "I'd say it's something we have to try out and get a feel for," he told fans. "[Right now] we feel a slightly lower cadence overall will benefit both us, you, and the game."
</p>
<p>
There's obviously risk to messing with a winning formula so soon after launch - particularly one that's helped propel Helldivers 2 into becoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-now-playstations-fastest-selling-game-ever">PlayStation's fastest-selling game ever</a>, to the tune of 12m copies on PS5 and PC - but it's unlikely fans will begrudge the team their hard-earned rest too much after such a chaotic and largely successful first few months.

			<p>When the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S launched, it took some live service games a while to release official next-gen updates, with some games relying on backward compatibility for a while. Crytek’s <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/hunt-showdown/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hunt: Showdown</a> has held out longer than most, as the game is still technically only playable via backward compatibility on current-gen consoles, but that’s finally going to change this summer.</p>
<p>According to Crytek, they’re going to be upgrading Hunt: Showdown to Cryengine 5.11 and releasing official PS5 and Xbox Series X/S updates in August. The flip side, is that support for Xbox One and PS4 is coming to an end, so console players will need upgrade if they want to keep playing. That said, the upgrade to XSX/PS5 will be free, and your player account, progress, and purchased DLC will carry over. You can get more details on the upgrade and transfer in the Crytek dev video, below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Developer Update | Date Reveal | Hunt: Showdown" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M0lAW63LTYo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The update that ushers in current-gen console and Cryengine 5.11 support will also introduce a new map, which Crytek claims will be designed to show off the capabilities of the new engine…</p>
<p><em>“Crytek is pleased to announce the long-awaited upgrade for Hunt: Showdown will be launching this coming August. The update will bring with it a new map, Cryengine version 5.11, and performance improvements for PC &amp; console versions of the game, as well as new UI/UX design and much more.”</em></p>
<p>Between now and the big update in August, Crytek is promising a further look at Hunt: Showdown’s tech and performance improvements, UI redesign, progression and prestige systems changes, new anti-cheat initiatives, and more. It seems Crytek is essentially treating this update as a relaunch of the game.</p>
<p>Hunt: Showdown can be played on PC, Xbox One, and PS4, as well as Xbox Series X/S and PS5 via backward compatibility. The native Xbox Series X/S and PS5 versions of the game launch August 15, at which point Xbox One and PS4 support ends.</p>

Hunt: Showdown, the acclaimed PvEvP bounty hunting horror shooter from developer Crytek, is waving goodbye to Xbox One and PlayStation 4 on 15th August - but owners will be able to upgrade to the current-gen versions for free.
</p>
<p>
Crytek's David Fifield confirmed an August end date for PS4 and Xbox One support in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0lAW63LTYo">new video</a> laying the groundwork for Hunt: Showdown's next major update, which is being described as a "significant relaunch of [the game] at a whole new level".
</p>
<p>
"After this is live and running natively on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series consoles," Fifield explained in the video, "you will no longer be able to play at all on the older generations of consoles and will need to upgrade."

<p>
Affected Hunt: Showdown players are being offered a free upgrade to the PS5 or Xbox Series X/S version from 15th August. Fifield notes player accounts and entitlements, alongside all related DLCs, will carry over when players are ready to make the transition.
</p>
<p>
Hunt: Showdown's August update also promises a CryEngine 5.11 upgrade, a new event, new map, new biome, and more. Fifield says Crytek is "very committed" to sharing more about the update ahead of its launch, and the studio is set to air a series of videos over the coming months to do just that.
</p>
<p>
Hunt: Showdown got its full launch back in 2021 after a few years in early access. Eurogamer contributor  Edwin Evans-Thirlwell liked it a lot on release, calling it a "stealth survival game like few others" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hunt-showdown-review">his Recommended review</a>.
