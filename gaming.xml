            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/24/24351191/ayaneo-3-price-release-date-indiegogo-specs-handheld<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Ayaneo builds the best-looking handheld PCs in the business, but they’ve always been boutique. The 2023 Ayaneo 2, for example, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23604799/ayaneo-2-review-handheld-gaming-pc">cost $1,300 for an arguably worse experience than the $400 Steam Deck</a>. But that experience isn’t dampening my excitement for the new 7-inch Ayaneo 3. </p></div><p>Not only does this one start at $900, within striking distance of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24204770/asus-rog-ally-x-review-handheld-gaming-pc">highest-end handhelds you’ll find at retail</a>, it’s the most feature-packed portable I’ve seen — with two USB4 ports <em>and</em> OcuLink <em>and</em> RGB-ringed Hall effect joysticks <em>and </em>your choice of two seemingly killer screens. Perhaps most exciting: a way to finally fix a handheld’s joystick and button layout to match your ergonomic preferences!</p><p>Just watch:</p><div><figcaption><em>Finally.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Animation by Ayaneo</cite></p></div><p>Ayaneo is calling the Ayaneo 3 “the world’s first modular handheld,” because there’ll be other modular options too. An extra $139 buys a set of six modules that let you swap out your joysticks for analog sticks, a six-button microswitch pad for fighting games, or even D-pads and face buttons with conductive silicone underneath for a different feel. </p><div><figcaption><em>Six modules and extra joystick toppers come with the “Magic Module” kit.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Ayaneo</cite></p></div><p>But importantly, that basic module that lets you change joystick and button orientation and swap joystick caps comes with the handheld by default, and it’s not the only feature Ayaneo is impressively cramming into the $900 kit. </p><p>While you’ll “only” get a Ryzen 8840U, 16GB of LPDDR5X RAM, and 512GB of storage that that price — no <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337300/amd-ryzen-z2-z2-extreme-z2-go">Z2 option</a>, and the HX 370 model starts at $1500 — you do get your choice of OLED or IPS right away. </p><p>That OLED screen is a 1080p 144Hz HDR OLED panel promising 800 nits of global brightness and 110 percent of the DCI-P3 color gamut, specs which suggest it could even beat the Steam Deck OLED’s excellent screen.</p><div><figcaption><em>An actual photo of the Ayaneo 3.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Ayaneo</cite></p></div><p>Like the Deck OLED, it unfortunately <em>doesn’t</em> have variable refresh rate for added smoothness — but if that’s important, the IPS panel option does! That one’s a 120Hz, 500-nit, native landscape 1080p display, according to the company, with 7ms response time and only 100 percent sRGB coverage (read: nowhere near as colorful as the OLED panel). </p><p>On top of all that, the Ayaneo 3 comes standard with both top <em>and</em> bottom USB4 ports, both of which are capable of 65W PD charging, <em>plus</em> the still-rare-on-handhelds Oculink port <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/11/24319196/egpus-continue-to-evolve">for eGPUs</a>, and it takes full-length M.2 2280 SSDs for easy storage upgrades.</p><p>Plus, there’s a dedicated hardware mode switch on the bottom edge to switch the controller and virtual-mouse-and-keyboard modes. I doubt that will make up for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/30/24329005/bazzite-asus-rog-ally-x-steam-os-editorial">the current state of Windows</a>, but it could help! Also, new trigger locks for its Hall effect triggers, if you want to switch them into a hair trigger mode.</p><p>I do have a few hesitations, even without having touched the Ayaneo 3. First, the company says its modules <em>electronically</em> latch into the frame — you have to eject them by pressing a software button, which activates a motor to release the latch. Sounds potentially fiddly?</p><p>Second, I’m sorry to report that this 1.5-pound handheld only fits a 49 watt-hour battery, even though the Asus ROG Ally X manages to fit an 80 watt-hour pack into roughly the same weight. Fingers crossed, but I wouldn’t expect great battery life here with neither a giant battery pack nor a particularly handheld-optimized chip.</p><p>Lastly, it’s always important to point out that these products are crowdfunded, and while Ayaneo has a history of delivering its promised handhelds, they haven’t always been great — and this is the most ambitious one yet. If that sounds worthwhile, <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/ayaneo-3-the-world-s-first-modular-handheld">you can find the Ayaneo 3 on Indiegogo</a> here. </p><p>The company says the handheld should ship at the end of April; here’s the whole price breakdown.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Don’t feel bad if you missed that news, because <em>Star Trek: Section 31</em> has been barely marketed and isn’t in a theater near you. Instead, this spin-off film starring Michelle Yeoh is a streaming-only movie exclusively available on Paramount+. </p><p>The movie sees Yeoh reprising her role as the evil mirror universe version of Philippa Georgiou from <em>Star Trek Discovery</em>. However, Georgiou is now working with the Federation and its secretive group known as Section 31. She forms a team, does some sci-fi mission, and the horrible movie that you shouldn’t watch ends with her and the team sharing drinks together. That’s when the team’s leader, Control, appears via hologram and we get a big last minute cameo. </p><p><strong><em>Stop right now if you are still planning on watching this movie and don’t want the ending cameo spoiled! This is your last chance.</em></strong></p><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Okay, so the leader of the Section 31 team seen in the movie is known as Control—its an AI from the future or past or whatever, don’t worry about it—and the person playing this character is none other than Jamie Lee Curtis. In the movie’s final minutes she pops up in a hologram and with some Borg-looking cybernetics on her forehead. She then tells the team about their next mission which seems like its sequel <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/star_trek_section_31&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/star_trek_section_31" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">that likely won’t happen.</a></span> </p><p>Here’s how she looks in the movie so you don’t have to watch it. </p><figure id="" data-id="a1d83c041d5f791c8776624fa9fde663" data-recommend-id="image://a1d83c041d5f791c8776624fa9fde663" data-format="png" data-width="1628" data-height="652" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a1d83c041d5f791c8776624fa9fde663" data-recommend-id="image://a1d83c041d5f791c8776624fa9fde663" data-format="png" data-width="1628" data-height="652" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://ew.com/star-trek-section-31-ending-cameo-8778510&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://ew.com/star-trek-section-31-ending-cameo-8778510" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As reported by Entertainment Weekly</a></span>, according to <em>Section 31'</em>s director and executive producer Olatunde Osunsanm, Curtis was cast because <em>Star Trek</em> producer and boss Alex Kurtzman’s cousin is her agent.

                <p>Microsoft's next big game, the RPG Avowed from The Outer Worlds developer Obsidian, is coming out in February. Unlike some of Obsidian's other RPGs, Avowed is not an open-world game. This serves the game best, Avowed region director Berto Ritger said.</p><p>Avowed features large "defined zones," as opposed to taking place in an open world. Ritger said having established and distinct zones is a "good pacing mechanism" for the choices players make.</p><p>"We know roughly what you've done before you've gone to the next thing. It's still a very open structure within those zones, where you can do whatever you want for the most part, but it's not one contiguous area where you could be anywhere at any moment," Ritger said in

It’s a shorter list that positions the new update as one of the smaller in recent memory, but that doesn’t mean it won’t keep players locked in for the time being.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rivals fans often show up for the FPS gameplay and stick around for the guns, so the Gunblade already feels right at home. This two-in-one rifle doubles as both a ranged weapon and a giant blade. Using both to catch your opponents off guard may prove useful in the heat of battle, especially on the new Rivals Bridge map. This suspended, concrete location leaves no room for small talk by putting players into close-quarters combat from the jump with only a few concrete walls and a bus standing in between them. Nosniy says the arena is located in Seoul and comes from creator @GreatGuyBoom.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/22/roblox-rivals-update-9-1737584645781.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Rivals Update 9 adds the Gunblade to the Roblox FPS experience's arsenal.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, fans will notice that the Rivals Update 9 patch notes don’t mention any specific bug fixes, balance changes, or quality-of-life additions. The developers acknowledge their decision to ditch any other tweaks in favor of adding the Bridge map and Gunblade. Although there was room to “slightly” modify the skins for the Demon Shorty and Demon Uzi while renaming a few other weapons, Nosniy does promise more to come with the next major content update. Among the new additions will be one long-awaited feature: Ranked.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We hear all of your feedback and want to reassure you all that every necessary &amp; additional changes/improvements will be made in time for Ranked,” the team said in a statement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rivals fans have enjoyed regular updates since launch arrived last May. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rivals-update-7-patch-notes-outline-plans-for-weekly-weapon-drops"><u>Update 7</u></a>, for example, brought along the introduction of the Energy Rifle, Energy Pistols, Crossbow, and more.

However, the developers have confirmed what the game is not, and that is a "cosmic horror in feudal Japan." Executive Michal Nowakowski <a href="https://x.com/michalnowakow/status/1758597188555591758" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said previously on social media</a>, "It's definitely NOT a cosmic horror in feudal Japan."</p><p>Given that Project Hadar is a new IP, it stands to reason it will take place in a new, original universe featuring brand-new characters. The word "Hadar" has <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/hadar" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">many definitions</a>, including a fossil site in Ethiopia and a star in the Centaurus constellation, but there is no telling if however the word may be defined is in any way associated with what the product might be when it's done.</p><p>CD Projekt developer Maria Mazu told <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/the-witcher-3-and-cyberpunk-2077-studio-dev-thinks-it-only-makes-sense-for-cd-projekt-red-to-make-a-new-ip-that-comes-straight-from-us/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a> that they were "so happy" to learn they would get to make a new IP. "I feel like it only makes sense given how many kinds of people we have on this, like the storytelling side of things but also our artists," Mazur said. "It feels like a waste not to invest all that into something new or something that comes straight from us. I am very excited about Hadar."</p><h2 id="Project_Hadar_game_engine">Project Hadar game engine</h2><p>Project Hadar is likely to be developed with Epic's Unreal Engine, though this is not confirmed. CD Projekt has a deal in place with Epic to make more of its games using Unreal Engine 5 as well, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-witcher-4-release-date-trailer-news/2900-5228/" data-ref-id="2900-5228">including The Witcher 4</a>, and it would make sense for the deal to cover CD Projekt's other games. But again, this is not confirmed.</p><h2 id="Who_s_developing_Project_Hadar_">Who's developing Project Hadar?</h2><p>CD Projekt is developing Project Hadar. As of October 31, 2024--which is when the latest data was published--CD Projekt said it had 18 people working on Project Hadar. This was actually down from 20 people at the end of July 2024. As you can see in the chart below, the overwhelming majority of CD Projekt's developers are working on Polaris, which is the codename for The Witcher 4.</p><p>CD Projekt has evolved in recent years to become a bigger studio that is making multiple games simultaneously. In addition to Hadar and The Witcher 4, CD Projekt's teams are working on a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6526333/" data-ref-id="1100-6526333">Cyberpunk 2077 sequel</a>, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-remake-everything-we-know-about-the-open-world-remake-of-the-classic-rpg/1100-6528839/" data-ref-id="1100-6528839">remake of the original Witcher</a>, and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-witcher-game-project-sirius-is-undergoing-some-changes/1100-6512512/" data-ref-id="1100-6512512">Witcher spin-off called Sirius. </a></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4433498-screenshot2025-01-24at1.55.44pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4433498" data-ratio="0.56085918854415" data-width="838" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4433498-screenshot2025-01-24at1.55.44pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4433498"></a><figcaption>Only a small number of CD Projekt developers are working on Hadar right now.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4433498-screenshot2025-01-24at1.55.44pm.png"></figure><h2 id="Project_Hadar_development_news">Project Hadar development news</h2><p>CD Projekt <a href="https://x.com/CDPROJEKTRED/status/1577317922460024834" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced Project Hadar in October 2022.</a> At the time, the studio said the game was "created from scratch" and was, at the time, in the "earliest stages of the creative process." At the time, the studio made it clear that it was not developing an actual game yet, but instead putting together the "foundation" for a game.</p><p>No one should expect Project Hadar to be released anytime soon. The Witcher 4 is the studio's current main focus, and it just <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-is-now-officially-in-production-new-teaser-image-revealed/1100-6528058/" data-ref-id="1100-6528058">entered full production at the end of 2024.</a></p><p>CD Projekt making a new IP is a major development for the studio, as the company is best known for its adaptations of other creator's works. The Witcher is based on Andrzej Sapkowski's novel series, while Cyberpunk 2077 is based on Mike Pondsmith's role-playing game.</p>

On top of all the other mechanics and features, this ends up being a lot of information to remember. It’s a bit of an abrupt surprise for a game that otherwise bills itself as being chill and cozy. There is no need to worry though! We’ve got you covered with a breakdown of every currency in <em>Infinity Nikki</em> along with their uses and how to get them.</p><h2 id="h160887"><a id="bling"></a>Bling</h2><figure id="" data-id="9c3e7441d7e881f0d56f4baeca4152de" data-recommend-id="image://9c3e7441d7e881f0d56f4baeca4152de" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Nikki points toward a pair of floating Bling on a rooftop." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Nikki points toward a pair of floating Bling on a rooftop." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Infold Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9c3e7441d7e881f0d56f4baeca4152de" data-recommend-id="image://9c3e7441d7e881f0d56f4baeca4152de" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Nikki points toward a pair of floating Bling on a rooftop." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Bling is the only currency that <em>technically</em> isn’t related to any gacha banners. It can be used on the Surprise-O-Matic, which is a separate gacha mechanic that’s accessible pretty early on. Bling can be used to purchase items and materials from merchants you encounter in-game. Upgrading outfits and Heart of Infinity nodes are also dependent on it.</p><p>Bling will be the currency you accumulate the most in terms of quantity. While everything else will be gathered in the hundreds and thousands, you’ll be able to surpass millions of Bling eventually. But in-game items and such do get pretty expensive, so it works out. .

You can also earn some here and there by raising your Stylist Rank, Mira level, or by progressing through the free track of the Mira Journey battle pass. Pay attention to any upcoming events since those can give some out as rewards too.</p><h2 id="h160891"><a id="revelation"></a>Revelation Crystal</h2><figure id="" data-id="e167f4a0c5a635269d902b9ae9348bd0" data-recommend-id="image://e167f4a0c5a635269d902b9ae9348bd0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The limited-time Blooming Fantasy banner that requires Revelation Crystals.

Otherwise, you can get them by exchanging with other currencies or through the paid track of Mira Journey. If you’re looking to exchange but aren’t sure which crystals to go for, I recommend focusing on Revelation Crystals. The fact that these are only used for time-limited banners inherently makes them more valuable.</p><p>On a related note, you might also be wondering what the Limited-Time Revelation Crystals that come with events are. <strong>Limited-Time Revelation Crystals work the same way as the regular ones, but they’ll expire at the end of the current banner.</strong> This isn’t a common mechanic among gachas, although one of the developer’s previous works had this function. I suggest using these up before they expire. Even if the banner doesn’t interest you, it’s better to use them to get some new items than let them waste. </p><h2 id="h160892"><a id=""></a>Tranquility Droplets</h2><figure id="" data-id="a0a188b296ba90ec5f934a669c92995a" data-recommend-id="image://a0a188b296ba90ec5f934a669c92995a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Tranquility Droplets tab in the store.

That being said, the best things to buy with them are Resonite or Revelation Crystals. </p><h2 id="h160893"><a id=""></a>Surging Ebb</h2><figure id="" data-id="5858e709305523064a6b381c00b118a3" data-recommend-id="image://5858e709305523064a6b381c00b118a3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Surging Ebb tab in the store.

Yes, you can trade these in for a limitless amount of Crystals. Just don’t expect to see this currency too often. Four-star and five-star outfit pieces are rarer to pull, and therefore rarer to get duplicates of.</p><hr><p>For as cozy as <em>Infinity Nikki</em> is, you’ll still feel like a gacha accountant with all these different currencies. The good news is that there isn’t crazy combat or metas to keep up with in this game. You can take it at your own pace and just vibe with all the Fresh and Elegant clothes acquired during your journey. Play the game and grind for the stuff you want, but make sure to take some time to just ride some bikes and look cute doing it.</p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Four years after its launch, US sales of Xbox Series X/S are trailing behind those of its predecessor, Xbox One, at the same point in the consoles' life time. Sales of PlayStation 5, however, are now firmly outpacing PlayStation 4.
</p>
<p>
That's according to sales data from marketing research and technology company Circana (formerly The NPD Group) in its latest monthly report. Circana executive director and games industry analyst Mat Piscatella summarised the company's finding  - covering US games and hardware spending up to December 2024 - in a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lgg2ddgpqc2n">lengthy post</a> on Bluesky (thanks <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/us-ps5-sales-are-pacing-ahead-of-ps4-while-xbox-series-lags-behind-xbox-one/">VGC</a>).
</p>
<p>
Commenting on some of the reports highlights, Piscatella <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lggkcxfw3c2f">wrote</a>, "Through each console's first 50 months in the US market (life to date ending Dec 2024 for both Xbox Series X/S and PS5), PS5 lifetime unit sales are 7 percent ahead of PS4's pace, while Xbox Series X/S trails Xbox One by 18 percent." By comparison, Piscatella noted, "Through 38 months in the US (through Dec 2023), PS5 led PS4 by 6 percent while Xbox Series X/S trailed Xbox One by 13 percent."

<p>
Circana's 2024 end-of-year report charts what Piscatella <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lgg2dpa7su2n">called</a> a "rough" 12 months for gaming hardware, with consumer spending falling 29 percent compared to last year. On a more granular level, spending on PS5 hardware fell by 18 percent (although it remained the best-selling platform in December) while Series X/S and Switch declined by 38 percent. This drop, however, was "expected" according to Piscatella, given Switch's substantial time on the market, and PS5 and Series X/S both being "past their selling peaks".
</p><p>
While specific hardware sales figures weren't disclosed, Sony last year revealed, amid declining year-on-year sales, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-5-totals-61m-units-sold-as-hardware-sales-continue-to-fall">61m PS5s have been shifted</a> since its launch in November 2020. Microsoft does not share sales figures for Xbox Series X/S, but it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-console-sales-decline-continues">also previously confirmed declining hardware sales</a> as it increasingly pushes Xbox as a hardware agnostic brand.
</p>
<p>
Piscatella's <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lgg2ddgpqc2n">full summary of Circana's latest report on US games and hardware trends</a> can be found on Bluesky and makes for an interesting read.

The primary reason to interact with this mechanic is to increase how many points your clothing scores during Styling Challenges.</p><p>Each Glow Up will require a certain amount of Bling, Threads of Purity, and Shiny Bubbles. The amount needed for each will increase each time you go through with an upgrade. Furthermore, a piece’s rarity will also affect how many resources are required.</p><h2 id="h165706"><a id="evolution"></a>Evolution</h2><figure id="" data-id="d0788b47e52289dfc8dd7b2ba7954400" data-recommend-id="image://d0788b47e52289dfc8dd7b2ba7954400" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Clothing Evolution screen with the Bubbly Voyage: Spring outfit." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Clothing Evolution screen with the Bubbly Voyage: Spring outfit." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Infold Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d0788b47e52289dfc8dd7b2ba7954400" data-recommend-id="image://d0788b47e52289dfc8dd7b2ba7954400" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Clothing Evolution screen with the Bubbly Voyage: Spring outfit." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>Another method of upgrading is called Evolution, and its sole purpose is to unlock a recolor of an outfit.</strong> There isn’t a gameplay advantage for doing this as stats remain the same as the original look. Any 4-star outfit will only have a single recolor to evolve into, but those with a 5-star rarity have three.</p><p>The requirements to go through an Evolution are dependent on a few factors. Ability Outfits you craft during the main quest line need the following:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>A duplicate of each item that makes the outfit</li><li>Bling</li><li>Threads of Purity</li><li>Calm Thoughts</li></ul><p>Any Ability Outfits you acquire from a banner can also evolve, but they’ll just need a duplicate set. That might sound easy at first, however, you’ll need to get these duplicate items from the banners as well. Time and a little bit of luck will be necessary to get enough of the items. Don’t be surprised if you’re suddenly tempted to fork over a bit of cash to get crystals and make more pulls on the banner.</p><p><strong>Outfits with a 5-star rarity are the most difficult to evolve.</strong> They can go through the process a total of three times, with only the final recolor requiring a set of duplicates. The first two evolutions will instead require a Heartshine to unlock the new duds. Heartshines are solely unlocked through the Deep Echoes mechanic of each banner, which rewards you with items for making various amounts of pulls. You can look forward to getting them after making around 180 pulls. Additionally, Heartshines are unique to each banner. If you complete a 5-star outfit and then decide to go for their evolved versions, you’ll need to grind out or pay for a lot of crystals.</p><hr><p><br><em>Infinity Nikki</em> can be downright overwhelming with its many systems, especially if you’re new to Gachas. Hopefully you have a better understanding of how to upgrade outfits so you can ace those Styling Challenges and look damn good while doing mundane activities. <br></p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It was a surprise reveal that came alongside confirmation that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-4-announced-at-microsofts-xbox-developer-direct-2025">Microsoft is set to publish Ninja Gaiden 4</a> across PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X and S (including Game Pass day one) later in 2025. For more, here's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-developer-direct-2025-everything-announced">everything announced during Microsoft's Xbox Developer Direct 2025</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's the official blurb on Ninja Gaiden 2 Black:</p><blockquote>In Ninja Gaiden 2 Black, players assume the role of Ryu Hayabusa, a deadly ninja who wields the legendary Dragon Sword while embarking on a global battle against a series of formidable foes. The beautiful and bloody remaster utilizes Unreal Engine 5 to significantly enhance the graphic expression, elevating everything from character visuals to environmental backgrounds. In fact, the stages, characters, effects, and lighting have all been completely redesigned and remastered to fully immerse gamers into the story’s dark ninja world.</blockquote><blockquote>Gore elements such as dismemberment and blood have also been remastered to enhance the action experience. The high-speed, violent fights play out in brilliant brutality, utilizing a variety of weapons and techniques including Japanese swords, shurikens, Kusari-gamas, and tonfas. Meanwhile, those looking for a more toned-down experience can simply toggle the dismemberment feature on and off in the Options menu.</blockquote><blockquote>In addition, Ninja Gaiden 2 Black includes extra elements from the spin-off titles released after the original game’s debut, including the ability to control three additional characters: Momiji, Ayane, and Rachel. The remaster also includes “HERO PLAY STYLE”, a mode for beginners that provides automatic support in the most difficult situations, making the notoriously challenging title more accessible for those who may not be so confident in their action skills.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">In a post on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/01/23/ninja-gaiden-4-developer-direct-2025/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Xbox Wire</u></a>, Team Ninja boss Fumihiko Yasuda explained the decision to remaster Ninja Gaiden 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This simultaneous announcement and same-day release alongside Ninja Gaiden 4 might have caught some people by surprise,” he said. “The biggest reason for developing Ninja Gaiden 2 Black was to address the concerns of core fans who might be wondering, ‘What’s going to happen to Ryu Hayabusa?’ We also wanted to give players something to enjoy as they wait for the release of Ninja Gaiden 4. We chose Ninja Gaiden 2 because it stands as one of the most solid action games in the series. We added ‘Black’ to the title to signal to fans that this is the definitive version, much like Ninja Gaiden Black was for the first game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yasuda continued: "This version is crafted to satisfy both those who played the original and newcomers discovering it as a current-generation action game. We’ve meticulously incorporated some of the additions of Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 while staying true to the challenge and feel of the original 360 version, including its signature gore and violence. We’ve also adjusted the weapon upgrade system to more align with the original release.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Ninja Gaiden 2 Black Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Team Ninja’s infamously challenging Ninja Gaiden series has a long association with Xbox. The developer’s reboot of the action series launched first on Xbox in 2004, propelling master ninja Ryu Hayabusa into the mainstream. Ninja Gaiden Black, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-ninja-gaiden-black-is-the-best-pure-action-game-of-all-time"><u>considered one of the greatest action games of all time</u></a>, launched the following year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ninja Gaiden 2 came out in 2008 published by Microsoft Game Studios for the Xbox 360. Ninja Gaiden 3 followed in 2012 on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Since then, fans have had the critically panned spin-off Yaiba: Ninja Gaiden Z, and, more recently, Ninja Gaiden: Master Collection, a compilation of Ninja Gaiden Sigma, Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2, and Ninja Gaiden 3: Razor's Edge.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

The Tomb features a fan-favorite Wonder Weapon, which deals elemental damage and provides an additional way to heal downed teammates.</p><p dir="ltr">At the end of the Citadelle des Morts final cutscene, Gabriel Krafft tells the crew to take the amulet they've acquired to an excavation site in France. As seen in the trailer below, the crew finds itself at the dig site, which features underground tombs and a subterranean temple.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlvFuhlYRMg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tlvFuhlYRMg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Gameplay for The Tomb shows off all these various layers of the map, and it gives us an even better look at the map's Wonder Weapon in action. The Tomb features the Staff of Ice Wonder Weapon, which is familiar to those who played the popular Origins map from 2012's Call of Duty: Black Ops 2.</p><p dir="ltr">The Staff of Ice is capable of firing icy blasts at enemies, slowing or freezing them in place, as well as dealing a more devastating area-of-effect attack. It also has the ability to heal, and the trailer shows a crew member using the Wonder Weapon to fire a restorative blast to revive a downed teammate.</p><p dir="ltr">Origins is one of the most beloved Zombies maps of all time, and while this is only one of the four elemental staffs featured in the original Black Ops 2 map, it's really nice to see the staff return after all these years. Plus, having another way to heal teammates is always a bonus.</p><p dir="ltr">Season 2 also adds the Death Perception perk from Black Ops 4, and augments will be available to unlock to upgrade the perk. Three more Gobblegums are introduced, including one Whimsical Gobblegum that dresses all the zombies with rubber ducky flotation devices.</p><p dir="ltr">All the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-2-roadmap-details-terminator-event-new-mp-maps-and-warzone-improvements/2900-6155/#1">highlights of Season 2's content can be found here</a>, which includes brand-new multiplayer maps, a Terminator crossover event, and ninja-themed operators.</p>

Such is the case with the <em>Sniper Elite</em> franchise, which continues to embrace the stealth and sniping experience with increasingly realistic mechanics. If you’re new to the series and want to know what you’ve been missing, here’s a brief rundown of <em>Sniper Elite</em> and all of the games released so far.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195734" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="157" data-playlist="195734,196411,195189" data-current="195734"><div><p>The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195734/195734_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195734/195734_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195734/195734_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195734/195734_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21246.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h47640"><a id="expect"></a>What to expect from the Sniper Elite franchise</h2><p>With the exception of two VR titles, the <em>Sniper Elite </em>franchise stars American OSS operative, Karl Fairburne, a deadly sniper with a penchant for getting shit done. As Karl, players infiltrate various Nazi strongholds during World War II in his quests to take out high-ranking officials, gather important intel, and work to stop the Nazis from gaining nuclear power. </p><figure id="" data-id="d89ed65c4400496900964317254b0f10" data-recommend-id="image://d89ed65c4400496900964317254b0f10" data-format="jpg" data-width="1440" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A first-person perspective of a sniper scope shows a soldier getting shot." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A first-person perspective of a sniper scope shows a soldier getting shot." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Rebellion</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d89ed65c4400496900964317254b0f10" data-recommend-id="image://d89ed65c4400496900964317254b0f10" data-format="jpg" data-width="1440" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A first-person perspective of a sniper scope shows a soldier getting shot." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Sniper Elite</em>’s gameplay is built around intense stealth, letting players loose in medium-sized sandbox levels where they’re tasked with completing various main and side objectives without being caught by Nazi forces. Doing so requires distracting enemies, knocking out or killing them, and even hiding their bodies.</p><p>And while much of this can be completed with some melee takedowns and a wide selection of traps, sometimes you just have to resort to popping noggins with a sniper. This is where things get the most fun, too, as the franchise takes a relatively realistic approach to sniping, requiring you to mask your shots using lightning or loud nearby events, as well as learn how wind and bullet drop will affect your shots.</p><figure id="" data-id="101b6aad1015d9818363d68608aa16d3" data-recommend-id="image://101b6aad1015d9818363d68608aa16d3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An X-ray image shows a bullet entering a soldier's body." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An X-ray image shows a bullet entering a soldier's body." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Rebellion</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="101b6aad1015d9818363d68608aa16d3" data-recommend-id="image://101b6aad1015d9818363d68608aa16d3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An X-ray image shows a bullet entering a soldier's body." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Perhaps most thrilling of all, though, is the series’ famous X-ray kill cam, which will often slow down time to show your bullet travel from your rifle to its target, then give you a view of their innards as the bullet penetrates their organs in graphic detail.

Luckily, <strong>each game has a standalone story, meaning you don’t need to have played any previous titles to understand what’s going on</strong>. A vague reference to past events here or there may catch the ears of the most dedicated fans, but rest assured you’re not missing any pivotal information by jumping into the series wherever you’d like.</p><p>The release order of the mainline series is as follows:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Sniper Elite </em>(2005)</li><li><em>Sniper Elite V2</em> (2012)</li><li><em>Sniper Elite III</em> (2014)</li><li><em>Sniper Elite 4</em> (2017)</li><li><em>Sniper Elite VR</em> (2021)</li><li><em>Sniper Elite 5</em> (2022)</li><li><em>Sniper Elite VR: Winter Warrior</em> (2023)</li><li><em>Sniper Elite: Resistance </em>(2025)</li></ul><p>In addition to the mainline franchise, a spin-off franchise known as <em>Nazi Zombie Army</em> uses similar mechanics (including the beloved X-ray kill cam) while pitting players against an onslaught of zombies. This alternate history series contains four games so far, with the first three being bundled on modern platforms under the title <em>Zombie Army Trilogy</em>. Meanwhile, the most recent game, <em>Zombie Army 4: Dead War</em>, can be purchased separately.</p><p><br>Clearly, there are plenty of games in the <em>Sniper Elite</em> series that are waiting to be enjoyed, but if you just want to dive into the latest and greatest, you can start with <em>Sniper Elite: Resistance</em> on January 30. <br></p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Nvidia's GeForce RTX 5090 starts at $1,999 before you factor in upsells from the company's partners or price increases driven by scalpers and/or genuine demand. It costs more than my entire gaming PC.</p>
<p>The new GPU is so expensive that you could build an entire well-specced gaming PC with Nvidia's next-fastest GPU in it—the $999 RTX 5080, which we don't have in hand yet—for the same money, or maybe even a little less with judicious component selection. It's not the most expensive GPU that Nvidia has ever launched—2018's $2,499 Titan RTX has it beat, and 2022's RTX 3090 Ti also cost $2,000—but it's safe to say it's not really a GPU intended for the masses.</p>
<p>At least as far as gaming is concerned, the 5090 is the very definition of a halo product; it's for people who demand the best and newest thing regardless of what it costs (the calculus is probably different for deep-pocketed people and companies who want to use them as some kind of generative AI accelerator). And on this front, at least, the 5090 is successful. It's the newest and fastest GPU you can buy, and the competition is not particularly close. It's also a showcase for DLSS Multi-Frame Generation, a new feature unique to the 50-series cards that Nvidia is leaning on heavily to make its new GPUs look better than they already are.</p>

<p>We won’t spend too long talking about the specific designs of Nvidia’s Founders Edition cards since many buyers will experience the Blackwell GPUs with cards from Nvidia’s partners instead (the cards we’ve seen so far mostly look like the expected fare: gargantuan triple-slot triple-fan coolers, with varying degrees of RGB). But it's worth noting that Nvidia has addressed a couple of my functional gripes with the 4090/4080-series design.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>The first was the sheer dimensions of each card—not an issue unique to Nvidia, but one that frequently caused problems for me as someone who tends toward ITX-based PCs and smaller builds. The 5090 and 5080 FE designs are the same length and height as the 4090 and 4080 FE designs, but they only take up two slots instead of three, which will make them an easier fit for many cases.</p>
<p>Nvidia has also tweaked the cards’ 12VHPWR connector, recessing it into the card and mounting it at a slight angle instead of having it sticking straight out of the top edge. The height of the 4090/4080 FE design made some cases hard to close up once you factored in the additional height of a 12VHPWR cable or Nvidia’s many-tentacled 8-pin-to-12VHPWR adapter. The angled connector still extends a bit beyond the top of the card, but it’s easier to tuck the cable away so you can put the side back on your case.</p>


<p>Finally, Nvidia has changed its cooler—whereas most OEM GPUs mount all their fans on the top of the GPU, Nvidia has historically placed one fan on each side of the card. In a standard ATX case with the GPU mounted parallel to the bottom of the case, this wasn’t a <em>huge</em> deal—there’s plenty of room for that air to circulate inside the case and to be expelled by whatever case fans you have installed.</p>
<p>But in “sandwich-style” ITX cases, where a riser cable wraps around so the GPU can be mounted parallel to the motherboard, the fan on the bottom side of the GPU was poorly placed. In many sandwich-style cases, the GPU fan will dump heat against the back of the motherboard, making it harder to keep the GPU cool and creating heat problems elsewhere besides. The new GPUs mount both fans on the top of the cards.</p>

          
                  </div>

<p>Nvidia’s Founders Edition cards <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=geforce+founders+edition+heat+problems&amp;oq=geforce+founders+edition+heat+problems&amp;gs_lcrp=EgRlZGdlKgYIABBFGDkyBggAEEUYOdIBCDQxMzhqMGoxqAIAsAIA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">have had heat issues in the past</a>—most notably the 30-series GPUs—and that was my first question going in. A smaller cooler plus a dramatically higher peak power draw seems like a recipe for overheating.</p>

      </figcaption>
      </figure>

<p>At least for the 5090, the smaller cooler does mean higher temperatures—around 10 to 12 degrees Celsius higher when running the same benchmarks as the RTX 4090 Founders Edition. And while temperatures of around 77 degrees aren’t hugely concerning, this is sort of a best-case scenario, with an adequately cooled testbed case with the side panel totally removed and ambient temperatures at around 21° or 22° Celsius. You’ll just want to make sure you have a good amount of airflow in your case if you buy one of these.</p>
<h2>Testbed notes</h2>

<p>A new high-end Nvidia GPU is a good reason to tweak our test bed and suite of games, and we’ve done both here. Mainly, we added <a href="https://thermaltakeusa.com/products/toughpower-gf-a3-gold-1050w-tt-premium-edition-ps-tpd-1050fnfagu-l">a 1050 W Thermaltake Toughpower GF A3 power supply</a>—Nvidia recommends at least 1000 W for the 5090, and this one has a native 12VHPWR connector for convenience. We’ve also swapped the Ryzen 7 7800X3D for a slightly faster Ryzen 7 9800X3D to reduce the odds that the CPU will bottleneck performance as we try to hit high frame rates.</p>
<p>As for the suite of games, we’ve removed a couple of older titles and added some with built-in benchmarks that will tax these GPUs a bit more, especially at 4K with all the settings turned up. Those games include the RT Overdrive preset in the perennially punishing <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>and <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> in Cinematic mode, both games where even the RTX 4090 struggles to hit 60 fps without an assist from DLSS. We’ve also added <em>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</em>, a recent release that doesn’t include ray-tracing effects but does support most DLSS 3 and FSR 3 features (including FSR Frame Generation).</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>We’ve tried to strike a balance between games with ray-tracing effects and games without it, though most AAA games these days include it, and modern GPUs should be able to handle it well (best of luck to AMD with its upcoming RDNA 4 cards).</p>
<p>For the 5090, we've run all tests in 4K—if you don't care about running games in 4K, even if you want super-high frame rates at 1440p or for some kind of ultrawide monitor, the 5090 is probably overkill. When we run upscaling tests, we use the newest DLSS version available for Nvidia cards, the newest FSR version available for AMD cards, and the newest XeSS version available for Intel cards (not relevant here, just stating for the record), and we use the "Quality" setting (at 4K, that equates to an actual rendering version of 1440p).</p>
<h2>Rendering performance: A lot faster, a lot more power-hungry</h2>
<p>Before we talk about Frame Generation or "fake frames," let's compare apples to apples and just examine the 5090's rendering performance.</p>
<p>The card mainly benefits from four things compared to the 4090: the updated Blackwell GPU architecture, a nearly 33 percent increase in the number of CUDA cores, an upgrade from GDDR6X to GDDR7, and a move from a 384-bit memory bus to a 512-bit bus. It also jumps from 24GB of RAM to 32GB, but games generally aren't butting up against a 24GB limit yet, so the capacity increase by itself shouldn't really change performance if all you're focused on is gaming.</p>



<p>And for people who prioritize performance over all else, the 5090 is a big deal—it's the first consumer graphics card from any company that is faster than a 4090, as Nvidia never spruced up the 4090 last year when it did its mid-generation Super refreshes of the 4080, 4070 Ti, and 4070.</p>
<p>Comparing natively rendered games at 4K, the 5090 is between 17 percent and 40 percent faster than the 4090, with most of the games we tested landing somewhere in the low to high 30 percent range. That's an undeniably big bump, one that's roughly commensurate with the increase in the number of CUDA cores. Tests run with DLSS enabled (both upscaling-only and with Frame Generation running in 2x mode) improve by roughly the same amount.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          


<p>You could find things to be disappointed about if you went looking for them. That 30-something-percent performance increase comes with a 35 percent increase in power use in our testing under load with punishing 4K games—the 4090 tops out around 420 W, whereas the 5090 went all the way up to 573 W, with the 5090 coming closer to its 575 W TDP than the 4090 does to its theoretical 450 W maximum. The 50-series cards use the same TSMC 4N manufacturing process as the 40-series cards, and increasing the number of transistors without changing the process results in a chip that uses more power (though it should be said that capping frame rates, running at lower resolutions, or running less-demanding games can rein in that power use a bit).</p>

      Power draw under load goes up by an amount roughly commensurate with performance. The 4090 was already power-hungry; the 5090 is dramatically more so.

      </figure>

<p>The 5090's 30-something percent increase over the 4090 might also seem underwhelming if you recall that the 4090 <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review/3">was around 55 percent faster</a> than the previous-generation 3090 Ti while consuming about the same amount of power. To be <em>even faster</em> than a 4090 is no small feat—AMD's fastest GPU is more in line with Nvidia's 4080 Super—but if you're comparing the two cards using the exact same tests, the relative leap is less seismic.</p>
<p>That brings us to Nvidia's answer for that problem: DLSS 4 and its Multi-Frame Generation feature.</p>

<h2>DLSS 4 and Multi-Frame Generation</h2>
<p>As a refresher, Nvidia's DLSS Frame Generation feature, as introduced in the GeForce 40-series, takes DLSS upscaling one step further. The upscaling feature inserted interpolated pixels into a rendered image to make it look like a sharper, higher-resolution image without having to do all the work of rendering all those pixels. DLSS FG would interpolate an entire frame between rendered frames, boosting your FPS without dramatically boosting the amount of work your GPU was doing. If you used DLSS upscaling and FG at the same time, Nvidia could claim that seven out of eight pixels on your screen were generated by AI.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>DLSS Multi-Frame Generation (hereafter MFG, for simplicity's sake) does the same thing, but it can generate one to three interpolated frames for every rendered frame. The marketing numbers have gone up, too; now, 15 out of every 16 pixels on your screen can be generated by AI.</p>
<figure>
    
          <figcaption>
        <div>

      Nvidia might point to this and say that the 5090 is over twice as fast as the 4090, but that's not really comparing apples to apples. Expect this issue to persist over the lifetime of the 50-series.

<p>Nvidia provided reviewers with a preview build of <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>with DLSS MFG enabled, which gives us an example of how those settings will be exposed to users. For 40-series cards that only support the regular DLSS FG, you won't notice a difference in games that support MFG—Frame Generation is still just one toggle you can turn on or off. For 50-series cards that support MFG, you'll be able to choose from among a few options, just as you currently can with other DLSS quality settings.</p>
<p>The “2x” mode is the old version of DLSS FG and is supported by both the 50-series cards and 40-series GPUs; it promises one generated frame for every rendered frame (two frames total, hence "2x"). The “3x” and “4x” modes are new to the 50-series and promise two and three generated frames (respectively) for every rendered frame. Like the original DLSS FG, MFG can be used in concert with normal DLSS upscaling, or it can be used independently.</p>
<p>One problem with the original DLSS FG was latency—user input was only being sampled at the natively rendered frame rate, meaning you could be looking at 60 frames per second on your display but only having your input polled 30 times per second. Another is image quality; as good as the DLSS algorithms can be at guessing and recreating what a natively rendered pixel would look like, you'll inevitably see errors, particularly in fine details.</p>
<p>Both these problems contribute to the third problem with DLSS FG: Without a decent underlying frame rate, the lag you feel and the weird visual artifacts you notice will both be more pronounced. So DLSS FG can be useful for turning 120 fps into 240 fps, or even 60 fps into 120 fps. But it's not as helpful if you're trying to get from 20 or 30 fps up to a smooth 60 fps.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>We'll be taking a closer look at the DLSS upgrades in the next couple of weeks (including MFG and the new transformer model, which will supposedly increase upscaling quality and supports all RTX GPUs). But in our limited testing so far, the issues with DLSS MFG are basically the same as with the first version of Frame Generation, just slightly more pronounced. In the built-in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> benchmark, the most visible issues are with some bits of barbed-wire fencing, which get smoother-looking and less detailed as you crank up the number of AI-generated frames. But the motion&nbsp;<em>does</em> look fluid and smooth, and the frame rate counts are admittedly impressive.</p>
<p>But as we noted in last year's 4090 review, the xx90 cards portray FG and MFG in the best light possible since the card is already capable of natively rendering such high frame rates. It's on lower-end cards where the shortcomings of the technology become more pronounced. Nvidia might say that the upcoming RTX 5070 is "as fast as a 4090 for $549," and it might be right in terms of the number of frames the card can put up on your screen every second. But responsiveness and visual fidelity on the 4090 will be better every time—AI is a good augmentation for rendered frames, but it's iffy as a <em>replacement</em> for rendered frames.</p>

<h2>A 4090, amped way up</h2>

<p>The GeForce RTX 5090 is an impressive card—it's the only consumer graphics card to be released in over two years that can outperform the RTX 4090. The main caveats are its sky-high power consumption and sky-high price; by itself, it costs as much (and consumes as much power as) an entire mainstream gaming PC. The card is aimed at people who care about speed way more than they care about price, but it's still worth putting it into context.</p>
<p>The main controversy, as with the 40-series, is how Nvidia talks about its Frame Generation-inflated performance numbers. Frame Generation and Multi-Frame Generation are tools in a toolbox—there will be games where they make things look great and run fast with minimal noticeable impact to visual quality or responsiveness, games where those impacts are more noticeable, and games that never add support for the features at all. (As well-supported as DLSS generally is in new releases, it&nbsp;<em>is</em> incumbent upon game developers to add it—and update it when Nvidia puts out a new version.)</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>But using those Multi-Frame Generation-inflated FPS numbers to make topline comparisons to last-generation graphics cards just feels disingenuous. No, an RTX 5070 will not be as fast as an RTX 4090 for just $549, because not all games support DLSS MFG, and not all games that&nbsp;<em>do</em> support it will run it well. Frame Generation still needs a good base frame rate to start with, and the slower your card is, the more issues you might notice.</p>
<p>Fuzzy marketing aside, Nvidia is still the undisputed leader in the GPU market, and the RTX 5090 extends that leadership for what will likely be another entire GPU generation, since both <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/new-radeon-rx-9000-gpus-promise-to-fix-two-of-amds-biggest-weaknesses/">AMD</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/review-intel-arc-b580-is-a-compelling-if-incredibly-tardy-250-midrange-gpu/">Intel</a> are focusing their efforts on higher-volume, lower-cost cards right now. DLSS is still generally better than AMD's FSR, and Nvidia does a good job of getting developers of new AAA game releases to support it. And if you're buying this GPU to do some kind of rendering work or generative AI acceleration, Nvidia's performance and software tools are still superior. The misleading performance claims are frustrating, but Nvidia still gains a lot of real advantages from being as dominant and entrenched as it is.</p>
<h3>The good</h3>
<ul>
<li>Usually 30-something percent faster than an RTX 4090</li>
<li>Redesigned Founders Edition card is less unwieldy than the bricks that were the 4090/4080 design</li>
<li>Adequate cooling, despite the smaller card and higher power use</li>
<li>DLSS Multi-Frame Generation is an intriguing option if you're trying to hit 240 or 360 fps on your high-refresh-rate gaming monitor</li>
</ul>
<h3>The bad</h3>
<ul>
<li>Much higher power consumption than the 4090, which already consumed more power than any other GPU on the market</li>
<li>Frame Generation is good at making a game that's running fast run faster, it's not as good for bringing a slow game up to 60 Hz</li>
<li>Nvidia's misleading marketing around Multi-Frame Generation is frustrating—and will likely be <em>more</em> frustrating for lower-end cards since they aren't getting the same bumps to core count and memory interface that the 5090 gets</li>
</ul>
<h3>The ugly</h3>
<ul>
<li>You can buy a whole lot of PC for $2,000, and we wouldn't bet on this GPU being easy to find at MSRP</li>
</ul>

However, seeing a Glaceon Tera ex deck in action would be very entertaining.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Eevee Elite Trainer Box Promo 173</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/24/pcmag-shopping-cards-10-1737718374095.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: The Pokémon Company International / Christian Wait</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Thanks to its stunning full artwork, this one will likely be in trainers' binders rather than their decks. It's still the standard Eevee card in this set, allowing trainers to evolve it as soon as it's played. It certainly makes playing an Eeveelution deck a lot easier.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Mela Trainer SAR 140/131</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/24/pcmag-shopping-cards-11-1737718394762.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: The Pokémon Company International / Christian Wait</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Mela is a powerful trainer card that can be used at the right time. Trainers can grab a fire energy from their discard pile whilst topping up their hand with 6 cards, which would come in handy mid to late game. Again, this is one for a trainer binder, with the usual Mela trainer card being fairly easy to pull.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Pikachu ex 028/131</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/24/pcmag-shopping-cards-12-1737718521837.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: The Pokémon Company International / Christian Wait</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Prismatic Evolutions also addresses Surging Sparks FOMO with Pikachu ex, although it's not a Tera ex. Thanks to Thunder, it's a relatively straightforward basic ex, with the possibility of one-hit knockouts in three turns. It's a high energy cost, but it's a lovely card to build up from the bench to switch in and out, thanks to its one energy retreat cost.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Max Rod Ace Spec 116/131</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/24/pcmag-shopping-cards-13-1737718545967.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: The Pokémon Company International / Christian Wait</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This card can literally flip a battle on its head. Imagine having Tyranitar's ex knocked out alongside its four energy cards, then using this Max Rod to get it all back and start building it again from the bench. Probably one of the most useful Ace Specs cards we've seen.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Espeon ex 034/131</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/24/pcmag-shopping-cards-14-1737718572842.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: The Pokémon Company International / Christian Wait</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Espeon ex decks are going to be very hard to combat thanks to their ability to both discard from an opponent's hand and de-evolve all opposing Pokémon, shuffling the evolution cards into their deck. This one card can drag a battle out and whittle down opponents, so imagine a deck built around four of them. Insane.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Tyranitar ex 064/131</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/24/pcmag-shopping-cards-15-1737718597512.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: The Pokémon Company International / Christian Wait</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">At first glance, Grind makes Tyranitar ex very playable. But it's a different story when I consider it a second-stage evolution with a minimum of three energy cards attached to stretch its legs. I love Tyranitar, but this ex-card ain't it, chief. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">My Favorite Prismatic Evolution Cards</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a given that we all want the Eeveelution SIR cards from Prismatic Evolutions. Still, some seriously cool overlooked artwork in this expansion might be worth snapping up if you see a bargain.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Dragapult ex SAR 165/131</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/24/pcmag-shopping-cards-16-1737719041103.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Dragapult ex SAR 165/131 is one of my favorite artworks from this set, and I'm very tempted to build a deck around Phantom Dive. Two energy costscosts for a combined 260 damage, 60 of which can be spread on your opponent'sopponent's bench. It's an insane move; watch for this card creeping up in value just because trainers want it in their deck.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Roaring Moon ex SIR 162/131</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/24/pcmag-shopping-cards-17-1737719796337.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: The Pokémon Company International / Christian Wait</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Another heavy hitter with Roaring Moon ex-SIR with stunning artwork. A triple hit energy spend for its attacks is brutal, but this basic Pokémon card could be the final push in a tight battle. Loading a deck up with Stadium cards and building support around Roaring Moon ex sounds like a fun deck to build, that's for sure.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Umbreon ex SIR 161/131</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/24/pcmag-shopping-cards-18-1737720000986.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: The Pokémon Company International / Christian Wait</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, ​I doubt anyone will use an $1200+ Umbreon ex SIR in their decks, but if you take a look at that mental moveset, you'd surely be tempted. Like Roaring Moon ex, this card has the chance of flipping a Pokémon TCG battle on its head in the 11th hour with both of its moves. Yes, it needs three different energy types. Still, there's some fun to be had building out an Eeveelution deck around Umbreon ex.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, with all things considered, is Prismatic Evolutions worth the hype? In short yes. There are plenty of awesome cards to add to your binder and more playable cards. Still, you'll be waiting for stock to appear without brilliant timing. Eeveelution-based sets will always be cool, but the chances of pulling one of the elusive Eeveelution SIRs is 1 in 900 booster packs. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also the addition of God packs and Master Ball cards, which is very cool. Imagine pulling every SIR in one booster pack? The problem is it's very unlikely to happen, so strap in and get ripping packs and boxes.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where to Buy Pokémon TCG: Prismatic Evolutions in 2025</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Stock has been hard to come by for Pokémon TCG: Prismatic Evolutions, and things are only now starting to even out a little. Pokémon is at the height of popularity again, between TCG Pocket, investors buying up stock, and general increased demand for sets such as Surging Sparks, it's a crazy time to get into the hobby. With <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-company-breaks-silence-on-prismatic-evolution-shortage">The Pokémon Company's efforts to restock shelves ASAP</a>, Prismatic Evolutions also represent a turning point of going online or in-store to buy stock instead of resorting to the questionable secondary market. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Prismatic Evolutions collection offers a range of products for collectors and players, each celebrating the beloved Eeveelutions. At the top, the Elite Trainer Box provides nine booster packs, an exclusive full-art Eevee promo, and useful extras like sleeves, dice, and condition markers—ideal for anyone building their collection or deck.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For a simpler option, the Surprise Box includes a few booster packs and a random Eeveelution ex promo with a Prismatic Evolutions stamp, offering an affordable way to dip into the set. Similarly, the Mini Tin is a compact choice with two booster packs, a collectible Eevee coin, and an art card, doubling as a neat storage solution.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Collectors will appreciate the Binder Collection, which pairs four booster packs with a sturdy Eevee-themed binder for organizing prized cards like Master Ball foils or Special Illustration Rares. The Tech Sticker Collection adds a playful touch with Eevee stickers and two booster packs, perfect for younger fans or casual fun.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lastly, the Poster Collection combines display-worthy content with collectibility, featuring three booster packs, a fold-out Eevee poster, and exclusive holo promos of Vaporeon, Jolteon, and Flareon. Each product highlights the magic of the Prismatic Evolutions set, offering something for every kind of Pokémon fan, whether you're chasing rare cards, organizing your collection, or simply enjoying the Eevee hype.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.
