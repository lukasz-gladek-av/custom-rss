The page says Xbox’s account and profile services are experiencing a “major outage.”</p><p>“You may not be able to sign-in to your Xbox profile, may be disconnected while signed in, or have other related problems,” the update says. “Features that require sign-in like most games, apps and social activity won’t be available.” </p><p>Issues with Xbox Live seemed to have started around 2PM ET, with <a href="https://downdetector.com/status/xbox-live/">Downdetector reports</a> beginning to rise around that time. There’s still no indication when Xbox could restore service. At around 4:10PM ET, <a href="https://x.com/XboxSupport/status/1808231362702254404">Xbox said</a> its investigation is “taking longer than expected.” <em>The Verge </em>reached out to Microsoft with a request for more information but didn’t immediately hear back.</p><p><em><strong>Update, July 2nd: </strong>Added an update from Xbox.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/15/22979436/elden-ring-speedrunners-world-record-race-30-minutes">speedrunners and content creators have found the best / most busted builds</a>, while the developers haven’t had the time to nerf them yet. People post all kinds of wild videos of bosses melting within seconds, going down so fast they don’t even have time to trigger their second or third phases. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/17/22982776/elden-ring-patch-notes-hoarfrost-stomp-mimic-tear-ashes-nerf">It happened in vanilla <em>Elden Ring</em> with Hoarfrost Stomp</a>, and it’s happening again with <em>Erdtree</em>’s perfume bottles.</p></div><div><figcaption>Erdtree<em>’s lightning perfume bottle weapon in action.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: FromSoftware</cite></p></div><p>I’m typically not one to go after gimmicky builds. I like how I’ve built my character — using a mix of glintstone sorceries, dragon incantations, and melee weapons whose attack power scales with my high intelligence. Such a build was good enough to get me through the base game, so it <em>should</em> be good enough to get me through the DLC. But it’s not, or at least not enough for my patience level. And herein lies some of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24183692/hidetaka-miyazaki-interview-shadow-of-the-erdtree-difficulty">the problem with <em>Erdtree</em>’s difficulty</a>.</p><p>In the base game, bosses were resistant to certain attacks and weak to others, but nothing so much that they couldn’t be beaten no matter what your build was. Rennala didn’t phase me even though she was highly resistant to magic damage; I could still smack her to death with my sword instead of my staff. But it doesn’t feel like that same philosophy has carried over to <em>Erdtree</em>. In the expansion, some bosses feel like they’ve been overtuned to resist certain builds no matter what, forcing players to either completely respec or keep throwing themselves at the boss in hopes of a lucky break. That’s what happened with me and Rellana, Twin Moon Knight. </p><p>She, like her similarly named counterpart from the base game, has a high magic defense. But she’s <em>also</em> resistant to slashing damage, which completely shuts down both my main sources of damage and, in turn, totally negates the way I’ve chosen to play. For a game like <em>Elden Ring</em> — with all of its classes, weapons, spells, and equipment to choose from — every build should be viable when combined with learning the patterns of a boss. I’d feel totally different if, while trying to take her down, I felt I was still making progress against her. But even with a fair number of upgrades to my attack power and finding a combination of weapons and spells that <em>should</em> have worked against her resistances, I still could barely put a dent in her health bar.</p><p>Enough.</p><p>I’d heard that the perfume bottles were broken in <em>Erdtree</em>. I even had one in my inventory after making my way through one of the harrowing gaol dungeons that has some unfortunate implications for our dear pot warrior friend Iron Fist Alexander. So I gave it a shot, figuring I’d use it for this one boss and respec back to my original build.</p><p>I picked up the lightning perfume bottle and the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ash+of+War:+Rolling+Sparks">Rolling Sparks Ash of War</a> and changed my stats to fit them just like I had seen in videos. For a test run, I snuck up on one of those huge armored knights with the big shields and massive hammers — enemies I just run from because, like most elite enemies in <em>Erdtree</em>, they’re too deadly for the scant rewards you earn from killing them. I aimed at his feet, unleashed Rolling Sparks, and... it was like the finger of god reached into the game’s code and hit “delete” on this guy. He just disappeared. Here’s what that looks like in action.</p><p>With my trial successful, it was time for the real test: Rellana. </p><p>Needless to say, it worked.</p><p>I can’t go back now. I don’t <em>want</em> to go back. Having this kind of power at my disposal has completely changed my approach to <em>Erdtree</em>. I do <em>not</em> have to slink around, fearful of every dark corner, or run past anything larger than an electric sheep. </p><p>But I’m not totally fearless. A good sneak attack or recklessness with a boss will take me out. I’m also not all-powerful. I still tend to avoid the uterus monsters and the big flame golems — I don’t want the smoke, you see. The build is also very temperamental. To do the kind of face-melting numbers seen in videos, I can’t lock on in order to aim at my opponent’s feet while praying they don’t move too much. Even though this build is pure grade-A uncut cheese, I don’t feel like I’m cheating. (Besides, according to game director Hidetaka Miyazaki, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/miyazaki-says-finishing-his-elden-ring-playthrough-was-difficult-i-absolutely-suck-at-video-games/1100-6524564/">I’m supposed to use everything at my disposal anyway</a>.) I still have to play <em>Erdtree</em> with the same healthy respect for strategy and my enemies that I did in the base game.</p><p>I know this won’t last. Just like with Hoarfrost Stomp, I’m reasonably assured the perfume build will be depowered to the point of uselessness and I will have to return to my original build.</p><p>But for now, I am deeply enjoying being a walking tactical nuke who smells <em>amazing.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That’s no small backup, and it can stretch the battery life of your console considerably—an extra eight hours or 1.6 full charges. You’re not limited to just juicing up your Switch, as it also works as a portable charger to top up your phone or tablet.</p><p>This battery case is rocking some handy extras, like a kickstand in the back to use your Switch in tabletop mode, and a slot behind that kickstand is ready to stow two game cartridges. It also offers an 18W PD, ensuring your Switch’s fully drained battery is back to full in under 2 hours. There’s even a smart chipset to help protect your device against overvoltage and short-circuiting, while cutouts and air vents on the case prevent overheating. </p><h2 id="newderybatterycharger">2. NEWDERY Battery Charger Case for Nintendo Switch Lite</h2><h3>Best Nintendo Switch Lite Battery Case</h3><div id="195743" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>NEWDERY Battery Charger Case</h3></p><div><p>Grab this Switch Lite Battery case and slot the console directly into it for up to 10 hours of extended playtime and additional USB-A to charge another device. </p></div></div><div><p>Size</p><p>10.47 x 4.45 x 1.71 inches</p></div><div><p>Includes additional ports to charge other devices</p></div><p>The <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/09/26/nintendo-switch-lite-review"><u>Nintendo Switch Lite</u></a> is more compact and lacks detachable joy-cons like the other Switch models, which means you’ll want to grab the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-lite-accessories"><u>best Switch Lite accessories</u></a> to fit its smaller dimensions. So, if you’re looking for a battery case to keep your Switch Lite topped up for long commutes or travel days, the NEWDERY Battery Charger Case for Nintendo Switch Lite is the perfect partner. In fact, it’s from the same company as our top pick. </p><p>This option integrates a battery and USB-C into a lightweight, ergonomic case for your Switch Lite. You’ll enjoy an additional 10 hours of playtime on your console thanks to the 10,400mAh battery that can handle speeds up to 18W. There’s even an additional USB-A output to charge another device, while it’s possible to charge both the Switch Lite and the battery case simultaneously. Battery levels can be monitored using LED indicators and multiple vents help prevent overheating. Adding the NEWDERY Battery Charger Case’s greatness is a kickstand and storage for one game card. </p><h2 id="nykopowerpak">3. Nyko Power Pak</h2><h3>Best Slim Nintendo Switch Battery Case</h3><div id="142491" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Nyko Power Pak</h3></p><div><p>Keep your Switch topped up with this slim, lightweight battery case offering 5,000mAh of juice without covering up the Joy-Cons or blocking any ports and vents. </p></div></div><div><p>Size</p><p>5.12 x 1.97 x 7.28 inches</p></div><div><p>Attaches to Switch without covering ports or vents</p></div><p>Love everything about playing your Nintendo Switch on the go but just wish it could last a little bit longer? Then you'll want the Nyko Power Pak. This battery case will let you keep playing with your Switch virtually unaltered. It doesn't cover up the Joy-con, doesn't block any ports or vents, and it only adds a half-pound onto the device. It does cover the Switch's built-in kickstand, but it makes up for that with a kickstand of its own.</p><p>Once you have the Nyko Power Pak strapped onto your Switch, you'll get an extra 5,000mAh of battery capacity for all your mobile gaming needs. Nyko suggests that this can almost double the battery life of your Switch, letting you really grind out the levels when you're nowhere near a power outlet. When you need to charge up the Nyko Power Pack, you can do so with the same USB-C cable you'd use to charge your Switch outside of the dock. That all makes for a pretty strong product, especially given it costs just about $20.</p><h2 id="bionikpowercommuter">4. Bionik Power Commuter</h2><h3>Best Nintendo Switch Carrying Case With a Battery</h3><div id="142493" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Bionik Power Commuter</h3></p><div><p>A roomy Switch carrying case with multiple pouches and built-in organizers that even includes a handy 10,000mAh battery bank. </p></div></div><div><p>Size</p><p>11.8 x 6.5 x 3.2 inches</p></div><div><div><div><p>Extra storage for accessories</p></div><div><p>Well-padded for extra protection</p></div></div><div><p>Carrying handle isn't convenient </p></div></div><p>You can get one of the best Nintendo Switch cases and an on-the-go battery pack for your Nintendo Switch all in one with the Bionik Power Commuter. This carrying case is designed to fit your Switch and a handy assortment of extras safely inside while providing a 10,000mAh battery pack to charge up your console (or your phone for that matter) between play sessions when you’re on the move and can’t get to a wall outlet.</p><p>The case has a main pouch for the Switch to slot into, and there’s a second compartment for accessories. You can store a bunch of game cartridges in a built-in organizer, and there’s a pocket to hold extra Joy-Con. The case itself is padded and uses water-resistant YKK zippers, helping keep all your gear safe. There’s a simple carrying handle on the case, but it can also attach to the straps of a backpack or sling, or you can attach the included shoulder strap for hands-free transport.</p><h2 id="ankerpowercore">5. Anker PowerCore 10000 PD Redux</h2><h3>Best Nintendo Switch Power Bank</h3><div id="142494" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Anker PowerCore 10000 PD Redux</h3></p><div><p>Universal power bank offering a USB-A and USB-C port along with 10,000mAh of juice capable of 25W charging speeds. </p></div></div><div><p>Size</p><p>4.22 x 2.06 x 1.07 inches</p></div><div><div><p>Simultaneously charges two devices</p></div><div><p>Provides no extra protection to the Switch</p></div></div><p>Power banks made specifically for the Nintendo Switch can be handy for their ability to attach and almost integrate with the portable console, but they may lack some of the flexibility and capacity (and often the price) of more universal power banks. Anker's PowerCore 10000 PD Redux is an example of how much you can get for a good price.</p><p>This power bank offers 10,000mAh of juice, and it can pump that out at up to 25W, letting you keep charging your Nintendo Switch even as you play. The battery pack has both a USB-A port and a USB-C port, so you can charge your Nintendo Switch and a secondary device (maybe your Pro Controller) at the same time. That USB-C port also handles recharging the power bank, which you can do with the very charger that your Nintendo Switch came with. Anker even includes the USB-C cable needed to make the most out of this power bank with your Nintendo Switch.</p><h2 id="emperorofgadgets">6. Emperor of Gadgets Portable Power Bank</h2><h3>Best Attachable Battery for Nintendo Switch</h3><div id="195733" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Emperor of Gadgets Portable Power Bank</h3></p><div><p>Top off your Switch with a 10,000mAh portable battery that straps onto it while offering a built-in USB-C and additional ports to charge other devices. </p></div></div><div><div><p>Additional ports for charging other devices</p></div><div><p>Adds a little bulk to Switch</p></div></div><p>The Emperor of Gadgets Portable Power Bank is a simple yet effective solution to extend your Nintendo Switch's battery life. This option is rather unique, as it actually straps onto the backside of your Switch, adding a slight amount of bulk and weight to the device. But you’ll still have an enjoyable playing experience while your portable console juices up. </p><p>The 10,000mAh should significantly extend your gaming time, and it can pump out 15W of power, keeping your Switch topped up even when it's running demanding games. A built-in USB-C cable makes it easy to plug into your Switch without any cable management or needing to remember a cable in the first place. There also are USB-A and USB-C ports on the power bank, so you can charge other devices without unplugging the Switch. Plus, short circuit and overvoltage protection ensure everything is done safely. </p><h2 id="nykoboostpak">7. Nyko Boost Pak</h2><h3>Best Compact Nintendo Switch Battery Pack</h3><div id="142489" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Nyko Boost Pak</h3></p><div><p>Add only 55g of extra weight to your Switch with the ultra-slim Nyko Boost Pak, which attaches directly to your console’s USB-C and delivers 2,500mAh of power. </p></div></div><div><p>Size</p><p>7.5 x 3.4 x 1.7 inches</p></div><div><p>Ultralight and compact build</p></div><p>If you like the idea of having a little extra battery pack that can attach to your Nintendo Switch but don't see yourself needing something that adds a ton of extra power at the cost of taking up space, then the Nyko Boost Pak will be right up your alley. This slim unit latches onto the bottom of the Nintendo Switch, connecting right into the USB-C port and adding virtually no thickness (though it will make your Switch a bit taller). It's actually slim enough that you can keep it attached even when docking the Switch. And, when you're on the go, it only weighs 55 grams, so you'll hardly notice it.</p><p>The Nyko Boost Pak adds on a modest but useful 2,500mAh of battery power. And, rather than just always running when it's attached, the Boost Pak has a power switch, so you can decide when it kicks into gear. Perhaps best of all, this is one of the cheapest Nintendo Switch accessories you'll find. The unit costs less than $20.</p><h2>What to Look For in a Switch Battery Case</h2><p>There are a couple of things to keep in mind before pulling the trigger on a battery case for your Switch. First, the original Switch’s internal battery is 4,310mAh and typically lasts about three hours when undocked (depending on the game). The new Switch lasts a bit longer between four to five hours in our experience, though Nintendo has yet to reveal the exact capacity of the larger battery.</p><p>Most of the packs I found are around 10,000mAh, so nearly all of them promise to double the life of your Switch, but that won't always be the case.</p><p>There are a lot of factors that go into the efficiency of an external battery pack, so don’t be disappointed if that 10,000mAh battery doesn’t triple your Switch’s battery life. With that said, all of them will still provide quite a boost.</p><h2>Nintendo Switch Battery Case FAQ</h2><h3>How Long Does the Nintendo Switch Battery Last?</h3><p>The battery life of a Nintendo Switch can vary based on the demands of specific applications and features being used. <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Support/Nintendo-Switch/How-Long-Does-the-Battery-Charge-Last-1630015.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Nintendo</a>, users of the most recent Nintendo Switch consoles (both standard and OLED) can expect 4.5-9 hours of battery life, while Switch Lite devices can last anywhere from 3-7 hours. As seen above, however, these projected times are pretty optimistic, so it’s not hard for any of the battery cases on this list to double your Switch’s lifespan. </p><p>The Switch’s <a href="https://electronics.howstuffworks.com/everyday-tech/lithium-ion-battery.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lithium-ion battery</a> will also inevitably degrade over time. One general way to keep your Switch battery as healthy as possible is to ensure your device stays charged. Try to avoid letting your device die, and, if possible, plug it in when it gets to or below 20%. </p><h3>Do I Need a Battery Case for the Nintendo Switch?</h3><p>Nintendo recognized that the original Switch had a pretty grim battery life, which is why the newer model <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/nintendo-switch/Nintendo_Switch_Longer_Battery_Release_Date_and_Model_Details">nearly doubled it</a>. Still, many players continue to find that low battery notification interrupting their gaming sessions. </p><p>Switch players who stick to using the TV display and keep their system docked most of the time will have little use for portable charging. However, Switch Lite users or gamers on the go could certainly benefit from the extended playtime that comes with battery cases. If you have upcoming travel plans and want to make sure your beloved Switch goes the distance, it could also be worth making the investment.  </p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Check out the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-game-deals">best game deals</a></li></ul><p><em>Danielle Abraham is a freelance writer and unpaid music historian.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

In my limited experience, it was always too laggy, made the games look ugly as shit, and needed far too potent a signal to work even passably well. However, I went away this past weekend and didn’t want to lug around either of my consoles, so I gave it an earnest shot again and I must say, I’m <em>pleasantly </em>surprised with how far cloud and remote gaming’s come.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196181" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="180" data-playlist="196181,196230,196923" data-current="196181"><div><p>The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21718.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>My biggest motivating factor for giving these alternatives another shot is that I simply did not want to be away from my PS5, which has <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/elden-ring&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/elden-ring"><em>Elden Ring</em></a></span><em>:</em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-expansion-review-1851545505&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-expansion-review-1851545505"><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a></span> currently installed on it. Despite starting the DLC prior to my trip, my attention’s been pulled in a million different directions and I’ve not been able to commit the time I wish I could give it. So I made it a point this weekend to try out my PS5’s Remote Play from my gaming laptop, dig into the DLC as much as I could, and test the bounds of the tech.</p><h2 id="h10415"><a id=""></a>Remote and cloud gaming has come a long way</h2><p>The last time I tried Remote Play—which doesn’t use the cloud since your games must be installed on your PlayStation console—was back in 2020. I tried playing <em>Persona 5</em> from the comfort of my own bed just a room over from my console and router and it was awful. Around the same time, the tech allowing you to stream games was beginning to take off, and my experience with it was pretty similar. Whenever the streams did manage to stay up for a bit longer than usual—since I was forcibly disconnected pretty quickly—screen tearing made it an illegible mess. “Surely,” I thought, “if my decent internet can’t even handle this, it’s got to be a mess for most everyone else,” and I never bothered touching either function again.</p><p>This time around, I had a much smoother experience, though it wasn’t without some predictable hiccups. At first, my laptop struggled to find my PS5 back home, which it searched for via the internet. Thankfully, my roommate helped me by turning my console on and off and ensuring it was on rest mode so that I could finally connect. When I finally managed to establish a connection, my video stream almost immediately froze, though I could still hear my inputs being acknowledged. After a few restarts, I learned I couldn’t really idle for fear of my stream immediately freezing again, meaning I had to twiddle the thumbsticks rather than stay put. It was a small but annoying price to pay in order to keep playing, and I sucked it up because I really wanted to get through the <em>Elden Ring</em> DLC.</p><p>Once the issues (mostly) cleared up though, it was kind of stunning how well Remote Play worked. I managed to make quite a bit of progress in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-expansion-review-1851545505&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-expansion-review-1851545505"><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a></span>, clearing the entirety of a dungeon and even defeating the Divine Beast Dancing Lion in two tries. There was no significant input lag, and after I solved the freezing issue, it rarely disconnected. I think I was able to put most of, if not more than, an hour into the expansion with a few stutters, but no major disconnections or freezes. The game <em>did </em>seem to get overwhelmed by two agile enemies who rushed me just outside a boss arena and crashed my Remote Play session, but they were the exception in what eventually became a pretty smooth experience. I was genuinely impressed by how well it eventually held up, even if the biggest issue appears to be that Remote Play struggles maintaining a stable connection for long periods of time.</p><p>By comparison, XCloud—Microsoft’s entirely cloud-driven gaming experience that allows you to stream whole games without installation—was a surprisingly more stable experience due to built-in compensations. While <em>Elden Ring </em>remained a mostly gorgeous game streaming from my PS5 (since it was installed), games like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/another-crabs-treasure-review-1851435745&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/another-crabs-treasure-review-1851435745"><em>Another Crab’s Treasure</em></a></span><em> </em>and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fallout-76-show-impressions-good-in-2024-updates-1851428848&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-76-show-impressions-good-in-2024-updates-1851428848"><em>Fallout 76</em></a></span><em>,</em> which weren’t downloaded to my Xbox,<em> </em>appeared much more washed out on stream.The tradeoff, however, was that they ran fuckton better and my cloud session never crashed or froze. When I first tested the capabilities of XCloud at home, where my internet connection is strained between me and my roommates’ countless devices, it seemed to barely hold up, and there was significant screen tearing every few seconds. On my parents’ much less populated connection, it worked like a charm, even if the games kind of looked ugly as sin.</p><p>Though neither experience was without its blemishes, I was able to get in, play my games, and get out, and that’s about all I could ask for. My time with Remote Play was leagues better than the experience I had years ago, and despite my hang ups, I have to admit that XCloud earnestly impressed me. I’m actually stoked to see how it continues to develop now. Anything to not have to carry around those ugly (and heavy) ass boxes anywhere anymore. Congratulations, y’all have made a convert out of me.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>GMs (Game Masters) are always taking inspiration from other media to implement new ideas into their world, and it looks like Wizards of the Coast is no different, because Larian Studios<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baldurs-gate-3/"> Baldur's Gate 3</a> has directly influenced how certain mechanics now work in Dungeons &amp; Dragons.</p><p dir="ltr">The news comes from the<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0rXo-Wp_II&amp;t=7s"> official Dungeons &amp; Dragons YouTube channel</a> (via<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dungeons-dragons-rules-update-includes-changes-prompted-by-games-lead-designer-playing-baldurs-gate-3" rel="nofollow "> Eurogamer</a>), where D&amp;D developers explain the 2024 Player's Handbook. Lead designer Jeremy Crawford says his time with Baldur's Gate 3 played a huge part in changing the rules for a few spells, including Cloud of Daggers and Produce Flame.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0rXo-Wp_II" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="7">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/P0rXo-Wp_II?start=7" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Now, whenever a spell caster uses Cloud of Daggers, they can move it around the battlefield to ensure it inflicts as much damage as possible. Crawford had wanted to do this for some time, but Baldur's Gate 3 was the final nail in the coffin that made him pull the trigger on changing the rule.</p><p dir="ltr">"Some spells that were really painful to cast in terms of their action economy are far less painful," Crawford said. "An example of that is Produce Flame, the Druid cantrip.</p><p dir="ltr">"That cantrip was really painful to set up--once you got it going, it could be fun to hurl the fire, [but] now it's way easy to cast it. And that is, funnily enough, another one where it was not only a pain to cast in the tabletop game, but when I was playing Baldur's Gate 3 [it] was excruciating. And it was while playing Baldur's Gate 3 I thought 'We are going to redesign Produce Flame so there will not be as much friction to cast this cantrip.'"</p><p>Just recently, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-youtuber-offers-500-to-players-who-can-find-secret-fourth-wall-scene/1100-6524518/">YouTube offered $500 to anyone who can find the secret fourth-wall scene in Baldur's Gate 3</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-is-getting-an-official-modding-toolkit-in-upcoming-patch-7/1100-6523885/">Larian Studios announced that Baldur's Gate 3 will be getting an official modding toolkit in the upcoming patch</a>.</p>

  <p id="gkidDD">Many boardgames in the party game genre like to test the players knowledge with trivia or social deduction. It’s all in good fun, but there are objectively correct answers. That immediately makes <em>Hues and Cues </em>a different experience, because this game is all about the subjective task of describing a color.</p>
<p id="SDNBJp">What specific shade of yellow is a school bus? Does oat milk have a particular color? Which is the more royal hue: Blue or purple? These are the sorts of questions you’ll be contending with in <em>Hues and Cues</em>, which we played in the latest episode of Overboard with special guests <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1516586&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flinktr.ee%2Flubchansky&amp;referrer=polygon.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.polygon.com%2Ftabletop-games%2F2024%2F7%2F2%2F24189959%2Foverboard-hues-and-cues-color-guessing-mattie-lubchanksy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://go.redirectingat.com?xcust=___pl__p_23954000__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026id=66960X1516586\u0026xs=1\u0026url=https://linktr.ee/lubchansky\u0026referrer=polygon.com\u0026sref=https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/2024/7/2/24189959/overboard-hues-and-cues-color-guessing-mattie-lubchanksy&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:50,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;xcust&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;xcust&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23954000__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;66960X1516586&quot;,&quot;xs&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://linktr.ee/lubchansky&quot;,&quot;referrer&quot;:&quot;polygon.com&quot;,&quot;sref&quot;:&quot;https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/2024/7/2/24189959/overboard-hues-and-cues-color-guessing-mattie-lubchanksy&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">Mattie Lubchansky</a> and <a href="https://www.eater.com/authors/jaya-saxena">Jaya Saxena</a>.</p>
<p id="B96Kic">In <em>Hues and Cues</em>, the cue giver selects a color from four choices on a card before giving their first cue. There are only a few rules that the cue giver must follow: The cue must be one word, and it can’t include a basic color, like red or green, though fancy colors like vermillion and chartreuse are legal. They also can’t use a specific object in the room, a cue that’s already been used, or a letter or number that could point to its location on the board.</p>
<p id="Gyaqdw">Once every player has made a color selection in clockwise order, the cue giver can give a second cue. This time it can be two words, but they must avoid using words that directly indicate it’s position relative to the player’s guesses, like “darker” or “south.” After all the players have made their second guess (this time in counter-clockwise order), the cue giver places the score box around their hue.</p>
<p id="syOhPe">Points are awarded based on how close players get to the correct hue, while the cue giver gets points for every guess inside the score box. After every player has been cue giver twice, the game ends and the player with the highest score wins. The game can be made easier for beginning players by letting cue givers select their color from the entire board, or harder by limiting the cues to specific categories like comic book characters or Pokémon. Either way, it’s an immensely fun party game that’s sure to provoke strange discussion about just what colors even are.</p>

Features like the hundreds of character customization sliders and pronoun options separate from your character’s gender live up to game director Corinne Busche’s promise that Dragon Age: The Veilguard was created with inclusivity in mind. This desire was carried over into the difficulty options too, which include standard choices like the story-focused Storyteller path, a balanced Adventurer mode, or the more crushing Nightmare mode, which can’t be changed once a playthrough is started.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/11/the-veilguard-1718088314067.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Dragon Age: The Veilguard will have a host of difficulty options.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Where BioWare’s latest gets interesting in this regard is its Unbound difficulty mode. This option is said to allow players to tailor their Dragon Age: The Veilguard adventure as they please with a variety of tweakable settings. Some highlights include the ability to adjust how wayfinding guides the experience, aim assistance, an auto-aim option, and wider (or narrower) parry windows. Enemy and player damage can also be finetuned, as can enemy pressure, but the real game-changer might be the option to turn off death for your character entirely. These are all options meant to make Dragon Age: The Veilguard more inviting for every kind of gaming fan.</p><p>"[None of these options] are a cheat," Busche explained. "It's an option to make sure players of all abilities can show up."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Game Informer was unable to view every difficulty and accessibility setting BioWare will offer, but Busche says players can expect to find more options upon launch. Dragon Age: The Veilguard is currently set to come to PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X | S sometime this fall.

            <p>
Somehow I'd missed hit horror movie franchise A Quiet Place was getting a video game adaptation (it turns out I'm just <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead-revealed-for-pc-and-consoles">deeply inattentive</a>), but barely a month after its re-reveal, a fresh look at its alien-evading action has come our way - and it definitely shows potential, assuming you've got the constitution for a game of near-silent sneakery and one-wrong-move tension.
</p>
<p>
A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead was actually <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-quiet-place-is-a-new-single-player-story-driven-horror-game-based-on-the-film">announced back in October 2021</a> before (appropriately) going silent for a while, and is the work of Stormind Games - the studio behind 2018's surprisingly effective Clock-Tower-inspired pursuit horror Remothered: Tormented Fathers. It doesn't have a release yet, but it's currently expected to launch this year.
</p>
<p>
Unfolding across an "eerily tranquil, post-apocalyptic landscape", A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead casts players as Alex, an asthmatic college student trying to survive the end of the world with her boyfriend Martin. She'll face "interpersonal family conflicts, all while coming to terms with her own inner fears" - as well as lots of silently insistent pointing, judging by the new trailer.

<p>
In gameplay terms, The Road Ahead is a first-person stealth-horror requiring players to minimise the noise they're making as they attempt to evade their sonically sensitive pursuers. There's also a shotgun and a car chase in there, so it clearly won't <em>all</em> be irritated shushing.
</p>
<p>
A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead doesn't have a release date yet, but it'll be available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2233120/A_Quiet_Place_The_Road_Ahead/">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10009366">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead/9NZLPG7P5KSS">Xbox Series X/S</a> when it eventually shows up.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24190812/skaven-age-of-sigmar-army-warhammer-40k-addition<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="8AL3Fe"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/warhammer-40k"><em>Warhammer 40,000</em></a> is stuffed to the brim with bad guys; nearly every faction racks up atrocities on the daily. There’s the protagonist faction, the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24113824/warhammer-40k-god-emperor-lore-dark-king-star-child-godblight">Imperium of Man</a>, which is quite literally the most brutal and inhumane regime possible. The <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/3/6/18253801/warhammer-40k-chaos-space-marines-abaddon-sisters-of-battle-new-models">Chaos Space Marines</a> are engaged in a 10,000-year-long war, using the powers of the dark gods to fuel their armies. And, of course, there’s the stupid, sexy <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23801775/warhammer-40k-drukhari-faction-lore-dark-eldar-xenos-fun">Dark Eldar</a> who torture and pillage their way through the galaxy. But there’s one specific kind of bad guy that’s missing from the setting, and a recent <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24161719/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-launch-box-reveal-preview-weekend-40k-aos-sisters-of-battle"><em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em></a> release throws that into stark relief: I demand that Games Workshop add Skaven to 40K, you <em>cowards</em>.</p>
<p id="ejqSdd">The Skaven are a longtime presence in the Warhammer fantasy settings, including <em>Age of Sigmar</em>, an alternative fantasy setting introduced in 2015. <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/2024/05/17/skaventide-is-the-jam-packed-launch-box-for-the-new-edition-of-warhammer-age-of-sigmar/">The new <em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em> <em>Skaventide</em> box set</a> — which went up for pre-order on June 29 — pits the Skaven, a ravenous horde of rat men who are scratching at every door and every dimension in hopes of finding something to feast upon, against the noble Stormcast Eternals. <em>Age of Sigmar</em> has some great villains, like the father of necromancy and all-time hater Nagash, but few are as beloved as the Skaven. They’re even the antagonist in the popular Vermintide games developed by Fatshark. You can’t truly escape the Skaven, and the only saving grace is that they’re so busy fighting each other that they sometimes forget about their mission of total annihilation.</p>
<div id="85ipIe"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5ZSiQ8lG0fs?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="RKmcJz">The Skaven are bipedal critters who swarm en masse, which is obviously dangerous in and of itself, but the fact that they have a decent grasp on technology just makes matters worse. In the original <em>Warhammer Fantasy Battles</em>, the human empires largely denied the existence of Skaven. (There are no rats living in Altdorf, waiting to rise up and overthrow humanity. That’s <em>ridiculous</em>; you must be just seeing things. Do not ask any more questions about the giant rats whomst walk like men.) They worship a Chaos entity called the Great Horned Rat, who is not a literal rat, but the metaphysical manifestation of all things ratlike. </p>
<p id="cj5bOa">The Great Horned Rat has a furry finger in a lot of different pies, but its main objective is just keeping the rest of its horde organized and focused. In the lore of <em>Age of Sigmar</em>, a magical apocalypse has shattered the traditional fantasy realm of<em> Warhammer Fantasy Battles</em>, and the setting is more of a multiverse. There are eight mortal realms, and then layers of sub-realms and alternate realities. One of these is the home of the Skaven, Blight City. The Skaven have organized themselves into 13 clans and have gnawed holes into each of the eight realms. Each Skaven thinks that they’re the best rat around, which makes for a bunch of backstabbing, betrayal, and bickering.</p>
<p id="LNPITg">The Skaven are known for their use of warpstone, an extremely powerful crystal formed of pure Chaos energy, to power technology that’s highly volatile — but, also, great for doing murder. Sure, a few dozen rats might get exploded into a fine mist when getting a given McGuffin dialed in correctly, but that’s a small price for an extremely powerful auto-cannon or a far-reaching communications device.</p>
<p id="eQybvS">But why would we want a faction of sentient rats in the grim darkness of the far future? Well, we mentioned that warpstone. But also? The Great Horned Rat is kind of a big deal. Traditionally, the Warhammer settings have four Chaos gods: the violent Khorne, the scheming Tzeentch, the rapturous Slaanesh, and the plague-loving Nurgle. In <em>Age of Sigmar</em>, the Great Horned Rat is also at the table, which is a feat that many have tried but none have managed. So why not fully elevate the Skaven to the science fiction big leagues?</p>
<p id="tSpt8z">As a faction, the Skaven are in an interesting place because of their inherent duality. On one hand, they’re a bunch of silly little guys scampering around and getting up to antics. On the other hand, they’re terrifying creatures who want nothing more than to flay you and then gnaw on your bones. A Hammer and Bolter episode, normally available as part of the subscription service Warhammer Plus, was recently made available on YouTube. It shows how hunting the Skaven is a difficult task.</p>
<div id="GG43NX"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9R24vuaesUA?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="39XIxA">Making matters worse, recent developments in the lore of <em>Age of Sigmar </em>have put the Skaven on the offensive. They’re no longer content with raiding and pillaging from afar. Archaon the Everchosen, one of the main antagonists of <em>Age of Sigmar</em>, teamed up with the Great Horned Rat to teleport the sub-realm of Blight City into reality. A huge chunk of Blight City showed up in the realm of Aqshy, one of the mortal realms, in an event called the Vermindoom.</p>
<p id="AHjLXM">For context, imagine you saw some rat holes gnawed into the foundation of your house. You’d probably be pretty concerned, driven to put down traps and call an exterminator. Now, imagine the rats smashed through the drywall and took over the master bedroom. Before long, you might find yourself barricaded in the basement, hoping that the rat men are content with raiding your fridge for cheese.</p>
<p id="nInJ0r">It’s perhaps no surprise that the Skaven are so popular that fans regularly demand they show up in Warhammer 40,000 as well. Let me join them in saying: Please, Games Workshop, let the rat army show up in the far sci-fi future of 40K as more than just a rare cameo. It’s what we deserve. Some antagonists are nuanced, and we’re meant to see reflections of ourselves in their own moral failings. Others are giant stinky rats with a massive cannon, and that’s great. They don’t even need spaceships — rats are infamous for hitching a ride on vessels, after all. Why not a Space Hulk? </p>
<p id="2Cu0BF">I, for one, would be willing to bend the knee to our new sci-fi rat overlords — so long as Games Workshop can bring a decent 2,000-point army down to a reasonable number of miniatures. </p>

So perhaps it doesn’t matter that it doesn’t draw as many competitive players to EVO.</p><p>“I think it’s probably because of the entirely competitive side of things,” ChemistryTasty8751 wrote. “Other fighting games like <em>Street Fighter</em> and <em>Tekken</em> pride themselves on balancing for pro play and competitive, trying to outdo each other with high-budget tournaments. Meanwhile <em>Mortal Kombat</em> don’t fuck with that. <em>Mortal Kombat</em> is a game that prioritizes casual fun because it’s the only fighting game I would actually recommend to newbies because it’s not ‘you need to hit this frame perfect input and space yourself at this exact point to remove end lag’ It’s more ‘here’s your character, go nuts.”</p><p>But in the broader competitive landscape, is it not concerning that <em>Mortal Kombat 1 </em>is trailing so far behind not only its direct competitors, but its own games?</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>“This is actually hilariously pitiful,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/MortalKombat/comments/1dszfbq/evo_final_registration_numbers_for_mk1/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MortalKombat/comments/1dszfbq/evo_final_registration_numbers_for_mk1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NatiHanson wrote</a></span> regarding <em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>’s registration numbers on Reddit. “People are gonna come up with different forms of copuim, but this is sad. Year 2 MKX had more entrants than this.

<p>Nexon certainly has a reputation in the gaming community for its numerous projects falling by the wayside. As such, folks feel somewhat cautious about approaching The First Descendant—a free-to-play third-person shooter that resembles a mixture of Destiny 2 and Warframe. But if you’re on the fence, this may be the deciding factor you need to try the game. So, do you need a Nexon account to play The First Descendant?</p>



<h2 id="h-does-the-first-descendant-require-a-nexon-account">Does The First Descendant Require a Nexon Account?</h2>



<p>You’ll be happy to know that The First Descendant does not require a Nexon account to play the free-to-play looter-shooter. You require an account if you wish to participate in the game’s cross-progression mechanics or <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-score-all-of-the-first-descendant-twitch-drops/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">receive the game’s many Twitch Drops</a>.</p>



<p>If you don’t care about cosmetics, emotes, or in-game currency, and if you only play your games on a single system, you don’t need to worry about signing up for a Nexon account. But if you intend to dive deep into The First Descendant on, say, PC and PlayStation 5, then you’ll want to sign up for a free Nexon account.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-the-first-descendant-cross-progression-works">How The First Descendant Cross-Progression Works</h2>



<p>As mentioned, The First Descendant does offer cross-progression support. However, you must sign up for a Nexon account to use the system. Once you’re set, the game will allow you to pick up your progress, characters, stats, and equipment on any <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-systems-first-descendant-releasing-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">supported system</a>. Currently, The First Descendant is available on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S—free to download and play on any of these systems!</p>

<p>It’s always nice to know the exact system requirements of an upcoming game that you’re most excited about playing. In this case, Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster. It’s a gorgeous game from what we’ve seen of its trailers, thanks to Capcom. But can you run the game? Here are the current Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster system requirements, though they’re subject to change before the game’s official release date!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-the-dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-system-requirements">What Are the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster System Requirements?</h2>



<p>As you can see from the official Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster system requirements below, the upcoming third-person zombie-slaying adventure isn’t overly demanding. It’s not an official remake, so the requirements prove rather accommodating to most systems these days. That said, it does support 4K, so if you want the zombie gore in ultra graphics, you’ll need a beefier system!</p>



<h3 id="h-minimum-system-requirements">Minimum System Requirements</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 10 (64-bit) / Windows 11 (64-bit)</li>



<li><strong>Processor</strong>: Intel Core i7-6700 / AMD Ryzen 5 3400G</li>



<li><strong>Memory</strong>: 16 GB RAM</li>



<li><strong>Graphics</strong>: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 (6GB) / AMD Radeon RX 580</li>



<li><strong>DirectX</strong>: Version 12</li>



<li><strong>Network</strong>: Broadband Internet Connection</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-recommended-system-requirements">Recommended System Requirements</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS</strong>: 10 (64-bit) / Windows 11 (64-bit)</li>



<li><strong>Processor</strong>: Intel Core i7-8700 / AMD Ryzen 5 3600</li>



<li><strong>Memory</strong>: 16 GB RAM</li>



<li><strong>Graphics</strong>: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070ti / AMD Radeon RX 5700</li>



<li><strong>DirectX</strong>: Version 12</li>



<li><strong>Network</strong>: Broadband Internet Connection</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="h-what-systems-will-dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-release-on">What Systems Will Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster Release On?</h2>



<p>We hope you’re ready to once again visit Willamette Mall, albeit in gorgeous 60 FPS and 4K resolution in the upcoming remaster. Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster will launch simultaneously on:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>PC</strong></li>



<li><strong>PlayStation 5</strong></li>



<li><strong>Xbox Series X|S</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>It will not, as of right now, launch on PlayStation 4 or Xbox One, however. The last-gen consoles won’t get the opportunity to enjoy the remaster, though the original is still available to many who have yet to upgrade!</p>

            <p>Surgent Studios has reportedly laid off an undisclosed number of employees.</p>
<p>The cuts come just three months after its latest release, Tales of Kenzera: Zau, released to strong critic and fan reviews.</p>
<p>Whilst neither the studio itself nor founder Abubakar Salim has commented publicly on the layoffs, former Surgent devs have discussed the redundancies on their personal social media profiles.</p>
<p>"The chapter entitled 'Pete Works At Surgent Studios' is coming to a close at the end of the month," wrote former level designer Peter Brisbourne on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/peteb_hello-the-chapter-entitled-pete-works-at-activity-7213868361368174594-wVBF/">LinkedIn</a>.</p>

<p>Yesterday, a producer wrote on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/raysura.bsky.social">Bluesky</a> yesterday that there was a "very high likelihood [they were] going to get some really bad news", and updated today with a simple: "Well, I’ve officially been laid off, as expected. Sh*t sucks."</p>

			<p>As part of the ongoing exclusive Game Informer coverage, BioWare <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive/2024/07/01/a-look-at-dragon-age-the-veilguards-difficulty-options-and-gameplay" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> more information on the difficulty settings available in Dragon Age: The Veilguard.</p>
<p>Preset difficulty options include Storyteller, Adventurer, and Nightmare, which are pretty self-explanatory. You may swap between them at your leisure, with the notable exception of Nightmare difficulty: once that has been selected for a playthrough, it cannot be reverted. You'd have to start a new one at a lower setting if needed.</p>
<p>The surprise option is the custom 'Unbound' setting, which will allow players to craft their own challenge level by tweaking parameters like parry timing, aim assistance (up to auto-aim), enemy pressure (how quickly and often you will be attacked), the amount of damage dealt to and received from enemies, and even wayfinding. Last but not least, fans who are interested in Dragon Age: The Veilguard solely because of the story (and there are quite a few of those) can turn on the no-death setting.</p>
<p>Game Director Corinne Busche told Game Informer that the studio doesn't consider these as 'cheat' options. Rather, they have been implemented to allow all kinds of fans to partake in the adventure. Players can expect other accessibility features, too, with more information to be shared closer to launch.</p>
<p>On that note, Dragon Age: The Veilguard is still scheduled for a generic Fall 2024 launch across PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. That may change soon, though, with Gamescom around a month and a half away.</p>
