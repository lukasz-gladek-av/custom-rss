<p>Parts of Daft Punk's extensive back-catalogue will be available in Fortnite, starting with a supercut of the 2007 album <em>Alive</em> and the accompanying tour. (thanks, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3lzgl7hf4r32p">Wario64</a>!)</p>
<p>You'll be able to remix a bunch of the duo's songs, make a music video in LEGO, get new furniture from fine furniture designer <a href="https://hervet-manufacturier.com/">Hervet Manufacturier</a>, and much more, all in the run up to a big afterparty...</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067kulvgo&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>And, as with any collaboration, there are tons of new outfits and accessories to purchase and decor bundles to furnish your space. Though we're <em>pretty</em> partial to that Daft Punk Pyramid Build, which apparently lights up in-sync with music.</p>


<p>We don't know how long the Daft Punk Experience will be going on in Fortnite (Epic has only said "for a while"), so if you want to get down to the dance floor and go around the world, then you can do just that starting from this Saturday.</p>
<p>You can find all of the details on the experience over on <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/party-harder-better-faster-stronger-in-fortnite-with-the-daft-punk-experience">the official Fortnite website</a>. But it's worth noting that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fortnite_festival">Fortnite Festival</a> Season 10 also has some pretty good music going on right now in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/gorillaz-dare-to-headline-fortnite-festival-season-10">the form of headliners Gorillaz</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>This past Friday afternoon, Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-x-s-prices-will-reportedly-go-up-again-in-us-microsoft/">quietly announced</a> that it would be raising the price for its Xbox Series X/S consoles in the United States, with the Series X getting a $50 increase, the 2TB Series X getting a $70 increase, and the Series S getting a $20 increase starting October 3. It's the second price jump for the Xbox console line this year, meaning that when we finally get to Oct.3, in the US alone, the Series S will have gone up $100, the Series X $150, and the 2TB Series X variant will have jumped up $200 in price.</p>



<p>Many have been quick to point to the current US administration's new tariffs as the real reason behind these price jumps, or as Microsoft puts it, "<em>changes in the macroeconomic environment</em>." According to former Blizzard president Mike Ybarra, however, that's only part of the story.</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://x.com/Qwik/status/1969178567490597232">X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Ybarra plainly states, "<em>Console price increases are not tariff issues, they are profit issues</em>. <em>And the reason why profits are not where they should be is a far, far deeper issue vs. the tariff excuse.</em>"</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Console price increases are not tariff issues, they are profit issues. And the reason why profits are not where they should be is a far, far deeper issue vs. the tariff excuse.</p>— Mike Ybarra 😇 (@Qwik) <a href="https://twitter.com/Qwik/status/1969178567490597232?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 19, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>He further clarifies that he's pointing out that the tariffs only account for one price increase. This second jump in price "<em>is simply a different problem and they are going to make consumers continue to pay for those problems</em>," while tariffs remain "<em>an excuse to continue raising prices</em>."</p>



<p>The tariffs introduced this year are undoubtedly part of the price increases on hardware from <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-us-price-changes-nintendo-switch-2/">Nintendo</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-ps5-pro-price-increases-us-tomorrow/">PlayStation</a>, and Xbox. But Ybarra isn't exactly wrong to point out that Microsoft raising its prices a second time, and the struggles it faces when competing with PlayStation and Nintendo go deeper and started well before this year's tariffs came into the equation.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/streamer-cancer-malware-steam-game-scam</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cancer-stricken-streamer-scammed-for-30k-by-malware-riddled-steam-game.1304466/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A streamer battling stage 4 cancer has been scammed to the tune of around $30,000 by a Steam game that concealed cryptodrain malware, and while the game has been removed, it remained online for around three weeks with the malware infecting its code.</p>

<p>As spotted by ResetEra user <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/streamer-rastaland-raising-money-for-his-stage-4-cancer-treatment-gets-30k-stolen-from-steam-game-containing-malware-while-streaming.1303938/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Atheerios</a>, streamer rastaland, who is suffering from a stage 4 sarcoma (which means the cancer has metastasized to other parts of his body), was tricked into downloading a Steam demo by the name of&nbsp;<em>BlockBlasters</em>, which&nbsp;contained a cryptodrainer.</p>

<p>If you're not sure what a cryptodrainer is, it's essentially a malicious piece of software that drains cryptocurrency from users' wallets (hence the name). As rastaland himself <a href="https://x.com/rastalandtv/status/1969629808788181258" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">says</a>, the malware drained him for "over $32,000" in creator fees earned through crypto platform pump.fun.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/blockblasters-streamer-scam-game.jpg?itok=fon6Iud6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/blockblasters-streamer-scam-game.jpg?itok=Ydho9znT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Steam game&nbsp;<em>BlockBlasters&nbsp;</em>(which has since been removed) tricked streamer rastaland out of $30,000.</figcaption></figure><p>You can see rastaland realizing what's happened in <a href="https://x.com/vxunderground/status/1969786282831130872" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">this clip</a> posted by X user vx-underground. Honestly, I'd recommend against watching it because it's completely heartbreaking, but if you'd like to get all your ducks in a row, it's there for you to watch.</p>

<p>As reported by cyber defense blog <a href="https://www.gdatasoftware.com/blog/2025/09/38265-steam-blockblasters-game-downloads-malware" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">G Data</a>,&nbsp;<em>BlockBlasters&nbsp;</em>seemingly didn't contain any malicious code until August 30th, when the cryptodrainer in question was added to the game. G Data's report also contains a great rundown of how exactly the drainer works and what you can watch out for to avoid being scammed yourself.</p>

<p>G Data points out that this isn't the first instance of malware being injected into Steam games; other examples include free-to-play survival sims&nbsp;<em>PirateFi&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Chemia</em>, both of which were compromised by malicious updates.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/chemia-scam-cryptodrainer-steam.jpg?itok=brvatRhM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/chemia-scam-cryptodrainer-steam.jpg?itok=0Lr34Rj7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Chemia&nbsp;</em>is another example of a Steam game injected with malware.</figcaption></figure><p>All three of the games I've mentioned in this article have now been removed from Steam, but according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3872350/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, two people are still playing&nbsp;<em>BlockBlasters&nbsp;</em>on Steam right now. If that's you and you're reading this, I'd strongly recommend backing out of the game and deleting it.</p>

<p>As for rastaland, he's apparently been <a href="https://x.com/rastalandTV/status/1969993892889027069" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">inundated</a> with support and kind words from his community, and it looks like crypto enthusiast Alex Becker <a href="https://x.com/ZssBecker/status/1969774353211695441" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">sent</a> the streamer enough money to cover the loss, which is a lovely gesture.</p>

<p>This feels to me like a pretty sobering reminder to be extremely careful when getting involved with anything Web3-related, whatever <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/might-and-magic-fates-blockchain-mobile" rel="nofollow">certain major publishers</a>&nbsp;may <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/immensely-popular-classic-sega-franchise-will-become-nft-game" rel="nofollow">tell you</a>.

It is written that when the Sumerian king Gilgamesh first beheld the gleaming ramparts of Uruk‐Haven, many centuries ago, he said unto his architects: "be sure to save up gaps for those long straight ones, and try your best to start a multiplier". But then Gilgamesh realised that, by means of temporal fluctuations too nonsensical to explain, he was actually looking at the submissions page for <a href="https://bsky.app/hashtag/FallingBlockJam">Falling Block Jam 2025</a>, the latest Itch.io "make a thing with a theme" festival, which ran from last week till today. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Falling block games! Such a simple concept, capable of so many perversions. I have played a handful of<a href="https://itch.io/jam/falling-block-jam/entries"> the jam's 239 entries</a> and found them to be enjoyable, if often rudimentary. As is the style round these parts, I will now try to briefly communicate their enjoyableness to you using words. This is honestly going to be quite difficult, because I keep seeing another entry I want to try.
</p>
<p>
A pretty one to start: <a href="https://fayer.itch.io/bloquecitos">Bloquecitos</a> is a Tetrislike with real-time physics, and blocks that merge to create different-shaped blocks when you match their patterns. It's a crafty rejig of the developer's previous <a href="https://fayer.itch.io/pancitomerge">Pancitomerge</a>. I'm fond of the mosaic tile patterns, and I like engineering cascades by merging two blocks so that others tumble together.
</p>

</figure>
<p>
<a href="https://apotheum.itch.io/this-side-up">This Side Up</a>, meanwhile, trades the "falling" component of the "falling block" genre for a gradually retreating 3D camera. You've got a shipping crate and you're trying to fill it with vintage household objects such as cacti, cathode-ray televisions, Nintendo Gamecubes, and lizard tanks.</p><p>I strongly relate to this one inasmuch as I had a bunch of stuff in lock-up during a flat move last year. There's a dark art to filling shipping crates so as to optimise both storage space and retrievability. I do not claim to have mastered this art. After all, I managed to divide up all my paired belongings between separate crates. I had left socks and saucepans in one box, right socks and saucepan lids in another. Get ye behind me, This Side Up! You are bringing back traumatic memories.
</p>

</figure>
<p>
<a href="https://datagoblin.itch.io/bone-scrambler">Professor Gambler's Bone Scrambler</a> is a falling block game born of the fateful realisation that a thrown die is a kind of falling block. Each turn, it rolls out a line of dice. You then slide the line horizontally to match the blocks below and create combos, or spend points to reroll the set. How do you earn points? From combos. It's got nice chiptune aesthetics, as you might expect from a game that has also been submitted to <a href="https://itch.io/jam/gbjam-13">GBJAM 13</a>.
</p>
<p>
A Pico-8 one next. In <a href="https://werxzy.itch.io/recycled-blocks">Recycled Blocks</a>, you control a little laser drone that has to sculpt blocks as they fall to complete work orders and remove them from the board. I found the control scheme a bit confusing, but I love the concept. Ditto the self-explanatory <a href="https://sunrysky.itch.io/circuit-makers">Circuit Makers</a>.</p><p><a href="https://walaber-ent.itch.io/jelly-well">Jelly Well</a>, meanwhile, gets two thumbs up for its subliminal hatred of LocoRocos and for its soundscape of human mouth noises. More of this kind of thing, please. Call of Duty games would sell twice as much if all the gun effects consisted of voice actors yelling "bang". I would hire Sir Anthony Hopkins to voice an AK47, myself.
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Walaber Entertainment</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Simply scrolling the Falling Block Jam submission feed makes me feel as though I'm losing badly at Tetris, so I'll resist the urge to write up any more. OK, one more, but only because it doesn't require a computer: <a href="https://npckc.itch.io/doctorvsvirus">Doctor Vs Virus</a> is a table-top falling block game you can play with a standard deck of cards.</p>
<p>If you see any others you like, please rotate and slide them dextrously into the comments below. Why not see if you can form a line with people recommending the same game - I'll try to add some block-clearing score attack functionality to our moderation software.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/anker-maggo-3-in-1-charging-station-hits-all-time-low-charge-airpods-pro-3-iphone-17-and-apple-watches-at-once.1304457/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Nobody should have to decide which one of their devices gets the fast charger while the other ones get the slow version, or none at all. You carry your smartphone and earbuds and wear your smartwatch at the same time, so you should be able to fast-charge them the same way.</p>
<p>That’s what Anker’s MagGo 3-in-1 charging station does for your Apple devices, including the brand-new iPhone 17, Apple Watch 11, SE 3, and Ultra, and AirPods 4 and Pro 3. They all get 15W charging power, and your desk or nightstand get a clean, organized look with just one cable for 3 devices. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4221/">Speaking of cleaning up, that’s what you’ll be doing with this limited-time Amazon sale that cuts the price of the MagGo 3-in-1 charging station by 30%, down to just $63.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4221/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Apple Certified</h2>
<p>The Anker MagGo 3-in-1 charging station is one of the rare chargers that’s officially certified by Apple as a fast charger for the Apple Watch. It’s powerful and fast enough to bring an Apple Watch Series 10 from 0 to a full charge in just an hour and 13 minutes — over 2 hours less than other wireless chargers. (It’s not compatible with Samsung or other non-Apple smartwatches.)</p>
<p>That amazing speed also applies to your MagSafe-compatible iPhone — watch your iPhone 16 Pro Max go from totally dead to 20% in just 20 minutes, a task which takes a 7.5W wireless charger over twice as long. And the Qi pad at the rear of the stand is a perfect fit for your AirPods wireless charging case, with a non-slip surface to prevent you (or your cat) from knocking them off in the middle of the night.</p>



<h2>Nightstand Upgrade</h2>
<p>The MagGo is a charging&nbsp;<em>stand</em>, so let’s not lose sight of that feature.

            <link>https://aftermath.site/roblox-charlie-kirk-recreations</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/why-major-events-like-charlie-kirk%E2%80%99s-death-end-up-on-roblox.1304448/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It took mere hours after Charlie Kirk’s death at Utah Valley University before recreations of the scene—in which suspect Tyler Robinson allegedly shot Kirk from a nearby rooftop—started appearing on <em>Roblox</em>. Rendered in <em>Roblox</em>’s crude, low fidelity style, people quickly created experiences (what Roblox calls the different games and locations on its platform) that lets users participate in or watch the killing play out. The following day, Roblox said it had removed <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/09/11/charlie-kirk-shooting-roblox-game-removed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more than 100 experiences</a> that referenced the event.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s very likely these experiences drew <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/09/roblox-annual-economic-impact-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just a tiny fraction of <em>Roblox</em>’s 111.8 million average daily users</a>. (One clip shared on X of an experience called "assassinate charlie kirk” <a href="https://x.com/crusty83106/status/1966289140473016497/video/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported 12 active players</a> at the time the video was recorded.) But the recreations of Kirk’s death found a wider audience when clips started circulating on TikTok and X, where they’ve received thousands of views, reposts, and likes. <a href="https://x.com/jackunheard/status/1966255591036432886/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Several posts on social media suggest</a> that some users were selling <em>Roblox</em> avatar skins designed to look like the T-shirt Kirk was wearing during the event, often with blood around the neckline. (Aftermath observed at least one of these avatars still available in Roblox at the time of writing.)</p><p>On Sept. 12, <a href="https://x.com/DavidBaszucki/status/1966550631327658374" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox CEO David Baszucki responded</a> to a post regarding the <em>Roblox</em> experiences from Florida representative and a former staffer for Kirk’s organization Turning Point USA Anna Paulina Luna—<a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/09/11/charlie-kirk-shooting-house-boebert-luna" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">who, while on the House floor, blamed Democrats for Kirk’s killing</a>. Baszucki said he was “saddened by the passing of Charlie Kirk" and continued, “Our Community Standards prohibit content and behavior that re-enacts specific real world violent or sensitive events or promotes terrorism or hatred against individuals or groups, and we do not allow any image or video sharing in chat.”</p><p>Though the juxtaposition of a graphic shooting and the childish nature of <em>Roblox</em> can be jarring, that the event quickly showed up in these spaces is not. It doesn’t matter the event: <a href="https://aftermath.site/fortnite-roblox-minecraft-steam-trump-assassination-attempt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">As Aftermath’s Nathan Grayson put it last year</a>, “this clockwork cycle plays out following almost any event of significance; the modern internet has been engineered for it.”</p><p>When a shooter attempted to assassinate Donald Trump during his presidential campaign last year, recreations of the event popped up in <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Minecraft</em>, and yes, <em>Roblox</em>. There have been players who <a href="https://kotaku.com/roblox-school-shootings-columbine-ass-adl-report-kids-1851777207" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recreate school shootings</a>. People roleplay crossing the Mexican border, playing as both migrants and border control. There has been <a href="https://youtu.be/vjEjU9uFUhk?feature=shared&amp;t=398" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an experience in which players encounter an assassinated JFK</a> and must complete an obstacle course to find the killer. Often, recreations spread further than the players who have actively participated even after being taken offline, thanks to social media platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and X.</p><p>Dr. Rachel Kowert, <a href="https://www.takethis.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ExtremismInGames_APrimer_FINAL-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a psychologist who studies extremism in games</a>, told Aftermath that some of these in-game scenarios—she pointed specifically to recreations of Columbine and playing as a Nazi in World War 2 games in <em>Roblox</em>—could be explained as propaganda designed to radicalize people. She said there may be some of that when making and spreading <em>Roblox</em> experiences recreating Kirk’s death. Recreations of these sorts of events may also be a way for young people to “recreate and process” an experience; lots of people were "inadvertently exposed” to videos of the actual shooting with clips shared widely on social media, she said. “I would hypothesize that’s a minority of people, but it is a possibility.”</p><p>Of course, that doesn’t mean <em>Roblox</em> should be used as the place to process traumatic events. “If you need to roleplay process, go to therapy,” Kowert said. “These places are town squares. Not everyone wants to roleplay process that, like not everybody wants to see it on their TikTok feed.”</p><p>The reality of internet culture, though, is that it’s very hard to ascribe actual intention to memes—and these <em>Roblox</em> experiences are often memes. It’s the same culture that bewildered mainstream media in interpreting the engravings on the bullets used by suspected shooter Tyler Robinson; what was originally described as “<a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/charlie-kirk-shot/card/ammunition-in-kirk-shooting-engraved-with-transgender-antifascist-ideology-sources-pdymd1sXXMSlVRhpvR4b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transgender and anti-fascist ideology</a>” ended up being references to video games and internet culture. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/16/us/text-message-tyler-robinson-roomate-vis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Robinson allegedly said so himself in text messages sent</a> after the killing: “remember how I was engraving bullets? The fuckin messages are mostly a big meme, if I see ‘notices bulges uwu’ on fox new[s] I might have a stroke.”</p><p>Memes are essentially a social currency online. Recreating violent events through memes can give a rush of attention and the thrill of being edgy. They often go viral on social media platforms like TikTok, which leads to an influx of clicks and views. This attention can translate into gain; sometimes it’s actual currency, as in the case of the Kirk assassination, where people were selling cosmetic items referencing the event.</p><p>“It’s impossible to know who’s doing it for the lulls and the clicks and who’s doing it because they’re radicalizing or actively trying to cognitively change the way you view and see the world,” Kowert said. “That’s why you can have none of it, because you can’t tell which is which.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-charlie-kirk-killer-steam-discord"><h3>What A Shock, The Government Is Scapegoating Video Games Again</h3></a><p>"That nihilism isn’t really reflected or addressed in either political party"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/arma-trans-platoon"><h3>Arma Can Be A Boys Club, But This Trans Women-Only Platoon Aims To Change That</h3></a><p>'It’s a community that is made for the trans community...

Now called "Wall Jumps," the ability to hop off of walls is coming to the new Call of Duty game as part of updates to the Omnimovement system.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/09/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-multiplayer-deep-dive" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">long blog post</a> revealing details about Black Ops 7's multiplayer mode, developers Treyarch and Raven Software detailed how players will be able to jump off walls. Most notably, Black Ops 7 will restrict when and how you can use this traversal option. Wall Jumps will only be available on certain surfaces that are marked with special icons, and each Wall Jump will reduce the player's momentum. Three Wall Jumps can be chained together without needing to return to flat ground.</p>

<p>Running on walls has appeared in occasionally in past Call of Duty games, <a href="https://callofduty.fandom.com/wiki/Wall_Running" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">most notably Black Ops 3</a>. In that game, players wore exoskeletons that allowed them to run, boost, and jump across walls, although its implementation was met with a mixed reception.</p><p>Wall Jumps are just one of numerous changes coming to multiplayer that were shown off in the blog post. Black Ops 7 will also feature a significant modification to the way that Tactical Sprint works, and players can now use Body Shield to booby-trap enemies. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-multiplayer-trailer-shows-off-all-18-maps-coming-at-launch/1100-6534905/" data-ref-id="1100-6534905">Finally, all the maps and modes coming at launch have been revealed</a>.</p><p>Black Ops 7 launches on November 4, but you can check it out before that via a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-start-time-how-to-get-in-and-everything-else-to-know/1100-6534073/" data-ref-id="1100-6534073">multiplayer beta that kicks off in early October.</a> For more, check out our overview of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">everything to expect from Black Ops 7</a>.</p>

But in the meantime, he likes doing updates for the original game. "It's so much easier to just add more stuff to Stardew Valley than to make a whole new game from scratch," Barone said on a podcast in May.</p>

The contractors who performed these duties--which include "back office teams, fraud, financials, chargebacks, customer services, chatlogs, customer phone and email support, refunds, account bans, remote data transfers, repair support, everything customer support," as one described--will see their contracts phased out at the end of September. It's estimated that 200 workers will be impacted, many of whom have worked with the company for years. One contractor said that while there are still a few people running these operations on-site, "it’s all going away."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Nintendo Switch 2 Console Review</p>
      </div>
<p>According to the contractors IGN spoke to on the condition of anonymity, Nintendo of America didn't provide any communication on the decision. However, as their employment comes to an end, the contractors must still help train the new hires before leaving their roles.</p><p>This, along with the language barrier, has created frustrations for everyone, the contractors said. As a result, the workers being let go fear that the quality of Nintendo of America's customer service will suffer in the long term. Contactors said Nintendo of America's decision has already produced a noticeable increase in irate or belligerent customers, with one person saying they've seen customers use racial slurs towards agents.</p><p>Nintendo of America said the claims in IGN's article are "inaccurate," refuting them in the face of its "high-quality" service:  </p><p>"While we have nothing to announce about our internal business activities, the claims shared with IGN include inaccurate information. At Nintendo of America, we are extremely thankful to have partnered with several companies and their talented contractors over the years to deliver high-quality customer service experiences. We continue to evolve and expand our customer service model with external partners that have deep experience in all the markets we serve across the Americas. This approach allows us to support the full scope of our customer service mission in both North America and our growing Latin American markets, and better scale to seasonal needs for consistent support. As always, our top priority is to provide excellent customer support, and we are pleased that customer satisfaction with the service provided by all our partners remains positive."</p><p>This all comes on the heels of the Nintendo Switch 2's massive success. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-sales-massively-outpacing-switch-1-sales-so-far-in-the-us/1100-6534305/" data-ref-id="1100-6534305">Outpacing the original</a> just a handful of months on the market, the console-handheld hybrid has already <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-sales-blast-past-expectations-now-6-million-globally/1100-6533625/" data-ref-id="1100-6533625">sold more than six million units globally</a>. The Switch 2 is an evidently very in-demand console right now, and as it enters its first holiday season, "high-quality" customer service will remain more important.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/resident-evil-requiem-will-feature-a-large-interconnected-story-and-grounded-action-elements-%E2%80%93-rumor.1304412/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/resident-evil-requiem/">Resident Evil Requiem</a> is shaping up to be one of the most ambitious entries in years, and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-gamescom-hands-on-preview-turn-on-the-lights/">demo</a> I tried during <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/gamescom-2025/">Gamescom</a> last month proved how the whole experience will be elevated by high-quality ray-traced lighting and layered sound design, which made every dark corridor haunting and every escape attempt tense, even in a noisy, expo environment. And if new rumors are to be believed, Resident Evil Requiem may also deliver the most complex narrative the series has seen.</p>



<p>In a new video shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ROEnetwork">Residence of Evil</a>, well-known leaker Dusk Golem went over the rumors currently circulating regarding the next entry in the series launching next year, revealing some additional, previously unknown details. As previously mentioned, Leon will be the second playable character in the game besides Grace, and the classic Resident Evil series protagonist will feature in the ninth entry in the series with an older appearance - unshaven and with greying hair. </p>



<p>Leon's gameplay segments, which are expected to be revealed during this week's Tokyo Game Show, will be action-oriented, but in a more grounded sort of way than <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-4/">Resident Evil 4</a> or <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-village-horror-greatest-hits/">Resident Evil Village</a>, doing away with enemies like possessed statues and more. Generally, the insider expects these action segments, which will take place in larger environments also featuring vehicles to move from one location to another, similar to the boat section in Resident Evil 4, to be compared to <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-the-definitive-package/">The Last of Us Part II gameplay.</a></p>



<p>The most interesting thing Dusk Golem revealed about Resident Evil Requiem is how Grace's and Leon's campaigns will be set in different years. Most of Grace's campaign will be set in 2028, while Leon's in 2020, and both will form a large, cohesive and interconnected story. While the Resident Evil series has often featured different campaigns with different main characters interconnected on some levels, this would be the first time this element is brought to such a scale.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="RESIDENT EVIL 9: REQUIEM | NEW LEAKS! | LEON REVEAL, GAMEPLAY, VEHICLES &amp; More!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NnvzOMHoDL4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>While Dusk Golem proved to have access to insider information in the past, we still have to take everything revealed in the video above with a healthy grain of salt. Thankfully, it's very likely we won't have to wait much longer to see Leon's new appearance and gameplay. No matter when this reval will occur, we know for certain we won't have to wait until Resident Evil Requiem launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Nintendo Switch on February 27, 2026 to learn more about its more action-focused elements.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fortnite Daft Punk Collab Confirmed, Launches Later This Week]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-daft-punk-collab</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fortnite-daft-punk-collab-confirmed-launches-later-this-week.1304409/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Epic Games has announced the latest band to make its way into&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>as a crossover, and it's none other than legendary French house duo Daft Punk, who will feature in the game as an "experience" later this week.</p>

<p>As revealed in an <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/party-harder-better-faster-stronger-in-fortnite-with-the-daft-punk-experience?lang=en-US" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official blog post</a>,&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>'s Daft Punk Experience will begin on September 27th, and rather than just consisting of a few songs for&nbsp;<em>Fortnite Festival&nbsp;</em>or a couple of skins, it'll serve as a full-scale "sonic journey", according to Epic.</p>

<p>In the post, Epic says the experience will take players to a "transformative dancefloor destination" where they'll be able to "remix Daft Punk's music at Dream Chamber Studios" or "blast hordes of robots with a soundwave laser in the Robot Rock Arena".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fortnite-daft-punk-collab-skins.jpg?itok=5b-1BR1N 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fortnite-daft-punk-collab-skins.jpg?itok=wY2SvpAe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Fortnite</em>'s new Daft Punk collab isn't just skins, but those are on offer too.</figcaption></figure><p>If that doesn't tickle your fancy, then perhaps you'd prefer to "make a Lego music video at Around the World" or "hit the Daft Club to dance til dawn". Furniture company Hervet Manufacturier, which has worked with Daft Punk in the past, will also have several virtual pieces displayed throughout the experience.</p>

<p>Epic is also promising an "afterparty" for the Daft Punk experience, but the studio is keeping the details close to its chest for now, promising to reveal more info about that "at a later date".</p>

<p>Of course, if you do want to pick up some Daft Punk skins for your&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>character, you can do so with a new bundle that launches this Thursday. It's got two new outfits and a bunch of accessories for you to spruce up your battle royale-ing with.</p>

<p>Daft Punk is far from the first artist to feature in&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>. The duo follows on from the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-festival-hatsune-miku-crossover" rel="nofollow">Hatsune Miku</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-festival-reveals-first-glimpse-of-weeknd-gameplay" rel="nofollow">The Weeknd</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-the-big-bang-eminem" rel="nofollow">rap legend Eminem</a>, among many others.</p>

		<p>I'm not sure what to do with myself. The Chicago Bears looked...good? Excellent? Yes, yes, I know the Cowboys defense is notoriously bad and yes, yes the Bears nearly gave up a franchise high amount of points to the Lions just one week ago—but let me have this moment. Let me hold onto it, before it slips away a week from now. We'll probably do exactly that on a podcast I'm about to record with Rob, but if you're also wondering "Hey, I wanna hear more about stuff going horribly wrong at Rob's house," don't worry, we have an entire HOA in the bank that you'll hear in the near future. I'm told that even in the weeks since recording that, there's more to talk about it. Somehow, I should not be surprised. And yet?</p><p>-pk, who keeps thinking he'll get tired of <em>Silksong</em> but has not</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>Sports!</em> – What exactly did you think was going to happen when the Chicago Bears have a kick ass win in a year where we're desperate for hope? (I also suspect we'll end up talking about the very weird Charlie Kirk moments.)</li><li><strong>STREAM: </strong><em>Baby Steps </em>– Look, the moment Chia and I played this demo, we knew that we were signing up for a video game that we needed to play together on stream with you. Come join us for what's sure to be a fucked up journey.</li><li><strong>PODCAST:</strong> <em>Remap Radio</em> – We'll probably tamp down the <em>Silksong</em> talk after this week, but I think I need to let everyone off the leash one last time lol.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Daft Punk, one of the biggest electronic dance music groups in history, is coming soon to <a href="https://kotaku.com/gaijin-war-thunder-fortnite-the-pit-deal-millions-epic-1851786813"><em>Fortnite</em></a> alongside some classic tracks, Lego skins, new emotes, and also a big confirmation from Epic that, no, they aren’t getting back together. Sorry.</p> <p>On September 22, after some online leaks and teases, <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/party-harder-better-faster-stronger-in-fortnite-with-the-daft-punk-experience">Epic officially announced that Daft Punk</a> was coming to <em>Fortnite</em> as part of a large in-game event. The robotic duo will arrive in Epic’s ever-growing battle royale on September 27 as part of something called the “Daft Punk Experience.” This will be an in-game location that players can visit alone or with friends, and it will feature various activities, including the ability to remix Daft Punk’s music, a horde mode featuring robots, and a dance club.</p> <p>But before all that, on September 25, cosmetic items based on the duo will be added to <a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-missing-characters-wishlist-grimace-agent-47-weird-al-star-trek-2000617211"><em>Fortnite’s</em> in-game shop</a>. Cosmetics include multiple Daft Punk outfits, emotes, weapon skins, in-game music tracks, and even some adorable Lego minifigs based on the famous robots.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000627583" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000627583"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000627583">©Epic Games / Daft Punk</figcaption></figure> <p>Now, if you’re a big fan of Daft Punk like me, you might see all this news and start thinking that maybe, just maybe, the duo is about to get back together. Perhaps this is just a tease of something bigger. A new album? A new song? A new tour? Well, bad news: Epic makes it very clear in the post announcing all of the new <em>Fortnite</em> x Daft Punk content that, no, the group is not getting back together. First, Epic starts the post off with a mention of the group being “no longer” around and then, to make it very clear, Epic included this in the event’s FAQ:</p> <blockquote> <ul> <li><em>Is Daft Punk getting back together?</em></li> <li>No. The Daft Punk Experience is an immersive music experience based on the band’s beloved music. The band is not getting back together.</li> </ul> </blockquote> <p>So there you go. Sorry about that. Of course, if they wanted it to be a surprise, that’s exactly what they would say. So perhaps there is still a chance… (Editor’s note: It’s not happening, Zack. Move on.)</p>

The trailer shows off all 18 multiplayer maps that will be available at launch and all footage was captured in-game. The trailer is set to the song "FE!N" from Travis Scott ft. Playboi Carti.</p><p>The trailer shows off some of the new traversal systems, too, including wall-jumping, while some of the new scorestreaks, guns, and gadgets are on display here as well. Black Ops 7 is set in the year 2035, which helps explain why some of the gameplay looks semi-futuristic. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new survey shared on <a href="https://x.com/MGSMGN/status/1969354623007014979">X (formerly Twitter) by user Metal Gear Network</a> (spotted by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/konami-asked-fans-which-metal-gear-remade/">Insider-Gaming</a>) reveals that Konami wants to know which Metal Gear Solid game fans think should get the remake treatment next, now that we're beyond the release of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://questant.jp/q/7DNR3EOO">survey</a> is entirely in Japanese, so unless you can read it or have a translation tool handy, you'll probably struggle to answer the questions to be able to submit your choice. But the key takeaway here is that Konami is clearly trying to gauge what fans want to see next.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The choices presented in the survey are: </p>



<ul>
<li>Metal Gear</li>



<li>Metal Gear 2 Solid Snake</li>



<li>Metal Gear Solid</li>



<li>Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty</li>



<li>Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots</li>



<li>Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker</li>



<li>Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes</li>



<li>Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain</li>



<li>Other (with a box to type in your selection)</li>
</ul>



<p>We know that there is more MGS on the horizon, if only through the coming release of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-4-peace-walker-mgs5-references-found-in-metal-gear-solid-master-collection-files/">MGS: Master Collection Vol. 2</a>, which is said to include MGS4, MGS: Peace Walker, and MGSV. Those wouldn't be major remakes or touch-ups of the aforementioned titles, though; they'd be in line with the first volume of the Master Collection, which is, they'd just be a means of playing the series on modern hardware. Of course, there's a larger question around what this would mean for MGS4 due to it currently being marooned on PlayStation 3, but that's a whole different topic.</p>



<p> So far, the MGSD: Snake Eater remake has had a strong commercial start, <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-million-seller-day-one/">selling over 1 million copies in its first day,</a> according to Konami. It's also had a strong critical start, with players and critics (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-ps5-review-based-on-a-hideo-kojima-game/">Wccftech included</a>) praising the remake for its efforts in updating what many consider to be one of the best stealth-action games out there.</p>



<p>From an external point of view, strong sales and critical reception should be exactly what Konami wanted out of the MGSD: Snake Eater remake, so why not move forward and pick another game in the series to repeat it with? Besides MGS2: Sons of Liberty, MGS3: Snake Eater was the riskiest game to remake, because it's the one that most of the series fans hold in higher regard than the rest.</p>



<p>Just like it did with <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-sells-over-2-million-units-worldwide/">Silent Hill 2</a>, Konami got the most difficult one off the board first, and by all means, knocked it out of the park. There will be high expectations for whatever comes next, but at least we can have some confidence in what Konami is trying to do with the series.</p>



<p>So, which game would you pick to get the same treatment that MGS3 got next? Personally, I don't need any of them to get a remake, I'd just like to be able to play my beloved MGS4 without having to boot up my aging PS3.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Xbox has revealed that this year marks its "largest investment" in the Xbox Game Pass subscription service to date, so it's clear the company isn't too fazed by discussions around whether the service is good for developers or not.</p>

<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inside-xboxs-increasingly-vital-indie-publishing-operation" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a>, Xbox indie boss Chris Charla confirms that 2025 has seen the biggest investment in Game Pass in the service's history, and he also reveals that Xbox has "signed deals with more than 150 partners to expand the catalog".</p>

<p>Charla says that "the majority" of studios whose games have been included as part of Game Pass "want to bring their future titles to the service", too, so the somewhat ambivalent buzz doesn't seem to be deterring developers who've got experience with the platform either.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xbox-game-pass-largest-investment-there-are-no-ghosts-at-the-grand.jpg?itok=zEhnasiB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xbox-game-pass-largest-investment-there-are-no-ghosts-at-the-grand.jpg?itok=AxI2P82x 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Xbox Game Pass is attracting indie titles like the upcoming&nbsp;<em>There Are No Ghosts at the Grand</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Xbox making its largest investment in Game Pass yet comes after a couple of high-profile industry figures expressed concern that the service might be doing more harm than good for developers, whether they be first-party or third-party studios.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, former Bethesda exec Pete Hines said subscription services were "worth jack shit" without companies making the effort to "figure out how to balance the needs of the service" with those who are "providing the content".</p>

<p>PlayStation boss Shawn Layden appeared to agree, linking Hines' comments on social media platform LinkedIn and asking whether subscription services were "healthy and helpful" for those who make games.</p>

<p>Layden's comments drew agreement <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-shannon-loftis-comments" rel="nofollow">from former Xbox VP Shannon Loftis</a>, who added that game adoption on Game Pass "comes at the expense of retail revenue" and that the service creates "weird inner tensions" among developers.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/human-fall-flat-xbox-game-pass_0.jpg?itok=xY9tfjwL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/human-fall-flat-xbox-game-pass_0.jpg?itok=wGw6bsPt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Game Pass hits like&nbsp;<em>Human: Fall Flat&nbsp;</em>haven't stopped some wondering whether the service is good for developers.</figcaption></figure><p>Whether or not Game Pass is actually good for developers is a question that's likely to continue to spark debate, but one thing's for sure: Xbox is still sure the service works. Stay tuned for more on this and all other things Game Pass-related.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>While reports are circulating that Disney-owned ABC and late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel are </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/jimmy-kimmel-fallon-colbert-stewart-trump-kirk-2000627249"><span>in talks to bring </span><i><span>Jimmy Kimmel Live</span></i></a> <span>back on air after the show was pulled last week, more high-profile names from some of Disney’s biggest franchises have spoken out in protest of the decision. While some, like Aunt May actor Marisa Tomei and She-Hulk actor Tatiana Maslany, have </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/jimmy-kimmel-abc-disney-boycott-marvel-marisa-tomei-2000627135"><span>called for a straight-up boycott</span></a><span> of the company’s services, some other major players in </span><i><span>Star Wars </span></i><span>and Marvel are simply voicing their support for Kimmel and condemning ABC and Disney’s decision.</span></p> <p><span>Mark Hamill, who has portrayed original </span><i><span>Star Wars </span></i><span>protagonist Luke Skywalker since long before Disney ever got its hands on the franchise, posted on Bluesky that he believes Jimmy Kimmel being pulled from the air in an effort to placate the FCC and the Trump administration will only embolden further attacks on free speech in America, and says that he finds Kimmel “very talented and funny.” This is in reference to comments from ex-Disney CEO Michael Eisner, who expressed similar sentiments </span><a href="https://x.com/Michael_Eisner/status/1969088566098870363"><span>on his X account</span></a><span> and signed off with the same final line.</span></p>   <p><span>Another big </span><i><span>Star Wars </span></i><span>name calling out Disney for this move is Dan Gilroy, a writer whose work on the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/andor-season-2-ending-vgchat-star-wars-rogue-one-10-12-1851780720"><span>Disney+ series </span><i><span>Andor</span></i></a><span> earned him an Emmy. Gilroy wrote a guest column on </span><a href="https://deadline.com/2025/09/andor-dan-gilroy-jimmy-kimmel-commentary-1236549627/"><i><span>Deadline</span></i></a><span> comparing the real-world actions of the Trump administration to events of the show, which focuses on the Galactic Empire’s tyrannical reign.</span></p>

 <p><span>“As one of the writers on the Disney+ drama </span><i><span>Andor</span></i><span>, we spent six years thinking about a fascist takeover of a galaxy far, far away,” Gilroy wrote. “Six years thinking about ordinary beings as an authoritarian regime comes in for the kill. Many people saw parallels between </span><i><span>Andor</span></i><span> and the real world. I see them as well, particularly in the events of the last week.”</span></p>

 <p><span>On the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-cinematic-universe-mcu-best-worst-movie-avengers-1851765913"><span>Marvel</span></a><span> side of things, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pedro-pascal-vanessa-kirby-anxiety-touch-controversy-1851787007"><span>Pedro Pascal</span></a><span>, who plays Mr. Fantastic in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-fantastic-four-first-steps-review-movie-marvel-mcu-1851786852"><i><span>Fantastic Four: First Steps</span></i></a> <span>and the upcoming </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/avengers-doomsday-4-cast-announcement-stream-mcu-marvel-1851772474"><i><span>Avengers: Doomsday</span></i></a><span>, posted a photo of himself with Kimmel to his Instagram with the caption “Standing with you @jimmykimmellive Defend #FreeSpeech Defend #DEMOCRACY.” Pascal also <a href="https://kotaku.com/mandalorian-grogu-trailer-disney-boycott-2000627542">plays the Mandalorian in&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em></a>.&nbsp;</span></p>   <p><span>Mark Ruffalo, who plays the Hulk in the MCU, has been vocally supporting Kimmel since the decision was made last week, criticizing the Trump administration </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJewRRfp4K4"><span>during a No Kings stream on September 18</span></a><span>, saying this move was an attack on free speech. After it was reported that Disney’s </span><a href="https://collider.com/disney-stock-nosedive-dis-nyse-drop-boycott-reaction-jimmy-kimmel/"><span>stock had dropped</span></a><span> following the calls for a boycott (though some dispute if this seven-percent drop is anything more than a standard fluctuation), Ruffalo warned </span><a href="https://www.threads.com/@markruffalo/post/DO1CP-Jjtsj"><span>on Threads</span></a><span> that “It’s going to go down a lot further if they cancel his show.”</span></p> <p><span>Disney and Kimmel are reportedly currently in talks, looking for a </span><a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/jimmy-kimmel-abc-disney-late-night-comeback-1236524695/"><span>“compromise” to bring the late-night show back</span></a><span>, but there has been no official word on whether these talks have borne any fruit.</span></p>

              <p>The Natural History Museum of London is getting a Pokémon pop-up shop experience beginning in early 2026. It’ll have exclusive stuff fans can’t get anywhere else. It’s intended to be part of Pokémon’s 30th anniversary celebration. Why does it seem destined to be yet <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-van-gogh-museum-scalpers-pikachu-card-1850882131">another scalper-infested mess</a>?</p> <p>Fans will need to register for a free ticket to visit the Pokémon x Natural History Museum pop-up store, which will run from 26 January 2026 until 22 March 2026. If you can’t make it to London yourself, the merchandise will be available to buy from the <a href="https://www.nhmshop.co.uk/?srsltid=AfmBOorBseC_DhtYXMqRbGzy3Zxn6ye5OvDqVzxM9dHraX54OsyrcOM7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online Natural History Museum shop</a> as well, according to <a href="https://www.gamespress.com/en-GB/Go-wild-as-The-Pokemon-Company-International-and-Natural-History-Museu">today’s press release</a>. It’ll include clothing, stationery, accessories, prints, and a brand-new exclusive plush, all of which “are sure to delight fans of all ages.”</p> <p>“The Natural History Museum and Pokémon share a fascination for and focus on the natural world and its creatures, from their evolution to their environment,” reads a press release. “In the Pokémon world, Pokémon can evolve into many forms which allow them to adapt smoothly and perfectly to any environment. Meanwhile, the Natural History Museum’s halls take you on a journey through the evolution and diversity of life on planet earth, from prehistoric dinosaurs to the species we live alongside today.”</p>

 <p>While The Pokémon Company hasn’t teased exactly what the exclusive merch will be, it’s promising “products designed especially for the collaboration.” Whether that’s a fossil-centric approach to the franchise’s creatures or something else thematically appropriate remains to be seen. “Design inspiration has been drawn directly from the Natural History Museum’s iconic building and architecture, as well as the beautiful naturalist sketches that fill the Museum’s archives,” head of Pokémon Europe licensing Mathieu Galante said.</p>

 <p>It certainly can’t go any worse than what transpired in 2023 when Holland’s Van Gogh Museum had its own Pokémon pop-up shop. The frenzy of fans and the race to scalp products online for jacked-up prices left an unfortunate scar on the fandom’s collectors. Have things mellowed out two years later? Hardly. The <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scalper-reseller-trading-card-van-gogh-pikachu-1850925900">steady growth of Pokémon market speculators</a> and the ongoing scarcity of what The Pokémon Company is able to get manufactured when it comes to cards, plushies, and other rare collectibles <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-plush-scalper-reseller-world-championships-2000618087">has left communities exhausted</a>.</p> <p>It’s not yet clear how The Pokémon Company<em>&nbsp;</em>plans to avoid similar issues with the Natural History Museum collaboration. Hopefully, it’s either produced enough stock to meet at least most of the demand, or found a way to limit what people can buy. The 30th anniversary of Pokémon begins February 27, 2026.</p>

                <p>Xbox boss Chris Charla, who runs Microsoft's independent gaming label ID@Xbox, has commented on the state of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-xbox-game-pass-games/2900-4001/" data-ref-id="2900-4001">Game Pass</a> and what developers are saying about it.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inside-xboxs-increasingly-vital-indie-publishing-operation" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Speaking to Eurogamer</a>, Charla said Microsoft worked with more than 50 developers in 2024 to sign their first Game Pass deals, and 2025 marks ID@Xbox's "largest investment in Game Pass to date."</p><p>"We remain focused on delivering the most exciting and diverse catalogue in gaming," he said.</p><p>Charla went on to say that the majority of developers who have worked with ID@Xbox for a Game Pass deal have come back to Microsoft asking to bring future titles to the service.</p><p>"As a result, we've signed deals with more than 150 partners to expand the catalogue. We continue to engage with hundreds of partners each year to review upcoming titles," he said. You can see all the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/upcoming-game-pass-titles/1100-6534406/" data-ref-id="1100-6534406">upcoming Game Pass games</a> we know about for a look at what's confirmed.</p><p>As for how Microsoft finds games to bring to Game Pass via ID@Xbox, Charla said it can come from any number of sources, including meeting with developers at conferences or even a simple DM. It also comes from workplace conversations, Charla said. "We find them from people all around Microsoft being like, 'Hey, have you seen this game?' And we find them from having friends who make games who say, 'Hey, you need to see my friend's game.' And from people just emailing us!"</p><p>Charla did not, however, comment on the many recent comments from prominent developers about the possible negative effects of Game Pass on the wider gaming industry. Arkane co-founder Ralph Colantonio said Game Pass is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arkane-co-founder-unloads-on-game-pass-calls-it-unsustainable/1100-6532991/" data-ref-id="1100-6532991">"unsustainable,"</a> while former PlayStation boss Shawn Layden said subscription services like Game Pass make developers become a <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-big-picture-part-one-i-dont-know-if-games-are-recession-proof" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"wage slave."</a> Former Bethesda higher-up Pete Hines, meanwhile, said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-bethesda-boss-pete-hines-has-strong-words-about-subscription-services-in-gaming/1100-6534511/" data-ref-id="1100-6534511">subscription services like Game Pass can lead to a "real problem" for the industry.</a> Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick has said it <a href="https://google.com/search?q=strauss+zelnick+no+sense+game+pass+gamespot&amp;rlz=1C5GCCM_en&amp;oq=strauss+zelnick+no+sense+game+pass+gamespot&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIJCAEQIRgKGKABMgkIAhAhGAoYoAEyCQgDECEYChigATIJCAQQIRgKGKABMgcIBRAhGKsC0gEINjUwOWowajeoAgCwAgA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">makes no economic sense to put new games on Game Pass.</a> Shannon Loftis, a former executive at Xbox, said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-downside-of-game-pass-according-to-a-former-xbox-boss/1100-6534539/" data-ref-id="1100-6534539">Game Pass eats into retail revenue.</a></p><p>Many others, meanwhile, have said Game Pass has had a major positive effect on their game releases. A top boss at the Football Manager studio said the being on subscription services has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/football-manager-player-numbers-are-through-the-roof-thanks-to-subscription-platforms-like-game-pass-and-netflix-series-boss-miles-jacobson-explains-how" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">led to skyrocketing player numbers.</a></p><p>Game Pass brought in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-nearly-hit-5-billion-in-revenue-says-microsoft/1100-6533574/" data-ref-id="1100-6533574">nearly $5 billion in annual revenue</a> for the first time recently.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> is launching a new Daft Punk Experience, but is adamant the robot rock duo aren't getting back together.</p>
<p>Unlike previous Fortnite concerts - from the likes of Marshmello, Travis Scott, and Ariana Grande - The Daft Punk Experience is instead a "fully interactive playground" in the Discover(y) mode, with multiple rooms in which to enjoy the music and lose yourself to dance.</p>
<p>That includes blasting robots with a soundwave laser in the Robot Rock Arena, remixing songs at Dream Chamber Studios, or making a Lego music video at Around the World. Some form of "afterparty" is also being teased, whatever da funk that might be.</p>
<p>"The band may be no longer, but their music lives on in Fortnite," reads a new blog post on the experience.</p>
<p>And to really hammer it home, the FAQ directly states: "The band is not getting back together". So no, you don't feel it coming - it's the end of the line.</p>
<p>It also states the experience won't feature any new music, as all songs have been previously released. Players will be able to make their own mashups though, but good luck making them harder, better, faster, or stronger.</p>
<p>The experience launches on 27th September at 2pm ET (that's 7pm UK time), but players are advised to join early. It will then be available "for a while" in Discover.</p>
<p>Of course, a Fortnite collaboration wouldn't be complete without a load of stuff to buy, either individually or as part of the Dark Punk Bundle. It includes song emotes, glittery outfits, and some adorable Lego characters so you too can be a Starboy, as well as other Jam Tracks including the duo's collaborations with The Weeknd.</p>

<p>Speaking of Lego, the first ever music-reactive build will be added to Fortnite - it's a lego pyramid that lights up when music is played.</p>
<p>Full details can be found on the <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/party-harder-better-faster-stronger-in-fortnite-with-the-daft-punk-experience">Fortnite blog</a>, so you can read up on the experience one more time.</p>
<p>Last week, Epic announced it would be giving Fortnite creators some more digital love by allowing them to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-creators-will-soon-be-able-to-sell-in-game-items-to-make-more-money-but-are-creative-mode-offerings-like-steal-a-brainrot-what-players-want">sell in-game items on their created islands</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gameplay-details-and-concept-art-for-xbox%E2%80%99s-cancelled-perfect-dark-reboot-have-leaked.1304337/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>New details regarding Xbox's cancelled Perfect Dark reboot have leaked online through a report on <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/gameplay-details-concept-screens-cancelled-perfect-dark-reboot">MP1st</a>, giving us a little more of an idea of what this game might have tried with its gameplay mechanics, the opportunity its developer The Initiative and Microsoft saw with it, and a few pieces of concept art.</p>



<p>When Microsoft announced that Perfect Dark was going to be the debut game for its new "<em>AAAA</em>" studio, The Initiative in <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-xbox-series-x-s-microsoft-game-awards-2020/">2020</a>, even if there was a sense that it was announced far too early, there was a buzz of excitement from fans. Jump ahead five years, and not only is the <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/">Perfect Dark reboot cancelled, but The Initiative is gone</a>, with the studio and its would-be debut game being one of the many major casualties from Microsoft's <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-layoffs-funding-increased-spending-ai-infrastructure/">massive 9,000+ layoff</a> this past July.</p>



<p>Before any of that happened, per MP1st's sources, Microsoft saw bringing back Perfect Dark as a chance to take advantage of the fact that two other major videogame secret agent-types were missing from the industry, namely 007 and Solid Snake. Of course, that's no longer the case, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-ps5-review-based-on-a-hideo-kojima-game/">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> putting the MGS series firmly back in players' minds and IO Interactive working up to its <a href="https://wccftech.com/007-first-light-uncharted-x-hitman-qa-narrative-drives-things/">007 First Light</a> release, but back in 2020, both series had been absent from gaming for some time.</p>



<p>Gameplay-wise, the documentation mentions three concepts called the Relentless System, the Reward System, and the Adrenaline System, though only the last of those three were detailed in the documents.</p>



<p>The Adrenaline system would have let players slow down time to dodge incoming bullets, line up their own shots, and move faster than surrounding enemies. It would also have let Joanna Dark do more damage to enemies, heal more, and reduce damage taken.</p>



<figure><figcaption>A piece of concept art from the cancelled Perfect Dark reboot via a report from MP1st.</figcaption></figure>



<p>There's also mention of a vertical slice that would have consisted of "<em>Season 1</em>" for the game, which gives some weight to rumors that the game would have had an episodic-style release, though at this point, who can say if they would have definitively gone that route.</p>



<p>Overall, to say it's unfortunate that this game never came to pass is an understatement, especially since it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-nearly-saved-take-two-deal-fell-through/">almost saved after Microsoft dropped the ball</a>. Yes, Joanna Dark no longer would have had the open window previously granted due to the absence of MGS and 007, but I doubt that anyone would have minded having three great modern stealth-action games to play. </p>



<p>Just <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-initiative-studio-head-leaves-xbox-feels-pride-perfect-dark-remake/">last week</a>, former studio head of The Initiative, Darrell Gallagher, left Xbox, and said he "<em></em><em>couldn’t be prouder of the talented and passionate team I had the privilege assemble and lead</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>I leave with nothing but pride in what we accomplished together and excitement for what’s next — both for myself and for the amazing developers I was fortunate enough to work with.</em>"</p>
