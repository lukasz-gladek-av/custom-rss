            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/sonic-x-shadow-generations-preview-crush-40-intensifies<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Sonic </em>games can be hit or miss, especially when it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/sonic-hedgehog-30-year-anniversary">comes to his 3D games</a>. <em>Sonic Generations</em> was a solid entry into the canon, and <em>Sonic x Shadow Generations</em> is bringing it back to modern consoles with a few extras.</p>
<p>Part remaster and part expansion, <em>Sonic x Shadow Generations</em> adds some Shadow levels to the game, and I got the chance to play two of them at Summer Game Fest Play Days.</p>
<p>The Shadow content felt laser-focused to appeal to fans of the old <em>Sonic Adventure</em> games here, particularly <em>Sonic Adventure 2: Battle</em>'s Team Dark campaign. It was accompanied by the kind of edgy butt rock you might expect, and I wouldn't have it any other way.</p>

<p>The first level I played was Space Colony Ark, which came with a lot of gravity-defying rail grinds and high-speed platforming. Shadow can do a homing attack, though he teleports instead of zooming into an enemy. He can also launch projectiles, though that only really felt useful in a boss fight.</p>
<p>After all, a common platforming trick in 3D <em>Sonic </em>games is using the homing attack to defeat enemies and get across gaps. The projectile just didn't feel like a useful tool in a platforming-heavy level.</p>

<p>There are some big shifts though from how these games typically go that are unique to Shadow. He can use Chaos Control, which freezes the entire level for five seconds, and it's useful for avoiding large-scale hazards or to keep certain platforms in place.</p>
<p>At some point in the level, I ran into a giant tunnel where a missile was on the other end of it. In this moment, the game gave me a full charge of Chaos Control and prompted me to use it. Then it launched into an interactive cutscene, where I had to play out a quick-time event to make Shadow beat up the missile.</p>
<p>It's kind of silly, but it also fits the edgy nature that Shadow's become known and beloved(?) for. The same sort of QTEs came up during the boss battle stage, which was against the Biolizard from <em>Sonic Adventure 2: Battle</em>.</p>

<p>The boss fight is pretty standard here; first, I played defense until an opportunity opened up, and then I homed in on the weak point to do some damage. It's nothing mind blowing, but it's serviceable and offers a good space for Shadow to say some edgy one-liners.</p>
<p>One last thing that stood out to me was the last quarter of the Space Colony Ark level, which got really psychedelic. The enemy, Doom's Eye from that old <em>Shadow the Hedgehog </em>game, transforms the stage into something straight out of <em>Dr. Strange </em>or <em>Spider-Verse</em>.</p>
<p>Mechanically, it shakes out to be a high-speed platforming section where you have to time your jumps right. But visually, it was a treat to see buildings and debris collapse, multiply, and defy the laws of time and space. If there's more weird stuff like that in the other Shadow levels, I'm excited to see more.</p>

<p>If you missed out on <em>Sonic Generations</em> or are looking for your next Shadow fix before the upcoming Paramount movie, <em>Sonic x Shadow Generations</em> is just around the corner. Keep an eye out for it when it launches on Oct. 25.</p>

            <link>https://www.polygon.com/24177114/the-imaginary-netflix-release-date-studio-ponoc</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/finally-2024-is-giving-us-a-good-imaginary-friends-movie.900327/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24177114/the-imaginary-netflix-release-date-studio-ponoc<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="w39MtB">Imaginary friends are having a moment. This year has already seen Blumhouse’s <em>Imaginary</em>, a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24093592/imaginary-review-horror-movie-blumhouse-teddy-bear-chauncey">not-so-great movie</a> about a murderous imaginary friend, and <em>IF</em>, an even-less-great movie about a whole world of imaginary friends, complete with a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24161804/if-ending-explained-john-krasinski-nostalgia-bait">fairly toxic message about childlike wonder and fantasy</a>. And now there’s <em>The Imaginary</em>, the latest anime movie from Studio Ghibli successor Studio Ponoc, founded by Ghibli veteran Yoshiaki Nishimura shortly after Studio Ghibli <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2014/8/4/5966439/studio-ghibli-shutting-down-restructuring-ni-no-kuni">announced its planned shutdown in 2014</a>. Much like <em>IF</em>, <em>The Imaginary </em>centers on a world of lost imaginary friends, and on the relationship between a young girl and the friend she created. Unlike <em>IF</em>, though, it looks pretty terrific.</p>
<p id="EU2rcx"><em>The Imaginary</em> comes to Netflix on July 5 as part of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/anime/24049777/studio-ponoc-the-imaginary-netflix-release-date">an ongoing deal between Netflix and Ponoc</a>. Based on a 2014 novel by British author A.F. Harrold, and directed by Ghibli animator Yoshiyuki Momose (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/2020/5/27/21271278/spirited-away-watch-best-studio-ghibli-movie"><em>Spirited Away</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/2020/5/29/21275119/porco-rosso-studio-ghibli-hayao-miyazaki-ending"><em>Porco Rosso</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/2020/5/28/21273717/take-me-home-country-roads-song-movies-studio-ghibli-whisper-of-the-heart"><em>Whisper of the Heart</em></a>), the movie follows Amanda and her imaginary friend Rudger, whose playful adventures through Amanda’s imagination are derailed by a predatory interloper. Here’s Netflix’s description:</p>
<blockquote><p id="GWVqEa">Studio Ponoc’s <em>The Imaginary</em> portrays the depths of humanity and creativity through the eyes of young Amanda and her imaginary companion, Rudger. Their fantastical adventures, launched from her attic, lead them to discover a magical world of creatures and places never before seen until a sinister force threatens to destroy their imaginary world and the friendship within it. Directed by renowned animator Yoshiyuki Momose (<em>Spirited Away</em>), <em>The Imaginary</em> is an unforgettable adventure of love, loss, and the healing power of imagination.</p></blockquote>
<p id="SPXf2S">This is Ponoc’s first feature-length film since its debut, 2017’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/12/16/13984298/studio-ghibli-director-new-movie-mary-and-the-witch-flower"><em>Mary and the Witch’s Flower</em></a>. Interim projects include the compilation movie <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/movies/studio-ponoc/modest-heroes"><em>Modest Heroes</em></a> (featuring three short stories, one directed by Momose), and promotional material like the lovely <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22590291/olympics-2021-anime-studio-ponoc-short-tomorrows-leaves">2021 Olympics short “Tomorrow’s Leaves,”</a> also directed by Momose. <em>The Imaginary</em> was released in December 2023 in Japan. </p>

  <p id="Uo9w0n">It’s almost as if they planned it. Hot on the heels of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_LtO6Mekjk">new trailer</a> and a wave of coverage for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24176506/monster-hunter-wilds-preview-impressions-summer-game-fest"><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em></a> out of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24164106/summer-game-fest-2024">Summer Game Fest</a>, <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/12/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-june-monster-hunter-rise-football-manager-2024-crusader-kings-iii-after-us-and-more/">Sony has announced</a> that <em>Wilds</em>’ predecessor, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22344620/monster-hunter-rise-review-switch"><em>Monster Hunter Rise</em></a>, is coming to the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog on June 18. Perfect timing, if you’re full of renewed excitement for hunting monsters and want to get your eye in ahead of the new game’s 2025 release.</p>
<p id="gAdPqJ">As a reminder, the Game Catalog is available to subscribers to the Extra and Premium tiers of PlayStation Plus.</p>
<p id="x7iclM"><em>Monster Hunter Rise </em>was a Nintendo Switch-first release in 2021, with Windows PC, PlayStation and Xbox versions following over the next couple of years. Its Switch origins are evident — it’s hardly the most graphically rich game, and visually it pales a little next to its predecessor <em>Monster Hunter World</em> — but it’s still as deep and engrossing as these games get. It’s on both PlayStation 4 and 5.</p>
<p id="2r3As1">Elsewhere, June’s Game Catalog selections incline toward sports and strategy, with games in the Crusader Kings, Anno, Football Manager, and... Monster Energy Supercross series. For a break from all that tinkering and competing, try the beautiful abstract platformer <em>After Us</em>. Here’s the full list of new additions, all coming on June 18.</p>
<ul>
<li id="7uuOVG">
<em>Monster Hunter Rise </em>(PS4, PS5)</li>
<li id="ukxvm8">
<em>Football Manager 2024 </em>(PS5)</li>
<li id="q8PW25">
<em>Crusader Kings 3</em> (PS5)</li>
<li id="brPAyA">
<em>Monster Energy Supercross — The Official Videogame 6</em> (PS4, PS5)</li>

</ul>
<p id="26LrpJ">Meanwhile, PlayStation Plus Premium subscribers also get <em>Kayak VR: Mirage</em> for PlayStation VR 2, and <em>Lego Star Wars 2, Ghosthunter</em>, and <em>Daxter</em> for the Classic library.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24177578/helldivers-2-update-notes-patch-01-000-400-stratagems-weapons-changes<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="d5m6vB">Arrowhead Game Studios issued a major update for its smash Starship Troopers simulator <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24071317/helldivers-2-starship-troopers-video-game-great"><em>Helldivers 2</em></a> on Thursday, featuring sweeping balance changes, a more informative Galactic War map, and the addition of invite-only lobbies.</p>
<p id="cO3fKl"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/4150709804553746157?l=english">Patch 01.000.400</a> begins a change of pace at Arrowhead, which <a href="https://x.com/helldivers2/status/1800166499363012867">said earlier in the week</a> that it planned to slow down the rate at which it updated the game, delivering bigger, higher-quality patches less frequently.</p>
<p id="Es3h9u">It’s certainly a substantial update. There are some new features, but the headline for <em>Helldivers 2</em> players is probably the huge set of balance changes that (mostly) buff stratagems and weapons across the game, with the goal of increasing viability and loadout variety.</p>
<p id="pRbtC7">In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/5998312279129319530?l=english">very detailed blog post</a>, Arrowhead’s chief creative officer Johan Pilestedt — evidently making good use of the time he freed up by <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1793267296682520846">resigning as the studio’s CEO</a> — laid out the thinking behind the balance changes, going into some detail on each one. </p>
<p id="lWIsY9">“With these balance changes we wanted to buff up some of the weaker stratagems to make them more viable and add more opportunity for variety in loadouts,” Pilestedt said, adding that there were few nerfs in the patch. “We also changed a few to make them more consistent, but the goal was to keep a similar or higher power level. We are looking into the stratagems more to see if there are any other stratagems that might need some buffs or changes to make them more viable.”</p>
<p id="yOdJlQ">Some examples: Several of the game’s sentry stratagems have been made more effective (and durable), the HMG emplacement and minefields have been buffed, and Orbital strikes are now more readily available and flexible in their use to make them competitive against Eagle stratagems. On the weapons side, at least eight of the game’s firearms are buffed — including the grenade launcher, HMG, explosive crossbow, Adjudicator, and Tenderizer — and changes have been made to how <em>Helldivers 2 </em>handles recoil and rifle damage to durable body parts.</p>
<p id="eWwPjw">Away from balance changes, supply lines and attack origins were made visible on the Galactic War map to give players more information on the progress of the galactic conflict; the community will now be able to see which planet an attack is originating from, and potentially be able to stop it at its source. The option to create invite-only lobbies has been added — which anyone who plays in a set group of friends will surely welcome.</p>
<p id="XqH6lh">Super samples, an important resource in the game, now drop on difficulty level 6 (they previously only dropped at levels 7 and above). “We feel that their existence only on difficulty 7+ forced some players to play the game on a harder difficulty than they wanted to comfortably play on. We do however still want a gating of them but a less punishing one,” Arrowhead said.</p>

<li id="h8qOFD">The SEAF Artillery stratagem is no longer blocked by stratagem jammers or Ion Storms, and is available after the mission timer ends and the destroyer leaves close orbit.</li>
<li id="aukhBA">Enemies in melee range of the gates in the Evacuate High-Value Assets mission will now attack it more consistently.</li>
<li id="0tFJmG">Added the ability to chat from in-game menus and mission loading screen.</li>
<li id="Pwjzb9">Updated some first person crosshairs to improve readability.</li>
</ul>
<p id="hQFp3r"><strong>Social</strong></p>
<ul><li id="9CHLzy">Invite-Only lobbies are now supported</li></ul>
<p id="A06ewV"><strong>Armors</strong></p>
<ul><li id="JuviNK">New armor passive Peak Physique (+50% melee damage, +30% weapon ergonomics)</li></ul>
<p id="ZKgzAU"><strong>Planets &amp; Hazards</strong></p>
<p id="Jns6rx">Spike Plant</p>
<ul>
<li id="1yg5Bu">The spike plant that appears on certain planets has been reworked.</li>
<li id="w0HW64">No longer causes bleed or stamina drain if hit by the plant explosion or spikes.</li>
<li id="uDn0r5">Now “pops” three times sending spikes everywhere, dealing increased damage.</li>
</ul>
<p id="SYLhhd">Fire Tornados</p>
<ul>
<li id="BXl6ef">Fire tornados have had their behavior changed, they should no longer feel like they actively respond to player movement, and should move more randomly.</li>
<li id="kRJZFe">While a fire tornado storm takes place, enemy vision is reduced. Player vision is unaffected.</li>
</ul>
<p id="x3yl4e">*Fire tornados being more random should result in more variance in situations players find themselves in. Tornados are significantly less likely to pile up and overlap on extraction points or objectives, and will generally be a bit easier to deal with.</p>
<p id="IFi03P">Tremors</p>
<ul>
<li id="w0HPpI">Tremors have had their spawning tweaked to be slightly more random.</li>
<li id="sTvgqv">Tremors have had their epicenter size and effect range increased.</li>
</ul>
<p id="Xtiuvy">*These changes should result in more situations where enemies away from the player get stunned, as well as reducing how consistently the player has a tremor occur next to them.</p>
<p id="eucDiS">Ion Storms</p>
<ul><li id="ViusTY">Added additional VFX for Ion Storms.</li></ul>
<p id="qDGUF5">Visibility</p>
<p id="T0ed27">A lot of planets have had their fog amounts tweaked to be a bit less harsh and dense, to provide less fatigue from constantly fighting on planets with bad visibility. We still intend there to be foggy planets with worse visibility, but the balance was a bit off.</p>
<ul>
<li id="TDYexm">Desert planets such as Erata Prime, Chort Bay, Hellmire, and similar.</li>
<li id="zhiUrq">Highlands planets such as Varylia 5, Matar Bay, Oshaune, and similar.</li>
<li id="WIoSqb">Artificial light sources have had their intensity rebalanced and reduced across the board to fix situations of lights completely blinding the player.</li>
</ul>
<p id="1eTvKu">Unexploded Hellbomb</p>
<ul><li id="95ZBaW">The unexploded malfunctioning hellbombs that can sometimes be found on planets will now explode immediately if hit with strong explosions or heavy weaponry. They will still have the same delay if hit by small arms fire or weaker attacks.</li></ul>
<p id="JVQ79i">Vegetation</p>
<ul><li id="deym20">Vegetation that’s large enough to slow the player now has an extra function. When inside the vegetation helldivers will be harder to detect, reducing their detection range by enemies. This effect stacks with other detection reducing effects such as nighttime, being crouched or prone, or things such as the scout armor passive.</li></ul>
<p id="xCEbYw"><strong>Enemies</strong></p>
<p id="FBFOpf">Acid Effect</p>
<ul><li id="kSgRXO">The acid effect applied by hunters, bug mines, etc. now allows you to sprint while under the effect and slows you by 30% instead of 50%. Duration has been increased from 3 to 4 seconds. These changes are intended to make it less punishing for players to be slowed while fighting the Terminids, This allows us to use it in more places without making the experience very punishing, for example the Bile Spewers.</li></ul>
<p id="31kt8h">Armored enemy balance</p>
<ul><li id="SVJU5h">We have toned down the amount of heavily armored enemies like Bile Titans, Chargers on higher difficulties and instead spawn more hordes of smaller enemies, the difference should be quite noticeable and the amount should be at least 30% less than before during bug breaches. We have also toned down slightly how many Hulks that spawn for the Automatons. Our intent is to ease up on the demand of anti-tank weapons and by having more of the other enemies give a better incentive for the group to bring stratagems and weapons that take care of hordes.</li></ul>
<p id="mJBrYj">Patrols</p>
<ul><li id="iSvHAa">Patrol spawning is now back to how it worked before patch 01.000.300 with some slight tweaks so that the levels are less empty if you are far away from important locations with enemy presence.</li></ul>
<p id="7EqYUL">Stunning</p>
<ul><li id="rlLTCY">Medium and large sized enemies now don’t get stunned as easily. This will not affect the stratagems that stun, and will mostly just affect how easily the Pummeler can stun larger enemies</li></ul>
<p id="kF5CVL"><strong>Terminids</strong></p>
<p id="eSi0P2">Bile Spewer and Nursing Spewer</p>
<ul>
<li id="oYKSPb">Spewers will now get slowed if they lose their legs.</li>
<li id="PujKZF">Spewer puke now applies the acid effect.</li>
<li id="J7kgyt">Spewer puke now can only damage helldivers up to 4 times per second and the helldiver cannot take damage multiple times from the same projectile. This should reduce instances where you are instantly killed by it.</li>
</ul>
<p id="Th4T2R">Bile Titan</p>
<ul>
<li id="q7CpEP">The Bile Titan’s head is slightly less durable against weaker anti-tank weapons. It’s not a large change, and will mostly matter for weapons like the railgun.</li>
<li id="nxVZVS">The Bile Titan’s puke can now only damage the helldiver 4 times per second and the helldiver cannot take damage multiple times from the same projectile. The damage is still very deadly so running through their puke is not recommended. Their puke now also has a bigger spread.</li>
</ul>
<p id="t8h4FS">Charger Behemoth</p>
<ul><li id="cA4XM4">The Charger Behemoth is now joining the battle on higher difficulties, it can now also take more damage than before. This enables us to spawn fewer chargers but still retain the difficulty.</li></ul>
<p id="kJEAhZ">Chargers</p>
<ul><li id="KEsgBV">Will now only show bleedout effects from the body if the bleedout state has started. It can still show bleedout effects from the mouth without having started the bleedout state.</li></ul>
<p id="43IGfW"><strong>Automatons</strong></p>
<p id="aay8z8">Hulk Scorcher</p>
<ul><li id="u9hofm">The Hulk’s flamethrower now does less damage and cannot damage helldivers more than 4 times per second. In addition, the helldiver cannot be damaged multiple times by the same flame projectile. This should reduce instances where you are instantly killed by it.</li></ul>
<p id="CcpKVl">Automaton Tanks</p>
<ul>
<li id="Q1Pp5C">The Tank armor value on the front has been lowered to be the same as the non-vent sections on the rear of the tank. The intent was initially that it was supposed to be more armored in the front, but the visual language did not show that.</li>
<li id="SJFLhm">The vents on the back of the Tanks turret still has the same armor value as before, but will check for explosion directions correctly now.</li>
<li id="AhBpk6">The damage of exploding automaton jump packs has been decreased by 50%, it will still set you on fire though.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="lNyWTD"><strong>Galactic War</strong></h3>
<p id="xSVa0d"><strong>Introducing Supply Lines &amp; Origin of Attacks</strong></p>
<p id="PNjRkX">Supply lines were previously not shown on the Galactic War map to reduce clutter and improve readability. However based on the feedback from our community we have made an implementation showing them on the map. This solution tries to maintain the general readability while still exposing the system to players in game.</p>
<p id="uPVFU3">You will now also be able to see which planet an attack is originating from, potentially allowing for the community to stop the attack at its source. We have also updated visuals in the sector and planet info pop-ups.</p>
<h3 id="HyBWto"><strong>Fixes</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li id="dmlJFT">The FAF-14 Spear targeting has been reworked and should now function much better. However it has lost the ability to target Automaton Spawners, this is not intended and will be fixed in the future.</li>
<li id="7ocMl8">Intense Heat and Extreme Cold environmental modifiers will now affect the Quasar Cannon’s reload speed and will show correctly in the HUD.</li>
<li id="qDDGZ3">Reload speed on Cold planets -2.5 sec</li>
<li id="Es1xOs">Reload speed on Hot planets +2.5 sec</li>
<li id="ILcs41">The radar pulse that detects enemies on the mini-map is now visible.</li>
<li id="QXaF9y">Most of Automatons weapons have now gotten tighter limits to how much the projectile they shoot can deviate from its weapons muzzle angle. What this means is that situations where devastators shoot sideways and similar should be fixed.</li>
<li id="lTG66j">The weapons of the Exosuits are now allowed small adjustments in the angle they fire their projectiles versus their muzzle angle. This should make their weapons more accurate.</li>
<li id="2IYoRq">Ballistic shield now collides with grenades.</li>
<li id="lrdOcW">The unblock button should no longer disappear from the social menu.</li>
<li id="sL3PzI">Blocked players can no longer join the blockers lobby through recent players.</li>

<li id="GfYxmj">Fixed issue where the player can throw an unlimited amount of grenades by pressing the “Quick grenade” button right after closing the Stratagem menu.</li>
<li id="9ixvky">Helldiver now also switches to the last active weapon when out of grenades, fixing the issue where they would be holding a stratagem ball without the stratagem menu being open.</li>
<li id="PmVqY3">Fixed some text overlap in various locations.</li>
<li id="Lho7Jj">The burning effect applied to the player when a combat walker dies is now a normal burn. The intent is that you should be able to escape it alive. But you will be on fire so hit the ground!</li>
<li id="PI12ow">The extraction shuttle can no longer take damage preventing extraction. New high grade materials directly from Super Earth R&amp;D have been utilized.</li>
<li id="Z5jgbG">On PC you can now navigate the super credits menu with “WASD” keys</li>

<p>A new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38Xzz5BQhE4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reveal trailer</a> via IGN revealed Peni Parker gameplay for Marvel Rivals, the anticipated team-based superhero shooter from NetEase Games.</p>



<p>The trailer is brief, but it describes Peni Parker as a vanguard and showcases combat involving the signature SP//dr mech-suit. </p>



<p>Much of the footage features mobility such as wall climbing and dashing. However, there’s also a glimpse of a transformed SP//dr with “Spider Sweep” and “Arachno-Mine” abilities. </p>



<p>These appear to include a Naruto-style run, and further emphasize the role Peni Parker will have in Marvel Rivals.</p>



<p>Today’s Peni Parker trailer concludes by reminding players that a Closed Beta for Marvel Rivals is coming in July 2024.</p>

</p></figure>







<p>Like the rest of the roster, Peni Parker is a fan favorite character. However, they likely gained mainstream popularity following the animated Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse film.</p>



<p>During PlayStation’s recent State of Play, NetEase Games confirmed Marvel Rivals is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-announced-for-console-at-playstation-state-of-play/">coming to consoles</a>. It will also boast a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/which-characters-are-in-marvel-rivals-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">massive roster of characters</a> for players to choose from, including Spider-Man, Storm, and more.</p>



<p>Early on, NetEase Games faced some backlash after restricting criticism during the closed alpha test. However, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-team-apologizes-for-restricting-criticism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">devs later apologized</a>, and the game is building plenty of renewed hype ahead of the closed beta.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals does not currently have a release window or date. It will be available on PC via Steam, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

<h2 id="h-full-the-finals-season-3-patch-notes">Full The Finals Season 3 Patch Notes</h2>



<blockquote>
<h2 id="h-balance-changes">Balance Changes</h2>



<h3 id="h-builds">Builds</h3>



<p>Light</p>



<ul>
<li>Decreased health regeneration delay from 10 seconds to 7 seconds, meaning health starts regenerating sooner. Does not apply in the Terminal Attack game mode</li>
</ul>



<p>Dev Note: The dynamics of Terminal Attack mode, with its limited health regen up to 100 HP, means that the Light archetype with their precise and high DPS weapons, can be very effective later in rounds. For that reason, we’ve chosen not to extend these new health regen rules to Terminal Attack for now. We’ll monitor these changes closely, as the season develops and adjust where needed.</p>



<p>Medium</p>



<ul>
<li>Decreased health regeneration delay from 10 seconds to 9 seconds, meaning health starts regenerating sooner. Does not apply in Terminal Attack game mode</li>



<li>Healing Beam has been replaced with Guardian Turret as the default Medium Specialization</li>



<li>Defibrillator has been replaced with Glitch Trap as one of the default Medium Gadgets<br>Dev note: As Terminal Attack becomes the Ranked mode, we want to make sure new players have a loadout that works in all modes. Healing-focused items are still available.</li>
</ul>



<p>Specializations</p>



<p>Goo Gun</p>



<ul>
<li>Getting hit by goo will now block movement Specializations such as Evasive Dash, except Charge ‘n Slam</li>
</ul>



<p>Winch Claw</p>



<ul>
<li>Decreased max range from 20m to 17m</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>Increased cooldown when missing targets from 6s to 7s</li>



<li>Increased cooldown when hitting carriables or teammate’s statues from 6s to 7s</li>



<li>Increased cooldown when hitting players, Cashout Stations or Terminals from 12s to 14s</li>
</ul>



<p>Gadgets</p>



<p>Breach Charge</p>



<ul>
<li>Increased ammo count from 1 to 2</li>



<li>Increased cooldown from 15s to 26s</li>



<li>Decreased player damage from 200 to 80</li>
</ul>



<p>Data Reshaper</p>



<ul>
<li>Increased ammo count from 1 to 2</li>



<li>Increased cooldown from 15s to 26s</li>
</ul>



<p>Gas Grenade</p>



<ul>
<li>Increased radius from 4.5m to 5m</li>
</ul>



<p>Glitch Trap – ITEM REWORK</p>



<ul>
<li>Glitch trap is no longer a proximity detonation device</li>



<li>Glitch trap now has a line-of-sight application. If an enemy player stands within range and in line-of-sight to the trap it will attach a tether to them. Tethered players have the Glitch effect applied to them, preventing them from using Specializations and Gadgets, and disrupting their HUD. Players will need to break the line of sight to the trap, destroy it, or get out of range of it, to remove the effect.</li>
</ul>



<p>Goo Grenade</p>



<ul>
<li>Increased the size of the goo wall created by the Goo Grenade from 2×4 to 2×6</li>



<li>Getting hit by goo will now block Evasive Dash and Grapple Hook</li>
</ul>



<p>Guardian Turret</p>



<ul>
<li>The cooldown regeneration on the Guardian Turret now starts when the turret is destroyed, not when it is deployed.</li>



<li>Added the ability for players to remotely destroy their Guardian Turret, allowing them to trigger the cooldown if their turret is not nearby. This is done by equipping the Specialization again and holding an interaction for a brief duration.</li>
</ul>



<p>Motion Sensor – ITEM REWORK</p>



<ul>
<li>Motion Sensor no longer sends out impulses at regular intervals for detection</li>



<li>Motion Sensor now has line-of-sight application. If an enemy player stands within range and in line-of-sight to the device, the sensor will attach a tether to them. Tethered players will be scanned by the Motion Sensor, allowing friendly players to see them through walls. Players will need to break the line of sight to the sensor or destroy it, to remove the scanning effect.</li>
</ul>



<p>Smoke Grenade</p>



<ul>
<li>Increased ammo count from 2 to 3</li>



<li>Increased cooldown from 45s to 50s</li>
</ul>



<p>Sonar Grenade</p>



<ul>
<li>Increased detection radius from 10m to 15m</li>
</ul>



<p>Stun Gun</p>



<ul>
<li>Players are now unable to use Specializations while the Glitch status is applied</li>
</ul>



<p>Weapons</p>



<p>93R</p>



<ul>
<li>Updated recoil pattern, making the weapon much easier to control and hopefully making headshots easier to achieve</li>
</ul>



<p>Dev Note: To increase viability for the 93R, we’ve made it considerably more precise but lowered the DPS slightly to offset that. Our aim is to make the weapon more effective when using precise aim and going for headshots, and we’ll continue to monitor its performance following these changes.</p>



<ul>
<li>Decreased fire rate from 260 RPM to 210 RPM</li>



<li>Decreased automatic recoil recovery duration from 0.72s to 0.7s, making the weapon easier to control</li>



<li>Increased the damage fall-off start distance from 15m to 23m, meaning the weapon will do max damage at longer ranges now</li>



<li>Increased the damage fall-off max distance from 22m to 35m, increasing the range before damage fall-off is fully applied</li>



<li>Decreased the damage fall-off multiplier at max range from 65% to 45%, meaning the weapon will do less damage at longer ranges now</li>
</ul>



<p>CL-40</p>



<ul>
<li>Decreased damage from 110 to 93</li>



<li>Increased fire rate from 250 RPM to 275 RPM</li>



<li>Decreased pump-action duration from 0.7s to 0.65s</li>



<li>Decreased self-damage multiplier from 1 to 0.75, reducing how much damage the grenades do to the player using them</li>
</ul>



<p>FAMAS</p>



<ul>
<li>Decreased automatic recoil recovery duration from 1s to 0.8s, making the weapon easier to control</li>



<li>Decreased the delay before recoil recovery begins from 0.8s to 0.7s, making the weapon easier to control</li>



<li>Increased damage from 23 to 24</li>
</ul>



<p>KS-23</p>



<ul>
<li>Decreased pump-action duration from 0.7s to 0.575s</li>
</ul>



<p>Lewis Gun</p>



<ul>
<li>Further updated recoil pattern, making the weapon easier to control for the first few bullets in the sequence, but making the weapon recoil more the longer the trigger is held</li>



<li>Decreased damage from 25 to 22</li>
</ul>



<p>LH1</p>



<ul>
<li>Updated firing animation, which should make the weapon easier to use</li>



<li>Decreased fire rate from 300 RPM to 280 RPM</li>



<li>Decreased bullet dispersion when crouching and standing still, making the weapon more precise</li>



<li>Increased player damage from 49 to 52</li>
</ul>



<p>Dev Note: Overall the effective damage of the LH1 should remain roughly the same, but it should now be easier to use, less nauseating, and more precise when standing still, as well as incentivizing headshots. The lower RPM should help make it feel distinct and make it easier to maintain targets in sights</p>



<p>M60</p>



<ul>
<li>Updated recoil pattern, making the weapon recoil more during the first few bullets, but making it easier to control for the rest of the sequence</li>



<li>Decreased damage from 22 to 19</li>
</ul>



<p>SH1900</p>



<ul>
<li>Increased damage from 10 to 13 per pellet</li>



<li>Decreased fire rate from 100 RPM to 80 RPM</li>



<li>Increased the size of the pellet dispersion pattern, making the weapon less accurate at range</li>
</ul>



<p>Dev Note: We’ve wanted for a while to make the SH1900 more effective against Heavies without making it oppressive for Lights. With higher pellet dispersion the SH1900 is now optimized for very close range only, which has allowed us to buff the damage, hopefully making Heavies easier to kill. This is a change we will be monitoring closely to measure its impact</p>



<p>Sledgehammer</p>



<ul>
<li>Updated camera animation when sprinting, which should reduce motion sickness for some players</li>
</ul>



<p>Throwing Knives</p>



<ul>
<li>Decreased projectile speed of primary attacks from 16.5 m/s to 14.75 m/s</li>



<li>Decreased projectile air drag of primary attacks from 7.5 to 7, allowing the projectile to travel farther</li>



<li>Increased projectile speed of secondary attacks from 13.8 m/s to 18.5 m/s</li>



<li>Increased projectile air drag of secondary attacks from 4 to 5.5, increasing the speed at which the projectile slows down<br>Dev note: Our last balance changes on the Throwing Knives pushed them in the right direction but ultimately felt too powerful, changing the weapon’s character too much. We have here dialed down the velocity of the regular projectiles so that leading your throws becomes a requirement again, but not to the same extent as before the last changes. Similarly we sped up the secondary projectiles so that they become a more long-range option with a focus on timing rather than leading.</li>
</ul>



<p>V9S</p>



<ul>
<li>Increased damage from 36 to 37</li>
</ul>



<p>Carriables</p>



<p>Glitch Barrel</p>



<ul>
<li>Decreased radius from 6m to 3.5m</li>
</ul>



<p>Goo Barrel</p>



<ul>
<li>Decreased the size of the goo wall created by the Goo Barrel from 2×6 to 2×4</li>
</ul>



<p>Toxic Gas Barrel</p>



<ul>
<li>Decreased radius from 5m to 3.5m</li>
</ul>



<p>Dev note: Overall, we’ve seen a low use of certain gadgets when there are overlapping items available in the arena. Therefore, we are swapping some values around on arena items and gadgets to ensure the latter have a stronger effect while still ensuring players can adapt to different situations even when out of gadget charges.</p>



<p>Game Modes</p>



<p>Terminal Attack</p>



<ul>
<li>Players must now interact with the terminal in order to deliver the decryption key, rather than throwing it into the terminal</li>
</ul>



<p>Dev Note:</p>



<p>It was too easy for attacking teams to rush a terminal and throw in the key to start a decryption, without needing to secure the objective first. This change should force attacking teams to seize the area around the terminal to start decrypting.</p>



<ul>
<li>Increased the throw distance of the decryption key now that it cannot be thrown into the terminal, allowing for more passing of the key</li>



<li>Added ‘warm-up zones’ to Terminal Attack, limiting where players can move to for the first 25 seconds of the match. This provides more time for the defending team to prepare</li>



<li>Carriable canisters now respawn at the start of each round in Terminal Attack, making sure each team gets access to the same amount each round</li>



<li>The specific combinations of team and objective spawn locations in Ranked Terminal Attack now occur in the same sequence in both halves of the match, making matches fairer.</li>



<li>Added unique names to all terminal locations in the arenas, these are displayed when looking at the terminals and in the lobby screen</li>



<li>Added a player count notification when contestants are eliminated</li>



<li>Added icons in the arena and to the HUD to highlight eliminated teammates and their location</li>



<li>Added Ranked Terminal Attack mode with a best of 13, first to 7 format</li>



<li>In Ranked Terminal Attack, if the match starts without full teams, the game will be automatically abandoned early and players will return to the queue. This is done to ensure games start in a good condition</li>



<li>Added a half-time reset of destruction to Ranked Terminal Attack mode, so that both teams have the same starting conditions as their opponents when defending or attacking</li>
</ul>



<p>Maps</p>



<p>Las Vegas</p>



<ul>
<li>Updated Terminal Attack spawn scenarios</li>
</ul>



<p>Monaco</p>



<ul>
<li>Updated Terminal Attack spawn scenarios</li>
</ul>



<p>Skyway Stadium</p>



<ul>
<li>Added to the Terminal Attack map pool</li>



<li>Tweaked the Power Shift related spawn points inside the Construction area so that players are better oriented toward the platform’s path</li>
</ul>



<p>SYS$Horizon</p>



<ul>
<li>Updated Terminal Attack spawn scenarios</li>
</ul>



<p>Content and Bug Fixes</p>



<p>Animation</p>



<ul>
<li>Added inspect animation for carriables</li>



<li>Blocked left arm gestures in third-person when riding ziplines</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where bullets clipped with the mesh when reloading XP-54</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where the first throw animation on Gateway sometimes didn’t play properly</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where an immediate melee attack was not properly displayed after using a Mesh Shield</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where your contestant was not centered during the “tunnel run” match intro</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where melee animations were sometimes not shown when exiting the emote camera.<br>Dev Note: This was a purely visual error, melee timings were not affected by this bug.</li>
</ul>



<p>Audio</p>



<ul>
<li>The audience has been reworked and will now be more responsive to various events in the arena and cheer for the contestants</li>
</ul>



<p>Career Rank</p>



<ul>
<li>Added 10 new Career ranks with associated rewards<br></li>
</ul>



<p>Fire Propagation</p>



<ul>
<li>Added a distance limit to all fire sources, to prevent fire from spreading infinitely</li>
</ul>



<p>Gameplay</p>



<ul>
<li>Made it possible to skip the elimination camera after a short while and go directly to spectating teammates</li>
</ul>



<p>Game Modes</p>



<ul>
<li>Added a dedicated Spectator slot to Private Matches</li>



<li>Updated available game modes
<ul>
<li>“Terminal Attack” remains as a base mode</li>



<li>Added “Terminal Attack – Ranked”</li>



<li>Added “Terminal Attack – Tutorial”</li>



<li>Added “World Tour” mode</li>



<li>Removed “Single Round Cashout”</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Added more info to the game summary screen
<ul>
<li>Team name</li>



<li>Game mode</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Disabled the Deathmatch game show event as it was not working as intended</li>
</ul>



<p>Maps</p>



<p>New map: Kyoto</p>



<ul>
<li>Available in Quick Cash, Tournaments, Bank It, Power Shift and Terminal Attack game modes</li>



<li>Features shallow water that will slow the player’s movement speed, making it risky to cross large open bodies of water</li>



<li>Shoji paper walls that allow bullets to pass through easily</li>
</ul>



<p>Settings</p>



<ul>
<li>New volume slider in settings for changing the commentator dialogue volume separately from the in-world dialogue</li>
</ul>



<p>Store</p>



<ul>
<li>Enabled single-item purchases for bundles from previous seasons<br></li>
</ul>



<p>UI</p>



<ul>
<li>Text chat added to the PC version</li>



<li>Player cards
<ul>
<li>Added background customization</li>



<li>Added badges that display your rank in World Tour and Ranked Mode</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Updated the end-of-round screen to include player cards and to highlight stats</li>



<li>Added a shortcut button to the Play menu from the Career screen</li>



<li>Added a cooldown for the event log when spamming pings and voice lines</li>



<li>Updated event log messages for various types of pings
<ul>
<li>Updated event log messages related to Cashouts and Terminals to be consistent and always include information about which objective was pinged</li>



<li>Added missing event log messages for certain pings on various objectives, like Cashboxes and Decryption Keys</li>



<li>“Attacking here” ping wheel action was renamed to “Attack here”</li>



<li>“Defending here” ping wheel action was renamed to “Defend here”</li>



<li>Updated “Attack Here” and “Defend Here” event log messages to match the character voice lines</li>



<li>Added event log message when pinging ziplines</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>It’s now possible to zoom in on pets in the Battle Pass and Store screens</li>



<li>Temporarily disabled the re-rolling of Daily Contracts</li>
</ul>



<p>Dev Note: We currently have a very small pool of Daily Contracts and felt it was unfair for players to spend VRs to re-roll a contract to only keep getting limited options in return. We hope to introduce more Contracts during the season and then re-enable re-rolls at some point when they offer more value.</p>



<p>Weapons</p>



<ul>
<li>Added Season 3 items
<ul>
<li>Thermal Bore – Light Gadget</li>



<li>Recurve Bow – Light Weapon</li>



<li>Dual Blades – Medium Weapon</li>



<li>Winch Claw – Heavy Specialization</li>



<li>Spear – Heavy Weapon</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Updated several Equipment HUD Icons:
<ul>
<li>All Grenades</li>



<li>All Mines</li>



<li>C4</li>



<li>Breach Charge</li>



<li>APS Turret</li>



<li>Barricade</li>



<li>Motion Sensor</li>



<li>Thermal Vision</li>



<li>Riot Shield</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Added 1 more progression level, with associated reward, for all weapons and gadgets. All item based Specializations (e.g. Guardian Turret or Goo Gun) also received this.</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where equipped charms would disappear when standing close to walls</li>



<li>Fixed emote animation exploit with the Sword which allowed multiple lunches in rapid succession.</li>
</ul>



<p>Dev note: While these moves discovered by players increase the effectiveness of some melee weapons, they are ultimately exploits and ones that most players find hard to use or unintuitive, adding confusion to the game (especially for those on the receiving end).</p>



<p>Security</p>



<ul>
<li>Updates to our Aimbot detection system</li>



<li>In-game reporting feedback – We’ll inform players who report unfair gameplay when appropriate actions have been taken.</li>
</ul>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/league-of-legends/" data-ref-id="5000-40335">League of Legends</a>' controversial <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/league-of-legends-gets-450-bundle-fans-react-with-shock/1100-6523790/" data-ref-id="1100-6523790">Immortalized Legend Ahri skin</a> is available now for those with a spare $250-$450 to spend, and fans are still not happy about it. Game director Pu "PuPuLasers" Liu spoke with <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/league-of-legends/ahri-skin-backlash-justified" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PCGamesN</a> about the backlash, saying it's "justified."</p><p>"People were very upset about it, not just a little," Liu acknowledged in the interview, adding, "I also think it's kind of justified." He noted that with the game being over a decade old, League of Legends players are "used to everything living under a certain price point." </p><p>Despite that, he defended the expensive bundle, explaining that products priced at this level were a rarity, and even taking some time to explain how they fit in with League of Legends' monetization strategy as a whole.</p><p>"These kind of products are designed for a very small percentage of our players to be able to purchase and flex," he explained. "In terms of what role [they're] going to play in our portfolio of skin products moving forward, it will continue [to be] a very small minority. I think last year we probably released over 130 or 140 skins, of which less than a handful were priced at that point. I would expect it to continue to be a minority rather than a majority."</p><p>"It's very important that we share with our players the situation that League of Legends is in," Liu continued. "It's a game that's competitively orientated; we only sell cosmetics, we don't want anything that even infringes upon pay-to-win or pay-for-power. As a consequence of that, the vast majority of our players play League, watch esports, enjoy all the content, cinematics, and music for $0. The majority of our revenue comes from a small, single digit percentage of players; it's just the reality that the hobbyist deep spenders are a disproportionate amount of business viability."</p><p>Liu shared some of the thought that went into pricing the premium-level bundle "on the morality side," comparing it to Warhammer fans who spend $200 a month on their hobby. He added that Riot prefers to target cosmetic items to those players who already have a history of spending in-game, rather than trying to convert players who aren't currently spending.</p><p>"We believe there's such a thing as having too high a percentage of your players spending on a free-to-play game," Liu adds. "That means your free-to-play experience relative to your paid experience is not good enough."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRM0yZvVn2E" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hRM0yZvVn2E" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The contentious skin, Immortalized Legend Ahri, was revealed as part of the Hall of Legends event created this year to honor Faker, one of the game's most successful and well-known esports players. The skin can only be bought in a bundle--either the $250 Immortalized Legend collection, which includes the skin along with a number of unique VFX and extra cosmetic items, or the $450 Signature Legend collection, which adds even more exclusive effects to the skin, more exclusive cosmetics, and a handful of chromas for other Faker-related skins.</p><p>The skin is so extravagant--with unique voice overs, animations, and other visual effects--that Riot created a new skin tier called Transcendent just to describe it. The previous highest tier is called Ultimate, with each Ultimate skin costing around $23.</p><p>The high price of the new skin celebrating one of the game's most popular figures <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/league-of-legends-gets-450-bundle-fans-react-with-shock/1100-6523790/" data-ref-id="1100-6523790">didn't sit right with fans</a>, with many promising to permaban Ahri in retaliation, and others pointing out the irony of releasing a $450 skin to celebrate a player who famously doesn't use skins in matches.</p><p>The Hall of Legends event is live now and will run until July 8.</p>

<p data-characters="264" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>My Time at Sandrock</em>, the life-sim adventure game from Pathea, received an update on June 13 including some vital preparations for upcoming <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/my-time-at-sandrock-multiplayer-and-cross-platform-support-coming-this-summer/">cross-platform multiplayer</a>, which will arrive later in the Summer. But that’s not all that was included in the patch.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="268" data-current-count="268" data-injectable="false">While the patch mostly dealt with bug-fixes and balancing issues, there are some new and exciting things coming to <em>Sandrock</em>. The patch went live at 2:50 a.m. EST / 11:50 p.m. PST, so you’ll have fresh updates waiting for you if you’re just diving in to play.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="235" data-current-count="503" data-injectable="true">Although there is no set date for the arrival of the cross-platform multiplayer feature as of yet, this update is setting the process in motion, meaning that players on all platforms will soon be able to link up and adventure together.</p>

 <ul data-found-items="10" data-current-count="400" data-injectable="true"> <li>Optimized how NPCs react to gifts</li> <li>Optimised game memory usage, CPU time consumption and improved rendering in order to improve performance and visuals</li> <li>Scarab Wings can now be acquired</li> <li>Tourist NPC will no longer get stuck at Shonash Bridge</li> <li>Flag will no longer disappear during “The Flying Daggers” mission</li> <li>Doors and stairs will no longer disappear when changing interior wallpaper or house style</li> <li>Stairs can now be moved during home renovations</li> <li>Mahjong mini-game will no longer get stuck due to AI calculation errors</li> <li>NPCs will now follow players into the game center during dates</li> <li>Players can now play Bubble Dragon during dates</li> </ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/warframe-best-railjack-build/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=warframe-best-railjack-build<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="211" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Getting the best build for your Railjack in <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/warframe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warframe</a> </em>is quite the task. The play style and flow are quite different from the base game, but you still may want to get it up to snuff with the rest of your arsenal.</p> <p data-characters="117" data-current-count="117" data-injectable="false">With that said, here is an entire breakdown of what you should be looking for to get a strong and versatile Railjack.</p> <h2 id="h-best-railjack-build-in-warframe" data-injectable="false">Best Railjack build in <em>Warframe</em></h2> <p data-characters="215" data-current-count="332" data-injectable="false">To start off, let’s go with the Plexus mod setup you will want to use for your ship. We’ll go through the three sections as well, including the Integrated, Battle, and Tactical setups on the top of the mod menu:</p> <p data-characters="10" data-current-count="342" data-injectable="false"><strong>Integrated</strong></p> <p data-characters="21" data-current-count="363" data-injectable="false"><strong>Aura:</strong> Ironclad Matrix</p> <ul data-found-items="8" data-current-count="683" data-injectable="true"> <li>Forward Artillery</li> <li>Conic Nozzle</li> <li>Hyperstrike</li> <li>Ion Burn</li> <li>Ordnance Cheap Shot</li> <li>Section Density</li> <li>Predator</li> <li>Waveband Disruptor</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="132" data-current-count="132" data-injectable="false">With this setup, your Railjack will have great survivability, turret damage output, and sustainable Ordnance. Now for the abilities:</p> <p data-characters="6" data-current-count="138" data-injectable="false"><strong>Battle</strong></p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="258" data-injectable="false"> <li>Blackout Pulse</li> <li>Tether</li> <li>Seeker Volley</li> </ul> <p data-characters="246" data-current-count="504" data-injectable="true">To properly play this setup, you want to use Blackout Pulse to disable Crewships. Use Tether on low and mid-level fighters to group them up and deal huge damage to them. At all levels, you can use Seeker Volley to destroy multiple fighters.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="34" data-current-count="34" data-injectable="false">And finally for the Tactical mods:</p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="154" data-injectable="false"> <li>Form Up</li> <li>Battle Stations</li> <li>Void Cloak</li> </ul> <p data-characters="176" data-current-count="330" data-injectable="false">You won’t be using these too often unless you find yourself in a dire situation. They’re nice to have in a pinch, but the cooldowns are very long, so use them in rotations.</p> <p data-characters="58" data-current-count="388" data-injectable="false">Now for the ship’s actual components, use the following:</p> <ul data-found-items="7" data-current-count="668" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Shield:</strong> Zetki Shield Array MKIII</li> <li><strong>Engines: </strong>Vidar Engines MKIII</li> <li><strong>Plating:</strong> Vidar Plating MKIII</li> <li><strong>Reactor:</strong> Vidar Reactor MKIII</li> <li><strong>Turret 1:</strong> Vidar Pulsar MKIII</li> <li><strong>Turret 2: </strong>Zetki Vort MKIII</li> <li><strong>Ordnance:</strong> Tycho Seeker MKIII</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="284" data-current-count="284" data-injectable="false">While it may take a while to get every variant of these to MKII, it’s what you should be building up to. The setup is boosted by the earlier mod setup, making your Railjack have great damage output, survivability, and mobility. It’s also a versatile setup against all enemy types.</p> <figure data-current-count="584" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-the-best-crew-for-railjack" data-injectable="false">The best crew for Railjack</h2> <p data-characters="236" data-current-count="236" data-injectable="false">Finally, for your crew. If you’re a solo player and need a few extra hands on deck, you can recruit new members from Ticker <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/where-is-fortuna-in-warframe-how-to-access-fortuna-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Fortuna</a>. It’ll cost a hefty amount of resources to hire the top-notch ones, but the payoff is worth it.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="209" data-current-count="445" data-injectable="true">Look for crew members who have high stats in Repair, Combat, and Endurance. They can do all the stuff to maintain the Railjack on the inside as you can easily clear fighters and Crewships at the cockpit.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="205" data-current-count="205" data-injectable="false">Finally, equip all of your crew with AoE weapons with strong mod setups. For some reason, they don’t run out of ammo and can destroy high-level enemies with ease, especially if their Combat stat is high.</p> <p data-characters="108" data-current-count="313" data-injectable="false">Of course, to also achieve this, you want to upgrade your Intrinsics with Railjack to all tens if you can.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="360" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">After that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/dragon-age-the-veilguards-gameplay-needs-to-win-back-fans-as-reveal-trailer-reaches-198000-youtube-dislikes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">less than popular reveal trailer</a> for <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> at the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/everything-shown-at-the-xbox-games-showcase-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Games Showcase</a>, the subsequent gameplay demonstration on June 11 was BioWare’s chance to win favour back with displeased fans. At the very least, <em>Dragon Age</em> series creator David Gaider likes what he saw, saying the development team have done a “great job.”</p> <p data-characters="592" data-current-count="592" data-injectable="true">Gaider, who served as lead writer on the <em>Dragon Age</em> games until he left BioWare in 2016 (making <em>The Veilguard</em> the first entry without his involvement), recently got round to watching <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-gameplay-shows-varrics-tragic-loss-of-bianca-at-solas-hands-and-eldritch-demons-from-the-veil/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the gameplay trailer</a> for himself and shared his thoughts <a href="https://x.com/davidgaider/status/1801050867975819542" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on Twitter</a>. Said trailer covers a curated segment of an early mission, with new player character Rook and their party doing some exploring and combat before confronting antagonist Solas. It honestly does a better job of demonstrating what <em>The Veilguard</em> is like than its weirdly <em>Borderlands</em>-esque reveal trailer; something Gaider also feels is the case.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Overall, I'd say this made for a better introduction than the reveal trailer. We see some story, and tone-wise it feels a lot darker and more DA. Like I said, trailers often need to be taken with a grain of salt, and my impression is that many fans are relieved. Which is great.</p>— David Gaider (@davidgaider) <a href="https://twitter.com/davidgaider/status/1801051741741289831?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 13, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="494" data-current-count="794" data-injectable="true">“I’d say this made for a better introduction than the reveal trailer,” says Gaider. “We see some story, and tone-wise it feels a lot darker and more <em>Dragon Age</em>. Like I said, trailers often need to be taken with a grain of salt, and my impression is that many fans are relieved. Which is great.” He does admit the new art style will take some getting used to, but acknowledges this is an aspect that has “changed every game so that’s nothing new.”</p>
 <p data-characters="570" data-current-count="570" data-injectable="true">However, Gaider has nothing but praise for the environments, calling them “utterly gorgeous,” adding, “To see the sprawl of Minrathous—wow. I wish we could have done this for Kirkwall or even Val Royeaux.” He wraps his thoughts up by saying it was lovely to see Solas again and the teases for <em>The Veilguard</em>‘s story have left him eager to see how things will play out: “Could probably chatter about the implications for days, and how this aligns (or doesn’t) with where I thought the story would go… but I won’t.”</p>
 <p data-characters="399" data-current-count="399" data-injectable="false">While Gaider has plenty of nice things to say about <em>The Veilguard</em>, it does seem like the gameplay has done little to appease a significant number of fans. At the time of writing, the gameplay trailer on YouTube has approximately 199,000 dislikes compared to 72,000 likes. Although that’s still a better split compared to the reveal trailer, which now sits at 234,000 dislikes and 41,000 likes.</p> <p data-characters="591" data-current-count="990" data-injectable="false">The fact that the gameplay trailer has scored more likes than the reveal trailer does suggest it’s won over some people, and <a href="https://x.com/dragonage/status/1800543538314371194" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a quick glance at Twitter</a> shows, amid the harsher criticisms, there are plenty of fans still excited for <em>The Veilguard</em>‘s launch later this year. Early previews of another demo shown to press at Summer Game Fest have been mostly positive too. <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/preview-dragon-age-the-veilguard-could-be-bioware-back-at-its-best/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VGC</a> called it “exciting, and engaging and made us desperate to see the next 50 to 100 hours of game,” while <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/dragon-age-veilguard-sgf-preview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Inverse</a> said it’s “hopeful the secret sauce of <em>Dragon Age</em> is still there.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-ps5-update-will-let-you-use-discord-directly-from-your-console.900276/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-ps5-update-discord-integration<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony is rolling out a new PS5 update that will let you access Discord directly from your console, bypassing the need to use the smartphone or desktop apps.</p>
<p>An update adding Discord support to PS5 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-ps5-beta-adds-discord-support-and-more">entered beta in February last year</a> before being <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-system-update-adds-1440p-vrr-support-discord-chat-and-more-today">released in full the following month</a>, but it's not currently possible to start a Discord chat without using the app on a mobile device or desktop PC.</p>
<p>That's all about to change, though. When the new PS5 update hits your area (which Sony says should happen "over the coming weeks"), you'll be able to open up Discord within your PS5's Game Base, then select a server and a voice channel and you'll be set.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ps5-update-discord-2024-banner.jpg?itok=al5df1OZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ps5-update-discord-2024-banner.jpg?itok=AmGrRTKT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Direct Discord integration is coming to PS5 at last.</figcaption></figure><p>You'll still need to ensure that your PlayStation and Discord accounts are linked (which also means you'll need a Discord account if you don't already have one), and you'll need to have updated your PS5, of course.</p>
<p>This isn't the only feature that's rolling out for PS5 in the coming weeks, either. Sony has also revealed that the Profile Share function is coming starting from next week.</p>
<p>This feature allows you to generate a link to your PlayStation profile, which you can then share to any social media or messaging app, allowing others to view your profile at a glance without needing to search for you.</p>
<p>It'll be as easy as selecting the "Share Profile" feature from the PS app or your console, upon which a link will be generated. Anyone who opens the link and who isn't already your PlayStation friend will be prompted to add you.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ps5-discord-update-2024-profile-share.jpg?itok=OQNDeaWW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ps5-discord-update-2024-profile-share.jpg?itok=6Bl5uOeY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll soon be able to send a quick link containing your PlayStation profile to others.</figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, Sony hasn't provided any specific dates regarding when you can expect these features to arrive on your PS5.</p>
<p>Make sure you keep an eye out for any prompts to update your system software as and when you get them.</p>

			<p>It's time for a new GeForce NOW Thursday, the weekly moment when NVIDIA updates its cloud platform's library. Starting today, GFN users can look forward to sailing the seven seas in Rare's Sea of Thieves.</p>
<p>The shared world pirate game may have struggled a bit at launch, but it has long since found its groove, and its recent debut on PlayStation 5 only <a href="https://wccftech.com/sea-of-thieves-most-downloaded-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expanded</a> the already healthy player base.</p>
<p>During Sunday's Xbox Games Showcase, Rare published a new trailer for Sea of Thieves Season 13, unveiling the return of Captain Flameheart and inviting players to become the boss. An all-new world event pits pirates against Flameheart's mighty flagship to seize it, raining fire on their enemies with a skeleton crew at their command and reaping the rewards of their dastardly deeds. Season 13 is coming to Sea of Thieves on July 25 as a free update to all players on Xbox, PC, and PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>The second major addition to GeForce NOW is Bodycam, a first-person tactical shooter game released last week <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2406770/Bodycam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam Early Access</a>. The two-man team at Reissad Studio plans a full launch in a few years.</p>
<p>Lastly, Gameloft's free-to-play arcade racing game Disney Speedstorm and indie farming/life simulator SunnySide are the remaining new GeForce NOW games for this week-</p>
<p>● SunnySide (New release on Steam, June 14)<br>
● Disney Speedstorm (Steam and Xbox, available on PC Game Pass)<br>
● Sea of Thieves (Steam and Xbox, available on PC Game Pass)<br>
● Bodycam (Steam)</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble-preview-fansll-go-bananas</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble-preview-fansll-go-bananas.900270/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble-preview-fansll-go-bananas<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>No doubt <em>Super</em>&nbsp;<em>Monkey Ball&nbsp;</em>fans are chomping at the bit for&nbsp;<em>Banana Rumble.&nbsp;</em>After all, it's been too many years since we've had a mainline entry in the series. Fret not, for&nbsp;<em>Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble</em>&nbsp;is coming this year.</p>
<p>Me, I've only played the first, but I remember enjoying it immensely as a kid. Playing&nbsp;<em>Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble</em>&nbsp;at Summer Game Fest brought me right back to my childhood, and it's just a pleasure to see the series retains its charm.</p>


<p>One notable difference between this entry and its predecessors is the inclusion of 16-player online multiplayer. Bots are optional too, and since I didn't have 15 other players with me, that's what I opted for. With that many monkeys, things go apeshit.</p>
<p>Admittedly, the Switch took a severe hit in performance with all 16 players on screen, and that is the only platform&nbsp;<em>Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble</em>&nbsp;is launching on. Aliasing is very visible and FPS also takes a dive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's not a deal breaker and is still playable, but combined with Nintendo Switch Online, I'm hoping things get ironed out before launch. Playing with that many NPCs is a fun time at least, and there are a plethora of game modes to choose from.</p>

<p>One, for instance, is a race akin to&nbsp;<em>Fall Guys</em>, wonky physics and all. Getting to the finish line with a bunch of monkeys bumping into each other is pure chaos, and it's sure to be a lot of fun.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each game mode sports a selection of different maps to keep things feeling fresh. All of these really take advantage of <i>Super Monkey Ball</i>s' physics, so this ensured maximum chaos. The AI, by the way, was kind of ruthless, but that made it more fun.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did get properly thrashed in Banana Hunt mode, tasking players with collecting the most bananas in an arena-like level full of twists and turns. Keep in mind, your fun will be determined by how tolerant you are of lower frame rates and performance dips.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Go on an Adventure in&nbsp;<em>Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble</em></h2>
<p>Players can express themselves with a plethora of characters. There are costumes, too, and I'm all about cosmetics. This will help differentiate multiplayer a bit and did I mention you can literally play as Sonic, Knuckles, and Tails?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also tried out the story mode, and as one might expect, it plays just like the others. Hey, I'm not complaining. The thrill of going as fast as possible to the finish and optimizing your run is what kept me hooked during the demo.</p>
<p>At its core,&nbsp;<em>Super Monkey Ball</em>&nbsp;is a simple concept and it executes that concept well.&nbsp;<em>Banana Rumble</em>&nbsp;will certainly entice players with frantic multiplayer action and its story mode. It might even be the catalyst that gets me back into the series after so long.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-number-of-games-announced-for-2025-is-already-overwhelming.900267/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24176445/2025-video-games-switch-2-gta6<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="fgAi7V">2025 is looking increasingly — overwhelmingly — crowded with games. </p>
<p id="4vZyie">Which makes sense, as 2024 may be remembered as a weird and uneven year for video games. People who play games are sticking with older, enduringly popular games like <em>Grand Theft Auto 5</em>, <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Counter-Strike</em>, and <em>Minecraft</em>, just as game developers are reckoning with longer development windows, swelling budgets, and a volatile games industry <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24074767/video-game-industry-layoffs-explainer">rattled by layoffs</a>.</p>
<p id="WW6L8y">That’s not to say that 2024 has been a <em>bad</em> year for video games. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-play/24078256/best-video-games-2024">Quite the opposite</a>. Fans of the medium have enjoyed great stuff, ranging from AAA scale (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24122319/dragons-dogma-2-review"><em>Dragon’s Dogma 2</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24071317/helldivers-2-starship-troopers-video-game-great"><em>Helldivers 2</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24047430/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-review-pc-xbox-ps5"><em>Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24033589/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-review-ubisoft-switch"><em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</em></a>) to indie-level surprises (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24084564/balatro-review-poker-game-deck-building-roguelite"><em>Balatro</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24079882/pacific-drive-review-steam-pc-playstation-5"><em>Pacific Drive</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24057437/palworld-review-pokemon-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-survival"><em>Palworld</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24151337/animal-well-review-pc-ps5-switch"><em>Animal Well</em></a>). This year’s best games have captured the hearts of millions with their fresh takes on classic genres.</p>
<p id="qg7ZsU">But 2024 will still probably feel like a downer — barring any major, still-to-be-announced releases in the back half of the year — compared to the deluge that’s coming in 2025. Next year alone, Nintendo and Rockstar Games will attempt to repeat the successes of their most popular products of all time: the Nintendo Switch and <em>Grand Theft Auto 5</em>.</p>
<p id="hpOHhH">A <a href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo/23899504/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-power-name-games">new Nintendo console</a> and the long-awaited release of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23952805/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-leaks-release-date-trailer"><em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em></a> might be enough on their own to carry a full year for many video game fans. Nintendo is said to be working hard to bolster its library of next-generation games for the “Switch 2,” reportedly delaying its new hardware to ensure that its customers have great software to play next year. In other words, expect a long list of great new Nintendo games in 2025 to land alongside the new console.</p>
<p id="1Lp4Gg">As for <em>GTA 6</em>, after racking up 200 million sales of 2013’s <em>GTA 5</em>, it’s safe to say that Rockstar will have a built-in audience expecting a huge, generational shift in play — and that audience will doubtless get dozens, if not hundreds, of hours of playtime.</p>

<p id="pRQ8Ep">Here’s what else those big releases will be competing with in 2025:</p>
<ul>

<p id="S4RCy9">This past week of not-E3 and Summer Game Fest events has seen even more 2025 games announced: Koei Tecmo’s <em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em>, Compulsion Games’ <em>South of Midnight</em>, <em>Mixtape</em>, <em>Wuchang Fallen Feathers</em>, <em>Cuffbust</em>, <em>Cairn</em>, and others. They’ll join previously announced games <em>Paralives</em>, <em>Little Nightmares 3</em>, and <em>Slay the Spire 2</em> in an incredibly crowded year that will only get more crowded.</p>
<p id="OxwXZF">These games, which could consume hundreds of hours of our spare time, are merely the ones we know about. And they’ll be competing for our attention amid <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24144727/2024-movie-release-schedule-blockbusters-2025-box-office">one of the busiest movie release calendars</a> of the past decade — all of which amounts to a very expensive and competitive year for entertainment. There are far worse problems to have. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/06/13/playstation-rolling-out-update-to-allow-players-to-join-discord-chat-directly-from<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>PlayStation is rolling out an update in the coming weeks that will finally allow players to join a Discord voice chat directly from their PS5 consoles. Currently, you can only use Discord on PS5 after first joining a voice chat group via a PC or phone, which is quite a cumbersome step to take in order to talk with friends while gaming.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/13/ps5-players-will-soon-be-able-to-join-discord-voice-chat-directly-from-their-console/?sf273538206=1">update</a> will gradually roll out to PS5 players in the coming weeks, starting first with Japan and Asia, followed by Europe, Australia and New Zealand, and the Middle East, and finally, North and South America. You will need to update your console to the latest system software and link your PlayStation Network and Discord accounts in order to take advantage of this upcoming feature.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wJQehypOr5E" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>To start a Discord voice chat directly from a PS5, players need to select the Discord tab in the Control Center's Game Base. Here, choose a Discord server or DM group you'd like to join, select your preferred voice channel, and you're set. You will receive a notification when another Discord user calls you, too, allowing you to join immediately.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This upcoming update will arrive more than two years after <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/01/31/link-your-playstation-account-to-discord-starting-today">PlayStation gave players the ability to link their PSN accounts to Discord</a> back in 2021.&nbsp;</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-helldivers-2-update-stratagem-changes</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-helldivers-2-update-brings-massive-stratagem-balance-changes.900240/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-helldivers-2-update-stratagem-changes<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>has received a huge update that contains a ton of stratagem balance changes, which, as chief creative officer Johan Pilestedt explains, are intended to add extra loadout variety opportunities.</p>
<p>Pilestedt, who <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-arrowhead-new-ceo">stepped down as developer Arrowhead's CEO</a> last month, says that this update is aiming to "buff up some of the weaker stratagems" and alter some for consistency.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/5998312279129319530" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam post</a> accompanying the new update's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/4150709804553746157" rel="noopener" target="_blank">patch notes</a>, Pilestedt goes into great detail regarding the changes made to each stratagem, with options like the Machine Gun Sentry, the HMG Emplacement, and the Anti-Personnel Minefield receiving buffs.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-update-stratagem-turret.jpg?itok=2W1-EXgr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-update-stratagem-turret.jpg?itok=a-HiM1Kx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>has received a big update that brings huge changes to some of the game's stratagems.</figcaption></figure><p>The changes are extensive, so we won't list them all here, but highlights include an increase in durability across all Sentry emplacements in order to make them less vulnerable to "small arms fire".</p>
<p>If you're a user of the Orbital Precision Strike (which, according to Pilestedt, pretty much everyone is), you'll be pleased to know it's had its call-in time and cooldown reduced.</p>
<p>Two Eagle stratagems, the Rocket Pods and the Strafing Run, have also been buffed, with the Rocket Pods gaining changes to make them "more consistent" in dealing with heavily-armored enemies and the Strafing Run getting extra armor penetration.</p>
<p>It's not just stratagems, either; several special weapons have also received buffs, including the Grenade Launcher, the Heavy Machine Gun, and the standard Machine Gun.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-update-stratagem-crossbow.jpg?itok=gZY7jZYR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-update-stratagem-crossbow.jpg?itok=IHLJLiCO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Several&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>weapons, including the explosive crossbow, have received buffs in the new update.</figcaption></figure><p>Standard weapons like the Purifier, the Explosive Crossbow, and the Eruptor have also seen changes in this patch, so if you've been using any of those weapons regularly, you'll likely notice a change.</p>
<p>It seems that Pilestedt and Arrowhead are intent on bringing bigger and more meaningful changes to&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>. Last week, the developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-viper-commandos-warbond">announced a shakeup</a> to the way Warbonds would work, with less frequent and more impactful Warbonds planned for the future.</p>
<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>right now on PC and PlayStation 5. Make sure to read our <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/helldivers-2-review-fighting-for-managed-democracy">review of the game</a> if you want to know whether this bug-splattering shooter is worth your time.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/flock-preview</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/flock-preview-wholesome-wonderful-whimsy.900237/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/flock-preview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sometimes we all need an injection of pure happiness in our lives, and <em>Flock </em>is here to envelope us all in its wholesome embrace. It's a simple, low-stakes game about cruising through the sky cataloguing funny little animals that can then join you flock and fly with you.</p>
<p>The premise of the game is simple. You're on to see your aunt Jane, who is studying the strange creatures you'll see in the world and needs help cataloguing them all. Of course, you agree to help and then you're off.</p>
<p>Flight is a simple joy. You don't need to worry about height, as the game will adjust that automatically for you. You can just zoom about where you'd like, sitting on perches or not littered throughout the world if you wish.</p>

<p>The simple movement that takes you to beautiful vistas combined with the calming, upbeat music create a meditative mood. Happily, I was lulled into a reverie that was utterly relaxing -- a welcome relief at the end of many appointments at Summer Game Fest.</p>
<p>What helps pull you in is the vibrancy of the world, which I would defy anyone to not be charmed thoroughly. The locales are popping with color, varied, and full&nbsp;of interestingly shaped flora and fauna at every turn.</p>
<p>That unique approach is applied to everything you come across, even with the interesting names of the creatures themselves. There are many different families of creatures you come across, each of which have fun names like gleebs, sprugs, burbots, and more.</p>
<p>When you do come across a new creature, you can observe its mannerisms and habits to try to learn a little about it. Once you're confident, you can prompt your aunt Jane that you've found a new creature to catalogue.</p>

<p>If its a new family of creature you've never seen, she'll reveal its kind to you. But, its up to you to find the specific type in that species. She'll give you a list with brief descriptions like, "Three vertical stripes" or "nose is a different color from the rest of its body."</p>
<p>Some of the descriptions are about their actions, too. If one zips and darts around, or always tries to fly into the brush or hide, that may be a clue for you to correctly identify what you've found.</p>
<p>After they're identified, and you have a whistle for that animal family, you can try to entice it to join your flock. That is simply done by following them and timing a call from your bird, who mimics the whistle, towards the creature. Do it correctly, or multiple times if needed, and it will fly around with you.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, that is more or less <em>Flock</em>. There is a wide world to uncover full of interesting creatures and characters as you learn all about the region. It's simple, cozy fun. And one of the best parts is you can do it with a friend, as <em>Flock </em>will have a co-op mode if you wish.</p>
<p>If you're just wanting to sink into a meditative state and meet cute creatures, one of which you'll no doubt fall in love with, <em>Flock</em> is perfect for you.</p>
<hr><p>Flock <em>was previewed for about 30 minutes at Summer Game Fest Play Days. It releases July 16th, 2024 on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.</em></p>

You can date in <em>Persona</em> games, so you can do that instead. I hope you find cool girlfriend soon.” Adding to the mystery surrounding Midori, the character would frequently talk about getting out of video game leaking world altogether, before eventually coming back, most recently on Monday of this week. </p><p>“It is just stressful to continue because of conspiracies,” Midori <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/MbKKssTBhz5/status/1800328353716785542&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/MbKKssTBhz5/status/1800328353716785542" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span> at the time. “So I am uncomfortable now.   I think it is good to stop here.” The timing also happened to coincide with several incorrect predictions around Square Enix games showing up at the Xbox showcase, as well as <em>Visions of Mana</em> not coming to PlayStation 4 (the publisher confirmed earlier today that it was). </p><p>Now it turns out the only real conspiracy was that Midori was a mysterious new female leaker from Japan, and not apparently a white male <em>Persona </em>leaker previously known as MysticDistance. “The rumors about my identity that have started to spread and will continue to spread recently are correct information,” he <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/MbKKssTBhz5/status/1801044892300267796&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/MbKKssTBhz5/status/1801044892300267796" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted on June 13</a></span>. “It is only ironic that I am corroborating information that will almost assuredly end the long journey that has been had with this account.”</p><p>The confession was in response to an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://0bin.net/paste/duqx6e6R#owLSgKnxlfq90-tk0d1mxL91OM3sTlxmq0E33K97e6s&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://0bin.net/paste/duqx6e6R#owLSgKnxlfq90-tk0d1mxL91OM3sTlxmq0E33K97e6s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">anonymous document</a></span> going around accusing MysticDistance of faking their new identity and relying on old or incomplete sourcing to peddle new, unsubstantiated rumors. On social media, meanwhile, the leaker has been criticized for embracing racist caricatures to masquerade as someone they weren’t. </p><p>“The Midori persona as it is may not be a real person, but it is what I believe to be an accurate representation of a real person albeit in a particularly strange way that I wish I did not use,” MysticDistance wrote in response. “But it was never used to manipulate anyone or to appear more credible.” He denied that the leaks came from old presentations rather than current sources, and said the new account “liberated” him to embrace Sega and Atlus leaker fan culture in a way that his old reputation as MysticDistance did not. </p><p>“I won’t tell anyone what to feel or what I think they should do in this situation. That isn’t my place,” he wrote. “I know that there are people who are reading this post who feel betrayed. I will not invalidate your feelings or decision to walk away or voice your feelings.” MysticDistance also claimed that his existing leaks will still be proven accurate. “Over the coming months and years, more and more of the unannounced information I have posted will be revealed,” he continued. “Of course, some plans will probably change too.  I hope everyone is excited for what they can expect from Atlus and Sega going forward.”</p><p>Midori is just the latest episode in a video game leaking culture saga that feels increasingly off the rails. As gaming companies pull back even further from early trailers and reveals, and fandoms for the hottest games become even more desperate for crumbs of new information, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-leak-google-youtube-private-videos-employee-1851516110&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-leak-google-youtube-private-videos-employee-1851516110">various leakers have tried to fill the gap, with varying degrees of success</a></span>. In part that’s because business plans can be complex and constantly evolving. It might also have to do with a lot of supposed leakers getting one piece of good information, and then not being able to help themselves from trying to parlay it into an entire identity and Discord community. Midori did fly too close to the sun, and now his wings have melted, at least until another one of his older random predictions gets proven right again. </p><p>Midori, aka MysticDistance, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Battlestate Games has just added Patch 0.14.9.1 to Escape from Tarkov, introducing a few new elements and tweaking some existing aspects of the game. At the heart of this update sits loot crates – a new reward-based mechanic that ties Escape from Tarkov closer to Tarkov: Arena. With this new feature, players can unlock a series of loot crates in EFT for completing various tasks in Tarkov: Arena.</p>



<p>Also, that cool Cultist Jacket has been added, but it’s exclusively available for those with The Unheard Edition of the game… For now.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-tarkie-drip">Tarkie Drip</h2>



<p>Those who purchased The Unheard Edition – or who do so going forward – can secure the Cultist Jacket, a long, black coat that has a handy hood built in. The catch is you can’t wear a helmet if you want to equip the hood, but that’s okay. It’s worth it to look super cool. This was one of the items promised to players when The Unheard Edition was revealed several weeks ago, promptly causing a huge controversy and forcing Battlestate Games into something of a hole. </p>



<p>If the awesome Cultist Jacket isn’t enough to whet your appetite, how about soaking up some of the new loot crates that BSG has added? For completing daily and weekly tasks in Tarkov: Arena, you’ll now unlock in EFT:</p>



<ul>
<li>Equipment Crate</li>



<li>Weapon Crate</li>



<li>Supply Crate</li>



<li>Valuables Crate</li>
</ul>



<p>There’s something for every item category in the game, and it’s assumed that you can unlock some fairly juicy items in these loot crates. Otherwise, what would be the point in chasing them down? The only catch is that you’ll need Workbench LL2 in your Hideout to open them.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, BSG updated how ballistic plate colliders work and tweaked the maximum protection area of every plate. That means that a single plate now offers wider coverage. Also, the Mark of the Unheard device now only works in PvE mode (lol) and Edge of Darkness and The Unheard Edition players have unique dog tag appearances and a reduction in insurance return times.</p>



<p>That’s everything!</p>

After three years and a multitude of changes, Amazon is planning on continuing its maiden voyage into uncharted waters, as New World Aeternum will bring the full experience and more to consoles this fall. We had the chance to check out Aeternum during Summer Game Fest, and so far, Amazon's adaptation adventure is smooth sailing.</p><p dir="ltr">Our hands-on began with New World's robust character creation system, and we could have spent the entire session there.

The Swordbearer, for example, is a tank who excels in heavy weapons and starts with buffs to their cooking and fishing skills, while the Occultist uses elemental magic and begins with increased mining and jewelcrafting abilities.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking with GameSpot at Summer Game Fest, creative director Dave Verafaillie explained that Archetypes contributed to one of the team's main goals for Aeternum: Making the start-up experience as quick as possible for console players. "[Archetypes are] a great way to onboard people," Verafaillie said. "You don't have to worry about too much customization stuff; you can just choose your play style and get in and enjoy it."</p><p dir="ltr">After character creation, it's time to begin the game properly, and the first thing that sticks out is the game's control scheme. New World's combat and traversal translate very well to the standard console controller. Jumps, attacks, and basic movement are all found where you'd expect them in a standard action game rather than an MMO, but Aeternum's controls do have some interesting traits.</p><p dir="ltr">For example, normal attacks are mapped to R2/RT, and attacks vary on how long you hold the button down. Pressing normally will result in a standard attack, but holding the button down will result in a heavy attack which takes longer to execute but deals more damage on contact. This approach feels great in practice, as it allows you to be more deliberate with attacks while keeping execution simple, and the control scheme as a whole works incredibly well in translating New World to the console experience.</p><p dir="ltr">Controller support had been added to the current New World offering in the past, but Aeternum's layout, according to the dev team, is even more optimized. "One thing that gives us an advantage in adapting New World to consoles is that both our controls and our combat are navigation-locked," game director Scott Lang said. "A lot of traditional MMOs use tap-target, cooldown-, and icon-based systems. Because we have one main weapon, and our system focuses on direct combat and direct navigation, we can then have three abilities that map really nicely to a controller." Verafaillie adds that "target lock, controller remapping, aim assist, and more" will also be coming to the control scheme with Aeternum.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4317950-nwa_announce_blacksmith_edendgrove_v3_1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4317950" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4317950-nwa_announce_blacksmith_edendgrove_v3_1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4317950"></a><figcaption>Blacksmithing in New World Aeternum</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4317950-nwa_announce_blacksmith_edendgrove_v3_1920x1080.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4317951-nwa_announce_blacksmith_edendgrove_v3_1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4317952-nwa_announce_cooking_brimstone_1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4317953-nwa_announce_fishingsolo_v3_1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4317954-nwa_announce_fishing_reekwater_a_1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4317955-nwa_announce_logging_brightwood_1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4317956-nwa_announce_miningduos_v1_1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4317957-nwa_announce_miningsolo_shatteredmtn_v2_1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4317958-nwa_announce_pvp_elysianwilds_v2_1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4317951,1300-4317952,1300-4317953,1300-4317954,1300-4317955,1300-4317956,1300-4317957,1300-4317958" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4317951-nwa_announce_blacksmith_edendgrove_v3_1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4317952-nwa_announce_cooking_brimstone_1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4317953-nwa_announce_fishingsolo_v3_1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4317954-nwa_announce_fishing_reekwater_a_1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4317955-nwa_announce_logging_brightwood_1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4317956-nwa_announce_miningduos_v1_1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4317957-nwa_announce_miningsolo_shatteredmtn_v2_1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4317958-nwa_announce_pvp_elysianwilds_v2_1920x1080.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4317951-nwa_announce_blacksmith_edendgrove_v3_1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4317952-nwa_announce_cooking_brimstone_1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4317953-nwa_announce_fishingsolo_v3_1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4317954-nwa_announce_fishing_reekwater_a_1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4317955-nwa_announce_logging_brightwood_1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4317956-nwa_announce_miningduos_v1_1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4317957-nwa_announce_miningsolo_shatteredmtn_v2_1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4317958-nwa_announce_pvp_elysianwilds_v2_1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">While New World Aeternum is considered a "massively multiplayer online" game--and the existing game is already one of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-mmorpgs/2900-5436/">best MMORPGs</a> out there--our demo was a solo experience. This was intentional; Aeternum has been designed so players can enjoy it either alone or with a group. "Another big focus for us was making Aeternum a single-player experience all the way through," Verafaillie said. "In other MMOs, you're sort of forced to do endgame raids with other players. We have endgame raids too that will require other players, but we've also added new repeatable solo trials that will let players continue to improve their gear if they prefer to go it alone."</p><p dir="ltr">New players were certainly a focus during Aeternum's development, but the team also had another set of players in mind: Those who played the game at launch but haven't done so since. According to the team, New World Aeternum will be completely different from the experience they'll remember from three years ago, and that starts with the story.</p><p dir="ltr">"If someone is coming in for the first time since launch, we've redone the entire main story quest line," senior producer Katy Kaczynski said. "The overarching story is still similar--Act 1 is still the Tempest, for example--but the way the story is told to you, the characters you meet along the way, all of that is different. This release brings even more immersion to the reworked story thanks to the enhanced dialogue system, so you can feel like you're part of the story instead of just watching it unfold."</p><p dir="ltr">The team understands the risk in making such a harsh adjustment, but according to Kaczynski, the team felt they had to do what was best for the game. "Feedback we got in the beginning of the game was that it was a really big grind, or that people didn't feel like they were brought into the story," Kaczynski explained, "so we wanted to take that and bring a more exciting and immersive experience."</p><p dir="ltr">Amazon Games is promising a lot to the MMO crowd as New World makes the jump to consoles with Aeternum, no matter if or when you played the game previously. A revamped story system, streamlined onboarding, and simplified controls will all provide an easy transition for experienced New World players, as well as a painless introduction to new adventurers. Based on our time playing the game and getting a feel for what it offers, the voyage seems to be sailing in the right direction.</p><p dir="ltr">New World Aeternum launches October 15 on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC. An invite-only closed beta will run from July 11 to July 17 on both Xbox and PlayStation, and players can sign up for a chance for an invite at the <a href="https://www.newworld.com/forward-link?id=tester-sign-up" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">game's official website</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/v-rising-tops-uk-charts-in-may-uk-monthly-charts<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

        <p>But overall software, hardware and accessory sales are down once again</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Vampire survival game V Rising emerged from Early Access and swooped to the top of the charts in the UK during May.</p>
<p>The PC game received strong reviews upon release, with a PS5 version due in June 11.</p>
<p>However, it was a slow month for game sales overall, with 1.85 million games sold, a drop of 21% compared with May 2023. Last year, the games market was boosted by the release of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, plus the release of Hogwarts Legacy on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the previous month's No.1 Fallout 4 manages to remain in the Top Five at No.4. The 2015 game surged up the charts in April following the launch of the Amazon Prime TV show combined with some price discounting.</p>
<p>Ghost of Tsushima: Director's Cut jumps up the charts following the game's release on PC, landing at No.6. It is PlayStation Studios' second biggest PC release (behind Helldivers 2), and its biggest internally developed PC launch. After two weeks, it has narrowly sold more than 2022's Spider-Man: Remastered</p>
<p>The final new releases in the Top Ten is the remake of Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door for Nintendo Switch (digital data missing). It's a decent debut for the game, with physical sales above both last year's Super Mario RPG and 2020's Paper Mario: The Origami King</p>
<p><strong>Console market continues to slip</strong></p>
<p>Just under 65,000 games consoles were sold in the UK over May (GfK panel data), a drop of 10% on the month before and nearly 33% down on may last year. PS5 was the No.1 format again, but saw sales down 13% over April.</p>
<p>The biggest reason for the tough year-on-year comparison is actually Nintendo Switch, which posted impressive console sales in May 2023 following the release of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. Switch sales are also down 9% over the month before.</p>
<p>Xbox Series S and X is in third spot, with sales also down 9% month-on-month.</p>
<p>Over in accessories, 475,429 products were sold in the UK during May, down 12.6% over April, by up 5% over May last year. The market was driven by the White (No.1) and Midnight Black (No.2) PS5 DualSense controllers, meanwhile the PlayStation Portal Remote Player has jumped back into the Top Ten at No.3.</p>
<p>Overall, game and console revenue has taken a sharp fall in the UK this year, but actually accessory sales are up 21% year-to-date.</p>
<p>"PC gaming accessories - driven by mice/keyboards/headsets - are up 8%, but console gaming accessories are up +26%," says GfK games boss Dorian Bloch.</p>
<p>"The main growth categories for console accessories are controllers, which is up 22% due to the PS5 joypads, namely DualSense, DualSense Edge and PlayStation Portal. But controllers are also slightly up within the Xbox space. For PlayStation this is due to first-party controllers, but for Xbox this is split between Microsoft, Acco and PDP.</p>
<p>"Console gaming headsets are up 17%, driven by PlayStation headsets and Sony’s existing Pulse 3D products, but most notably since Week eight with the introduction of Pulse 3D Elite, which is driving the Pulse range and increasing Sony’s overall revenue share.</p>
<p>"SteelSeries products for PlayStation have been driving things, too, most notably the Arctis Nova Pro Wireless, which even at around £300 remains a SteelSeries top volume seller."</p>

<p data-characters="277" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-destiny-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Destiny 2</a></em> players have been singing their praises for The Call, a legendary Sidearm you get while playing <em>The Final Shape</em>‘s campaign, because it’s been dragging most of us through the new content by providing us with what feels like an incredibly unfair advantage. </p> <p data-characters="449" data-current-count="449" data-injectable="true">I got The Call in the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-complete-exegesis-in-destiny-2-the-final-shape/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">third mission</a> in the campaign, and it carried me through the rest of that story and into every activity afterward. I thought I’d just gotten lucky, but now most players are sharing their stories about when they got the weapon and just how handy it was. Some are even admitting how they felt silly after trying it for the first time, long after picking it up and being filled with regret for having sat on it for so long. </p>
 <h2 id="h-destiny-2-players-love-the-call-for-helping-them-have-a-great-time-in-the-final-shape" data-injectable="false"><em>Destiny 2</em> players love The Call for helping them have a great time in <em>The Final Shape</em></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="423" data-current-count="723" data-injectable="true">A thread with hundreds of comments on the<em> </em><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1dddus7/i_think_its_safe_to_say_the_callthe_new_strand/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Destiny 2</em> subreddit</a> shows just how much players appreciate The Call as a weapon and getting it so early. Many are comparing the rolls they got, which only add to this weapon’s power. User tne2008 explained, “My first one was subsistence and hatchling. I don’t think I’ve ever reloaded it manually. I don’t know if hatchling is the ideal roll but I love it.”</p>
 <p data-characters="342" data-current-count="342" data-injectable="false">Even those who didn’t realize how good The Call is until much later have chimed in. User JeanBoy stated, “I slept on The Call until I started struggling on the final boss fight of the legendary campaign lol. Switched to it with Graviton Lance/Hammerhead and was able to beat it on my third try. It’s now my go-to loadout!”</p> <p data-characters="419" data-current-count="761" data-injectable="true">Right now, players are discussing what the best roll for The Call might be so they can craft the perfect version. I’d say tne2008’s was pretty good, but really, whatever perks work for your play style will be the best for you. What makes this Sidearm so useful is its Rocket-Assisted Frame Trait. This makes it fire self-propelled rocket ammunition, with projectiles that explode on impact for high damage. </p>
 <p data-characters="386" data-current-count="386" data-injectable="false">In practice, this is a tiny rocket launcher with projectiles that’ll seek out enemies if you fire close enough to them. It one-shots red bar enemies and almost wipes out stronger foes too. This weapon is what I lean on right now, and it helped me clear <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2s-the-pale-heart-location-leans-into-strangeness-and-wouldnt-look-out-of-place-in-warframe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Pale Heart</a>‘s Overthrow activities the five times required to unlock the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-unlock-the-dual-destiny-exotic-quest-in-destiny-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dual Destiny Quest</a> in about four hours flat. </p> <p data-characters="268" data-current-count="654" data-injectable="false">I regularly have The Call drop as a reward, and you likely will as well. If you’re not currently using it but are playing through<em> The Final Shape</em>‘s content, check your inventory and equip it because it will save your bacon every time you sit down to play. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[New World: Aeternum Preview - It's Still an MMO]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/new-world-aeternum-preview-its-still-mmo</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-world-aeternum-preview-its-still-an-mmo.900207/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/new-world-aeternum-preview-its-still-mmo<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/new-world"><em>New World: Aeternum</em></a> feels a bit bizarrely familiar. Amazon’s recently revealed title is an enhanced edition of <em>New World</em>, and it’s probably best to think of it like a big 2.0 update—a realm reborn, if you will.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There’s a seemingly big focus on making it a viable solo experience, with voice-acted cutscenes and dialog options. That illusion is pretty quickly shattered though, as I entered a shared world with other players roaming around, much like the hub worlds in Destiny.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I spent nearly an hour with <em>New World: Aeternum</em> at Summer Game Fest, playing it via a controller thanks to its upcoming console release. Within that time, I hit level 5 and unlocked quite a few abilities for my weapons, and it felt just like any other MMO, for better and for worse.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Swashbucklin’ in a New <em>New World</em></h2>
<p>In the character creator, I picked the Musketeer archetype, which gave me access to a rapier, a musket, and the stats to start off on the right foot. There were six other archetypes to choose from, though you can also allocate your points however you wish to as you level up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In true MMO fashion, waypoints constantly directed me to my next objective, eliciting a sort of autopilot mentality. It’s zen, in a way, but it’s also a bit mindless.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Combat is easily approachable, with light and heavy melee attacks dealing with most foes. There’s a block and dodge, and I could quickly swap to my musket and take fire using the triggers.</p>

<p>The more you use a weapon type, the more you unlock skill points for them, which can be cashed in for passive and active abilities. For example, I could unleash a quick flurry with the rapier or shoot a fire shot that immolated enemies. There’s even a passive that let me do more damage to a burning target.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you’ve played some RPGs, none of this is particularly surprising or new. But being new both is and isn’t the goal for <em>New World: Aeternum</em>. It’s both the next step in <em>New World</em>’s live-service journey and a reason for new players to hop on, if they’re interested.</p>

<h2>An Aeternity of Looting&nbsp;</h2>
<p>I was initially pulled in by the idea that this could be a completely solo experience. I find it hard to get into MMOs personally, but the storytelling and cutscenes made it seem like something I could partake in without having to worry about some social hoops like guilds and raids.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The voice acting here is serviceable and fun, though it won’t win any awards. Grace O’Malley, a roguish pirate, is charming in her own way, and Aelstrom has a gruffness to him that reminds me of Braum from <em>League of Legends</em> or <em>Overwatch</em>’s Reinhardt.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But it all sort of fell apart for me when the words all led to the same early-game MMO tropes we all know. You wash up on the shores of Aeternum, the Eternal Island where no one truly dies. Aelstrom commends you for conquering death and being born again, complimenting your strong soul.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then the first thing he asks you to do is hunt some boar for food. After that? Hunt down and kill a few mobs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everything takes time, too—you’ll see that circular timer show up for nearly everything. Picking up mats takes half a second. Crafting takes a couple seconds. Looting takes a couple seconds. After a while, whenever that circular UI element shows up, I couldn’t help but check out a little bit mentally.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I can’t speak to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-world-moving-to-seasonal-model-expansion-coming-this-fall"><em>New World</em>’s endgame or expansions</a> across its nearly three years of service, but Aeternum is shaping up to be a fresh jumping-on point for lots of newcomers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s opening up to new audiences on Xbox and PlayStation, and all of Amazon’s marketing is pushing it as an action RPG, not quite an MMO. Solo play is more emphasized, but I’m not convinced it’ll be a great solo experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even if you can roll credits without playing a single raid or expedition with real players, I’m sure there’s a slew of other dedicated single-player action RPGs that might be more worth your time.</p>

            <p>Xbox has announced a release date for Ara: History Untold.</p>
<p>The upcoming turn-based historical strategy title is set to launch on 24th September. On its debut, it will be available for Windows PC and Steam. The Xbox published title will arrive on day one for PC Game Pass, as well.</p>
<p>In addition, president of developer Oxide Games Marc Meyer and Head of Ara for Xbox Game Studios Brian Stone have shared more about what players can expect on the game's release later this year.</p>

<p>The duo showcased the game during an episode of the Official Xbox Podcast with an accompanying <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/06/12/ara-history-untold-release-date-multiplayer-details/">blog post</a>, where they spoke about leaders and the game's "living" map. They also spoke more on the Ara: History Untold multiplayer, with Oxide describing its gameplay as "Simultaneous Turns".</p>
<p>"The way that works is you submit your actions, and everyone else in the world submits their actions at the same time, and then they all get resolved together," Meyer explained. "It's not a situation where if you go first, you get to get the claim; the person who goes second doesn't get the claim. In this model, everyone goes at the same time. So, in multiplayer you really have a fair chance at everything."</p>
<p>Meyer said the team wanted to make sure it "removed all the barriers for multiplayer", meaning players will be able to "jump in and out of as many games as [they] want".</p>
<p>Said Meyer: "You can take your turn when you have time and wait until it gets submitted. If your friend decides he doesn't want to play anymore, an AI can come in and take over for him, it doesn't mean the end of your entire world if you're playing online and you don't want to do that, you can stop, and you don't have to worry about destroying the game for everyone else who's playing."</p>
<p>You can check out the full podcast via the video below. Here, the hosts also spoke more on Age of Mythology: Retold, which was announced earlier this week.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-playstation-handheld-capable-of-running-ps4-games-natively-would-be-very-hard-to-achieve.900192/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-handheld-ps4-games-natively/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A PlayStation handheld console capable of running PS4 games natively would be very hard to achieve, mostly due to power draw and memory bandwidth, among other reasons.</p>
<p>Replying to a fan question regarding the rumored handheld, which is said to be in the works, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R41x68m1GXc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> highlighted how a portable console capable of running PlayStation 4 games natively would be very hard to achieve due to power draw and the massive memory bandwidth of the system, 176 GB/s. In addition, such a portable system would require the use of a Jaguar CPU for compatibility, and there's nothing in the mobile space capable of providing these specs to run PS4 games natively.</p>
<p>A PlayStation handheld based on modern AMD architectures, however, could definitely run PS4 games, but they would have to be ported, which would significantly make the game library smaller. Such a system, however, would have no trouble running scaled-back PlayStation 5 games, taking a page from the Steam Deck and another modern handheld system that can run current AAA games by dropping settings and resolution. Still, Digital Foundry found the idea of a new handheld system from Sony to be a very good one, considering how well the remote play-focused PlayStation Portal sold worldwide.</p>
<p><iframe title="Could Sony Make A PS4-Compatible Portable?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R41x68m1GXc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As already mentioned, a PlayStation handheld is said to be in <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-playstation-handheld-amd-18-cus-1-8-ghz-gpu/">early development</a> by Sony. Powered by a custom AMD APU, this handheld is currently in the High Level Design Phase, meaning it is at least two years from release and has yet to be greenlit. Specs have yet to be finalized a swell, but it is said the system will use 18 CUs, and its GPU will likely run at 1.8 GHz or slower due to the PlayStation 5's variable clock speeds.</p>
<p>Following the PlayStation Vita, which could have been much more successful with better support thanks to its great hardware at the time, Sony left the handheld market, only to return to it somewhat with the aforementioned PlayStation Portal. You can learn more about the system in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-portal-remote-play-device/">review</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/todays-helldivers-2-patch-is-obscenely-large-and-fans-are-loving-it/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=todays-helldivers-2-patch-is-obscenely-large-and-fans-are-loving-it<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="472" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">To call the latest <em>Helldivers 2</em> patch big is an understatement. Even calling it chunky doesn’t feel apt enough, with the patch notes going into explicit detail on various balancing updates to weapons and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-stratagem-tier-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stratagems</a>, bug fixes, and the supply lines between planets are actually visible now. While Patch 01.000.400 has only launched today, early responses from fans suggest Arrowhead is taking things in the right direction, with some calling it a big win for players.</p> <p data-characters="779" data-current-count="779" data-injectable="true">I’m not going to cover the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/4150709804553746157?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full patch notes</a> because, again, there’s simply too much, but one of Arrowhead’s key goals was to better balance the Stratagems. As such, some of the weaker options have received buffs to make them more viable. For instance, the Orbital Precision Strike has had both its call time and cooldown reduced, making it easier to use against moving targets. A wide array of regular weapons have seen buff too, like the Heavy Machine Gun. In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/5998312279129319530?l=english**" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a separate blog post</a> detailing the rationale behind all the Stratagem and weapon adjustments, chief creative officer Johan Pilestedt explains how the Heavy Machine Gun “failed to deliver on the fantasy,” which is why its rate of fire has been lowered and it deals more damage than before.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="511" data-current-count="811" data-injectable="true">Perhaps one of the most welcome changes is the inclusion of visible supply lines. Despite being an important mechanic that dictate which planets players can actually go to, you initially couldn’t see them. Arrowhead says this was to avoid the Galactic War map getting too cluttered, but “based on the feedback from our community we have made an implementation showing them on the map. This solution tries to maintain the general readability while still exposing the system to players in game.”</p>
 <p data-characters="398" data-current-count="398" data-injectable="false">Initial responses from players appear to be mostly positive.

 <p data-characters="554" data-current-count="554" data-injectable="false">There are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1deunkd/comment/l8ehdoz/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">some who have complained</a> about how the FAF-14 Spear Stratagem has been affected. It was in need of a fix to improve its aiming and while the patch has done exactly that, it unfortunately can no longer target Automatic Spawners. Arrowhead has stressed this was unintentional and will be fixed, but this is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1deunkd/comment/l8ehhm0/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a sticking point for a handful of players</a>, though they appear to be the minority. On the whole, while there are definitely more fixes required, this patch seems like it’s done almost everything right in keeping the player-base happy.</p>

            <p>
Sonic Dream Team has received another update, adding additional levels and an endgame mission.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-3d-platformer-sonic-dream-team-announced-by-sega">Apple Arcade exclusive was released in December last year</a>, but developer Hardlight has continued to update the game ever since.
</p>
<p>
Previous updates added the Sweet Dreams Zones as a bonus for completing the main adventure. This new update adds two new Acts to the zone, with new level features and new takes on missions.

<p>

Further, a new endgame mission has been added called Bittersweet Way, available for players who collect all Dream Orbs and Moons. It promises to be the most challenging level so far.
</p>
<p>
New achievements and competitive rankings have also been added alongside these new levels, plus collectible music tracks are unlocked via hidden musical notes across the game's levels.
</p>
<p>
Sonic fans should absolutely get on Sonic Dream Team, despite it being a mobile game. It comes highly recommended as a full 3D Sonic adventure with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-dream-team-puts-players-in-exhilarating-flow-state-says-studio-head">great skatepark-esque level design</a> and a brilliant soundtrack.
</p>
<p>
It's playable across iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV, and Apple Vision Pro.

            <p>
Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, Konami's forthcoming remake, will have a visual filter to recreate the look of the original game.
</p>
<p>
On the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDCppzRLwpw&amp;rco=1">Xbox podcast</a>, producer Noriaka Okamura discussed more about the game and confirmed the Legacy control style "applies a visual filter to more faithfully recreate the screen look of the original game".
</p>
<p>
Konami has since confirmed to Eurogamer this visual filter can be applied to either control style, meaning players can use modernised controls with the classic filter. More information is expected soon.

As Metal Gear Solid fan account Perfect Stealth noted on X, this visual filter was hinted at on the Konami website with a short clip for the Legacy Style controls.

While the development team at Konami is using Unreal Engine 5 for high-fidelity graphics (as discussed on the Xbox podcast), fans have criticised the visuals for lacking the same colour palette and tone as the original.
</p>
<p>
One thread on X uses gifs to directly compare the remake with the original to see the difference.

But is a visual filter enough? While it certainly adds a certain warmth to the graphics, it's unclear if other visual effects used as an artistic choice will be included.
</p>
<p>
In a video from Konami this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-release-date-leaks-as-producer-wants-fans-to-hold-team-to-account">Okamura asked fans to hold the team to account</a>.

</p>
<p>
"We want the players to be able to judge for themselves whether this new team is right for the job of keeping Metal Gear going," he said. "So please, keep watching, and keep us honest."
</p>
<p>
The visual filter is certainly a welcome addition, but I've no doubt passionate fans will continue to share their thoughts.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/phantom-line">Phantom Line</a>, the PVE <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">co-op</a> shooter formerly known as Hornet, has an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2400840/Phantom_Line/">early demo</a> available until the 18th of June, 2024. It’s from Antistatic Studios, who include former <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bioshock">Bioshock</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands">Borderlands</a> devs among their ranks. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> lets you and up to three great mates fill the ectoplasm-stained tactical boots worn by members of the ‘paranormal SWAT’, where you’ll explore large maps and try to contain strange goings on. You’ll need to join the game’s <a href="https://discord.com/invite/uHheyk2PBA">Discord</a> if you want to play. Trailer below.</p>

<p>If you don’t want to go through the hassle of joining and downloading the demo based on the scant details from the trailer, YouTuber ENFANT TERRIBLE has uploaded an entire 50 minute session. I have no idea who they are, though, so while I’m sure they’re lovely, don’t come to me if it turns out they barbecue babies for fun or something.</p>

<p>The game looks to be stuffed with creepy pasta and conspiracy theory-esque paranormal shenanigans. Back when the game was called Hornet, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-cyberpunk-and-bioshock-devs-reveal-eerie-post-apocalyptic-open-world-shooter-hornet">Edwin wrote</a> about its ARG marketing campaign, which included a ‘<a href="https://youtu.be/LJ15D9r_awQ">found footage</a>’ video and a <a href="https://www.anomaleaks.net/">mock conspiracy theory</a> website named AnomaLeaks. I must say, I do enjoy this sort of thing. Does anyone remember those choose your adventure books you’d get with audio tapes and other paraphernalia where you’d have to piece the story together? There was a semi-famous one with werewolves, I believe.</p>
<p>Phantom Line does not, at time of writing, appear to feature werewolves, and looks to be going more for slow build, exploration, horror-with-mates vibes. But what it lacks in big dogs, it makes up for in pedigree. The line-up at Antistatic include former Cyberpunk 2077 writer Lukasz Ludkowski and Kris Teper, former Bioshock series lead environment artist. I’ve also just noticed they’ve described the studio as "committed to…the immersive sim genre.” And now I’m suddenly extremely interested, mark for piling crates on top of each other that I am.</p>

			<p>According to The Coalition's Matt Searcy, the story of the upcoming Gears of War E-Day will best show the tech that the team has been working on.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-e-day-prequel-announced-by-the-coalition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement of E-Day</a> during the Xbox Showcase last week came as a surprise to many - most of us didn't see a prequel title coming following the events of Gears 5. The trailer that Microsoft and developer The Coalition debuted during the showcase was impressive, to say the least, and it was all in-game as well. Of course, we don't know whether the footage was shown running on PC or Xbox Series, but the trailer was, without a doubt, stunning. Interestingly enough, some months back, reputable insider Nate Najda, mostly known as shinobi602, already <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-6-might-appear-at-xbox-showcase-people-arent-ready-for-how-good-it-looks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that people would be impressed with what The Coalition would show off with the next Gears.</p>
<p>As said, many didn't expect a sequel from The Coalition, but according to the studio's Creative Director Matt Searcy, the tech that the team had been working on, will best come into its own via E-day's story. "Making games is really hard,” the Creative Director told Console Creatures in a recent interview. “There’s a lot of investment that you do. And when you find the idea that lit us up at this moment, even if you’re talking about your strategies and games and trilogies and what you could do or not do. You grab that lightning in a bottle. That’s the game everybody is hyped about. We’re gonna make that game.</p>
<p>He continued, "Because it’s gonna be the best fucking <em>Gears</em> game everybody’s ever played, if we make that one. We had this technology that we were working on. This is the story that’s gonna showcase it the best. I think it’s really, at the end of the day, it’s about, again, it’s not Nicole and I making this call. There’s a whole studio of people that are invested in this idea. And you go, “Hell yeah, let’s do that then."</p>
<p>Whether Gears of War E-Day will indeed turn out to be the best Gears game to date remains to be seen (after all, that's what developers always say about their upcoming titles), but going by the game's trailer, E-Day has great potential.</p>
<p>Gears of War: E-Day is coming to Xbox Series and PC on a yet-to-be-announced date.</p>
