            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>

<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/summitsphere.com/post/3m73xolgge22w">Summitsphere</a> is giving <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/antonblast">Antonblast</a> fans one last hurrah, one year after the game first launched on PC. And it's a content-filled update befittingly titled 'THE END'.</p>
<p>On <strong>18th December 2025</strong>, The End is bringing four brand new bosses, a boss rush, multiple new game modes (including Hard Mode), new music, and new spray cans, among lots of other little additions coming to the 2024 platformer, which is heavily inspired by the <strong>Wario Land</strong> series.</p>
<p>Let's have a look at the specifics coming with The End in just a few weeks, courtesy of Antonblast's Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is it. THE END of ANTONBLAST will be the game's final content update, bringing the remaining content promised to our Kickstarter backers, as well as a plethora of <strong>BRAND NEW</strong> content!</p>
<p><strong>FEATURING</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE DEMON CORP<br></strong>This band of bastards has been rehearsing each day for the Big Tournament, and now it's their time to shine. That's right, <strong>FOUR</strong> new (smaller-scale!) boss fights against each member of the Demon Corp. Claim your Prize Star by defeating each of them and be granted early access into their big show!<br>
<strong><br>
THE BIG TOURNAMENT: THE BOSS RUSH<br></strong>Danton has been laboring over day and night and has at last fulfilled his contract to bring the Big Tournament to life! Earn your Battle Pass and prepare to face <em>ANTONBLAST</em>'s most grueling challenge: Face against the game's <strong>nine</strong> major boss fights without facing a knock-out and claim your title of Tournament Champion! There is a big cash prize in it for the winner, too.<br>
<strong><br>
THE LIME TRIALS<br></strong>The mysterious <strong>Lime Trials</strong> make their appearance. Defeat the big baddie of each wing of Brulo's Casino, and you will be granted access to a new kind of timed challenge: Collect all Limes in the room before time runs out to recover the <strong>Souvenir Lime</strong>! And, if you feel like showing off after already collecting the Souvenir Lime, claim cash prizes especially if you beat your best time!</p>
<p><strong>NEW GAME MODES<br></strong>As promised to our supporters, our <strong>Hard Mode</strong> and <strong>Stage Rush Mode</strong> will finally make their appearance. In <strong>Hard Mode</strong>, face the challenges of <em>ANTONBLAST</em> with little extra help and stricter, harder stages and bosses. Satan's troops are a little more prepared this time! In <strong>Stage Rush</strong>, blast through the twelve stages and eight bosses of the Adventure campaign as fast as you can! <strong>Hard Mode</strong> will automatically unlock for any players who have already cleared the first stage in game; <strong>Stage Rush</strong> will automatically unlock for any players who have defeated the Final Boss. But, could there be more...?</p>
<p><strong>DANTON<br></strong>Now that Danton's work around the Casino is mostly finished, you will find him perusing the area. Feel free to talk to him, he's <em>really</em> happy about it!<br>
<strong><br>
NEW SOUNDTRACK AND SOUND WORK</strong><br>
Our updated <em>ANTONBLAST Soundtrack</em> will be <em>wholly replacing</em> the existing tracks in the game. Furthermore, we have extensively touched up our sound design and have totally rebalanced and adjusted the soundscape of the game to prevent audio clipping and other nasty artifacts. The result is the game won't be as ear-piercingly loud, meaning you can get a much cleaner view (hearing?) of what is actually going on at any given moment in the game and don't need to turn the audio down so low. It is a much more pleasing experience on everyone's ears. We have also shifted some sounds around, but you'll have to play the game to hear the difference!<br>
<strong><br>
NEW TRINKETS</strong><br>
Brulo's Shop has been restocked with various new items, such as the <strong>Virtual Visor</strong>, <strong>Game Brick</strong> and <strong>Pet Paint</strong> (harmless, non-toxic). Experience Anton and Annie's Adventure under... a different light.<br>
<strong><br>
NEW SPRAY CANS<br></strong><strong>SIXTEEN</strong> new Spray Cans have been added, bringing the total to <em><strong>110</strong></em>. Most will be hidden, strewn around Brulo's Casino and Peanut Park, so be sure to be look around carefully!<br>
<strong><br>
NEW ACHIEVEMENTS</strong><br>
<strong>FOUR</strong> new achievements for you to figure out and, well, achieve! Discover the secrets of Peanut Park and engage with the new stages and boss fights and (re-)claim your Perfect title on <em>ANTONBLAST</em>!<br>
<strong><br>
NEW LANGUAGE SUPPORT</strong><br>
That's right, you will be able to experience the glorious text and interface of <em>ANTONBLAST</em> in a total of <strong>EIGHT</strong> languages: <strong>English</strong>, <strong>French</strong>, <strong>German</strong>, <strong>Spanish</strong>, <strong>Italian</strong>, <strong>Portuguese</strong>, <strong>Latin-American Spanish</strong> and <strong>Brazillian Portuguese</strong>. We hope our more international Blasters appreciate and enjoy the work our community localizers have put into the game!<br>
<strong><br>
LOTS OF BUG FIXES</strong><br>
I mean, I hope you're not surprised about it! The team has put TREMENDOUS work into polishing up <em>ANTONBLAST</em> into being the best game ever. We hope it reached that standard now!<br>
<strong><br>
AND MORE!<br></strong>There is a LOT more that you will see that we have not talked about here. It will all be made clear... in THE END.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's a <em>lot</em> for an ending, isn't it? Any excuse to go back to Antonblast, which <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/antonblast">we loved</a> back when it launched on Switch last year. And it's received a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/12/antonblast-receives-update-on-switch-with-performance-boost-to-60fps">performance boost since launch</a>.</p>

While Black Ops 7 is sticking to thematically appropriate operator skins, Season 11 of Call of Duty Mobile includes a major crossover with Street Fighter, which allows players to transform into the popular fighting characters and use their iconic fighting moves. This new season also adds a DMZ extraction mode, new loadout items to unlock, and special events.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Season_11_start_date_details">Season 11 start date details</h2><p dir="ltr">Season 11 starts on December 11 at 12 PM PT / 3 PM ET.

There are also weapon blueprints, skins, and other cosmetics available to unlock for free.</p><p dir="ltr">For the premium tiers, the battle pass offers the "Mauy Claus" Santa operator skin for Ajax and the "Iron Kata" skin for Sparrowhawk.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Horses, a disturbing indie horror game, was set to launch yesterday on several digital storefronts, but in the past week, many of those retailers have refused to list it, including Steam, the Epic Games Store, and most recently, the Humble Store. It's a move that has sparked controversy online, with many decrying it as unjust censorship of the game’s adult themes. But what, exactly, is in this game that makes it so offensive? Each platform has released its own statement, but<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/unsettling-horror-game-horses-banned-from-steam-leaving-studio-with-high-risk-of-closure">&nbsp;in an interview with&nbsp;IGN</a>, Pietro Righi Riva, co-founder of Horses developer Santa Ragione (which previously created titles like <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2022/09/15/saturnalia-an-indie-horror-with-an-art-style-you-have-to-see-captures-october-release">Saturnalia</a> and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/wheels_of_aurelia/b/pc/archive/2016/10/05/on-the-road-again-and-again.aspx">Wheels of Aurelia</a>), explained what he thinks happened.</p><p>The titular horses are not, in fact horses – the game's primary disturbing element is that the farm the player visits has a population of enslaved, nude humans wearing horse masks. The controversy is not solely related to the nudity or enslavement, but about a character's young daughter and her proximity to the "horses."</p>

<p>"The daughter wants to ride one of the horses (in the game the ‘horses’ are humans wearing a horse mask) and gets to pick which one,"<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/unsettling-horror-game-horses-banned-from-steam-leaving-studio-with-high-risk-of-closure">&nbsp;Riva told&nbsp;IGN</a>. "What followed was an interactive dialogue sequence where the player is leading, by a lead as if they were a horse, a naked adult woman with a young girl on her shoulders. The scene is not sexual in any way, but it is possible that the juxtaposition is what triggered the flag."&nbsp;</p><p>Horses was rejected by Steam when it was submitted for review in 2023. Riva claims Steam never gave him a specific moment to explain the rejection, but the rejection message included a line that read, "Regardless of a developer’s intentions with their product, we will not distribute content that appears, in our judgment, to depict sexual conduct involving a minor." Assuming the issue was with the daughter character, they raised her age.</p>



<article data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="7cb19293-6c29-4c15-a9e1-579641aea176" data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.none_original_image" data-entity-embed-display-settings="{&quot;link_url&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;link_target&quot;:0,&quot;link_original&quot;:0,&quot;image_source&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;embed_source&quot;:0,&quot;image_caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;embed_caption&quot;:0,&quot;content_warning&quot;:0}" data-langcode="en">

<p>"We have since changed the character in the scene to be a twenty-something woman, both to avoid the juxtaposition and more importantly because the dialogue delivered in that scene, which deals with the societal structure in the world of Horses, works much better when delivered by an older character," Riva's statement continues. Despite the adjustment, Steam has not changed course. Reportedly, even after repeated contact between Riva and various representatives at Steam, he hasn't even received confirmation of what scene or element of the game caused the ban in the first place.</p><p>Yesterday, the ban expanded when the Epic Games Store, which had been set to sell Horses, reversed course at the last minute. Despite reportedly approving the game earlier in the year, the game was rejected 24 hours before its planned launch. The game&nbsp;<a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/horses-004d87">has a store page and everything</a>, and at the time of writing, Horses is still listed as "coming soon." Developer Santa Ragione received the following statement from the Epic Games Store, and a representative from Epic later confirmed to&nbsp;IGN that the statement was accurate:</p><p>We are unable to distribute Horses on the Epic Games Store because our review found violations of the Epic Games Store Content Guidelines, specifically the ‘Inappropriate Content’ and ‘Hateful or Abusive Content’ policies. The ‘Inappropriate Content’ policy prohibits content which “contains explicit or frequent depictions of sexual behavior or not appropriately labeled, rated, or age-gated.” The ‘Hateful or Abusive Content’ policy prohibits content that promotes abuse and animal abuse. This content is prohibited by our Guidelines and cannot be distributed on the Epic Games Store. Additionally, when we [Epic] filled out the IARC Questionnaire based on the content that we reviewed, it received an Adult Only (AO) rating. Products with AO ratings cannot be distributed on the Epic Games Store (the only exception is for products in cases where an AO rating was applied solely due to the usage of blockchain or NFT technology). You have some options on how to move forward: 1. You can make updates to your product to ensure compliance and resubmit it for review. 2. If you believe we made a mistake, you also have the ability to appeal this decision. You can appeal by replying to this email or creating a private discussion on our Developer Support site. Select "Epic Games Store" as the topic. 3. You cannot change the title or content to repurpose it for another game. If you choose not to move forward, we'll refund your submission fee for this product.</p><p>Riva has since claimed that the ban is more likely due to the increased media attention following the news that Steam would not be listing the game, but Epic has not confirmed this fact. Riva has also said that the studio filled out its own IARC questionnaire – a form which evaluates the rating of your game for PEGI, ESRB, and other video game content rating authorities – and unlike Epic's AO rating, Santa Ragione saw its game marked as rated M for Mature.</p><p>As of today,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horses-the-upsetting-horror-game-previously-banned-on-steam-gets-last-minute-ban-from-epic-games-store-too">IGN&nbsp;reports the Humble Store has banned the game as well</a>, and accessing the link the game was previously listed at,&nbsp;<a href="http://humblebundle.com/store/horses">humblebundle.com/store/horses</a>, prompts an error message in the right corner of the screen that reads, "HORSES is no longer available for purchase."&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/horror/controversial-horror-game-horses-gets-kicked-off-the-humble-store-one-day-after-launch-but-its-also-become-the-best-selling-new-release-on-gog/">PC Gamer reports that a representative from Santa Ragione confirmed the game's removal</a>, but at the time of writing, has not received a response from Humble.</p><p><a href="https://www.horses.wtf/index.html">Horses is still available on itch.io and GOG</a>. It probably goes without saying, but the game contains adult and potentially objectionable content, so proceed to those links with caution. It's currently one of the best-selling games on GOG, as its bans have shone a spotlight on it that it might not have otherwise received.&nbsp;</p><p>Sources: IGN [<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/unsettling-horror-game-horses-banned-from-steam-leaving-studio-with-high-risk-of-closure">1</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horses-the-upsetting-horror-game-previously-banned-on-steam-gets-last-minute-ban-from-epic-games-store-too">2</a>], <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/horror/controversial-horror-game-horses-gets-kicked-off-the-humble-store-one-day-after-launch-but-its-also-become-the-best-selling-new-release-on-gog/">PC Gamer</a></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/12/03/steam-the-epic-games-store-and-the-humble-store-refuse-to-sell-indie-horror-game-horses]]></content:encoded>

But the company claims that the Mat is also designed to reduce stress, relieve pain and tension, and improve the quality of your sleep.</p><p>The Woojer Mat is available now for $799 through the company’s online store, but is currently discounted to $699. It’s described as a mattress topper but unlike those memory foam pads that stay permanently atop your mattress and under your sheets, at 30-inches wide the Woojer Mat is narrower than even a twin-sized mattress and is instead designed to be unfolded and used only as needed. It’s not a permanent bedroom upgrade.</p><p>Underneath an outer layer of breathable fabric is thin padding embedded with six haptic transducers capable of producing low frequencies up to 250Hz. The mat connects to any device that’s compatible with headphones and speakers using Bluetooth, USB-C, or an analog audio cable, including your smartphone. If you want to continue to listen to a movie, song, or game while their audio is being turned into soothing vibrations, the mat can wirelessly connect to headphones or you can plug them into a built-in amplifier using a cable.</p><p>Connecting the Woojer Mat to its accompanying mobile app also provides access to a “rich library of dedicated vibroacoustic sessions designed for everything from back pain relief to deep relaxation and mental clarity.” If you want to use it without distractions, you can adjust volume and the intensity of the vibrations using a strip of buttons on the mat without reaching for your phone or other devices.</p><p>We haven’t tested the mat and can’t vouch for Woojer’s wellness claims. But like those elaborate chairs that provide an intense full-body massage experience or a white noise machine, the mat’s biggest benefit could be as sensory distraction so you temporarily forget mental stresses that leave you tense or unable to fall asleep.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/837482/woojer-haptic-wellness-mat-vibrations-bluetooth]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em><a href="https://kotaku.com/games/ready-or-not">Ready or Not</a>,</em> a popular (and controversial) first-person tactical co-op shooter and SWAT simulator, is getting a free trial on consoles. The trial will feature full access to the game and will be available for the rest of 2025.</p> <p>On December 3, Void Interactive announced a new limited-time free trial for<em> Ready or Not.</em> The trial is available now on PlayStation 5 (with a PS Plus subscription), Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. Once downloaded and installed, players will have access to the entirety of<em> Ready or Not,</em> including every mission. Players can enjoy the game for three hours before the trial ends. After that, all progress made in the trial can be carried over to the full game if players decide to purchase <em>Ready or Not.</em> This free taste will be available only on consoles and only until February 20, 2026.</p> <p>First released in 2021 on PC via Steam early access, <em>Ready or Not</em> has been mired in controversy over the years. <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-loses-publisher-days-after-devs-remind-fans-about-1848258819">The game lost its original publisher</a>, Team17, shortly before launch. The SWAT sim courted controversy over its subject matter, including a level set in a community college. <a href="https://kotaku.com/controversial-steam-best-seller-ready-or-not-is-an-unse-1848317351">When <em>Kotaku’s</em> own Ethan Gach played the game in 2022</a>, he felt it was unfinished and filled with juvenile humor and unsettling copaganda. I recently played it earlier this year, and while the action is tight and snappy, everything around it, including how it makes you treat every human you meet as a threat, is hard to ignore.</p> <p>In July, it found itself buried in a whole different mess of controversy <a href="https://kotaku.com/ready-or-not-censorship-update-console-mod-uncensored-1851786403">when a patch was rolled out across PC</a>&nbsp;that made changes to some in-game assets, including the censorship of nudity. This was done to make the game easier to release on consoles. Fans who had been playing for years called foul and review-bombed <em>Ready or Not.</em> A modder rolled back the changes within an hour of the patch going live. Things have calmed down a lot since then, and the game has continued to receive frequent updates.&nbsp; <a href="https://kotaku.com/ready-or-not-community-manager-fired-for-responding-to-charlie-kirk-assassination-with-nothing-was-lost-2000627182">Earlier this year, the game’s community manager was fired after joking about Charlie Kirk’s killing.&nbsp;</a></p>

                <p>Legendary game designer and programmer Ron Gilbert (Monkey Island) has revealed that one of his exciting-sounding upcoming projects has been canceled due in part to investors not coming to the table to fund the project.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/12/after-40-years-of-adventure-games-ron-gilbert-pivots-to-outrunning-death/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Speaking to Ars Technica</a>, Gilbert said this game had a vision of being a "large, open-world-type RPG" in the vein of The Legend of Zelda. Gilbert worked alongside two other people--an artist and a designer--for about a year on the project before Gilbert realized it was not going to happen.</p><p>"I just [didn't] have the money or the time to build a big open-world game like that," he said. "You know, it's either a passion project you spent 10 years on, or you just need a bunch of money to be able to hire people and resources."</p><p>Gilbert previously described his new project as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monkey-island-creators-next-game-is-best-described-as-classic-zelda-meets-diablo-meets-thimbleweed-park" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"classic Zelda meets Diablo meets Thimbleweed Park,"</a> and a lot of people were excited to find out what that might look like. Now it's not happening.</p><h2>"Horrible" publishing deals</h2><p>Gilbert said he pitched the project to people in the industry but discovered that "deals that publishers were offering were just horrible."</p><p>The kind of game Gilbert envisioned "isn't the big, hot item" so potential publishers didn't invest, he said. "The amount of money they're willing to put up and the deals they were offering just made absolutely no sense to me to go do this," he explained.</p><p>Gilbert funded 2017's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/thimbleweed-park-review/1900-6416642/" data-ref-id="1900-6416642">Thimbleweed Park</a> on Kickstarter, bringing in more than $600,000 USD. Gilbert also took private investment to complete the project.</p><p>The industry veteran observed that publishers today can be "very analytics-driven" and have devised their own formulas to "try to figure out how much money they could make." The result of this, Gilbert observed, is that publishers take on less risk, and in turn, games that do get made often look the same.</p><p>"You end up [getting] a whole lot of games that look exactly the same as last year’s games, because that makes some money," he said. "When we were starting out, we couldn't do that because we didn't know what made this money ... I think that's why I really enjoy the indie game market because it's kind of free of a lot of that stuff that big publishers bring to it, and there's a lot more creativity and you know, strangeness, and bizarreness."</p><p>Gilbert's latest game is Death by Scrolling, an action game that was released at the end of October this year. Before that, he partnered with Devolver for Return to Monkey Island.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Getting 100% completion in a Metroid game--and metroidvania titles in general--is a satisfying achievement that's part of the genre's appeal. However, in Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, there is unfortunately a way to pigeonhole yourself where collecting everything needed isn't possible. Now, the game will warn you about a point of no return, but it's still easy to make a regrettable decision. That's why GameSpot's reviewer for the first-person adventure, Steve Watts, advises players to make a copy of their main save in another save slot before entering the endgame.</p><p dir="ltr">Watts detailed the "confusing choice" that Nintendo and developer Retro Studios made in his <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review-prime-but-not-quite-prime-prime/1900-6418446/">Metroid Prime 4 review</a>. "When I was ready to proceed to the endgame, I got the usual warnings about a point of no return, but I had figured I could always load an older save to go back and do more exploring to pick up power-ups that I missed," Watts wrote. "But the auto-save now has me locked into the final area with no such apparent option, and my regular save slot--the one that activates when Samus steps into a save station--has been overwritten with a Mission Complete, so loading it prompts me to start a new game."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Metroid Prime 4 Beyond Review</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The main menu does allow you to make a copy of a game in a different slot. If you want to proceed to the endgame to see how the story concludes, while allowing freedom to go back and explore, make sure that you either make a copy of your save or opt not to overwrite with a Mission Complete save. That said, there's always the possibility that Nintendo and Retro address this confusing issue with a future update for the Switch and Switch 2 game.</p><p dir="ltr">Metroid Prime 4 launches tomorrow, December 4. The game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-features-a-new-samus-aran-voice-actor/1100-6536668/">features a new voice actor for Samus Aran</a> with Erin Yvette replacing previous Metroid Prime mainstay Jennifer Hale. In addition, Krystle Martin provides the motion capture for the bounty hunter.

                <p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has enjoyed an exceptional year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2025-winners-nominees/2900-7258/" data-ref-id="2900-7258">becoming the most-nominated game in the history of The Game Awards</a>. Its cast--Ben Starr, Charlie Cox, and Jennifer English among them--earned major recognition in the show's performance categories, helping cement the game as one of the year's standout achievements. But even while celebrating this success, the cast has been discussing ways the awards could grow, especially when it comes to recognizing the full range of performance work that brings modern games to life.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-cast-calls-for-the-game-awards-to-add-a-motion-capture-category/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Video Games Chronicle</a>, cast members English, Shayla Nyx, Devora Wilde, and Aliona Baranova shared their hope that The Game Awards will eventually expand its performance categories. They explained that, while the nominations are an honor, the current categories overlook many essential performers.</p><p>"If I may, can I put my petition forward for why we need to have a motion capture category?" Baranova said. "It's been decades of actors going in, doing the mocap, and then someone else's voice is popped on top, and those mocap performers just disappear. I forgot that. Nobody knows about them.” Baranova, who worked as a motion capture director on Baldur's Gate 3, noted that this issue has persisted for years.</p><p>She added that recognition could also help audiences better understand the craft. "The audience doesn't know enough about this because there's not enough attention on it," she continued. "If we had an award category for mocap specifically, then studios would be encouraged to release that behind-the-scenes footage because people are desperate for it. Studios keep that a bit quiet because it gives away details on how they made the game."</p><p>Actor Charlie Cox echoed the sentiment last month, saying that although he's "thrilled" about his nomination, credit for his role in Expedition 33 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/expedition-33-actor-says-hes-truly-grateful-for-outpouring-of-support-after-charlie-cox-spoke-out/1100-6536509/" data-ref-id="1100-6536509">must be shared with motion capture performer Maxence Carzole</a>.</p><p>"It needs to happen," Baranova added. "I posted about it online the other day, and some people were questioning like, "How would we do it?'. I don't know, they can figure it out. We need to do it because there are these fantastic mocap performances going on."</p><p>Devora Wilde agreed, saying, "Yes, I was actually surprised about that for The Game Awards. But I think that's always been the case, hasn't it? It's just been 'performance in a game'."</p><p>The Game Awards will stream live from the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles on December 11, and in case you didn't know, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/quick-reminder-you-can-vote-in-the-game-awards-now/1100-6536609/" data-ref-id="1100-6536609">you can also vote in the awards</a>.</p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/pointcrow-tortellini-goldfish-dead-elden-ring-youtube/</link>
            <guid>1372063</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Tortellini, a goldfish that defied pretty much every conceivable odd to beat some of <em>Elden Ring’</em>s toughest bosses, has died. He was three.</p><p>YouTuber and streamer Eric “Pointcrow” Morino informed his community of Tortellini’s passing <a href="https://x.com/PointCrow/status/1994132270530335040?ref=aftermath.site"><u>on Twitter</u></a> late last week.</p><p>"Unfortunately, my goldfish Tortellini has passed away," Morino wrote. "He's been unwell for the past couple weeks fighting a systemic bacterial infection and took a turn for the worse last night. I'm doing my best as a goldfish keeper, but fancies are incredibly fragile, and it seems that after 3 years it was his time to go."&nbsp;</p><p>Goldfish can live to be older than ten with proper care and space, but there are <a href="https://www.about-goldfish.com/how-long-do-goldfish-live.html?ref=aftermath.site"><u>many misconceptions around their actual needs</u></a> and even <a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/goldfish-may-have-longer-memories-than-just-three-seconds-46062?ref=aftermath.site"><u>their supposedly fleeting memories</u></a>, which studies have shown are much more sophisticated than colloquial myths have led people to believe. As a result, goldfish in captivity often fail to reach their golden years.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“Rather than wax on all [the] mistakes I've made keeping [a] fancy goldfish, lessons I've learned too late (there is so much to know), and how devastated I am over this loss, I really want to highlight all the accomplishments Tortellini has done,” Morino wrote.&nbsp;</p><p>Tortellini led a distinguished life among video game-playing animals. Breathing – or extracting from water, via gills – the same rarified air as <a href="https://aftermath.site/speedrunning-dog-interview-peanut-butter-agdq/"><u>Peanut Butter the speedrunning dog</u></a>, Tortellini managed feats that have eluded the majority of human beings. Specifically, he toppled a slew of <em>Elden Ring</em> bosses, including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1AzDZiVOU&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Melania</u></a>, considered to be the base game’s hardest boss, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NSek3TIhT4&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Consort Radahn</u></a>, the final boss of the <em>Shadow Of The Erdtree</em> DLC.&nbsp;</p><p>This involved a setup that mapped Tortellini’s tank onto a grid, each portion of which corresponded to a controller input. Repeats on the grid ensured that Tortellini was never doing <em>nothing</em> as long as he kept drifting around, but that didn’t stop him from, for example, repeatedly trying to swig health flasks even when he had none. Attempts took hours, as well as a special build that focused on armor and bleed damage, minimizing the number of times Tortellini – whose memory might be better than assumed, but whose perception of the human world and all its terrors still leaves something to be desired – would have to hit enemies and dodge.&nbsp;</p><p>Tortellini also proved to be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pTupmpyBeM&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>a capable<em> Mario Party</em> player</u></a>.</p><p>Videos of his accomplishments have racked up over 10 million views in total, meaning that, as Morino has observed, Tortellini might actually be the most famous goldfish in history.</p><p>After Morino announced that Tortellini had gone to the great goldfish tank in the sky, mourners poured into not just <a href="https://x.com/NotTDuwbs/status/1994170139395117540?ref=aftermath.site"><u>his Twitter post</u></a>, but also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NSek3TIhT4&amp;lc=UgySsIqAJX7h3M0Mjsd4AaABAg&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>years-old videos</u></a> and even <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PointCrow/comments/1p9lk4m/a_shiny_hunt_in_honour_of_the_greatest_piscine/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>games</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>"Had to come back and watch this absolute legend of a goldfish after hearing the sad news," <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAPtyfEzoo&amp;lc=Ugw_eCbRMaSlZBJt9qx4AaABAg&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>wrote one</u></a> video commenter. "I will miss you little fish."</p><p>Recent years have seen a growing number of viewers raise questions about the ethics of pets and content creation, whether it’s the <a href="https://aftermath.site/hasan-piker-dog-collar-kaya-nontroversy-twitch/"><u>storm of bad-faith nonsense surrounding Hasan Piker’s dog</u></a> or more legitimate concerns like <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/viral/animal-sanctuary-rescues-pet-pig-belonged-logan-paul-pearl-rcna65105?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Logan Paul’s pig being found</u></a> abandoned in a field, disheveled and unhealthy, after she was “irresponsibly rehomed” according to the animal sanctuary that ended up saving her. Aftermath reached out to Morino for more details about his approach to taking care of Tortellini, as well as what he self-admittedly learned over time, but did not receive a response as of this publishing.</p><p>"[Tortellini] was there to make us all laugh and bewilder us on how a small fish could do so much,” Morino wrote in his Twitter post. “He's lived a god damn good life. I miss him so much."</p><h2 id="recommended">Recommended</h2><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/haru-urara-horse-death-umamusume/"><div><p>Beloved Loser Horse That Inspired A Generation (And An Umamusume Anime Girl) Dies - Aftermath</p><p>An incredible number of people are mourning the death of Haru Urara, the inspiration behind one of the most popular anime girls in Umamusume.</p><p><span>Nathan Grayson</span></p></div></a></figure>

            <title><![CDATA[Octopath Traveler 0 Review - Octagon Peg, Square Hole]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/octopath-traveler-0-review-free-to-play</link>
            <guid>1372039</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> leads with a lot of messages directly to the player over a shimmering background. In this game, the player is assured, you can be anyone. You can go anywhere.&nbsp;</p><p>It sounds great: a promise that many games make, but exceedingly few deliver on. Unfortunately, <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> is closer to the empty promise of the many than the delivery on the few.</p><h2>Freedom Facade</h2><p>Where this freedom fails is the story that <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> attempts to tell. Instead of using the eight protagonists that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/octopath-traveler-review-road-less-traveled" rel="nofollow">defined the original Octopath</a>, 0 centers your journey around antagonists. Specifically, these antagonists embody the temptations of Fame, Power, and Wealth.</p><p>Gone are the days of small vignettes. Instead, this tale is a continent-spanning epic about warring kingdoms. The bigger war going on is between the story and the game that’s containing it. Octopath’s structure of chapters that last around an hour or two is perfect for smaller-scale stories, as a few bite-sized, self-contained stories lead to a climactic conclusion.</p><p>On the other hand, this longer-form story struggles. It cycles through a seemingly endless supply of new characters, nearly all of whom are one of two absolutes: “I am a good guy” or “I am a bad guy.” None of them goes through meaningful growth or change.</p><p>During dialogue exchanges your custom character protagonist has with this large cast, you’ll occasionally be prompted to make choices. These choices, a totally new addition to the franchise, are also a superfluous one. Every time you make a choice, there is a clear “right” and “wrong” answer. If you choose the wrong one, you’re usually just taken back to the dialogue choice. Less <em>Baldur’s Gate</em>, more <em>Pokémon</em>.</p><p>This created protagonist also comes at the cost of the usual octet of heroes on your journey. Where previous games had the heroes’ personalities at the forefront, <em>0 </em>has only your created protagonist with no dialogue. In attempting to create a canvas, <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> is left with more of a husk.</p><h2>Familiar Feelings</h2><p>Where <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> shines is in the places it borrows from its predecessors. The turn-based battle system is as sharp as ever. Strategizing Boost Points and attack types to Break your opponents is immensely satisfying.&nbsp;</p><p>With how balanced the game is around the new, more singular story, the level curve is more direct. Your party members will all begin to have all of their skills unlocked and reach their full potential right at the final showdown. It feels free of level scaling issues that have plagued other entries.</p><p>The biggest change is with the freedom granted by the additional party members. Your battle party consists of eight characters instead of 4. This means that certain party members can take a supporting role in the back row, while a vanguard fights up front. &nbsp;This switch-up refreshed the already top-of-the-class battle system in a very engaging way.</p><p>To support this greater battle, you can get quite a few new heroes in your total ranks. Instead of the usual eight, there are loads of characters to find– my final crew had 15– and it's fun to try out all of the different combinations. You'll find a few favorites: shoutout to Viator, the best tank a guy could ask for. However, changing out your party is a quick menu away.</p><p>This sizable band of heroes comes at the cost of the old skill upgrade style and a new, more rigid system. Like all <em>Octopath </em>games, you gain more agency as time goes on, but it's a long walk. It's a neat change, but I'm hoping not the new normal.</p><p>It also still has the same HD-2D style that the series has become known for. It still has its same perks– gorgeous pop-up book environments, cool enemy battle sprites– and its same drawbacks– lack of character expression, limitations of how varied characters look. It also has the same great soundtrack as the first two games, but it is mostly reused from other games.</p><p>Also returning from the original games is the lengthy endgame. <em>Octopath Traveler</em> is at its best when you can break the battle system, and getting the last tools to do so is always a satisfying feeling.</p><h2><em>Octopath Traveler 0</em>&nbsp;| Final Thoughts</h2><p><em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> is a game at odds with itself.

Paul Tobin, a distinguished Senior Concept Artist and Art Director at Weta Workshop, will be bringing his creative experience and passion to the acclaimed tabletop studio.</p><h2>Paul Tobin Joining Chaosium</h2><p>According to the official press release, Paul Tobin had a hand in many blockbuster films during his time at Weta Workshop. His work has been featured in Peter Jackson's <em>The Hobbit</em> trilogy, James Cameron's <em>Avatar</em> franchise, the award-winning sci-fi TV show, <em>The Expanse</em>, and Denis Villeneuve's <em>Blade Runner 2049</em>. Tobin's work even appeared in Monolith Software's <em>Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor</em> video game.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>But Tobin's work has also appeared in other tabletop projects. These include <em>Werewolf: The Apocalypse</em>, <em>Curseborn</em>, and <em>13th Age</em>. &nbsp;In addition, he already has a working relationship with Chaosium, working for several months on the latest edition of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/chaosium-releases-pendragon-quick-start-rules" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Pendragon</em></a>, the TTRPG set in the time of Arthurian knights.</p><p>That relationship has now strengthened with Paul Tobin working full-time at Chaosium. Furthermore, he will be contributing to art direction for the studio's most popular tabletop game, <em>Call of Cthulhu</em>. The cosmic horror TTRPG is one of the most beloved in the industry, recently celebrating its 50th anniversary with a recently announced <a href="https://www.chaosium.com/call-of-cthulhu-chaosium-50th-anniversary-slipcase-set/" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">slipcase set</a>. Tobin stated the following regarding the new chapter of his career:</p><blockquote><p>"I started playing Call of Cthulhu 35 years ago, so joining Chaosium in its 50th year feels like I’ve just rolled a critical success on my Luck roll. Working on Pendragon these past few months has been incredible, and I’m excited to meet even more of the team in the months ahead."</p></blockquote><p>Chaosium was founded in 1975 by game designer Greg Stafford. &nbsp;Since its foundation, the studio has been behind many beloved tabletop experiences like the swashbuckling pirate adventures of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/7th-sea-price-of-arrogance-is-first-major-campaign-for-pirates-ttrpg" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>7th Sea</em></a>, and the bronze age fantasy of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/cults-of-runequest-announced-by-chaosium" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Runequest</em></a>.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

<p>Despite the delay, the <em>Skyblivion </em>mod team says it's "closer than ever" to release, and that the mod is currently "in the best state it has ever been", so perhaps we can hope that this will be the final delay for the ambitious project.</p><p>Specifically, the team says the entire world map of <em>Oblivion </em>is "100% complete" in <em>Skyrim</em>, and you can check out an interactive map of the team's work <a href="https://skyblivion.com/map/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">here</a> (although it might be a little slower to load whenever the site is busy, apparently).</p><p>Additionally, all quest dungeons are complete "with unique boss battles and rewards", and the mod's core weapon, armor, and clutter assets are "essentially finished" and sporting "beautiful and unique redesigns".</p><p>You can check out a video that contains a more detailed breakdown of where the <em>Skyblivion </em>team is at, and what needs to be done next, right here.</p>
<p>If you're not familiar with <em>Skyblivion</em>, it's a total conversion mod that is aiming to reproduce the entirety of <em>Oblivion</em>'s world in <em>Skyrim</em>, complete with the former's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/skyblivion-devs-detail-remastered-quests-and-environments" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ef9bba54-91b5-4661-99d0-8e16492cc51d" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">quests</a>, environments, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/biggest-skyblivion-update-shows-world" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="892838a0-bbd2-435a-8df4-97e3eeb52ea1" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">world</a>.</p><p>The mod will be free when it launches, but it will require you to own both <em>Oblivion</em>'s Game of the Year Deluxe edition and <em>Skyrim</em>'s Special Edition, so make sure you've got both of them before you install it (when it releases, of course).</p><p><em>Skyblivion </em>has been in development for a number of years; in the intervening time between its announcement and the present day, Bethesda <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-released" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a10701c6-a666-4045-979d-936482373c34" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">released its own <em>Oblivion </em>remaster</a>, although arguably, what the <em>Skyblivion </em>team is aiming to do is even more ambitious than that.

Truth be told, I have never played a Castlevania game. Just haven't gotten round to one of 'em yet! Symphony of the Night is probably more my speed over the original games, but I do see their importance too of course. However, what I have played, at least a little bit of, is a game that is very derivative of OG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-platform-games-on-pc">platformer</a> except for the fact you can see the entire, 8-bit level at once: Schattenjäger.
</p>
<p>
The setup is as simple as many NES games were. You are Gabriel Knight, the titular Schattenjäger, who has received a request from the local townspeople in the dead of night to rescue a woman named Diana from the evil Count (i.e. legally distinct Dracula). You've got a big ole spear, and you can throw some kind of magic glass thing for long distance damage. It's Castlevania! But as I said, rather than scroll bit by bit, you can see the entire level at once.

<p>
At first I wondered what purpose this might serve. Seeing the whole level gives you the advantage that you know what's coming, so you can plot out your next steps. Though, that potentially trivialises some elements of the game. Agh! No! I just got hit by an invisible enemy, and I died. Womp, womp. It's a bit mean spirited, but in that Soulsian kind of way, where you've learned a lesson, a tidbit about the world, and can come back better next time.
</p><p>
Overall it is most definitely more of a technical exercise than a gameplay revolution. There's an emphasis on the novelty of it, the fact that "every pixel is exactly one pixel in full-HD resolution." And yet it doesn't claim to be anything more than it is, it doesn't outstay its welcome, and offers a fun spin on a classic series. Give it a punt on <a href="https://tim-rachor.itch.io/schattenjaeger">itch.io</a>, it can even run in your browser.

            <title><![CDATA[EXCLUSIVE – Eidos Montreal Was Working on a Legacy of Kain Reboot Before Embracer Buyout]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/legacy-of-kain-reboot-eidos-montreal/</link>
            <guid>1372021</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<div><p>Several CVs from past employees at Eidos Montreal have revealed that the developer was working on a ‘Dark Fantasy ARPG’ and was focused on reviving an established vampire IP, with a design emphasis on melee combat and parkour. The details have sparked a lot of speculation online, but Insider Gaming can confirm that it was a Legacy of Kain reboot and that its cancellation is a few years old at this point.</p><p>To make it clear, the current set of cancelled projects circulating around is years old and is not a part of the current layoffs.</p></div>







<p>The project was cancelled following Embracer’s acquisition of the studio, which was known internally as P16, as it was the 16th project to start development at Eidos Montreal.</p>



<p>Described to Insider Gaming as a ‘Legacy of Kain soft-reboot’, the game made it only around a year into development before Embracer pulled the plug to send the IP back to Crystal Dynamics. However, it’s currently unknown whether or not Crystal Dynamics did anything with the IP after it was transferred back.</p>



<p>Sources tell Insider Gaming that the project was going well, and despite only around a year of development, there was already some barebones gameplay.</p>



<p>P17 is, unfortunately, just one of many projects cancelled at Eidos Montreal in the last few years (as many as 7-8), with the studio seemingly being forced into a direction of being an outsourcing studio for the likes of Grounded 2 and Fable. Sources tell me that the developers were also previously asked to work on Kojima’s Overdose, but the request was refused because some of its developers would have had to move to Japan.</p>







<p>Currently, Eidos Montreal is also working on its own massive internal project, which started development around 2019 and has seen hundreds of millions of dollars pumped into it – a cost that sources say will unlikely to be recouped – but too much investment has already been made for it to be cancelled.</p>



<p>As for what this eventually means for Eidos Montreal is unclear, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/eidos-montreal-another-embracer-studio-suffers-large-scale-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">layoffs earlier this year</a> and now <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/eidos-montreal-lets-go-staff-more-layoffs-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other subsequent rounds of layoffs</a> could mean that the future is dire for the studio. </p>



<p>If you’re a developer at Eidos Montreal and would like to speak further on the issues at the studio, you can email me securely and anonymously at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="592d36342d3634313c373d3c2b2a363719292b362d363734383035773a3634">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></p>

It comes with a breakdown for some of the community talking points BF Studios has attempted to address so far, while giving fans a closer look at what’s to come when Winter Offensive launches December 9.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/battlefield-6-anticheat-update-season-1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">anticheat</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-update-quickly-fixes-defibrillators-after-support-players-report-strict-revive-requirements">challenge/progression</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-surprise-update-addresses-escalation-feedback-with-increased-objective-capture-time">Escalation</a> updates topping the list of recent highlights, BF Studios is turning its attention to a number of key issues across combat, REDSEC, and the overall Battlefield 6 experience. One especially troublesome issue for the community that the team is seeking to fix with update 1.1.3.0 are audio issues that have existed since launch. Players should notice, for example, that footsteps have been tweaked to “improve clarity, distance definition, and positional awareness across the game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We have also continued to work on performance and memory issues that could cause sounds,” BF Studios says, “such as vehicles or footsteps, to sometimes not play as intended, which has been particularly noticeable on larger Battle Royale maps.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following last month’s multiplayer mode tweaks is a set of additional adjustments for Rush and Breakthrough. The studio explains the new changes as another step in the balancing act that has seen it attempting to keep matches fair, with the new update ideally improving the experience for attacking players.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Battlefield Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Capture volumes and vehicle availability in Breakthrough will also be updated when 1.1.3.0 launches next week, with BF Studios explaining that Siege of Cairo, for example, will feature an additional attacker tank for Sectors 1 and 3 and a reworked capture area for objective B. Rush fans will notice M-COM locations for Manhattan Bridge and Liberation Peak have been adjusted to further refine attacker gameplay.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“These updates are intended to reduce bottlenecks, remove frustration points, and create more consistent and engaging fights around objectives,” BF Studios says.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Beyond these highlights, we have also made a range of quality-of-life improvements across UI clarity, minimap behavior, controller aiming responsiveness, and more, which you will see detailed in the full notes.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another topic plaguing the Battlefield 6 fanbase since launch involves potential hit registration and netcode issues. It’s an area BF Studios has taken aim at before, with update 1.1.3.0 set to, hopefully, buff out even more scratches related to inconsistent gameplay across multiplayer and REDSEC. Also included in the new changes is the promise that Battlefield 6 will be easier on the eyes thanks to changes to close-range soldier visibility, lighting, prone animations, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While players across the experience will likely pick up on “wide-ranging” changes to weapon handling, attachments, and recoil patterns, REDSEC fans can look forward to armor and tank availability changes. Armor changes for the battle royale experience will be detailed in its own dedicated post in the near future, with tank changes also subject to change as fans get their hands on update 1.1.3.0.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We are actively exploring several areas aimed at improving clarity, responsiveness, and fairness in combat, BF Studios adds. “This includes further work on edge cases related to hit registration, investigating rare desync scenarios with destructible objects, and gathering deeper data on situations where players feel they were eliminated after reaching cover. These areas remain key priorities, and the findings from our ongoing investigations will inform updates planned for the new year.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This latest communication from the Battlefield team stops short of providing full Battlefield 6 update 1.1.3.0 patch notes. Players are told to expect a more detailed list of all of the new weapon, map, and mode changes in “the next few days.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 Season 1 will deliver its third and final chapter when Winter Offensive launches December 9 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X | S. While the two previous chapters have introduced additional weapons, modes, and two maps – Blackwell Fields and Eastwood – next week’s content update focuses on its Ice Lock event changes. Expect snowy limited-time goodies for Gauntlet and Empire State, as well as an ice climbing axe melee weapon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 launched for PC and consoles October 10.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/no-games-for-genocide-xbox-microsoft-boycott-palestine-2000650175</link>
            <guid>1371994</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>No Games For Genocide, a collective of video game workers and union organizers, just announced a pledge to boycott Xbox. It calls on journalists, developers, streamers, and consumers to participate in the Palestinian-led BDS (boycott, divest, sanction) movement against Microsoft, which it’s accused of being complicit in Israeli war crimes. The tech giant recently cut off cloud services to an Israel Defense Forces intelligence unit that </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/06/microsoft-israeli-military-palestinian-phone-calls-cloud"><span>used them for mass surveillance of Palestinians</span></a><span>, but continues supplying them to the rest of the military.</span></p> <p><span>After years of acquisitions, Microsoft has become a gaming industry monolith, and avoiding it entirely may prove difficult for many, especially considering how dire the industry’s job crisis has been over the last few years. But </span><a href="https://nogamesforgenocide.com/"><span>No Games For Genocide</span></a><span> believes that the more people who take part in their movement’s proposed collective actions, the better chance the tech giant will take notice.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“The games industry in particular is at the intersection of entertainment and tech, and there are a lot of material links—when we’re looking at the tech aspect of hardware and software—there are a lot of connections between the games industry and the genocide that Israel is committing against the Palestinian people,” Sara Khan, a content creator, </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/gameassist"><span>cofounder of Game Assist</span></a><span>, and one of No Games For Genocide’s organizers, told me over a video call. “A few of us really wanted to organize around that, and organize people within the industry to say ‘we don’t want these ties’ and find a way to move past them.”&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Khan and IWGB Game Workers Union founder, Austin Kelmore, worked with other industry members to organize No Games For Genocide and determine where to focus its attention. The IWGB recently unionized Disco Elysium maker ZA/UM and has been fighting Rockstar Games over the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-union-rockstar-court-legal-developers-2000643478"><span>firing of 34 </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto 6</span></i><span> developers</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“Sort of serendipitously, the </span><a href="https://bdsmovement.net/microsoft"><span>Palestinian-led BDS movement</span></a><span> announced earlier this year that Xbox was going to be one of their new consumer targets,” Khan explained.” It made sense for it to be a priority campaign for us.”</span></p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:dkxt4ihy3a4lnunqu3g5xhyn/app.bsky.feed.post/3m6zcsllmoc2k" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreielby3tqjwmmgrdbdifrubaewzhyln7onkchbyj6t7wx4skskvbtm"> <p lang="en">SIGN OUR BOYCOTT XBOX PLEDGE: We are asking gamers, game workers, streamers &amp; journalists to join us in boycotting &amp; divesting from Xbox, to force Microsoft to end its complicity in the genocide of Palestinians.</p> <p>We’ve provided concrete actions everyone can take. Sign here: nogamesforgenocide.com</p> <p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:dkxt4ihy3a4lnunqu3g5xhyn?ref_src=embed">No Games For Genocide (@nogamesforgenocide.com)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:dkxt4ihy3a4lnunqu3g5xhyn/post/3m6zcsllmoc2k?ref_src=embed">2025-12-02T16:00:16.473Z</a></p></blockquote></div>  <p><span>No Games For Genocide has been working with the BDS National Committee to organize its campaign, which doesn’t just include signing the pledge, but offers a variety of other ways people can participate. </span></p>

 <p><span>It argues that consumers should avoid purchasing Microsoft or Xbox products, streamers shouldn’t play Xbox-published games on stream (or accept sponsorships from any Xbox game studio), journalists should “halt all coverage of Xbox-published games,” and developers should “demand [their] publisher not publish [their] game on the Xbox and Microsoft Stores,” among other things.</span></p>

 <p><span>Khan and their fellow organizers know these are some pretty tall orders. “People understandably are facing hurdles and have to consider the potential risks to their job security, their livelihood, which is completely understandable,” they said. “This is definitely more long-term work. How do we build that collective power? How do we make sure we’re protecting people’s jobs and accounting for that risk? […] As individuals, these things are scary; the risks that they carry are very real, so it’s important for us to build that collective power.”&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Perhaps with that risk in mind, many of the pledge’s signatories (which include the investigative YouTube channel People Make Games and worker-owned game studio Soft, Not Weak) are at the consumer level. “That’s immediately more accessible to folks,” Khan explained. “Hopefully, over time, we’d love to be able to get more studios or media outlets in a position to commit to the pledge.”</span></p> <p><span>The term “collective power” comes up a lot; the notion that organizing behind a common goal can create cover and/or protection for individuals who want to publicly take a political position that may result in retaliation. Khan likened it to union organizing and how workers feel empowered to stand up for fair wages and labor protections together as a unit: “How can we build towards you being in a position—not just you as an individual in your workplace, but hopefully multiple individuals, perhaps the entire workplace—to get you into a position where this would be doable? […] There is only so much we can do as individuals. There’s so much more we can do as a collective.”</span></p> <p><span>But didn’t Israel and Palestine just agree on a ceasefire? And what about the <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2025/09/25/update-on-ongoing-microsoft-review/">September 2025 “update” from Microsoft</a> that confirmed the company “ceased and disabled a set of services to a unit within the Israel Ministry of Defense?” When asked, Khan pointed back to the</span><a href="https://bdsmovement.net/news/microsoft-blocks-israel%E2%80%99s-use-its-technology-mass-surveillance-palestinians"><span> official BDS statement</span></a><span> after </span><span>Microsoft announced it was terminating Israel’s access to AI and Azure cloud tech</span><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>“</span><span>Microsoft remains a key technological pillar in Israel’s apartheid regime and its genocide in Gaza,” the BDS news post read. “It continues to equip the Israeli military, government, and prisons with the technology used to commit war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide.”</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Khan also emphasized that Microsoft and other video game companies are complicit in the genocide and imperialism taking place in the global south, and that No Games For Genocide’s goal is to help the industry rethink its role in these systems. (In 2023, a</span><a href="https://google.com/search?q=future+class+kotkau&amp;rlz=1C1RXQR_enUS1119US1119&amp;oq=future+class+kotkau&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIJCAEQIRgKGKABMgkIAhAhGAoYoAEyCQgDECEYChigATIJCAQQIRgKGKABMgkIBRAhGAoYoAEyBggGECEYCtIBCDQ1OTVqMGo0qAIAsAIB&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8"><span> petition created by the Game Awards Future Class calling on The Game Awards host Geoff Keighley to acknowledge the humanitarian crisis in Gaza</span></a><span> was reportedly ignored.)&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“The violence that Palestinian people have been experiencing is, plain and simple, settler colonial violence,” Khan said. “It’s an occupation, not just apartheid and not just genocide…so a ceasefire is not enough. We have to question the very existence of a settler colonial state, and we have to ask: What does decolonization look like for the Palestinian people?”</span></p> <p><span>No Games For Genocide’s long-term goals are aligned with BDS: “We keep mounting up the pressure until we see Microsoft divesting.”&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Kotaku has reached out to Xbox for comment.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><strong>Update 12/3/2025 at 2:40 pm E.T.:&nbsp;</strong>A Microsoft spokesperson told&nbsp;<em>Kotaku,</em> “the company treats claims about our technology seriously. As we indicated in our blog, we have undertaken an ongoing review of these allegations” and linked to the aforementioned September 2025 blog post. The company also pointed to an internal email from President Brad Smith about a new “Microsoft Integrity Port” for employees to report their ethical concerns to.</p>

		<p>KING Art and Deep Silver have announced that a second closed alpha playtest for Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War IV will be taking place next week, with the confirmed dates being December 12th to December 15th. Those who took part in the November closed playtest will automatically be enrolled and emails will be sent on how to join. Those who did not take part in the Novmber closed playtest for Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War IV need to subscribe to the <a href="https://www.deepsilver.com/gb/games/dawn-of-war-iv#newsletter">Dawn of War IV newsletter</a> as information on how to take part will be sent through that.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War IV Official Announce Trailer | Gamescom Opening Night 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lAPm8fIy5mg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a statement the developers said, <em>“While this next round of testing will remain relatively small in size, we’re looking to bring on some new testers alongside our existing group of Closed Alpha Testers to provide feedback on the game as we work to shape the future of Dawn of War IV together. <wbr>As a reminder, these tests utilize an early Alpha Build of the game, with selected testers being required to sign an NDA, as well as agree not to share, discuss, screenshot, or record any part of the test. Additionally, if you don’t already have one, you’ll need to create a free Discord account if selected.”</em></p>
<p>Only a select few new closed alpha playtesters will be selected for this round of Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War IV playtest, as it will remain small in scale. Future playtests will expand the content available and allow more players to join. When it releases, the game will have over 70 campaign missions which can be played solo or in co-op, and the four factions will include the Space Marines, Orks, Necrons, and the Adeptus Mechanicus. A release date is yet to be confirmed.</p>

		<p>Tribute Games has released the first big patch for Marvel Cosmic Invasion, with the main focus by the team being removing bugs from the game. Some of the fixes in this patch for Marvel Cosmic Invasion include addressing an issue causing the game to crash when joining multiplayer sessions, an issue where Super Heroes stats would not upgrade, and also making sure Master Mold is no longer invulnerable. You can read the full list of fixes below.</p>
<p><iframe title="MARVEL Cosmic Invasion | Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/itVLfmX3Ts8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>



<p><b>Fixes!</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Heteropteron Blocker&nbsp;</b>– We’ve fixed an issue where having camera shake effects OFF would stop the cinematic from triggering, keeping Super Heroes trapped in Stage 13<wbr></li>
<li><b>Multiplayer Crashing</b>&nbsp;– We’ve fixed an issue where joining a multi-player game session and resetting story progress would trigger a crash<wbr></li>
<li><b>Enemy Cheating!&nbsp;</b>– We’ve fixed an issue where Master Mold would become invulnerable and non-targetable, which if anything was just rude<wbr></li>
<li><b>Venom Issues</b>&nbsp;– We’ve fixed issues where Venom could become frozen after being parried during Symbiote Pounce or immediately lose armor during Venom Bite<wbr></li>
<li><b>Upgrade Blocking&nbsp;</b>– We’ve fixed an issue that would mean Super Heroes’ stats did not upgrade after levelling up unless players returned to the main menu.<wbr></li>
<li><b>Enemy Superpowers</b>&nbsp;– We’ve fixed an issue where enemies would deal abnormally high damage on their first hit during a grab<wbr></li>
<li><b>Annihilus Invulnerability&nbsp;</b>– We’ve fixed an issue (and related issues) where Annihilus wouldn’t re-enter the staggered/vulnerable state and players couldn’t deal damage<wbr></li>
<li><b>Where’s Hela?!&nbsp;</b>– Fixed an issue where Hela could de-synchronise while teleporting<wbr></li>
<li><b>Annihilus Forever!&nbsp;</b>– We fixed an issue where Annihilus wouldn’t stop attacking after his shield breaks<wbr></li>
<li><b>Multiplayer Connections</b>&nbsp;– Fixed an issue which could cause problems when the host disconnects while Super Heroes are joining a lobby (this should now simply return you to the multiplayer menu)<wbr></li>
<li><b>Reigning in She-Hulk</b>&nbsp;– Option now added to have controller shake only for players controlling the character (meaning that She-Hulk’s controller vibration only happens for the player controlling her)<wbr></li>
<li><b>Cosmic Hold On What?!</b>&nbsp;– We’ve fixed an issue where Super Heroes would sometimes be swapped when respawning<wbr></li>
<li><b>At Least Credit Me&nbsp;</b>– The character who threw the enemy will now be considered the instigator when determining who gets credit for knocking down an assembly line bomb<wbr></li>
<li><b>Cosmic Stability</b>&nbsp;– We’ve deployed some additional protection for lobby stability when players reach Game Over in Arcade Mode<wbr></li>
<li><b>Interrogating the Vampire</b>&nbsp;– We’ve fixed an issue which prevented Super Heroes from using the Vampire modifier in Arcade Mode<wbr></li>
<li><b>Choose your character!</b>&nbsp;– We’ve fixed the issue with the characters’ order in character select for Steam Deck and Linux. That should fix the online desync/crashs between Steam Deck and other versions<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Smaller Fixes</b><wbr></p>

<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where intro music was used instead of main stage music where players joined later in Stage 2 (Genosha)<wbr></li>

<p>In our Marvel Cosmic Invasion review, Ade said,<em> “Having found Tribute Games’ previous release, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge, to be one of the best scrolling beat ‘em ups I’d ever played, I had high expectations for Marvel Cosmic Invasion. How could Shredder’s Revenge with Marvel characters go wrong? Sadly, Marvel Cosmic Invasion is entirely OK but fails to be anything more than that.”</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Elden Ring Nightreig</em>n’s first paid DLC, <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-dlc-forsaken-hollows-artorias-dark-souls-2000643101"><em>The Forsaken Hollow</em></a>, is finally here. If it does it’s job, the new mini-expansion will bring fans back and give them new reasons to obsess over the surprisingly excellent multiplayer roguelike.</p> <p>I’ve cleared my schedule and shamed my friends into joining me for whatever fresh surprises from FromSoftware await us. Here’s everything you need to know about the new content, including what’s in it, when it goes live, and the accompanying patch notes.</p>

 <h2 id="what-time-does-elden-ring-nightreign-the-forsaken-hollows-launch-in-your-time-zone">What time does <em>Elden Ring Nightreign: The Forsaken Hollows</em> go live?</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The official release schedule of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ELDENRING?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ELDENRING</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NIGHTREIGN?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NIGHTREIGN</a> The Forsaken Hollows is now available.</p> <p>Learn how to access the content of The Forsaken Hollows here: <a href="https://t.co/YKcgUiynX1">https://t.co/YKcgUiynX1</a> <a href="https://t.co/RJafPEq0dV">pic.twitter.com/RJafPEq0dV</a></p> <p>— ELDEN RING (@ELDENRING) <a href="https://twitter.com/ELDENRING/status/1995858043746275502?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>This is the part that sucks. The global release times are staggered and consoles get the short end of the stick. <em>The Forsaken Hollow</em> launches December 3 at 6:00 p.m. ET on PC and December 4 at 12:00 a.m. ET. If you’re on Xbox Series X/S, you can pull the time zone trick to get in early, but it seems like everyone on PlayStation 5 and PS4 are out of luck.</p>

 <p>I’m still holding out some small ray of hope that the DLC will magically unlock around 9:00 p.m. ET like most of <em>Nightreign</em>‘s free updates and weekly content rotations. That doesn’t seem to be the care this time around, however.</p>

 <h2>How do you access <em>The Forsaken Hollows</em>?</h2> <p>Just because you bought the $15 DLC doesn’t mean the content will automatically be active in your version of <em>Nightreign</em>. To actually access the two additional Nightfarer characters you’ll need to have first defeated Tricephalos, the game’s three-headed wolf Nightlord. After that, head to the Roundtable Hold, talk to the Iron Menial, and get the message from the Small Jar Merchant to unlock the new Scholar and Undertaker classes.</p>

 <p>What about the new Shifting Earth event? To access that and the new Balancers boss fight, you’ll need to have completed the above steps and defeated a second Nightlord. With those conditions met you’ll head to a chapel that appears behind the Small Jar Merchant where you can activate the&nbsp;cataclysmic Shifting Earth event ‘The Great Hollows.’</p>

 <h2>What’s <em>The Forsaken Hollows</em> DLC adding to <em>Nightreign</em>?</h2> <p>There’s the Scholar, a new support class whose Character Skill is called Analyze and lets him debuff enemies by keeping them within a scoped view. His passive skill is Bagcraft which lets him hold more items. His Ultimate Art is called Communion and it links enemies so damaging one damages them all, while also doing the same for allies letting them share heals.</p>

 <p>Then there’s Undertaker, a more aggressive melee class whose Character Skill is called Trance and gives her free stamina and bonus speed. Her Ultimate Art is Loathsome Hex which unleashes a flurry of attacks at whatever’s targeted. Her passive, Confluence, briefly gives her another free Ultimate Art any time an ally uses theirs.</p> <p><em>The&nbsp;Forsaken Hollows</em> DLC also adds the aforementioned Great Hollows Shifting Earth event, which isn’t just a repurposed section of the existing map but an entirely new area players will have to fly to with its own points of interest, ruins, and underground mazes. In addition to the new Balancers Nightlord, the DLC is bringing poison swamps to Limveld, fresh field bosses, and also entirely new weapons.</p> <p>Most importantly, it should feel hard. “Whenever people who have played the main game extensively go into the DLC content, they’ll be able to have a bit of that feeling like they had when they first played <em>Nightreign</em>, where there’s still a bit that they’re trying to figure out,” <a href="https://kotaku.com/nightreign-forsaken-hollows-dlc-map-swamp-field-bosses-2000649718">director Junya Ishizaki promised</a>. “[<em>The Forsaken Hollows</em> is] definitely a little bit harder, but it’s not ridiculous or anything like that, but that’s still within what we would consider to be a fair challenge.”</p> <h2>A new patch with no Nightfarer balance changes</h2> <p>Finally, the DLC arrives alongside the latest free update which is already live. It includes some small quality-of-life tweaks and a bunch of bug fixes, including for Raider’s Retaliate skill where it wouldn’t work properly and an ongoing issue where some Sites of Grace or Churches wouldn’t activate. Notably, however, there are no actual buffs or nerfs to the existing cast of characters. Maybe FromSoftware wants to see how Scholar and Undertaker compare before decided to rescale them.</p> <p>Here are the full patch notes for <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-notes-version-103"><em>Nightreign</em> version 1.03</a>:</p> <blockquote> <h2>New features</h2> <ul> <li>Added support for The Forsaken Hollows. <ul> <li>If you own the DLC The Forsaken Hollows, it will be displayed in the lower right corner of the title screen.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Added a display of the currently equipped relics in the Character Selection menu. <ul> <li>You can check the effects of equipped relics by toggling the display.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Added a feature to set names when registering Relics presets in the Relic Rites menu.</li> <li>Set names can be changed in the All Presets section.</li> <li>The order of presets for each character can now be changed in the All Presets section of the Relic Rites menu. <ul> <li>In the Relic Rites menu, you can change the order of presets (but not the order of the character themselves) in the All Relics section.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Added Deep Large Scenic Flatstone to the Collector Signboard shop.</li> <li>The map’s layer display can now be toggled in the Results menu.</li> <li>The relics equipped by each player can now be displayed in the Results menu. <ul> <li>Relics can only be displayed for sessions played in version 1.02 or later.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Players with a Personal Objective that requires defeating a specific target while Reliving a Remembrance can now embark on Expeditions with players whose Personal Objective does not require defeating a specific target. <ul> <li>Personal Objectives that do not require destroying the target will only appear for one player per Expedition.</li> </ul> </li> <li>The flask count will now be highlighted in the following situations:</li> <li>When the flask count is at the maximum capacity,</li> <li>When an enemy-induced effect that influences the flask is triggered.</li> <li>The vertical position of the compass’ rune icon will now be displayed if the runes dropped upon death are significantly above or below the player character.</li> <li>You can now highlight specific events that occur on a map layer that is on a different level from the character’s location in the map menu.</li> <li>Adjusted the Dormant Power selection screen so that the HP gauge and other UI elements remain visible while the screen is displayed.</li> <li>Adjusted the weapon lineup in Limveld’s shops.</li> <li>Added Fire Pots to the shop inventory inside the Spirit Shetler.</li> <li>The target-lock on enemies that are behind when the tombstone summoned by Raider’s Ultimate Art appears no longer gets released.</li> </ul> <h2>Balance Adjustments</h2> <p>In general, the trigger conditions of Relic effects that trigger with low HP, equipment passive effects, and special effects have been broadened.</p> <h3>Changes to Passive Effects and Special Effects</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Added new Passive Effects:</strong> <ul> <li>Improved Melee Attack Power</li> <li>Improved Dash Attacks</li> <li>Improved Rolling Attacks</li> <li>Increased the effect of the Passive Effect Improved Attack Power when Two-Handing.</li> <li>Increased the effect of the Passive Effect Attack Up when Wielding Two Armaments.</li> <li>Increased the effect of the Passive Effect Improved Chain Attack Finishers.</li> <li>Increased the effect of the Passive Effect Improved Charge Attacks.</li> <li>Increased the effect of the Passive Effect Improved Jump Attacks.</li> <li>Increased the effect of the Passive Effect Improved Guard Counters.</li> <li>Increased the effect of the Passive Effect Improved Skill Attack Power.</li> <li>Increased the effect of the Passive Effect Physical Attack Up.</li> <li>Broadened the trigger conditions and decreased the effectiveness of the Passive Effect Improved Damage Negation at Low HP.</li> <li>Broadened the trigger conditions and decreased the effectiveness of the Talisman Blue-Feathered Branchsword.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h3>Changes to Relic Effects</h3> <ul> <li>Increased the effect of Physical Attack Up.</li> <li>Increased the effect of Improved Initial Standard Attack.</li> <li>Increased the effect of Improved Critical Hits.</li> <li>Increased the effect of Improved Guard Counters.</li> <li>Increased the effect of Improved XXX Damage (excluding bow weapon types).</li> <li>Increased the effect of Improved Attack Power with 3+ XX Equipped (excluding bow weapon types).</li> <li>Broadened the trigger conditions and decreased the effectiveness of Improved Damage Negation at Low HP.</li> </ul> <h3>Other Changes</h3> <ul> <li>Reduced the FP consumption and increased the power of the Wrath of Gold Incantation.</li> </ul> <h2>Bug Fixes &amp;

              <p><span>Every now and then, I remember when </span><i><span>BioShock </span></i><span>lead Ken Levine </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stop-making-porn-with-my-characters-bioshock-creator-p-1442945516"><span>asked fans to stop sending him porn of Elizabeth from </span><i><span>BioShock Infinite</span></i></a> <span>because it felt like seeing NSFW pictures of a daughter. Smut artists have only gotten bolder in the years since, because they’re sending this art directly to creators on various social media platforms. While some are down for it, Briana White, who voices </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-does-aerith-die-live-sephiroth-1851287690"><span>Aerith</span></a><span> in the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-ps5-1851276129"><i><span>Final Fantasy VII Remake </span></i><span>trilogy</span></a><span>, is not.</span></p> <p><span>White responded to a video on </span><a href="https://x.com/ItsBrianaWhite/status/1995571225926795588"><span>X</span></a><span> of Rei Ami, one of the vocalists from </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i></a><span> (and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-fortnite-rei-ami-stream-zoey-rumi-2000632536"><span>unabashed </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>fan</span></a><span>), talking about how much smut she’d been exposed to of the titular demon-hunting trio. The voice of Zoey said it can be shocking but admitted to seeking some of it out herself.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>White responded, saying she doesn’t want people to “normalize” tagging actors in pornographic art of their characters, and that those who do this have “forgotten the meaning of the word ‘inappropriate’.”</span></p> <p><span>“It’s really a shame when [voice actors] want to interact with the people who love the characters on social media, but just a few creeps ruin it for everyone,” White wrote.</span></p> <p><span>“It is a matter of consent,” she continued elsewhere in the thread. “And it can be almost impossible to know what exactly is acceptable or not to an individual just from knowing their social media persona.”</span></p> <p><span>I love smut as much as the next guy, but sending porn to actors unprompted is just harassment. It’s gotta be especially tough when these folks want to be part of the community and get face time with fans, but are met with this weirdo behavior. Draw your porn, write it, and post it on Archive of Our Own, but respect boundaries, folks. Everybody wins.</span></p>

                <p>Prediction markets have been popular for years, and now Roblox's top boss has said he wants to see them integrated into the hugely popular game someday.</p><p>CEO Dave Baszucki told <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/21/podcasts/hardfork-roblox-child-safety.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The New York Times</a>, "We would. I think we would have to do that."</p><p>It's not so easy, though, as Baszucki said every country has different legislation surrounding "loot boxes and kid gambling," so there are regulatory hurdles that would need be sorted out.</p><p>Baszucki is bullish on the idea, even if it might take time to come to fruition. For what it's worth, the interviewer and host laughed at the idea of prediction markets in Roblox.</p><p>"I actually think it's a brilliant idea if it can be done in an educational way that's legal. And so, imagine no free Robux, no free prizes, just a game called the Dress to Impress Predictor, where it's not like trying to get kids' money or anything like that. I would be a big fan of it," he explained.</p><p>Prediction market platforms like Polymarket and Kalshi are peer-to-peer platforms where people can buy and sell contracts tied to any number of events, including professional sports and culture events like which movie will win Best Picture. They are different from traditional sports betting platforms because there is no "house" setting the odds.</p><p>Prediction markets in the US are regulated by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, an agency of the US government that recently granted approval to Polymarket to function in the US. Its main rival, Kalshi, was approved by the CFTC years ago.</p><p><a href="https://news.kalshi.com/p/kalshi-cnn-prediction-market-partnership" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kalshi recently reached a deal with CNN</a> to feature its markets in the CNN newsroom, a decision that drew much debate and discussion online. Prediction markets, like traditional sports gambling, have been a hot-button issue, with many saying it's bad and dangerous for many different reasons.</p><p>Currently, Kalshi has a number of open markets for gaming, including a <a href="https://kalshi.com/markets/kxgameawards/game-awards/kxgameawards-2025" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">market for Game of the Year at The Game Awards</a>. More than $2.3 million has been exchanged so far on this market, with Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 far and away the leading choice to win.</p><p>Baszucki made headlines recently when he was asked in this same interview about child predator concerns in Roblox.

<p>Soak in the Viewros</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Nintendo's biggest release of the month (the <em>year</em>?) arrives tomorrow, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> finally Morph Ball rolling onto Switch 1 and 2. But with the new hardware still comparatively fresh on store shelves and the holiday season right around the corner, you might be wondering which system is <em>the</em> place to play Samus's latest adventure on.</p>
<p>Here to shed some light on how each version holds up is the above comparison video from the sublime Mr. Alex Olney. As you'll see, the footage shows a direct comparison between the Switch 1 and 2 releases, and the latter's beefed-up specs are immediately obvious.</p>
<p>The side-by-side gameplay showcases Samus in a whole range of environments, demonstrating how the game holds up whatever you throw at it. While fps is no issue for the older console, there's something about the 4K resolution bump on Switch 2 that really sings when put in direct comparison.</p>
<p>Of course, this isn't to say that the Switch 1 version provides a 'bad' experience in any way. We had the following to say about the S1 release in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/metroid-prime-4-beyond">our 8/10 review</a>: "It plays very well at a very solid 60fps in both docked and handheld, but after getting used to seeing Viewros in stunning 4K (or an internal resolution approaching it), it’s surprising how much the art direction seems to have been built with this in mind".</p>
