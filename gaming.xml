            <p>Cult of the Lamb's next free update, Unholy Alliance, introduces a brand new character and couch co-op.</p>
<p>While you won't be able to join friends online, you will be able to buddy up via couch co-op as you "crusade through dungeons, slay heretics, build your cult, and seek new powers together" on 12th August, 2024. One of you can play as Lamb, and the other as Goat.</p>
<p>You can see it in action below:</p>

<p>"Unholy Alliance is the latest free update for smash hit Cult of the Lamb, introducing a new playable character: the Goat!" Massive Monster explains.</p>
<p>"Experience the entire Cult of the Lamb campaign in local co-op, with one player inhabiting the role of the Lamb and the other taking on the mantle of the Goat. Enjoy new two-player twists on existing mini-games like fishing and knucklebones, and choose from a selection of corrupted weapons, tarot cards, curses, and relics as you embark on co-op crusades."</p>
<p>As well as take on the heretics together, Lamb and Goat will be able to swap weapons, deal extra damage when fighting back-to-back, or even critical damage if their attacks "are in sync".</p>
<p>The Lamb and the Goat can swap weapons, deal extra damage when fighting back-to-back, or deal a critical hit if their attacks are in sync.</p>
<p>Unholy Alliance expansion also introduces new tarot cards, relics, buildings, fleeces, follower traits, follower quests, and secrets, as well as new powers and abilities for solo players who don't have a co-op buddy handy.</p>
<p>Unholy Alliance will launch for free on PC, PS5, PS4, Switch, and Xbox Series S/X on 12th August, 2024.</p>
<p>The update follows <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cult-of-the-lambs-sins-of-the-flesh-sex-update-arrives-next-week">Sins of the Flesh, a free update</a> that rolled out to all platforms in January. It included new progression systems, adding more complexity to the gameplay, plus "shiny poop, baneful brooms, and bigger, better buildings".</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cult-of-the-lamb-review-a-genre-mash-up-with-a-lot-of-ideas">Eurogamer's original Cult of the Lamb review</a>, our Donlan called it a "charmer with a hundred moving parts".</p>
<p>"Being a cult leader in this funny old game, then, is a little bit like being a game designer, I imagine. It's complex on certain levels, and to use the lovely vivid cliche, you're herding cats quite a lot," he wrote. "But really you're trying to arrange happiness for people. The only difference is that as a cult leader, if they don't become happy on cue, you can cook them and eat them."</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/senua%E2%80%99s-saga-hellblade-2-ending-explained.894555/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-ending-explained/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=senuas-saga-hellblade-2-ending-explained<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="65" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><strong><em>[This post contains spoilers for Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2]</em></strong></p> <p data-characters="308" data-current-count="308" data-injectable="false">Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2 continues Senua’s journey after the troubled and traumatic experiences of Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice. While the original Hellblade heavily implied that most of the events in the game were all happening in Senua’s mind, the sequel is even more complicated. </p> <p data-characters="227" data-current-count="535" data-injectable="true">Hellblade 2 is a visual work of artistic storytelling before it is a video game. With lines between what’s real and what’s happening in Senua’s mind so blurry, there is a lot to interpret and make sense of in Hellblade 2.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Ninja Theory</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="493" data-current-count="793" data-injectable="true">While the whole game is full of twists and turns, it doubles down on the intrigue during its ending. Senua comes face to face against Godi, Thorgestr’s father, at the end of the game. Up until this point, the game had led us to believe the Giants were real and that Senua had been leading the charge to take the Giants down for them. However, it is revealed during the fight with Godi that the Giants were never real. Godi constructed them to create fear among the people and gain power.</p>
 <p data-characters="376" data-current-count="376" data-injectable="false">Once Senua discovers that Godi lied to the people, she attacks him and very nearly takes the life of the Tyrant. At this point, Senua comes to a crossroads where she must choose between taking Godi’s life or sparing him. While her initial rage after all that he put her and those around her through pushed her to end his life, she slowly begins to question the decision.</p> <figure data-current-count="676" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Ninja Theory</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="444" data-current-count="444" data-injectable="true">Throughout the game, Senua has been troubled by her past, particularly her abusive father. Senua begins to rationalize the decision to kill Godi, fearing that she will become just like her father and go down a darker path. At the same time, Senua starts realizing that there is another choice, where she can spare Godi’s life, finally moving on from the trauma of her past and the influence her father still has over her thoughts and actions.</p>
 <p data-characters="517" data-current-count="517" data-injectable="true">During this internal battle, Senua also hears Thorgestr telling her that “we are not our fathers,” highlighting how he also chose to be better before his life ended. While it may seem like Senua choose the latter option and spares Godi’s life, Ninja Theory never shows the decision she makes. By leaving the story up for interpretation, the game leaves it to the player to decide what Senua did. In turn, it allows the player to decide how they perceive Senua’s struggles and what she would ultimately decide.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Ninja Theory</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="449" data-current-count="749" data-injectable="false">Several themes run through the final moments of the game, with love, friendship, trauma, acceptance, and hope all highlighted through Senua and her Furies’ internal dialogues. Whether Senua makes the Tyrant pay for his crimes with his life or spares him is ultimately up to whatever the player accepts as Senua’s choice. The ambiguity of a definitive ending is another way Ninja Theory wanted to convey the message that there is always a choice.</p>

<p data-characters="256" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">There are many ways to equip your characters with Echoes in <em>Wuthering Waves</em>, but there are only two viable ones you should consider using: ‘4,3,3,1,1’ or ‘4,4,1,1,1’. The question comes then: which of these Echo loadouts is better?</p> <h2 id="h-which-configuration-is-better-for-echoes-in-wuthering-waves-4-3-3-1-1-or-4-4-1-1-1" data-injectable="false">Which configuration is better for Echoes in <em>Wuthering Waves</em>: ‘4,3,3,1,1’ or ‘4,4,1,1,1’?</h2> <p data-characters="558" data-current-count="558" data-injectable="true">Regarding total stat gains, <strong>‘4,3,3,1,1’ </strong>is completely superior to <strong>‘4,4,1,1,1’</strong> thanks to the inclusion of more high-ranked Echoes. Echoes with higher loadout costs come with a main stat that provides more overall of the main stat. Despite this, both setups are actually viable for current content in <em>Wuthering Waves</em>, but there are times when you might consider using <strong>‘4,4,1,1,1’ </strong>over the superior one. There is nuance to this subject, and the best way to explain them is to break down each configuration for your reference.</p>
 <h3 id="h-echo-configuration-4-3-3-1-1-breakdown" data-injectable="false">Echo Configuration ‘4,3,3,1,1’ Breakdown</h3> <p data-characters="350" data-current-count="350" data-injectable="false">Since this setup yields higher total stats, <strong>your characters will always deal more damage with it</strong>. Specifically, the two ‘3’ Echoes should either be ATK% or Element DMG%, and both, when leveled to max rank, should give you 30% of whichever stat is on them. This is a big deal for damage and is the main reason why this config is superior. </p> <p data-characters="522" data-current-count="872" data-injectable="true">However, this config is not without its faults. Despite the superior stat spread, the two ‘3’ Echoes that are a part of this setup are incredibly difficult to obtain on a set bonus. You see, ‘3’ Echoes are the only ones that can come with an Element main stat, but there is an Element main stat for every Element in <em>Wuthering Waves</em>. Every time you slay and capture an Elite enemy, you have <strong>a low chance of obtaining the Element you need for your character</strong> thanks to all of the differing variables. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="628" data-current-count="928" data-injectable="true">Even if you do get the correct element, chances are, it’s on the wrong Echo set for said character. It is possible to get Spectro DMG on a ‘3’ Echo that has the Havoc set attached to it, which is very much useless. To make matters even worse, Elites are finite in the overworld, meaning you <strong>can </strong>farm and kill all of them on the entire map. If this happens, you must wait for the daily reset for them to respawn so you can continue farming them. All of these randomized variables make getting proper ‘3’ Echoes a rare occurrence, thus the difficulty in achieving this setup, despite its superiority.</p>
 <p data-characters="280" data-current-count="280" data-injectable="false">Beyond this rarity limitation, <strong>‘4,3,3,1,1’ </strong>has no other inherent negatives. It offers you a wider range of stat options to choose from and gives you more raw stats in general. For those looking the make their characters as powerful as possible, use this configuration.</p> <h3 id="h-echo-configuration-4-4-1-1-1-breakdown" data-injectable="false">Echo Configuration ‘4,4,1,1,1’ Breakdown</h3> <p data-characters="680" data-current-count="960" data-injectable="true">Due to the nature of ‘3’ Echoes, you may want to opt into using this configuration instead because of how easy is to get running at a viable level. You see, ‘1’ and ‘4’ Echoes are very easy to obtain with the correct stats you need. Although ‘1’ Echoes are finite, there are significantly more basic enemies on the map to farm, making it unlikely for you to run out before the daily reset. ‘4’ Echoes can be farmed infinitely because they come from the respawning bosses on the map. There is no limit to how many times you can farm these, so getting the correct main stat from them is a matter of your farming diligence.</p>
 <p data-characters="617" data-current-count="617" data-injectable="true">This ease of build comes at the cost of a weaker character overall. The lack of ‘3’ Echoes means you have <strong>no Element DMG bonuses </strong>and <strong>fewer ATK% bonuses</strong>, resulting in a sizable loss of damage. However, because two ‘4’ Echoes are used in this setup, it is significantly easier to obtain both <strong>CRIT RATE </strong>and <strong>CRIT DMG</strong>. This is due to your ability to farm for these main stats as much as you want. Characters running this setup probably won’t have issues obtaining acceptable levels of CRIT value stats, resulting in them becoming mid-to-late game viable much earlier than the superior setup. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="399" data-current-count="699" data-injectable="true">Another not-so-obvious caveat of this configuration is the <strong>resource drain</strong> using will have on you. In <em>Wuthering Waves</em>, you are constantly stretched thin for resources and must make continuous decisions of whether or not to invest in specific characters or weapons. Waveplates timegate the amount of resources you can obtain, making these decisions crucial to how effectively your account progresses. </p>
 <p data-characters="592" data-current-count="592" data-injectable="true">Before using this configuration, ask yourself: <strong>is it worth wasting resources to build a stat inferior Echo setup? </strong>In my opinion, as someone who likes to min-max my character builds, I find my resources valuable, and if I’m just going to transition from this setup in the future, then I’d rather wait to get the correct pieces before investing in a character. If you’re not a min-max number cruncher like me, though, <strong>this setup is perfectly viable to use</strong>. For those who simply want to get their characters up and running effectively, <strong>‘4,4,1,1,1’</strong> will accommodate.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/8/24174246/biggest-movie-trailers-venom-last-dance-alien-romulus-maxxxine-june-2024-first-week<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Two of my favorite trailers for this week share a common theme: parasitic aliens. The trope has given us some of the finest moments in cinema history; consider the whole <em>Alien</em> franchise, the horrifying dog transformation in <em>The Thing</em>, or <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DotJ2rXMuLno">that scene from <em>Spaceballs</em></a>. You could make a convincing argument that <em>Star Trek</em>’s Borg race are parasites of a kind, too.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s a versatile premise that lets a movie be as heady or grotesque or action-packed as its creators want. And two of sci-fi’s most beloved fictional freeloaders are showing up this week.</p><p><h3>Venom: The Last Dance</h3></p><p>Venom doesn’t like being called a parasite, but that’s still basically what it is. In the case of the Klyntar symbiote and Tom Hardy’s Eddie Brock, though, the two are more than a parasite and its host. They’re buddies in a charming bromance! This week’s trailer <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24170379/venom-the-last-dance-trailer">shows more of that</a>, with some hefty stakes and the implication that this is the end of the road for Brock and his greasy, brain-hungry friend. Color me excited for the October 25th theatrical debut of <em>Venom: The Last Dance.</em></p><p><h3>Alien: Romulus</h3></p><p>Face-hugging Xenomorph horror is making a comeback, thanks to director Fede Alvarez (<em>Evil Dead</em>) in the new <em>Alien: Romulus </em>trailer. It feels good to see the franchise <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24170776/alien-romulus-trailer-release-date">turn back to its roots</a>; I liked the more ruminative <em>Prometheus </em>and <em>Alien: Covenant</em>, but they weren’t everyone’s cup of tea. In this new trailer, scavengers on an abandoned space station turn into prey. It’s dark and claustrophobic; it has chest-bursters and facehuggers; and it looks absolutely terrifying. The movie hits theaters on August 16th.</p><p><h3>MaXXXine</h3></p><p>Ti West’s horror trilogy concludes with <em>MaXXXine. </em>It follows Mia Goth’s character as her star rises in 1980s Hollywood amid a murder mystery. True to the series, this one will have its own distinctive vibe, which West has likened to a “<a href="https://ew.com/maxxxine-mia-goth-ti-west-big-sprawling-los-angeles-movie-8642961">noir-ish</a>” movie with “<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/maxxxine-starring-mia-goth-is-a-very-rich-movie-with-a-terminator-like-aesthetic-says-director-ti-west-interview-exclusive/">a Terminator-like aesthetic</a>.” I’m in. The movie takes place after the events of <em>X </em>and its prequel, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23352979/pearl-review-tiff-2022"><em>Pearl</em></a>, and will head to theaters on July 5th.</p><p><h3>Honorable video game mention: Metal Slug Tactics</h3></p><p>Alright<em>, Metal Slug Tactics</em> isn’t a movie. But it’s a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/3/24170725/why-yes-id-love-to-blow-up-some-cartoony-nazis-on-a-turn-based-grid">new take</a> on one of my all-time favorite video game series. <em>Tactics</em> is a turn-based strategy take on what’s normally a sidescrolling shooter — think <em>Contra, </em>but so much sillier —<em> </em>known for its difficulty and meticulous sprite-based animation. And it comes from the folks behind <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/18/23172898/tmnt-shredders-revenge-classic-arcade-game-interview"><em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge</em></a><em> </em>and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/30/21242538/streets-of-rage-4-review-ps4-xbox-steam-switch"><em>Streets of Rage 4</em></a>! It’s out this fall for PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 / 5, and Xbox One / Series S / X. Put this straight into my veins.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Batman: Arkham Shadow - 5 Details We Found In the New Trailer]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/batman-arkham-shadow-5-details-we-found-in-the-new-trailer</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/batman-arkham-shadow-5-details-we-found-in-the-new-trailer.894489/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/batman-arkham-shadow-5-details-we-found-in-the-new-trailer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>DC fans were treated to a new cinematic trailer for Batman: Arkham Shadow at Summer Game Fest, one that sheds new light on the tone and storyline fueling this latest Arkham-verse adventure. This time around, Batman battles for the very soul of Gotham as the enigmatic Rat King rallies his followers to tear the city to the ground. </p><p>You may have some questions after watching the new trailer. How does this game fit into the larger Arkham timeline? Who is the Rat King, anyway? And how do iconic Bat-villains like Harley Quinn and Scarecrow figure in this conflict? Let’s break down what the trailer reveals about the plot of Arkham Shadow.</p><p><em><strong>Warning:</strong></em><em> this article contains spoilers for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League!</em></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>Revealing the History of the Arkham Universe</h2><p>At this point, Rocksteady has closed out the Arkham saga on a pretty definitive note. 2015’s Arkham Knight ended the main trilogy with Batman fully conquering his fears, vanquishing the ghost of the Joker and abandoning his life as Bruce Wayne. 2024’s Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League delivered what it promised by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kevin-conroys-batman-is-completely-wasted-in-suicide-squad"><u>killing off that version of Batman</u></a>, to much fan consternation. </p><p>Between that and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/batman-kevin-controy-retrospective-humanity-compassion-arkham"><u>the tragic passing of voice actor Kevin Conroy</u></a>, you might be assuming the door has closed on the Arkham universe. Is Arkham Shadow actually part of that universe, or is it taking place in a separate version of the DCU like 2022’s Gotham Knights?</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/07/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-10h54m43s181-1717772398645.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Camoflaj studio head Ryan Payton has confirmed to IGN that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/batman-arkham-shadow-developer-cites-arkham-asylum-as-its-north-star-summer-game-fest-2024"><u>Arkham Shadow is indeed part of the Arkham-verse</u></a>, specifically citing 2009’s Arkham Asylum as the game’s “North Star.” Arkham Shadow is a prequel to that game, taking place in between the events of 2013’s Arkham Origins and Arkham Asylum. Fittingly, Origins voice actor Roger Craig Smith is reprising the Batman role here. This is a younger Batman than the one seen in the main Arkham trilogy, but more seasoned than the relative rookie hero we saw in Arkham Origins.</p><p>As for the Batsuit, the design in Arkham Shadow seems to strike a happy medium between the costume from Arkham Origins and the more rugged, armored suit introduced in Arkham Knight. This is definitely a Batman who looks ready to brawl. As is the case in the other games, we’re sure players will have the option of switching to any number of unlockable bonus costumes if they choose, though the fact that Arkham Shadow is played in first-person may dampen the fun of changing costumes a bit. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>Who Is the Rat King?</h2><p>The previous Arkham games included a wide range of Bat-villains, but they tended to revolve mainly around a core group of heavy-hitters like Joker, Scarecrow, Bane and Ra’s al Ghul. Arkham Shadow is operating a little more outside the box. This time, Rat King is the villain threatening to bring Gotham City to its knees. </p><p>Who is the Rat King, exactly? This character appears to be the Arkham-verse’s take on Ratcatcher (though it should be noted that Ratcatcher himself previously appeared in some of the Arkham tie-in comics). In the core DC Universe comics, Ratcatcher is a villain named Otis Flannegan who once worked as an actual rat-catcher for Gotham City. After being imprisoned for murder, Flannegan develops a costumed persona and harnesses his talent for luring and controlling rats to punish the men responsible for his arrest.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/07/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-10h54m06s423-1717772398645.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>While Ratcatcher has appeared in animated shows like Batman Beyond and Harley Quinn, the character is probably best known for playing a key role in 2021’s The Suicide Squad. In that film, Daniela Melchior plays Ratcatcher II, the daughter of the original (played in flashbacks by Taika Waititi). </p><p>As his revamped name suggests, Rat King has been given a major overhaul for the Arkham-verse. This version of the villain is unique in that he’s acquired a large cult following. Many Gothamites seem to identify as rats and respond to Rat King’s call to burn Gotham to its foundations. Based on all the graffiti seen in the trailer and the symbolism of rats fleeing a sinking ship, it seems many disillusioned Gothamites are taken in by Rat King’s vision of a better world.</p><p>We also know that the plot of Arkham Shadow involves Rat King abducting high-ranking city officials like Commissioner Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent (confirming the game takes place before Dent’s downfall as Two-Face). Some of the graffiti in the trailer references pigs, which we assume is Rat King’s slang for the police and others in power propping up the old system.     </p><h2>The Smashing Pumpkins Soundtrack</h2><p>Like any good teaser trailer, the choice of music offers its own clues as to the plot and tone of Arkham Shadow. The trailer features an instrumental version of the Smashing Pumpkins song “Bullet With Butterfly Wings.”</p><p>That’s certainly a significant needle drop. “Bullet With Butterfly Wings” is a song all about frustration and hopelessness with the world at large. The lyrics of the song echo the emotions felt by these ordinary citizens of Gotham City as they take to the streets and even stand up to the mighty Batman himself. </p><p>And, of course, the song is iconic for the repeated refrain “Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage.” What better choice of song to represent the message this up-and-coming villain is selling to the downtrodden citizens of Gotham?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>Harley Quinn and Scarecrow’s Origins</h2><p>Rat King may be the main villain of Arkham Shadow, but he won’t be the only foe Batman clashes with here. Like the other Arkham games, the Dark Knight will face a gauntlet of opponents as he singlehanded battles to hold his city together. We see two of those villains in the trailer - Harley Quinn and Scarecrow.</p><p>Notably, however, neither villain is shown in their full supervillain costume. We know that Arkham Shadow is meant to chronicle the origin stories of both Harley and Scarecrow. That’s probably why we see Harley in her civilian guise as Dr. Harleen Quinzel. She’s shown looking on eagerly as a building burns, her inner madness bubbling to the surface. Later, we see Dr. Jonathan Crane leaving the city courthouse as it begins to burn, donning his signature Scarecrow mask.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/07/mixcollage-07-jun-2024-11-01-am-7644-1717772484126.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Interestingly, the trailer suggests that both characters are inspired by Rat King in their evolution from civilians into costumed supervillains. Crane seems to recognize the power that comes from manipulating emotions, which feeds into his own obsession with spreading fear. As for Harley, the game may be distancing her from the Joker somewhat, suggesting that more than just her infatuation with the Clown Prince of Crime inspired her to become a deadly jester. It’s possible we’ll see Joker in the game in some form (likely voiced by Arkham Origins’ Troy Baker), but Harley’s origin story is clearly bigger than him.</p><h2>The Gray Ghost and Monarch Theatre Cameos</h2><p>The trailer features a pair of Easter eggs that Batman fans will find intriguing. The scene with Harley Quinn shows her in front of the Monarch Theatre, a location with deep significance for the franchise. Traditionally, the Monarch Theatre is where the Waynes travel to watch The Mark of Zorro on the night they’re murdered. It’s essentially the place where Batman was born.</p><p>Alongside the Monarch Theatre itself, we also see a movie poster advertising a film called The Ghost in Gray. The Ghost in Gray features a costumed hero called The Gray Ghost, as played by actor Simon Trent. As established in Batman: The Animated Series, Bruce used to idolize Trent and watch the Gray Ghost serials with his father. The Gray Ghost character wound up serving as a major source of inspiration as Bruce developed his Batman persona. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/07/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-10h53m48s498-1717772398644.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Is it just a coincidence that Arkham Shadow features two references to the origin of Batman in this trailer? Or are these Easter eggs a sign that the game will delve deeper into the circumstances that transformed Bruce Wayne into a costumed crimefighter? It would only be fitting that a game that reveals the origins of villains like Harley Quinn and Scarecrow also looks back to Bruce’s own formative years. We’ve seen glimpses of his origin in previous Arkham games, but there’s always room for a more in-deoth look back at the birth of Batman. Perhaps the prospect of battling ordinary civilians for the fate of Gotham has the Dark Knight in an introspective mood. </p><p>That’s everything we were able to glean from the trailer for Batman: Arkham Shadow. What do you think will happen in the game? Is Rat King truly the main villain, or is another Batman rogue lying in wait?

<p data-characters="430" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Some of the most menacing enemies in <em>Fallout</em> games are small critters scaled up to human-sized proportions. A disturbing example of this are the <strong>Gulpers</strong> of <em>Fallout 76</em> who were once cute salamanders until the Great War mutated them into six-foot-tall predators of the Wasteland. Flies and other insects aren’t enough to sate their appetite anymore so Gulpers have adapted to ambushing players around the Mire and Cranberry Bog.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="200" data-current-count="200" data-injectable="false">If you’re looking to defeat Gulpers for Seasonal Challenges or harvest their meat to make delicious pepperoni rolls, you’ll want to know all of the locations Gulpers are found within <em>Fallout 76.</em>&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-all-gulper-locations-in-fallout-76" data-injectable="false">All Gulper locations in <em>Fallout 76</em>&nbsp;</h2> <figure data-wp-context="{ &quot;core&quot;: 				{ &quot;image&quot;: 					{   &quot;imageLoaded&quot;: false, 						&quot;initialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;hideAnimationEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;preloadInitialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxAnimation&quot;: &quot;zoom&quot;, 						&quot;imageUploadedSrc&quot;: &quot;https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/fallout-76-gulper-map-locations.webp&quot;, 						&quot;imageCurrentSrc&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;targetWidth&quot;: &quot;1200&quot;, 						&quot;targetHeight&quot;: &quot;675&quot;, 						&quot;scaleAttr&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;dialogLabel&quot;: &quot;Enlarged image&quot; 					} 				} 			}" data-wp-interactive="" data-current-count="500" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Bethesda</figcaption> <div data-wp-body="" data-wp-bind--role="selectors.core.image.roleAttribute" data-wp-bind--aria-label="selectors.core.image.dialogLabel" data-wp-class--initialized="context.core.image.initialized" data-wp-class--active="context.core.image.lightboxEnabled" data-wp-class--hideanimationenabled="context.core.image.hideAnimationEnabled" data-wp-bind--aria-modal="selectors.core.image.ariaModal" data-wp-effect="effects.core.image.initLightbox" data-wp-on--keydown="actions.core.image.handleKeydown" data-wp-on--touchstart="actions.core.image.handleTouchStart" data-wp-on--touchmove="actions.core.image.handleTouchMove" data-wp-on--touchend="actions.core.image.handleTouchEnd" data-wp-on--click="actions.core.image.hideLightbox" tabindex="-1"> <p> <figure><figcaption>Image via Bethesda</figcaption></figure> </p> <p> <figure><figcaption>Image via Bethesda</figcaption></figure> </p>  </div></figure>

<p>If you boot up Astro's Playroom today, you'll see an in-game announcement entitled "New Game Update".</p>

			<p>Yesterday, at Summer Game Fest 2024, Remedy's Sam Lake <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-night-springs-dlc-reveal-release-date-summer-game-fest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that the first Alan Wake 2 DLC, Night Springs, would launch later today.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/remedys-no-holds-barred-approach-to-alan-wake-2-expansions-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking to GamesIndustry</a> in a new interview, Remedy's Communications Director Thomas Puha has highlighted the great fan response (despite not-so-exciting sales):</p>
<p><em>The response was incredible. Alan Wake 2 was a very hard game to ship. But we always had the plan of once we ship it, there's still things we want to talk about in addition to this expansion, photo mode, and the second expansion that we're working on.</em></p>
<p><em>We've always taken this very long view at Remedy. It's not like the first couple of months are focused on sales; it's the next three years at least – that's how we look at it. There's various bits and pieces we're doing that will hopefully keep the game out there. But it really resonated with people in an incredible way.</em></p>
<p>Speaking of the first Alan Wake 2 DLC, Game Director Kyle Rowley said it would be tonally different and feature a lot of fan service. Also, the studio really liked the idea of allowing players to take control of multiple characters (in Night Springs, you play as three characters, one for each episode).</p>
<p><em>American Nightmare was tonally quite different from the original game. In that same vein, we are creating a slightly different experience. From a gameplay perspective, we've shifted it for each episode to match the tone. We wanted to make the gameplay feel familiar, but also under a slightly different stylisation and context.</em></p>
<p><em>There's quite a lot of fan service, I would say. We definitely wanted to make sure that we were using characters that players who have played our games would resonate with and would want to play as again in some instances.</em></p>
<p><em>We always wanted the idea of playing as multiple characters. In the original concept of the base Alan Wake 2 game, we wanted to have more playable characters than we ended up with. Night Springs as a concept came about as we were figuring that out. We parked it, then after we were done with the game, we wrote some more awesome, crazy stuff.</em></p>
<p>As a reminder, Remedy also announced that a retail edition of Alan Wake 2 will be released at some point in the Fall season.</p>

<p id="z6apCR"><strong>Director: </strong>Scott Frank<br><strong>Cast:</strong> Liam Neeson, Dan Stevens, Boyd Holbrook</p>
<p id="UsGVTH">This dark neo-noir is a bright spot in Liam Neeson’s late-career swerve to action and action-centric thrillers. He plays a retired NYPD detective who now works as a private investigator. When he’s hired to investigate a brutal murder case, he’s pulled into a dark web of crime and conspiracy.</p>
<p id="v8Txj7">Based on Lawrence Block’s novel, it’s the rare Neeson action (or action-adjacent) vehicle that actually allows the Oscar-nominated actor to flex his acting chops. Neeson’s Matt Scudder is troubled, but determined... and you really don’t want to mess with him. Add in an appealing supporting cast with Dan Stevens, Boyd Holbrook, and David Harbour, and you have a modernized throwback of a detective movie.</p>
<p id="nvQjtc">There are some reasons that <em>A Walk Among the Tombstones </em>is relevant this year: Director Scott Frank (<em>The Queen’s Gambit</em>) recently partnered with Clive Owen for another PI throwback in the AMC Plus show <em>Monsieur Spade</em>. Frank also co-wrote <em>Logan</em>, which I guess is relevant again with <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine </em>around the corner. And it’s been a summer of Dan Stevens, with <em>Abigail</em>, <em>Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire</em>, and <em>Cuckoo </em>all coming out this year.</p>
<p id="VKuwRO">A content warning: This movie is, in part, about sexual violence, and deals directly with that topic. —<em>Pete Volk</em></p>

<p id="Fu8Vo0"><strong>Director: </strong>Paul Feig<br><strong>Cast:</strong> Blake Lively, Anna Kendrick, Henry Golding</p>
<p id="HhqLas"><em>A Simple Favor</em> is every ounce the delicious thriller comedy you want and more. It helps that the film knows — and loves — what it is. Single mom and mommy vlogger Stephanie (Anna Kendrick) strikes up a surprise friendship with ultra cool and stylish Emily (Blake Lively), only to have Emily suddenly vanish entirely. That sounds like every pulpy lit mystery, but <em>A Simple Favor</em> has a laugh and an edge to it those stories don’t. As Stephanie finds herself more drawn to Emily’s husband, Sean (Henry Golding), in the wake of her disappearance, the movie winds its plot around its characters the way Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck get strapped to a pole. The result is a fun, splashy little thriller about a murder mystery mess, with great costumes (<em>great</em> costumes) and a gall far beyond its veneer. —<em>Zosha Millman</em></p>

<p id="0NVglT"><strong>Director: </strong>Xavier Gens<br><strong>Cast:</strong> Bérénice Bejo, Nassim Lyes, Léa Léviant</p>
<p id="8NkYhx">Without a doubt, this is the best thriller on this list that starts with a quote “based on Charles Darwin.” And for those who are craving the thrash and chomp of a good shark movie, <em>Under Paris </em>(from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24022711/mayhem-review-action-movie-farang-xavier-gens"><em>Mayhem!</em></a> director Xavier Gens) will certainly satisfy — though it takes some time to build. Three years after losing her team to a shark attack, Sophia (Bérénice Bejo) has retreated to Paris to recover. But trouble, much like a shark in the Seine, follows her home and threatens the prosperity of the city. </p>
<p id="Jxtuff">If you’re thinking, <em>Well just how much trouble could a shark in the Seine really cause?</em> — <em>Under Paris</em> is happy to clear that up for you. Delicately balanced as a movie that takes the threat just seriously enough to help you cheer when a shark majestically jumps out of the water with a Parisian in its jaws, <em>Under Paris</em> is a platonic ideal for watching sharks tear through the heart of the city of love. —<em>ZM</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/who-is-lego-horizon-adventures-for<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">PlayStation's family-friendly spin-off might struggle to land with both adult fans and kid newcomers.  </h2></div><section><p>After weeks of internet rumours, Sony’s unusual new game was finally made official at Summer Game Fest 2024: <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lego-horizon-adventures-is-official-and-out-this-holiday-sgf-2024">LEGO Horizon Adventures</a>. Built brick-by-brick by main Horizon developer Guerilla in collaboration with Studio Gobo, it looks to be exactly what you’d expect from a LEGO tie-in: bright, charming, goofy, and full of things to smash and studs to collect. That’s been a recipe for success multiple times over for LEGO, but this time around I’m not so sure. Who exactly is LEGO Horizon Adventures for? </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>This isn’t LEGO’s first foray into the Horizon universe. The Danish toy company’s fantastic <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horizon-lego-tallneck-set-build">Tallneck kit</a>, based on Horizon’s giraffe-like walking towers, is an almost 14-inch tall behemoth made of 1,222 pieces. If the brick count didn’t give it away, the recommended age for this model is 18+. In the physical world, LEGO Horizon has been aimed at adults because it’s adults who play the video game series. But one look at LEGO Horizon Adventures and it’s clear this isn’t anywhere close to the type of experience we’ve had with the two mainline Horizon games so far. For existing fans who are already chomping at the brick for a new game, this likely isn’t what they were hoping for. </p><p>While I didn’t expect LEGO Horizon Adventures to simply be a full-fat Horizon game with a LEGO aesthetic, I am surprised that the trailer shows very little of what I’d consider to be the series’ core DNA. Horizon is all about tactically tearing apart robot dinosaurs and animals. Thunderjaw wrecking your day? Blast off its missile launchers. Struggling with a Snapmaw? Snipe its freeze sac. Each machine is built of components that can be broken and shattered, an idea that would surely translate beautifully into snapping and scattering Lego pieces. And yet the trailer suggests that combat in LEGO Horizon Adventures will be similar to prior LEGO games of the Star Wars and Marvel varieties – give something a good, simple boop on the head and they’ll break apart. I’m not sure how satisfying this is going to be for long-term fans. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>LEGO Horizon Adventures Screens</h3></div></output><p>And so the answer is obvious, isn’t it? LEGO Horizon Adventures is for children. This is a PlayStation Studios game being released for <em>Nintendo Switch</em>, afterall. But I’m not sure it’s that easy. LEGO games have been so successful with children because they’ve historically adapted licences that kids already love. As a pre-teen during the prequel era of Star Wars I loved the tie-in LEGO kits, and so the subsequent LEGO Star Wars video games were a no-brainer. But Horizon isn’t already beloved by kids in its original or LEGO form. And while my six-year-old nephew is as dinosaur obsessed as any kid his age, I don’t think an armour-plated t-rex is going to be a guaranteed magnet. He’d go wild for a new LEGO Jurassic World game, though, not least because there’s already age-appropriate LEGO kits he can play with.</p><p>So who is LEGO Horizon Adventures for? I think it’s for gamer families. It’s for parents who spend dozens and dozens of hours playing Horizon on PS5 after they’ve put their kids to bed, and who now want to introduce that world to their sons and daughters. The ingredients are all there: as detailed by the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/07/lego-horizon-adventures-launches-holiday-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation Blog</a>, LEGO Horizon Adventures is a light-hearted retelling of Aloy’s original story, playable completely in co-op. It’s a way for an older gamer to share something they love with a kid who’s not quite ready for something as intense and complex as the full-scale Horizon games. </p><p>That’s what I imagine the boardroom pitch was, anyway. And while I hope that LEGO Horizon Adventures finds its place, I think that place is going to be a much narrower niche than would be ideal for Sony. For the parent or older sibling in the co-op pairing, I wonder if LEGO Horizon Adventures will be able to translate all the things they love about the original games. Will the combat – the beating heart of Horizon – be good enough? Will turning the complex Aloy, with all her doubts and troubles and inner-fight, into a cartoon character be satisfying? And for the child with the other controller, will this bright new world of machines, hot dogs, and (presumably) a message of environmental protection prove alluring enough to pull them away from more established characters and the likes of Roblox? I fear that the sweet spot for both players will be slim. </p><p>Historically, the LEGO pipeline has taken movies families love, turned them into physical LEGO kits they can build together, and then reimagined those kits as worlds that can be explored through video games. LEGO Horizon Adventures disrupts that pipeline by being a family game inspired by a LEGO kit for adults that was adapted from a video game for more advanced players. And so while I really do hope it’s a co-op delight, I can’t help but wonder if LEGO Horizon Adventures is built on shaky foundations. </p><p><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Senior Features Editor. </em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

While it took roughly 20 hours for a team to finally beat it, Bungie has confirmed that The Witness has been halted and Salvation’s Edge conquered.</p> <p data-characters="472" data-current-count="472" data-injectable="true">The race for world first in <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s Salvation’s Edge raid has been going on since 1 PM ET on June 7, 2024.

That doesn’t mean they’re complete newcomers, but it shows how this was anyone’s race.

 <p data-characters="410" data-current-count="410" data-injectable="true">Only Bungie can verify a world’s first completion in a raid, and after initial tentative results came in, the developer has <a href="https://x.com/DestinyTheGame/status/1799417499655499838" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">now confirmed</a> that Tyraxe and their fireteam were the first players to reach the end of Salvation’s Edge and claim the loot chest at the end of the raid. That chest is important because it’s the trigger that notifies Bungie of which team has completed the raid first. </p>

		<p>Nano Park Studios has announced Petal Runner, a game in which players take on the role of couriers known as Petal Runners. The game’s aesthetic and atmosphere draw inspiration from the classic Game Boy Color RPGs, such as the iconic Pokemon series, to weave its narrative about life as a courier in Sapphire Valley. A life that you can explore at your own pace and leisure.</p>

<p data-characters="316" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Of all of the daily quests that players can acquire in <em>Fallout 76</em>, hacking a terminal is the most loathed of them all. The hacking minigame isn’t as exciting as exterminating pests or hunting down creatures for their materials. Plus, perks are required to attempt to hack most of the terminals found in the game.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="318" data-current-count="318" data-injectable="false">But hacking terminals doesn’t have to be so tedious. Unlike slaying creatures, players don’t have to worry about spawns or interference from others. Terminals are found in fixed locations and are always the same level, so besides the minigame itself, they can be the most straightforward daily quest to complete.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-how-to-hack-terminals-in-fallout-76" data-injectable="false">How to hack terminals in <em>Fallout 76</em>&nbsp;</h2> <p data-characters="319" data-current-count="637" data-injectable="true">There are four levels of terminals found across Appalachia that range from zero to three. Level zero terminals can be hacked by any player since they don’t require any perks. Terminal levels one through three require having the Hacker, Expert Hacker, and Master Hacker perk cards respectively in order to hack them.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="195" data-current-count="195" data-injectable="false">Different levels of terminals will provide varying rewards and any level terminal will fulfill most quest or achievement requirements (besides Tadpole challenges which mention particular levels).</p> <figure data-wp-context="{ &quot;core&quot;: 				{ &quot;image&quot;: 					{   &quot;imageLoaded&quot;: false, 						&quot;initialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;hideAnimationEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;preloadInitialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxAnimation&quot;: &quot;zoom&quot;, 						&quot;imageUploadedSrc&quot;: &quot;https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/fallout-76-hacking-terminal-1.webp&quot;, 						&quot;imageCurrentSrc&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;targetWidth&quot;: &quot;1200&quot;, 						&quot;targetHeight&quot;: &quot;675&quot;, 						&quot;scaleAttr&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;dialogLabel&quot;: &quot;Enlarged image&quot; 					} 				} 			}" data-wp-interactive="" data-current-count="495" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption> <div data-wp-body="" data-wp-bind--role="selectors.core.image.roleAttribute" data-wp-bind--aria-label="selectors.core.image.dialogLabel" data-wp-class--initialized="context.core.image.initialized" data-wp-class--active="context.core.image.lightboxEnabled" data-wp-class--hideanimationenabled="context.core.image.hideAnimationEnabled" data-wp-bind--aria-modal="selectors.core.image.ariaModal" data-wp-effect="effects.core.image.initLightbox" data-wp-on--keydown="actions.core.image.handleKeydown" data-wp-on--touchstart="actions.core.image.handleTouchStart" data-wp-on--touchmove="actions.core.image.handleTouchMove" data-wp-on--touchend="actions.core.image.handleTouchEnd" data-wp-on--click="actions.core.image.hideLightbox" tabindex="-1"> <p> <figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> </p> <p> <figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> </p>  </div></figure>

 <p data-characters="324" data-current-count="324" data-injectable="false">Hacking terminals in <em>Fallout 76</em> is much more forgiving than in the other <em>Fallout</em> games.

		<p>Heart Machine, the developers of Hyper Light Drifter and Solar Ash, has revealed its brand new project called Possessor(s). Much like the studio’s previous game Hyper Light Drifter, Possessor(s) is a fast paced action side scroller but set in its own world. In this world, a hellish landscape exists which has come about due to interdimensional catastrophe and horror. Furthermore, players will take on the role of Luca, the host, and Rehm, who is Luca’s uncooperative other.</p>
<p><iframe title="Possessor(s) | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eFd32M4-muA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Following the reveal of the Possessor(s), Alx Preston, Founder &amp; Creative Director at Heart Machine said,<em> “You’ll notice that Possessor(s) shares DNA with Hyper Light Drifter, despite being an entirely different world and story. As a studio, we’re eternally applying valuable lessons from our past successes and mistakes to our present work. We’re carrying those lessons forward, and transforming them into something unique with this game. We hope to continue to build on our legacy while pushing the boundaries of what we can create. At its core, Possessor(s) is a game about relationships – specifically, the ones that hurt us and how we navigate through them. We wanted to explore the idea of getting out of toxic traps and the difficult journey of self-improvement. Our characters are trying to change for the better and struggling to stop punishing themselves. The theme of possession ties into how we heal from these emotional wounds.”</em></p>
<p>Danny Moll, Art Director of Possessor(s) also chipped in saying, <em>“We have carefully calibrated the overall aesthetic and tone of Possessor(s) and are proud of what we’ve come up with. Inspired by games like INSIDE, Signalis, and Control — and TV shows like Severance, we’ve created a world that feels both familiar and hauntingly surreal.Imagine a post-apocalyptic sci-fi landscape, influenced by weird fiction world-building in such works as Jeff Vandermeer’s Area X or the Annihilation film. It’s “sony-walkman retrofuturism” in a game.”</em></p>

<p>A release date for Possessor(s) is yet to be confirmed.</p>

They’re the first people to complete some encounters, and it’s been such a fun experience to watch as a fan playing this franchise since the <em>Destiny 1 Alpha</em>. However, as fire teams approach what is believed to be the end of the raid, many have turned off their live gameplay feeds. In some cases, this means that all we can see is a blank screen, and it’s not as enjoyable as I imagine watching Guardians pummel The Witness should be. </p>

User <a href="https://x.com/RhyWil/status/1799309933793697814" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RhysWild</a> has posted what might be the funniest summary of what’s going on right now. </p> <figure data-current-count="517" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="433" data-current-count="433" data-injectable="true">I’m almost certain that most streamers are still recording their gameplay and will upload it once they’ve completed Salvation’s Edge. While I’d love to see it live, I think this situation makes the race a little more fair since all the competing fire teams are right at the end of the raid. Being able to see what another team is doing and if they make any meaningful progress feels like an unfair advantage. </p>
 <p data-characters="287" data-current-count="287" data-injectable="false">The race for world first in <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em>‘s Salvation’s Edge began at 1 PM ET on June 7, 2024. At the time of writing, this race has been going on for almost 20 hours. That makes it the longest race for world first in <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-destiny-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Destiny 2</a></em> history, which is quite the feat. </p> <p data-characters="274" data-current-count="561" data-injectable="false">I think it’s quite fitting that the last major expansion for the game has the toughest raid to beat. I’m going to remember this as a fan of the game, even when other raids are added, because there’s never quite been a situation like it for this community. </p>

		<p>During the Summer Game Fest, Capcom confirmed the fighters coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/07/street-fighter-6-year-2-characters-have-been-announced/">Street Fighter 6 during year 2</a>. The first of those fighter is M.Bison, who will be available on June 26th for those who have the Year 2 Character Pass or Ultimate Pass, who was shown riding a huge horse and evoking some imagery of Death. Now, Capcom has released a gameplay trailer for M.Bison, showing some of his moves.</p>
<p><iframe title="Street Fighter 6 - M. Bison Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5dgfrWteSW0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>What we know about Street Fighter 6’s version of M.Bison is that he has amnesia, so does not remember the events of the previous games. He does claim the name back but he is on new journey of self discovery, a journey that involves a lot of Psycho Power, knee presses, stomping, and punching.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/30/street-fighter-6-review/">In our Street Fighter 6 Review,</a>&nbsp;Nick said,&nbsp;<em>“Street Fighter 6 doesn’t need recommending to hardcore fighting fans – you all already know how incredible it is – but do I recommend it for more casual players? Street Fighter 6 has a real sense of community, welcoming all players old and new, teaching new tricks and providing something for those that just want a bit of fun. This is truly a fighting game for everyone.”</em></p>

            <p>Medieval looter Dark and Darker has finally returned to Steam as an early-access, free-to-play game.</p>
<p>Developer Ironmace confirmed the news at last night's Summer Game Fest show, during which it also revealed that the "unforgiving hardcore fantasy FPS dungeon PvPvE adventure" would be free to play on the Epic Games Store, too.</p>

<p>As a thank you, the team has added a "massive content update" which includes the Ice Abyss area, new boss Frost Wyvern, and an all-new Druid class.</p>
<p>You can also expect to find "numerous" unspecified QoL upgrades to "enhance the gameplay experience".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dark-and-darker-has-been-removed-from-steam-following-a-cease-and-desist-demand">Dark and Darker was previously been removed from Steam</a> following a protracted legal dispute with Nexon. The Korean developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dark-and-darker-developer-denies-stolen-code-allegations-following-police-raid">had its office searched after allegations the studio created its game with stolen code</a> and was then served a cease-and-desist letter and DMCA takedown by Nexon, the fellow Korean games company where several Ironmace employees used to work.</p>
<p>After using <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dark-and-darker-developer-uses-chatgpt-ai-tool-in-bid-to-prove-it-hasnt-infringed-copyright-1">ChatGPT in a bid to prove it hadn't infringed any copyright claims</a>, Ironmace put <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/despite-legal-woes-dark-and-darker-finally-launches-into-early-access">Dark and Darker back online</a> via its own launcher, Blacksmith. Then, in January of this year, a court ultimately <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dark-and-darker-dev-says-nexons-trade-secret-and-copyright-lawsuit-against-it-has-been-dismissed">dismissed Nexon's request for an injunction</a>, allowing Ironmace to release the game on PC storefronts once again.</p>
<p>"Our vision is to deliver unparalleled joy and excitement to players worldwide with Dark and Darker," the team said. "We are committed to transforming it into an iconic title that will captivate and be cherished by the global gaming community for the next decade and beyond."</p>
<p>Despite only returning to the Steam store yesterday, the game currently sits on a "mixed" review score from almost 1500 players. The negative reviews primarily stem from reports that the F2P version is essentially a "demo", as you can't use any uncommon items or unlock multiple characters unless you cough up for the Legendary package. Others are just delighted that the game is once again on Steam.</p>
<p>"Back from the dead, comeback of the year," <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/durpledore/recommended/2016590/">said</a> one happy player.</p>

		<p>During Devolver Direct, Devolver Digital and Croteam announced the Road to Elysium DLC for The Talos Principle 2, set for release on June 14th. This upcoming DLC comprises three distinct narratives from various character viewpoints, introducing new challenges.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Talos Principle 2 | Road to Elysium Reveal Trailer | Coming June 14" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S_yL_I8BEgk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The three stories of The Talos Principle II Road to Elysium are called Orpheus Ascending, Isle of the Blessed, and Into the Abyss. You can read descriptions for each of the below.</p>
<p><em><strong>Orpheus Ascending – </strong>Explore the philosophy of love, death and resurrection through the story of Hypatia and Sarabhai. Return to the role of 1K to enter Sarabhai’s mind and retrieve the shattered fragments of her personality. Set in a gorgeous environment inspired by Ancient Egypt, this chapter challenges you to solve a series of complex laser-based puzzles in unconventional ways.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Isle of the Blessed – </strong>Hang out with Yaqut and Miranda as they join Cornelius and Athena on a puzzle-driven adventure set on a stunning Caribbean island. Challenge yourself with a wide variety of never-before-seen puzzles using familiar tools, culminating in the Hexahedron, a large continuous puzzle cluster set in a mysterious tower.</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Into the Abyss – </strong>Return to one of the most dramatic moments from&nbsp;The Talos Principle II&nbsp;and find out what happened to Byron when he was trapped in the Megastructure. Taking place on a series of floating islands, this chapter takes you on a trippy journey through a glitchy dream world full of extremely difficult puzzles that will make even veteran players’ heads spin.</em></p>
<p>In our The Talos Principle 2 review, Adrian wrote, <em>“Talos Principle 2 is the best puzzler since 2011. This is as good as the genre gets and absolutely essential for puzzle game fans.”</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Every Summer Game Fest 2024 Announcement]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/every-summer-game-fest-2024-announcement</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/every-summer-game-fest-2024-announcement.894384/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/every-summer-game-fest-2024-announcement<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Summer Game Fest is back this year with a number of new announcements looking to pad out the rest of 2024 and beyond. Host Geoff Keighley took to the stage to show off a number of new announcements including both new game reveals and updates on games we've seen before. While we were told to mute expectations somewhat (that means no Kingdom Hearts IV or other dream titles), there was still a lot to take in from studios big and small. Here's the full recap of what we saw during the two hour showcase.</p>

<h3><em>LEGO Horizon Adventures</em></h3>
<p>The once rumored <em>LEGO Horizon</em> finally sees its reveal with a colorful announcement trailer showcasing Aloy, the franchise's lead gal and machine hunter. <em>LEGO Horizon Adventures</em> will take Aloy and a crew of heroes through the lush wilderness on a quest to save the world and discover the secrets of her past. Co-developed by Guerrilla and Studio Gobo, <em>LEGO Horizon Adventures</em> is a playful and light-hearted story inspired by the events of the world of <em>Horizon</em>.</p>
<p>Players will be able to dive into a grand adventure, customize parts as much as they like, and take on action-filled battles by themselves or with a friend using the game's co-op system. <em>LEGO Horizon Adventures</em> is coming to PC, PlayStation 5, and Nintendo Switch this holiday.</p>

<h3><em>No More Room in Hell 2</em></h3>
<p><em>No More Room in Hell 2</em> is an 8-player horror experience currently in development by Torn Banner Studios with an expected release on Halloween 2024. This game is an intense, permadeath co-op journey into eerie, zombie-filled zones. As a first responder, it'll be up to you to survive, scavenge, stockpile, and fulfill your mission - and then do it all over again as each experience changes.</p>
<p>The announcement trailer runs through various in-game scenarios including gameplay and in-engine cinematics. No More Room in Hell 2 will be available for early access on Halloween this year, with a release expected on Steam and Epic Games Store.</p>

<h3><em>Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions</em></h3>
<p>Revealed last year and in various states of player testing during that time, Warner Bros. Games has finally put the date on <em>Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions.</em> Featuring iconic locations from the series, as well as characters including Harry himself, Ron, and Hermione, as well as other references, the game will task players with flying across arena in the roles of a Beater, Chaser, Keeper, or Seeker in a number of modes. Those who own <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> will receive the Bonus Legacy Pack when they connect Quidditch Champions to their WB Games account.</p>
<p><em>Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions</em> will be available on September 3 for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam and Epic Games Store. Additionally, PlayStation Plus subscribers will get the game day one as part of their monthly releases.</p>

<h3><em>Cuffbust</em></h3>
<p>The announcement of <em>Cuffbust</em> promises a fun prison break experience to have with your friends by equipping tools, evading guards, and executing your plan to get out of jail. The game promises destructible environments, proximity chat, a multitude of escape routes, and 20 player lobbies.</p>
<p><em>Cuffbust </em>is coming to Steam in 2025, developed by by Gavin Eisenbeisz (Two Star Games), creator of <em>Choo-Choo Charles, No Snake Hotel, My Beautiful Paper Smile, Cloud Climber,</em> and <em>My Friend is a Raven</em>. The game is currently available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2592220/CUFFBUST/">Wishlist</a> alongside its announcement trailer.</p>

<h3><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em></h3>
<p>Ubisoft debuted a short teaser for their upcoming adventure game <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, which is coming on August 30th. While the teaser is short, it does give us a new look at various environments, traversal using various vehicles, familiar characters such as Jabba the Hutt, space battles, and stages of combat.</p>
<p>Further information on <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> is expected to be shown off at Ubisoft's own showcase, Ubisoft Forward, on June 10th at 12PM PDT. There, fans can expect an all-new gameplay reveal.</p>

<h3><em>Neva</em></h3>
<p><em>Neva </em>has returned after a year of silence with an all-new gameplay trailer. Featuring a new story from developer Nomada Studio, the creators of <em>GRIS</em>, <em>Neva</em> follows the story of Alba, a young woman who is bound to a curious wolf cub following an incident that was quite traumatizing. Together they will have to embark on a journey full of peril, and make their way through a once-beautiful world as it slowly decays around them.</p>
<p><em>Neva</em> will launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series some time in 2024.</p>

<h3><em>Sid Meier's Civilization VII</em></h3>
<p>At long last, the next entry in the storied Civilization series is revealed with the announcement of <em>Sid Meier's Civilization VII</em>. While the full gameplay reveal is expected in August, the teaser shows off some of the elements one might expect from the Civilization franchise. This new strategy game's goal is to empower you to of course create the greatest empire the world has ever known.</p>
<p>You'll be able to rule as many legendary leaders from history, establish your civilization, construct cities, and expand your territory all while conquering or cooperating with rival civilizations in pursuit of prosperity and exploring the unknown world. <em>Civilization VII</em> is a strategy game developed by the team at Firaxis Games, and will be available across all major platforms including PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

<h3><em>Black Myth: Wukong</em></h3>
<p><em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> isn't far off, but that didn't stop the developers at Game Science from showing off a new CG trailer meant to entice people to pre-order. This single-player action RPG is inspired by the classic story Journey to the West, and those familiar with that tale can see some of that brought to live in the new trailer.</p>
<p>Digital pre-orders are now live for <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>, which will launch on August 20, 2024 for PlayStation 5, Steam, and Epic Games Store. The trailer also had a first look at the game's collector's edition, which can be seen below.</p>

<h3><em>Once Human</em></h3>
<p>Starry Studio's <em>Once Human </em>has a release date, courtesy of a new trailer shown off at Summer Game Fest. The multiplayer open-world survival game set in a post-apocalyptic future urges friends to unite against monstrous enemies, uncover secret plots, compete for resources, and build up your own territory. The trailer shows off many of these elements with all-new in-engine footage.</p>
<p>With the official release date set for July 9, 2024, <em>Once Human</em> is available for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2139460/Once_Human/">Wishlist </a>now on Steam and will also be available on Epic Games Store.</p>

<h3><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em></h3>
<p>Upcoming fantasy RPG from the developers of Persona, <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>, showed up to Summer Game Fest with an all-new gameplay focused trailer for their new RPG, coming to PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series on October 11. The trailer shows off many in-game battle scenes, as well as some of the anime-style cutscenes chronicling the Kingdom of Euchronia.</p>
<p><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> will have your main character journey alongside a fairy companion named Gallica, in order to lift a curse from the kingdom's lost prince. What sets the game apart from the Persona series is a magical power known as Archetype that involves the channeling and combination of unique job classes.</p>


<h3><em>Batman: Arkham Shadow</em></h3>
<p>A new Batman game is in development for Meta Quest VR from Warner Bros. Games. With a new story-focused trailer shown off at Summer Game Fest, there's a lot to unpack as Gotham City comes under siege from the mysterious Rat King and his devotees.</p>
<p>Players will be able to experience Gotham City like none other in this full-length entry in the Arkham universe. It's set nearly two years after the events of <em>Batman: Arkham Origins</em> and includes familiar characters such as The Scarecrow, Harley Quinn and more. <em>Batman: Arkham Shadow</em> will be available this Fall on Meta Quest 3.</p>

<h3><em>Street Fighter VI</em> - Year 2 Character Reveals</h3>
<p>Capcom revealed the next round of characters heading to <em>Street Fighter VI </em>across 2024 and 2025 with a new character-focused trailer highlighting Year 2.

<h3><em>Power Rangers: Rita's Rewind</em></h3>
<p>Power Rangers is the latest franchise to see the retro game treatment with the announcement of <em>Power Rangers: Rita's Rewind</em>.

<p><em>Power Rangers: Rita's Rewind</em> is being developed by Digital Eclipse in collaboration with Hasbro, and will launch for consoles and on Steam in 2024.</p>

<h3><em>Deer &amp; Boy</em></h3>
<p>Continuing with the indie reveals in <em>Deer &amp; Boy</em>, a colorful game and cinematic platformer about unlikely companions by Lifeline Games. As the title suggests, a boy and a deer will have to overcome many obstacles that will change their lives forever. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Warhorse Studios shared a new look at <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II,</em> which is still scheduled to launch in 2024 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series. The new trailer shows off expanses of environments, character cutscenes, and some of the combat system players can expect in the beautiful but unforgiving world of 15th Century Bohemia.</p>
<p>The aptly named Saints and Sinners trailer asks the question - will you take the path of righteousness or vice? Will you save the world or punish its sins? Choice is a big part of<em> Kingdom Come: Deliverance II'</em>s open-world adventure systems.</p>

<h3><em>Slitterhead</em></h3>
<p>Bokeh Studio's<em> Slitterhead</em> saw a new trailer and release date at Summer Game Fest. The game will launch on November 8, 2024, for PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and Epic Games Store.</p>

<p>The trailer shows us that Atla doesn't really want to be there, and if it were up to her, the tea shop would only be a fleeting memory. <em>Wanderstop </em>is coming some time in 2024 to PC and PlayStation 5.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/msi-claw-after-more-updates-nope-it%E2%80%99s-still-a-dud.894381/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/8/24174086/msi-claw-updates-review-addendum<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24105991/msi-claw-review">When I called the MSI Claw an embarrassment</a> in my May 18th review, one commenter pointed out they’d gotten higher benchmark scores than me. Sure enough: MSI had pushed out new graphics drivers and BIOS updates between the time I benchmarked and the time we published. </p><p>I’ve now tested those updates. In some of my tests, they’re better. In others, I actually found them worse! Overall, they don’t change my conclusion one bit: the MSI Claw is the worst pick from today’s crop of consumer handheld gaming PCs, and you should steer clear. </p><p>Below, you’ll find my new benchmark results in the same games, across all of the Claw’s standard power modes. In almost every test, you’ll see the Claw dramatically behind the competition in speed <em>while using more power</em>.</p><div><p><em>New results bolded. All tests at 720p low, save&nbsp;Dirt Rally&nbsp;at 720p ultra.</em></p></div><p>Worse, I’m still finding the Claw varies wildly between playable and completely unplayable in demanding games where the less expensive Steam Deck has no issues. In <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider,</em> I saw the game repeatedly and inexplicably dip to just 20fps in a cave with no enemies around at 720p and Medium spec, before recovering to a stable 60fps a little while later. </p><p>I saw something similar in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, even though the MSI Claw now generally has a higher framerate in that game after updates. </p><p>And I’m also now seeing some very weird behavior with the Claw when it comes to power modes. You might expect MSI’s “Performance” mode to be speedier than its “Balanced” mode, right? That’s not what I saw in <em>Cyberpunk 2077 — </em>and when I took a close look at the framerate dips, I noticed they always coincided with an unexpected power dip. </p><p>While the Intel Meteor Lake chip consumed a pretty stable 30 watts in Balanced mode, it tried to hit 35, 36, even 37 watts in Performance mode — and couldn’t maintain it, dipping down to 29 watts again and again. Plugged into USB-C power, the Performance mode worked better, continually pulling between 37 and 45 watts of power. Not that the extra power made an improvement in <em>Cyberpunk, </em>unfortunately. </p><p>And if you’re seeing higher scores than I am, I highly suggest you run that benchmark another three or four times, because it looks like MSI now runs its chip unsustainably faster for a while after you switch power modes, then throttles back down. The Asus ROG Ally does the same trick, and I always had to run my benchmarks a bunch of extra times there before I start counting, so I don’t throw off the average with outliers. I didn’t need to do that when I first reviewed the Claw.</p><p>To MSI and Intel’s credit, at least <em>Dave the Diver</em> feels playable now at a smooth 60fps with only occasional drops, unlike in my original review. </p><p>Overall, I think the MSI Claw should never have gone on sale. I’m glad I never had the urge to buy one when it first came out. I would feel cheated, just like the users <a href="https://forum-en.msi.com/index.php?threads/are-you-kidding-me.397812/">in MSI’s own forums</a> who <a href="https://forum-en.msi.com/index.php?threads/new-msi-claw-8-ai-i-feel-so-cheated.397853/">say they feel cheated</a>, now that MSI has announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/7/24173763/msi-claw-7-lunar-lake-roadmap-claw-2-claw-3-claw-4">not one, but two improved versions</a> less than three months after the original came out. </p><p>It certainly doesn’t help that the company put it on sale before giving reviewers a chance to warn anyone.</p><p>If MSI is serious about the handheld space, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/7/24173763/msi-claw-7-lunar-lake-roadmap-claw-2-claw-3-claw-4">it sounds like the company is</a>, I think it should offer a trade-in program for buyers of the original Claw. If you want to fix this, MSI, let them pick one of this fall’s revisions at a massive discount. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>At Summer Game Fest 2024, Riot Games announced that its popular free-to-play 5v5 competitive first-person shooter game VALORANT will soon be available on consoles. A limited beta is set to kick off on June 12 for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X players living in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Europe, and Japan, with more regions possibly rolling out later.</p>
<p>Arnar Gylfason, Production Director of VALORANT at Riot Games, stated:</p>
<p><em>When exploring whether to bring VALORANT to additional platforms, we knew we had to be able to offer the same uncompromising, competitive experience that we’ve provided to PC players for years: a precise, team-based, tactical shooter. We were adamant that VALORANT’s core, competitive gameplay must feel natural on a controller; and - if we couldn’t deliver on that gameplay promise - we had to be prepared to walk away from it. We hope we nailed it, but ultimately, our players will have the final say.</em></p>
<p>Riot Games confirmed that due to the game's focus on competitive gameplay, there will be no cross-play with the existing PC version <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/valorant-professionals-wanted/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched in June 2020</a>. However, all players will have a connected, shared inventory and gameplay progression tied to their VALORANT account. PC and console players will receive simultaneous platform releases of all live patch balances, new agents, maps, premium content, and additional live service features.</p>
<p><iframe title="VALORANT CONSOLE ANNOUNCE // Welcome Trailer - VALORANT" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e9i02_8aMV0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXq176aI7Mk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new developer diary</a>, Riot talked about the process of bringing the game to consoles and ensuring it would feel right with a controller:</p>
<p><em>VALORANT is a very mouse-focused game. It requires a lot of dexterity. One of the things we were really focused on when we were getting the game to feel really good on the controller was to manage the limitations of your trying to move through the environment with your right stick as fast as you can, but you also need to be hyper-precise.</em></p>
<p><em>Being able to do both things with one stick is a very challenging problem. When we first got our hands on VALORANT on console, it was a much different experience than we have right now. It was a bit clunky. We needed something to make it easier for players to slow down and hone in on gunfights when they need to. I think our switch to what we call a focus mode was a big turning point for us.</em></p>
<p><em>It's kind of the button you press before you take a fight. Your sensitivity drops down, you zoom in, you become precise. You should feel like you're about to be accurate when you're trying to hit the really long range shot.</em></p>

			<p>The action/adventure game <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-remake-needs-a-rethink-creator-slitterhead-prototyping-complete/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Slitterhead</a> appeared with major news at Summer Game Fest 2024. Japanese Developer Bokeh Game Studio, founded by Silent Hill creator Keiichiro Toyama following Sony's closure of Team Siren, revealed that Slitterhead would launch on November 8 for PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2631250/Slitterhead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> and Epic Games Store), PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>
<p>Here's the brief official description provided by Bokeh:</p>
<p><em>Set in the densely cluttered streets of "Kowlong," filled with obscurity and chaos, this battle action-adventure game casts players as the "Hyoki," an entity devoid of memory and physical form. His only motive is to eradicate the monstrous beings known as "Slitterheads" crawling around the city, disguising themselves as humans.</em></p>
<p><em>Hyoki's ability allows him to possess and control human bodies at will, turning the people wandering the city into his pawns. With this power, he can slip through barriers, assume the identity of specific individuals, and infiltrate dangerous areas and organizations. By rapidly switching hosts, he can also traverse the city at high speed.</em></p>
<p><em>Roaming the vibrant neon-lit cityscape, players must seek out allies among humans known as "Rarities," infiltrate and track dangerous organizations, and engage in battles harnessing the power of blood. While human bodies are fragile, Hyoki can burn their life force, turning blood into weapons to confront the ferocious Slitterheads. Even when critically wounded, he can continue fighting by switching hosts efficiently.<br>
</em></p>
<p><em>By possessing "Rarities", specific humans who share high sync with Hyoki, he is able to unleash even more powerful attacks and activate various abilities. The cooperative relationship with these "Rarities" holds the key to uncovering the deepening mysteries in the city of Kowlong.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Slitterhead - Gameplay Trailer - SGF 2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2mAkn64FQDU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

		<p>It might be hard to remember the days of the Atari 2600. Some of you would have been minus 12 or a similar sort of negative age that makes me upset. I do remember though, as I had an Atari 2600. Admittedly is was a good while after the console came out, and it was because we were poor, but let’s not get into that right now. Still, the most wonderful thing about my Atari 2600 was its 52-game cartridge, an unbelievable pack of games with various styles and genres covered. It feels like the team behind UFO50 have similar memories, as we’re about to get the same type of wild, multi-game experience in 2024.</p>
<p><iframe title="UFO 50 - Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5wqZi1smZOg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Mossmouth, the team behind the Spelunky games, have been working on UFO50 for a long time – it was announced 6 years ago! – and there’s a clear reason why: these are 50 fully-formed games. Narratively, they’ve created a retro game developer, UFO Soft, given them a timeline between the 80s and 90s, and then gone to work building the games that this fictional developer created. It’s mind-blowing when you think about it.</p>

<p>There’s various different genres here, from SHMUPS, classic 2D platformers and into-the-screen RPGs. Some are shorter, arcade-style experiences; others have narratives and expansive worlds to explore. If you’re a fan of retro-styled indie games, or this was the era of gaming that you grew up in, UFO50 looks like it will be a nostalgic and constantly surprising journey through a developer that you’ve never experienced before.</p>

<p>There’s not been too much through the Summer Games Fest to get excited about, but Day of the Devs showcased that we’re in safe hands with the indie creators out there. Every game in UFO50 includes a singleplayer mode, but if you also have fond memories of 8-bit and 16-bit multiplayer action you’ll be gald to know that over half of the games also offer local multiplayer as well.</p>

<p>UFO50 will be released on PC on the 19th of September, and I, for one, absolutely can’t wait! Stay tuned to TheSixthAxis for more news, previews and reviews as UFO50 is certainly one to watch.</p>

 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via EA Sports</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="460" data-injectable="true"> <li>Select Training Transfer from the menu.</li> <li>First, select the card from which the training will be transferred.</li> <li>Second, select the card which will receive the XP.</li> <li>Click on the ‘Transfer’ button to complete the process.</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="391" data-current-count="391" data-injectable="false">There are still going to be a lot of strategies involved with the transfer process. First, the training transfer will be limited if the target player has a lower rank. In such cases, the extra XP will remain with the original card, and you can transfer it once the rank of the target card is high enough. Additionally, ranks of the cards won’t be affected by any transfer of training. </p> <p data-characters="247" data-current-count="638" data-injectable="true">You should also remember that 10% XP will be lost in each transfer. Training Transfer points, required in every exchange, won’t be infinite either. However, there will be plenty of in-game activities from which players can earn these points.</p>
 <p data-characters="228" data-current-count="228" data-injectable="false"><em>FC Mobile</em> Training Transfer will be available after the update on June 11. This update will also introduce a new <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/fc-mobile-euro-2024-tournament-explained-release-date-rewards-and-more/">Euro 2024 tournament mode</a> in Ultimate Team. You can select any of the qualified nations and write your own history.</p>

			<p>In early 2021, Lever Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-more-room-in-hell-2-gets-steam-page-ahead-of-coming-soon-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> No More Room in Hell 2, a sequel to the popular 2011 Source mod. The game was meant to launch soon after that announcement, but it went dark for a long time.</p>
<p>That changed at Summer Game Fest 2024 when we learned that Chivalry developer Torn Banner Studios acquired Lever Games and bolstered the team with some of its own veterans to finish developing No More Room in Hell 2, now slated to launch <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/292000/No_More_Room_in_Hell_2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/no-more-room-in-hell-2-ea1b5c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a> early access this Halloween.</p>
<p>Steve Piggott, CEO and creative director at Torn Banner Studios, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>No More Room in Hell 2 continues the dark, grounded aesthetic and intense action horror approach of the original game while expanding its vision dramatically. We’re excited to be the new shepherds of a franchise we adored as fans and thrilled to take up the mission of capturing the iconic horror of classic zombie cinema. We want to blow people away with our first co-op game, pushing Torn Banner’s skill in multiplayer action to a whole new level.</em></p>
<p>The game is now being made with Unreal Engine 5. It is set on a huge map (the first one to be released will be a Power Plant), and most of all, it features permadeath, causing players to consider every step of the way. In each match, players will have to find their fellow companions on the map and will start with very little, having to loot new weapons and gear to increase their chances of survival. They will then move toward the final objective on the map's center and try to extract there.</p>
<p><iframe title="No More Room in Hell 2 | Official Announce Trailer - Summer Game Fest" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jkuwzUd9lGs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Looting supplies levels up the player character, so long as they survive a mission. With every run, you can improve your chances for survival with access to equipment caches and starting gear. The developers also promise a 'dynamic gore system' that will make bashing zombies very satisfying.</p>

		<p>A new gameplay video gives PlayStation fans a closer look at upcoming action RPG, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/phantom-blade-zero">Phantom Blade Zero</a>. The new trailer, dubbed “The Blade is Drawn” made its debut during Summer Games Fest 2024, showcasing new weapons, enemies, and environments.</p>
<p><iframe title="Phantom Blade Zero Gameplay Trailer - SGF2024" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cgBmIjaZraE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>There’s still no word on a release date just yet, though a Phantom Blade Zero demo will be making its way around the globe at key gaming events and exhibitions in 2024.</p>
<p>Developed by Chinese developer S-Game, Phantom Blade Zero is currently due to launch on both PlayStation 5 and PC. First revealed during Sony’s PlayStation Showcase in May 2023, it promises a gritty Souslike experience that blends together elements of steampunk, Chinese mythology, and martial arts.</p>
<p>It follows the saga of Soul, an elite assassin framed for the murder of the leader of the enigmatic Order of the Mask. With a mere 66 days left to live, Soul must traverse a treacherous landscape filled with powerful foes and unravel a complex conspiracy to clear his name and find a cure.</p>

<p>Hopefully, the Phantom Blade Zero demo will be publicly playable in the near future.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-showcase-8-world-premieres-gears-6-new-doom/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Tomorrow's Xbox Showcase is said to feature 8 world premieres, including the rumored new Gears 6 and DOOM.</p>
<p>At least, that's what Spanish leaker 'eXtas1s' (who often <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">writes</a> for outlet Exputer) said on X some hours ago. Although the event will feature more than eight games coming to Xbox (and possibly other platforms as well), the leaker writes to have heard about 8 titles that haven't been officially announced just yet. As mentioned by ''eXtas1s' on X, these titles include both first- and third-party games, and among them are the new Gears from The Coalition and Bethesda's rumored DOOM: The Dark Ages.</p>
<p>"According to our sources, we can confirm that the Xbox Showcase <span>will have a total of 8 WORLD PREMIERES, that is, games</span> for which there is not even an official announcement, until the event", the leaker <a href="https://x.com/eXtas1stv/status/1799098658203341301" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> on X. He <a href="https://x.com/eXtas1stv/status/1799099198161428553" target="_blank" rel="noopener">added</a>, "This includes 1st and 3rd party games. We already know 2 of them, Gears 6 and Doom The Dark Ages."</p>
<p>Although this isn't a confirmation in any way, T<a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-6-unlikely-30-fps/">he Verge's Tom Warren also mentioned the announcement of the new Gears from The Coalition and the new DOOM from id Software some days ago. Interestingly enough, while DOOM: The Dark Ages is said to be a multi-platform title, Gears 6 will allegedly be Xbox exclusive.</a></p>
<p>Back in April of this year, several insiders and leakers <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-6-might-appear-at-xbox-showcase-people-arent-ready-for-how-good-it-looks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggested</a> that Gears 6 might very well appear at Microsoft's Xbox showcase. Known insider Nate "shinobi602" Najda said that aside from the game looking very good, it's <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-6-unlikely-30-fps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unlikely that it would run at only cinematic 30FPS on Xbox Series X|S</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as reported last month, the new multi-platform DOOM is said to be called DOOM: The Dark Ages, and will feature a medieval setting. "Doom: The Dark Ages has been in development for roughly four years, which makes sense, as Doom Eternal came out in 2020", reputable insider Tom Henderson wrote last month. "The game was developed under the codename “Year Zero,” and The Dark Ages subtitle is quite literal, as the game is said to feature a “medieval inspired Doom world.”</p>

		<p>Hype surrounding the upcoming <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a> DLC is currently at its zenith, with the major expansion planned to release on June 21st 2024 on PC and consoles. However, one dataminer suggests that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/21/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-release-date-21-june-trailer/">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> will continue a disappointing <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/fromsoftware">FromSoftware</a> trend by not supporting the game with additional <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-trophies">trophies</a> or achievements.</p>

<p>This update comes via reliable source <a href="https://x.com/PlaystationSize/status/1798320557706076525">PlayStation Game Size</a>, who also reveals that the major Elden Ring DLC will weigh in around 16.5GB with pre-loads taking place 2 days ahead of launch, on June 19th 2024. While the claim that there will be no additional PlayStation trophies or Xbox achievements has yet to be 100% verified, it’s extremely likely considering developer FromSoftware’s track record with the <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> series doing the same.</p>
<p>It’s been a long wait for fans of the 2022 smash hit, with Elden Ring director Hidetaka Miyazaki first teasing the DLC during The Game Awards 2022, &nbsp;“As for Elden Ring, we have several more things we want to do” he commented. It was then&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/28/elden-ring-dlc-confirmed-to-be-in-development/">confirmed to be in development in early 2023</a>, though development has been largely silent ever since then. While Elden Ring has sold tens of millions of copies, it shows impressive commitment to work on a DLC expansion for over two years – typically that kind of development cycle gets spun off into a sequel, as we saw with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/11/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review/">Tears of the Kingdom</a>.</p>
<p>The title has one multiple Game of The Year awards including trophies from DICE, The Game Awards, and it was our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/12/31/game-of-the-year-2022-overall-winner/">Overall Game of The Year winner here at TheSixthAxis.</a></p>

<p>We scored Elden Ring top marks,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/02/23/elden-ring-review/">10/10 in our review</a>&nbsp;back in February 2022. “Elden Ring is the game Souls fans have been waiting for,” said Jason. “From the open world design, to riding into battle on Torrent’s back, and the dark narrative woven through the world, this is a clear Game of the Year frontrunner that will have us all ensnared for a long time to come.”</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/08/inside-out-2-disney-speedstorm-season-8/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/inside-out-2-coming-to-disney-speedstorm-for-season-8.894300/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/08/inside-out-2-disney-speedstorm-season-8/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/gameloft">Gameloft</a> has confirmed that Season 8 of <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/disney-speedstorm">Disney Speedstorm</a> will be inspired by upcoming Pixar sequel, Inside Out 2. Not only that, this new season has been dated for next week, launching on June 13, 2024, on all available platforms including PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PC, Nintendo Switch, and mobile.</p>
<p><iframe title="Disney Speedstorm - Season 8 Date Reveal" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sY-xdHHo8pM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p dir="ltr">Each new season in Disney Speedstorm brings with it new playable racers and tracks, as well as a battle pass refresh. In Season 8 – dubbed Journey of Emotions – fans of the free-to-play racer can expect a glut of new content based on Inside Out 2, which hits cinemas on June 14, 2024.</p>
<p dir="ltr">First up, we have 5 new unlockable characters including Joy, Fear, Anger, Disgust, and Sadness. Gameloft is teasing that we’ll also see 2 mystery racers appear mid-season. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/28/disney-speedstorm-muppets-kermit-event-unlock/">The last mystery racer to join Disney Speedstorm was Kermit the Frog from the Muppets</a>. Journey of Emotions will also introduce a cluster of new tracks to the game as well as Crew Members, secondary characters that can be equipped to racers to increase both their base stats and the effectiveness of power-ups.</p>
<p>For long-time fans of the Disney kart racer, there’s even more exciting news. With Season 8 comes a new “Team Battle” game mode which should hopefully introduce a new dynamic and give characters with support-focused abilities some much-needed time under the spotlight. Gameloft will also be making changes to ranked play, saying that “Ranked Races will see major improvements designed to make the competitive Disney Speedstorm experience more rewarding for all players. A new Player Rank progression and reward system will work alongside the current individual racer and progression paths, giving players even more opportunities to unlock exciting rewards.”</p>

<p>Disney Speedstorm originally launched in 2023 and received a slew of seasonal updates, adding various Disney characters and circuits. The latest season – Sugar Rush – is currently live with a spread of new Wreck-It-Ralph content. In our recent&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/10/disney-speedstorm-review-2024-edition/">Disney Speedstorm review</a>, we scored it a 7/10, saying that:</p>
<p>“Despite being drenched in familiar IP, Disney Speedstorm isn’t the kind of idle kart racing shovelware older gamers grew up with. There’s a clear reverence for the characters it features and their fantastical worlds, evidenced by the passion in Speedstorm’s art direction and soundscape. When coupled with Gameloft’s previous racing hits, the result is something that caters for casual gamers and genre die-hards alike. Just beware that whilethis virtual Disneyland-on-wheels is free, some of its main attractions come at a cost, whether spending time grinding away in queues to meet your favourite Disney mascots, or paying cash for that VIP fast-track.”</p>
<p>You can download the game now on PC, mobile, and all major consoles, complete with crossplay.</p>

			<p>Nomada Studio's Neva has received a beautiful new gameplay trailer during the Summer Game Fest event.</p>
<p>For those in the unknown - Neva is the follow-up title to indie hit title GRIS, and from what we've seen, it's looking absolutely gorgeous. The new trailer shows off the game's art, combat, and majestic vistas. You can check out the brand-new gameplay trailer for Neva below:</p>
<p><iframe title="Neva | Gameplay Trailer | Coming 2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IRG8m0jBGEA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><em>Neva&nbsp;depicts the moving tale of a young woman, Alba, and her lifelong bond with a magnificent wolf as they embark on a thrilling adventure through a dying world.</em></p>
<p><em>Following a traumatic encounter with dark forces, Alba finds herself bound to a curious, mischievous wolf cub. Working together, the pair will help each other overcome increasingly dangerous situations.</em></p>
<p><em>The wolf will grow and mature over time—as will Alba's relationship with it as they traverse this cursed, decaying world.</em></p>
<p><em>Building on what Nomada Studio achieved with&nbsp;GRIS,&nbsp;Neva&nbsp;will feature platforming, puzzles and combat against monstrous enemies, with a minimal UI, delicate art, high quality traditional animation and haunting music.</em></p>
<p>Published by Devolver Digital, Neva was officially announced last year.&nbsp;Neva is slated for a release on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and Nintendo Switch later this year. More information about the game can be found on the <a href="https://neva.game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2420660/Neva/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam page</a>.</p>
<p>Studio Nomada's hit title GRIS was among <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftech-best-indie-games-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our best indie titles of 2018</a>, and we spoke highly about the title in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/gris-anything-but-grizzly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review</a> back then. <em>"Not every game needs to be challenging or hard, and Gris proves that will spectacular grace. It feels like interactive art, like you are traversing a painting the size of a monument and taking it in one small frame at a time. Complimented by a beautiful, almost heartbreaking soundtrack (available for separate purchase&nbsp;on Amazon), GRIS is a fantastic, thoughtful experience, even if it doesn’t last very long."</em></p>
