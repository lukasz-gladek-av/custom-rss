            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/armored-core-6-fires-of-rubicon-hits-3-million-copies-sold-worldwide/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In a loosely translated <a href="https://x.com/fromsoftware_pr/status/1816473504642134502" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a> today, FromSoftware confirmed that Armored Core 6 Fires of Rubicon has officially sold 3 million copies worldwide.</p>



<p>FromSoftware simply thanked all of the fans who played the game since launch. Armored Core 6 Fires of Rubicon first released just under a year ago in August 2023. </p>



<p>Since then, it continued to earn ‘Very Positive’ reviews on Steam and strong scores on Metacritic. It currently holds an impressive 8.0 user score on the latter.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Armored Core 6 just got another Ranked Match Season Update on July 19, with another scheduled for September 2024. The latest major patch was Update 1.06 in February 2024, fixing up bugs and addressing some balancing issues.</p>



<p>However, fans continue to request new DLC for the hit game. Earlier this month, FromSoftware did appear to be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fromsoftware-is-seemingly-hiring-for-armored-core-6-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hiring for Armored Core 6 content</a>.  The job listing requested experience with character modeling and textures for robots in particular.</p>



<p>Although Armored Core 6 has now reached 3 million copies sold, FromSoftware still hasn’t officially announced any new DLC. </p>



<p>Most recently,  FromSoftware expressed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fromsoftware-might-consider-end-to-end-total-co-op-for-future-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interest in co-op gameplay</a> for future titles. Publisher Bandai Namco also just announced its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bandai-namco-announces-gamescom-2024-lineup/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lineup for Gamescom 2024</a>.</p>



<p>Armored Core 6 Fires of Rubicon is available now on PC, and current or last-gen consoles for PlayStation and Xbox fans.</p>

		<p>Crytek has announced Hunt: Showdown 1896, the next chapter for its PvPvE extraction shooter, will be coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC on 15th August. A free upgrade and replacement from the original <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hunt-showdown">Hunt: Showdown</a> game, it also see PlayStation 4 and Xbox One players no longer able to play as <a href="https://www.huntshowdown.com/news/hunt-showdown-to-sunset-on-ps4-xbox-one-from-15th-of-august">the game is sunset on those platforms</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mammon's Gulch Map Reveal | Cinematic Trailer | Hunt: Showdown 1896" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3Nrpz5OFPNg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Hunt: Showdown 1896 is a leap ahead in a number of ways for the game, while the core battle to defeat an occult beast and get back to extraction will remain the same. Narratively, time has jumped forward and the main location has gone from the Bayou to a new map in the Rocky Mountains called Mammon’s Gulch. This will emphasise verticality with plenty of vantage points above the surface, inspired by the community’s love of DeSalle, and then mines and oil wells to explore below that connect the two mountainous regions. In total there are 16 compounds to scope out, with the map as a whole roughly equivalent in size to what’s gone before.</p>
<p>There’s also a big leap technologically, with CryEngine 5.11 powering the game and Crytek keen to make the most of the current generation consoles. Console players will get a native 4K and 60FPS on PS5 and Xbox Series X, which is stepped down to 2K for Xbox Series S.</p>
<p>Other technical improvements include having audio track the true speed of sound, a redone UI, rebalanced perks, weapons and Hunters, a centred crosshair option, overhauled wire trap placement, and more.</p>

<p>Crytek discussed Hunt: Showdown 1896 last year, before it was given the new name. At the time they were <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/if-you-want-to-think-of-it-as-hunt-2-youre-welcome-to-but-im-not-going-to-charge-you-hunt-showdown-manager-on-the-extraction-shooters-impending-engine-upgrade-and-the-pitfalls-of-declaring-a-sequel/">tentative about discussing it as a sequel</a>, though promised that there would be no new game release and charge, similar to how <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a> was an in-place replacement for the original.</p>
<p>On the plus side, all past player purchases and progress will carry forward to Hunt: Showdown 1896 from the original game, but on the downside, a lot of old maps from the Bayou are being shelved… for now. Crytek has also said that “they will be returning post launch after receiving a revamp of their own.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sea-of-thieves-developer-rare-now-has-a-dedicated-doggo-park.936537/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rare-dedicated-dog-park<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Sea of Thieves</em>&nbsp;developer Rare has introduced a dedicated dog park to its studio grounds, allowing employees' good boys and girls to frolic to their hearts' content.</p>
<p>In a paw-sitively adorable <a href="https://x.com/RareLtd/status/1816166798464598375" rel="noopener" target="_blank">post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Rare says that staff have been bringing their doggos to work "for a while", and that the dog park represents another opportunity for outdoor pet fun "alongside ample woodland walks".</p>
<p>Not only that, but Rare dogs are provided with "complimentary toys" that they can chew "to their adorable hearts' content". Honestly, it's hard to argue with Rare that their dogs are the cutest. Here are a couple of shots provided by the studio of Rare dogs frolicking. First, this acrobatic friend.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rare-dog-park-jumping.jpg?itok=GrxKOxYS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rare-dog-park-jumping.jpg?itok=e92betof 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Just&nbsp;<em>look&nbsp;</em>at them.</figcaption></figure><p>If that dog doesn't catch that ball, I'm going to riot. Next, here's this adorably fluffy little creature coming to investigate the camera.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rare-dog-park-close-up.jpg?itok=5AseEtW_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rare-dog-park-close-up.jpg?itok=O82881AR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Urgh. So cute.</figcaption></figure><p>Finally, check out this photo, which features three little canine friends having a ton of fun with a ball. Well, two of them are. The other one appears to have vacated their brain of the one brain cell shared by all dogs.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rare-dog-park-chaos.jpg?itok=JEhHCE4v 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rare-dog-park-chaos.jpg?itok=FfNXCjE3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>These dogs are too precious for words.</figcaption></figure><p>The gaming industry is a difficult place to pay attention to these days thanks to what seems like a relentless tide of negative news, and in fairness, Rare's parent company Microsoft <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-shutdown">hasn't exactly</a> rendered itself <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-report">immune to that cycle</a>.</p>
<p>Still, sometimes it's nice just to take a look at some little dogs having fun, and a dedicated dog park is a great step, especially if lots of employees were already bringing their dogs into work. I mean, just look at them frolic!</p>
<p>If you're wondering what Rare is currently working on, the studio is still hard at work with its piratical live-service game&nbsp;<em>Sea of Thieves</em>, and it's technically also still working on cel-shaded adventure game&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/everwild"><em>Everwild</em></a>, although news on that project has been relatively scant since <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-is-beautifully-serene-game-from-rare">its announcement</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/25/24205963/elgato-stream-deck-plus-xlr-usb-dock-accessories<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Elgato is launching two new docks for its Stream Deck Plus device that can add XLR microphone support or a USB hub. The Stream Deck Plus originally <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23517751/elgato-stream-deck-plus-review">launched in 2022</a> with the usual Stream Deck buttons, a new LCD display, and additional knobs, but these docks extend the functionality even further.</p><p>The <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.elgato.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Fxlr-dock-stream-deck-plus">$119.99 XLR Dock</a> slots into the rear of the Stream Deck Plus and delivers up to 75dB of gain, enough to power Shure’s popular SM7B microphone. Just like Elgato’s dedicated Wave XLR, it even has a headphone jack for zero latency monitoring. </p><p>The XLR Dock means you only need a single USB cable routing to your laptop or PC and a single device instead of having to combine an XLR interface and Stream Deck. The knobs on the Stream Deck Plus can control the microphone, and there are plenty of ways to assign mute switches and more on the main Stream Deck buttons, too.</p><div><figcaption><em>The rear of the XLR Dock for the Stream Deck Plus.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Elgato</cite></p></div><div><figcaption><em>Elgato’s USB Hub for the Stream Deck Plus.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Elgato</cite></p></div><p>If you don’t have an XLR microphone, then Elgato is also launching a <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.elgato.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Fusb-hub-stream-deck-plus">$59.99 USB Hub</a> that plugs into the back of the Stream Deck Plus. It includes two USB-C ports, two USB-A ports, and an SD or microSD card reader at the side. All four USB ports will deliver up to 5Gb/s of data transfers, so unfortunately, there are no Thunderbolt speeds here. </p><p>There is also a 65-watt uplink port that provides enough power to charge your laptop if you connect this hub to an external USB-C power supply. In fact, Elgato recommends using a USB-C power supply with this hub: “Most systems are unable to power both Stream Deck Plus and USB Hub on their own, without causing performance issues. For best results, keep USB Hub connected to a power supply at all times.”</p><p>Both the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.elgato.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Fxlr-dock-stream-deck-plus">XLR Dock</a> and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.elgato.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Fusb-hub-stream-deck-plus">USB Hub</a> are available immediately from Elgato’s web store.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stalker-2">S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a>, the beautifully grotty sci-fi shooter sequel from Ukrainian studio GSC Game World, has been delayed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2-release-date-pushed-back-again-to-september-2024-to-fix-technical-imperfections">once again</a>. It’s a relatively good-spirited delay, though: first off, it’s not <em>that</em> long, with the previously planned September 5th launch pushed back just a few weeks to November 20th. There’s also clever little in-universe announcement video (one which gives the fourth wall a study kick on its way out), and an accompanying promise of a meaty "developer deep dive video", set to reveal much more of the game’s radioactive hellscape on August 12th.</p>

</span>
<span data-position="1"></span></p><p>"We know you might be tired of waiting, and we truly appreciate your patience", reads the English-language announcement post on <a href="https://x.com/stalker_thegame/status/1816435698007699568">Xitter</a>. "These two additional months will give us the chance to fix more "unexpected anomalies" (or simply "bugs", as you call them)".</p>
<p>To sate our appetites for schlepping through an overgrown Chernobyl Exclusion Zone and firing rusty AKs at psychic beasts, the deep dive video will include "exclusive interviews, lots of new footage, and a full video walkthrough of one of the game quests". Neat! When August 12th comes it’ll release on "Xbox media channels", which I assume means, like, YouTube, and not some kind of terrestrial TV channel I’ve not heard of where Master Chief presents the 6 'o' clock news.</p>
<p>In all seriousness, I’ve been well up for more S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 for ages. I adore the atmosphere of the older S.T.A.L.K.E.R.s, but have always bounced off their hardcore Eurojank, so the notion of having the same world built with updated production values is a intensely compelling one. You can’t argue with taking more time to polish, either – even if it does mean that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6o6D_a3PAHw">"Final Release Date" trailer</a> didn’t age particularly well, naming-wise.</p>
<p>GSC have also been forced to deal with far worse than a handful of software bugs. Staff from the Kyiv-based studio were relocated to Prague in the wake of Russia’s 2022 invasion, and early S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 development materials have been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2-test-footage-has-leaked-online-after-a-year-and-a-half-of-hacker-attacks">stolen and released</a> by apparent Russian hacking groups. Also in 2022, designer Volodymyr Yezhov, who had previously worked on the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/s-t-a-l-k-e-r-shadow-of-chernobyl">S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/s-t-a-l-k-e-r-clear-sky">S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/s-t-a-l-k-e-r-call-of-pripyat">S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat</a>, was <a href="https://twitter.com/DefenceU/status/1607400845246664704">killed while defending the city of Bakhmut</a> as a volunteer soldier.</p>

The long-awaited post-apocalyptic shooter was slated to arrive on September 5 but will now launch on November 20 to give developer GSC Game World more time to address technical issues.</p>

<p>Additionally, the studio announced it will release its first-ever Developer Deep Dive video to give a comprehensive behind-the-scenes look at the game. The video will feature new gameplay footage, overviews of its world and locations, a full walkthrough of a story quest, and developer interviews. It is being made in collaboration with Xbox and will premiere on August 12.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vxeGyXSM5Pc" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>The delay marks another bump in the road for S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl. It was <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/xbox-games-showcase/2020/07/23/stalker-2-is-coming-to-xbox-series-x">formally unveiled in 2020</a> after years of teases at the Xbox Games Showcase but has hit snags along the way, including garnering backlash for now-canceled <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2021/12/15/stalker-2-developer-announces-auction-for-metahuman-nft-that-will-appear-as-in-game-npc">plans for NFT implementation</a>. The biggest disruption was <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/03/03/gsc-game-world-puts-stalker-2-development-on-sidelines-amidst-ongoing-ukraine-conflict">Russia’s invasion of Ukraine</a>, where GSC Game World is based, which upended development and forced the staff to relocate to Prague, Czech Republic (though some team members actively fought and <a href="https://gamerant.com/stalker-developer-killed-ukraine-vladimir-fresh-yezhov/">sadly perished </a>in the war). Despite all of this, the game has managed to come together, and we even played it during <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/sgf-2024/2024/06/09/the-coolest-games-we-played-at-summer-game-fest-2024-and-more">Summer Game Fest</a> this year.</p>

<p>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl launches on November 20 for Xbox Series X/S and PC. It will launch day one on Xbox Game Pass. If nothing else, this delay gives players more time to catch up with the <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/xbox-partner-preview/2024/03/06/original-stalker-legends-of-the-zone-trilogy-is-available-on-xbox">Xbox re-release of the original games</a> that arrived earlier this year.&nbsp;</p>

A <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2580190/PlayStationVR2_App/">Steam app for Sony's PlayStation VR2</a> headset is due for release on 6th August.

</p>
<p>
The free, official app will allow Steam users to play games on the virtual reality headset, as well as use the PlayStation VR2 Sense controllers.
</p>
<p>
Use of the app will also require the PC adapter, which was unveiled in June and will release on 7th August.

<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-testing-ps-vr2-compatibility-with-pc">PSVR2 compatibility with PC was announced by Sony earlier this year</a>, though a specific release date wasn't given at the time.
</p>
<p>
Then, in May, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-vr2-unannounced-pc-adapter-spotted">PC adapter was certified in South Korea</a>, allowing the headset to plug directly into a PC. This was <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/03/playstation-vr2-players-can-access-games-on-pc-with-adapter-starting-on-august-7/">revealed on the PlayStation Blog</a> in June, with a 7th August release for support.
</p>
<p>
The minimum PC requirements, as per both Steam and the PS Blog, are as follows:
</p>
<table data-mobile-mode="scroll">
<tbody><tr>
<td>Operating system</td>
<td>Windows 10 64-bit / Windows 11 64-bit</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Processor</td>
<td>Intel Core i5-7600 / AMD Ryzen 3 3100 (Zen 2 or later architecture is required)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>RAM / memory</td>
<td>8 GB or more</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>GPU / graphics card</td>
<td><ul>
<li>NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 or later (Turing or later architecture is required)</li>
<li>NVIDIA RTX series</li>
<li>AMD Radeon RX 5500XT or later / AMD Radeon RX 6500XT or later</li>
</ul>

(For the best performance, we recommend that you use an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 or later or AMD Radeon RX 6600XT or later graphics card)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>DisplayPort</td>
<td>DisplayPort 1.4 (must have a standard DisplayPort or Mini DisplayPort output port)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>USB</td>
<td>Direct connection only</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bluetooth</td>
<td>Bluetooth 4.0 or later</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>
Perhaps the biggest draw to using PSVR2 on PC is to play Valve's own <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/half-life-alyx-review-a-legend-returns-in-elegant-form">Half-Life: Alyx</a>, which has become somewhat legendary since its release in 2020.

</p>
<p>
Earlier in March, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-vr2-production-paused-as-stock-piles-up-report">Sony reportedly paused production</a> of its latest VR headset due to unsold stock piling up.

</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-hard-to-stay-excited-about-the-playstation-vr2-if-even-astro-bot-wont-wear-one">Eurogamer's VR expert Ian Higton has also bemoaned the lack of support from Sony</a> for the PS VR2, particularly as the forthcoming Astro Bot is a flat screen game.

(It’s worth noting that Parametrix insures companies against such downtime losses, so it’s in their interests to highlight such scale.)</p><p>Of course, even if companies are able to recover losses through insurance, the insurers are going to want their money back too. We’ve reached out to Crowdstrike to ask for their thoughts on the reaction to the $10 coupons, and what plans the firm has in place for customer compensation.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a new <a href="https://press.crytek.com/venture-deep-into-mammons-gulch-crytek-reveals-hunt-showdown-1896-entering-a-whole-new-era-of-hunt-in-the-rocky-mountains-of-colorado-launching-15th-august" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">press release</a> and trailer, Crytek confirmed that Hunt: Showdown 1896 will launch on August 15, 2024, including a “whole new experience.”</p>



<p>Crytek revealed that 1896 will be “the next chapter of Hunt.” It features a brand-new Mammon’s Gulch biome set in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, adding more verticality. </p>



<p>Given the title, it makes sense that time will also “leap forward.” Further, the developers call Mammon’s Gulch “the first map,” implying Crytek could add more maps later on. </p>



<p>Following launch, Crytek also stated that fans will get “overhauled and restored” original maps. It did not offer a concrete release date for those updates. Fans got a look at Mammon’s Gulch with a new trailer, though it did not reveal gameplay.</p>

<p>Hunt: Showdown 1896 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hunt-showdown-1896-gets-esrb-rating-possibly-for-next-gen-upgrade/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got an ESRB rating</a> just last week, teasing the big next-gen update. However, Crytek did not confirm any new content at the time. </p>



<p>Today, the developer revealed that Mammon’s Gulch will add 16 unique compounds, “torched towns”, mines with untold horrors, and new threats. It will also introduce a “host of new vantage points,” along with “lush forests and soaring hilltops.”</p>



<p>With CRYENGINE 5.11, fans cannot play the original Hunt: Showdown on last-gen consoles <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hunt-showdown-ps4-xbox-august/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">past August 15, 2024</a>. </p>



<p>Today’s press release reminds fans that all console players can get an automatic next-gen upgrade at no cost. It will also retain past purchases and progress.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/world-of-warcraft-devs-form-blizzards-first-wall-to-wall-union.936495/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/world-of-warcraft-blizzard-union<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A group of&nbsp;<em>World of Warcraft&nbsp;</em>developers at Blizzard have banded together to create the studio's first wall-to-wall union, which comprises workers from across the QA, art, and sound departments, plus more.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<em>World of Warcraft&nbsp;</em>Gamemaker's Guild is the first union at Blizzard to consist of workers from several different departments, and as well as the aforementioned departments, it also includes workers from Blizzard's design, engineering, and production divisions.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/WoWGG_CWA/status/1816194652539871269" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a> announcing the union's formation, the Gamemaker's Guild says it's standing for a "democratized workplace" and that at a "crucial moment in games", the union "stand[s] together as one".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/world-of-warcraft-devs-unionize-the-war-within.jpg?itok=PBdN7TkW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/world-of-warcraft-devs-unionize-the-war-within.jpg?itok=uF2h9PuG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>World of Warcraft&nbsp;</em>developers have formed Blizzard's first wall-to-wall union.</figcaption></figure><p>This union was formed in conjunction with the Communications Workers of America union, and <a href="https://x.com/CWAUnion/status/1816203069463617712" rel="noopener" target="_blank">per the CWA</a>, the new union's formation means that more than 1,750 workers across Microsoft's various gaming divisions are now unionized.</p>
<p>Speaking <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/24/24205366/world-of-warcraft-developers-form-union-blizzard-entertainment" rel="noopener" target="_blank">to The Verge</a>, Blizzard employees Kathryn Friesen and Paul Cox explained why the union was formed, and it turns out the desire to create the union came from one of Blizzard's core values, namely "every voice matters".</p>
<p>Friesen says that&nbsp;<em>World of Warcraft&nbsp;</em>characters genuinely care about each other and the game, and that this spurs them on to "stand together to fight for collective bargaining rights".</p>
<p>Cox, meanwhile, points to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/california-expands-activision-blizzard-lawsuit">lawsuit brought against Blizzard</a> by the state of California over discrimination claims made against the studio. Cox says Blizzard's responses felt "corporate", which led Blizzard employees to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/activision-blizzard-employees-walk-out-after-new-explosive-allegations">walk out en masse</a>, kicking off efforts to unionize across the studio.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/world-of-warcraft-union-the-war-within.jpg?itok=_6lu591U 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/world-of-warcraft-union-the-war-within.jpg?itok=cXyGVuYs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>World of Warcraft</em>'s tenth expansion is due to launch in August.</figcaption></figure><p>Blizzard's&nbsp;<em>World of Warcraft&nbsp;</em>devs aren't the first to unionize at Activision Blizzard; others include&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/raven-software-is-unionizing-as-game-workers-alliance"><em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>developer Raven Software</a>, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/activision-blizzard-albany-qa-workers-forming-union">QA workers at Activision Blizzard Albany</a>.</p>
<p>Reportedly, employees' attempts to unionize haven't been met with the fondest of responses by Activision Blizzard's management; one internal email supposedly urged employees to engage in "active, transparent dialogue between leaders and employees" rather than "simply signing an electronic form offered to you by CWA".</p>
<p>The Blizzard Albany union <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/activision-blizzard-accused-of-trying-to-stifle-albany-union">subsequently accused</a> Activision Blizzard of trying to mount a "futile" effort to engage in "union-busting", a concern that Activision's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/activision-blizzard-fights-to-delay-union-vote-tabulation">later move to delay a union vote tabulation</a> certainly did nothing to alleviate.</p>
<p>It looks like one thing is for sure, at any rate; efforts to unionize on the part of gaming industry employees aren't going to stop any time soon. For what it's worth, a Microsoft spokesperson told The Verge that the company intends to "engage in good faith negotiations" with the CWA going forward, so that's encouraging, at any rate.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/fallout-london-is-now-available-for-download/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fallout-london-is-now-available-for-download.936492/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/fallout-london-is-now-available-for-download/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The players were right. The cryptic post in the Discord server was precisely what it said on the tin, and now the expansion-sized mod for Fallout 4 has officially been released on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/fallout_london" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GOG.com</a>, available for players to install. This mod is free to install and play through Fallout 4; players only need to install it from the GOG mod launcher. In addition, players must ensure that their version doesn't have the next-gen update installed. Otherwise, the mod will be incompatible.</p>
<p>This immense expansion-sized mod has been in development by Team FOLON for many years, and the release date has finally come. Fallout: London is available globally for everyone to install. The only people who won't be able to participate are console players and those who own the game on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/gog-confirms-fallout-london-wont-be-playable-through-epic-games-store-versions-of-fallout-4/">Epic Games Store</a>. However, if you are desperate to get stuck, Fallout 4 is 60% off, available on GOG.com, where the mod will be completely compatible.</p>
<p>This fan-made project has been in the works for a lengthy five years, with players being tided over with the release of the Fallout show and the next-gen update for Fallout 4, to name a few things. Because Fallout: London is so massive, most popular mod sites could not host the mod, with GOG.com stepping up to shoulder the burden, even allowing users to use a custom launcher.</p>
<p>For those wanting to get stuck in and download Fallout: London, you'll need to make sure you own Fallout 4: Game of the Year Edition on GOG.com or through Steam.</p>
<p>The installation process for Fallout: London is also relatively simple. For those downloading it via GOG.com, all you need to do is install it via GOG GALAXY and disable cloud saves. Make sure to follow the instructions given via the launcher, and you'll be able to get stuck. As a disclaimer, Team FOLON has also mentioned that it is crucial to disable cloud saves, as Fallout: London will make irreversible changes to the game files, which can stop Fallout 4 from working correctly.</p>
<p>Fallout: London is a jam-packed mod with over 200 new quests to get stuck into and 20 factions trying to gain power to rule over the city. To be able to download Fallout: London, you'll need to have at least 65 GB of space available for the mod, not including the space required for Fallout 4: Game of the Year edition.</p>
<p>Already, Fallout: London is highly reviewed on GOG.com, with an overall rating of 4.6 stars out of 5. This is incredibly positive for Team FOLON, which has dedicated a great deal of time to making this mod and bringing it to Fallout fans completely free.</p>

<p>AMD has announced that its next-gen Ryzen 9000 series CPUs have been delayed until August. The news comes just days before it was set to release to consumers amid reports that reviews had yet to receive their processors.</p>



<p>In a statement posted by AMD, the company says that initial units “did not meet our full quality expectations” during final checks. This led to the decision to delay until next month.</p>



<p>“Out of an abundance of caution and to maintain the highest quality experiences for every Ryzen user, we are working with our channel partners to replace the initial production units with fresh units,” the company said.</p>



<p>With fixes needed, AMD has announced that the Ryzen 7 9700X and Ryzen 5 9600X processors will now release on August 8. The higher-end Ryzen 9 9950X and  Ryzen 9 9900X CPUs will go on sale starting August 15.</p>



<p>“We pride ourselves in providing a high-quality experience for every Ryzen user, and we look forward to our fans having a great experience with the new Ryzen 9000 series,” they said.</p>

<p>Does AMD announcing that its Ryzen 9000 series processors have been delayed impact your decision to buy one at all?

<p>As spotted <a href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/psvr-2-app-suddenly-appears-on-steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by TechRadar</a>, a new PlayStation VR2 app is now listed on Steam with a release date slated for August 6, 2024.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2580190/PlayStationVR2_App/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam page</a> explains that fans can use the app to play VR games and apps on Steam with a PlayStation VR2 headset and Sense controllers.</p>



<p>Players will need the headset, Sense controllers with Bluetooth connection, and the PlayStation VR2 PC adapter. PlayStation <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-vr2-pc-adapter-is-coming-august-7-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously announced</a> the PC adapter will launch the same week on August 7, 2024. It will have an estimated retail price of $59.99.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Players will need to set up the PS VR2 on PC, and update firmware for the headset and controllers. PlayStation users can also adjust settings for their PS VR2 “from the SteamVR dashboard, including setting your play area and screen brightness.”</p>



<p>Users will also need to keep the PlayStation VR2 App installed on their PC after setup to keep using VR games and apps. The PC adapter itself also has its own requirements, such as DisplayPort 1.4 compatibility and 8 GB of RAM.</p>



<p>PlayStation also continues to push towards PC support with new ports for popular video games. Ghost of Tsushima became the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ghost-of-tsushima-was-the-best-selling-game-in-the-us-in-may-2024/">best-selling game in the US</a> in May 2024, following its PC release. </p>

With a mix of classic arcade and console mechanics, players will battle against mutated victims and machines, dodge bullet barrages, and crush bosses in nine levels of gore-ific brutality. As Vadim, fight back against The Meat and stop the terrors spawned from scientist Yuri Markov’s experiments on the Moon.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Multi-phase Boss Fights</strong> – <em>Iron Meat</em> pays homage to classic run-and-gun titles from the past, with intense boss fights fixed into multiple phases. With three difficulty settings to choose from, players can put their skills to the test, where a higher difficulty is rewarded with an even more challenging boss battle.</li><li><strong><a title="Genres > Multiplayer [351 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer">Multiplayer</a> Couch Cooperative Play</strong> – Who says you have to take on The Meat invasion alone? With two-player couch <a title="Genres > Co-Op [186 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative</a> play, you can grab a buddy to leave a trail of bloody, Meat-infected corpses together! It’s double the firepower, double the carnage, and double the MEAT!</li><li><strong>Over 30 Unlockable Skins</strong> – You don’t have to be a soldier to fight against The Meat. Hell, you don’t even have to be a HUMAN to do so! With over 30 unlockable skins to choose from, players can customize their character the way they want. Each skin comes with interchangeable parts, allowing for greater customization with mixing and matching. Want a shark head on a robot body with dinosaur feet? DONE. Maybe a half human, half doggo? YOU BET! Or how about a cowboy with a tail and demon wings? Hmm…YEP!</li></ul><!-- AD: content -->

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-delayed-once-again-november<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GSC Game World has announced another&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>delay, with the long-awaited post-apocalyptic FPS now set to arrive later this fall.</p>
<p>The new&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>release date is November 20th, per a press release. This will, according to GSC Game World, give the game's developers the time to "address technical issues" and bring the final&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>release "closer to the experience that the fans expect".</p>
<p>GSC game director Yevhen Grygorovych says that although he knows players are "tired of waiting", the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-release-date-revealed-and-pre-orders-available-now">two extra months</a> will give the team the chance to fix more "unexpected anomalies" (hem, hem).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stalker-2-delayed-again-heights.jpg?itok=nN80DaRp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stalker-2-delayed-again-heights.jpg?itok=AU_7r0Q- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>"Sorry, Stalker, but it's going to be a while before you can play&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>."</figcaption></figure><p>It's not all bad news, though; on August 12th, the "first ever Developer Deep Dive for&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>" will air, featuring interviews with staff members, behind-the-scenes looks at the development process, and "lots of new footage".</p>
<p>You'll also get a full video walkthrough of one of&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>'s story quests, so you should be able to get a good idea of what the game will play like on the ground, so to speak.</p>
<p><em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>has been a very long time coming indeed. It's been in development in one form or another since at least 2010, but the game in its current form was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-heart-of-chernobyl-release-date-announced">introduced at E3 2021</a> and was set to release in April 2022.</p>
<p>Numerous delays then followed, with the game being pushed back <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/post-apocalyptic-shooter-stalker-2-delayed-until-december">first to December</a>, then <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-sequel-has-been-pushed-to-next-year">to 2023</a>, and eventually landing on a release date of September 5th, at least until today.</p>

<p>When&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>does arrive, GSC Game World is promising an "epic nonlinear story" that takes place in a "seamless open world" full of post-apocalyptic sights to see.</p>
<p>You'll fight a range of different mutants, each with "different behavior models", and you'll take advantage of "hundreds of weapon combinations" in order to do so.</p>
<p><em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>launches on November 20th for PC and Xbox Series X|S. If you want to know what kind of shape the game is in right now, be sure to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-preview-get-in-zone">check out our preview</a>!</p>

            <p>Yet again, some good food. Following the news earlier this week that<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bethesda-game-studios-developers-ecstatic-to-announce-a-241-strong-wall-to-wall-union"> 241 Bethesda Games Studios staffers</a> had formed what was at the time the biggest wall-to-wall under Microsoft, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/24/24205366/world-of-warcraft-developers-form-union-blizzard-entertainment">The Verge</a> reports that over 500 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/world-of-warcraft">World Of Warcraft</a> developers have voted to form their own union, alongside the Communication Workers of America (CWA).</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The World Of Warcraft GameMakers Guild consists of workers from every department - hence 'wall-to-wall' - including designers, engineers, artists, and producers, across offices in California and Massachusetts. It’s now the second-largest union at Microsoft overall, after 600 Activision Blizzard QA workers<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/8/24094602/activision-blizzard-qa-workers-unionizing-microsoft"> formed a union</a> in March, despite the publisher’s history of attempting to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/activision-blizzard-appeal-against-blizzard-albany-qa-union-vote-rejected">shoot down similar efforts</a>.</p>
<p>WOW quest designer Kathryn Friesen told The Verge "You can tell just by talking to people how much they care about one another and the work that they do in the game. I think that that’s where [the unionisation effort] comes from, the desire to stand together to fight for collective bargaining rights at the table."</p>
<p>Senior quest designer Paul Cox told The Verge that staff were encouraged by the company’s response to being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/activision-blizzard-sued-by-california-over-alleged-culture-of-sexual-harassment-and-discrimination">sued by the State of California</a> in 2021, with walkouts leading to eventual unionisation. “A lot of the early responses felt very corporate and didn’t feel like they reflected the values that, as a company, we said we upheld.”</p>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023%E2%80%932024_video_game_industry_layoffs">an estimated</a> 10,000 people lost their jobs due to games industry layoffs and closures. From January to June of 2024, that number is around 10,800 already. God fucking speed, you beautiful people who make all our lives more fun and interesting. Let’s keep up the momentum.</p>

            <p>
Monster Train, the acclaimed roguelike deckbuilder from developer Shiny Shoe, is making its way to PlayStation 5 today, 25th July, some four years after its original release.
</p>
<p>
Monster Train sees players attempting to restore Hell's inferno after it freezes over - a task requiring them to ride a train carrying a burning pyre deep into the heart of Hell.
</p>
<p>
At first glance, it's all a bit Slay the Spire, with branching pathways providing choices on how to progress and level up each run. But the proper fun comes in combat, where the real-time card battling sees players unleashing their hellish minions against the forces of heaven - gradually moving between multiple floors of the titular train as they try and defend the pyre on top to win.

<p>
As Eurogamer's Robert Purchese <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-train-brings-a-new-idea-to-a-genre-i-love">explained</a> in 2020, "The skill is... not only [in] surviving those rounds and stopping their fighters reaching the top, but scaling up your damage and survivability, via buffs (spells and the like), for when the boss arrives. When the Final Wave comes, things change. Instead of the usual routine of playing your cards, then everyone trading blows and a new round beginning, you enter Relentless Mode where characters on one row continue to trade blows with a boss, until either they are dead or the boss is."
</p>
<p>
Monster Train's PS5 release features over 280 cards, six unique monster clans, and 25 covenant levels - including everything introduced in the game's The Last Divinity paid expansion, which is bundled into this latest version. It also incorporates the multiplayer Hell Rush mode, which sees competitors battling against the clock in real-time to prove their demonic superiority.
</p>
<p>
And if a blast of infernal card battling sounds like exactly the kind of thing you're looking for, Monster Train's PlayStation release costs $24.99.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/arkham-horror-roleplaying-game-review-very-specific-but-good-gateway</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arkham-horror-the-roleplaying-game-review-a-gateway-for-new-players-to-ttrpg.936435/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/arkham-horror-roleplaying-game-review-very-specific-but-good-gateway<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's hard to get into any TTRPG if you don't have someone to hold your hand along the way. Picking up a ruleset for the first time and trying to steer a party of new players can be a daunting task but <em>Arkham Horror: The Roleplaying Game</em> starter set goes about it in the most logical way creating a positive to learn in environment.</p>
<p><em>Arkham Horror,</em> a franchise that fans of horror and board gaming might know from the <em>Arkham Horror </em>board game or <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="fb14a3b2-6d4a-4518-ad52-9d9652a61fa1" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/arkham-horror-card-game-review"><em>Arkham Horror The Card Game</em></a>, has finally taken steps towards a full Tabletop RPG with their release of the<em> Hungering Abyss</em> Starter Set.</p>
<h2>Building The Foundation Of Knowledge</h2>
<p><em>Arkham Horror: The Roleplaying Game Hungering Abyss</em> puts players into the shoes of one of five investigators in the town of Arkham, Massachusetts. From the hardboiled detective investigating missing persons, to the high school track and field star whose friend has gone missing everyone has noticed things going on and has their own leads to provide.</p>
<p>From this launch point players will get to piece together the mysteries of the town, fight off evil cult members, and stop the quaint town for descending into hell.</p>

<p>The campaign for <em>Arkham Horror: The Roleplaying Game</em> was laid out in a unique way that gameplay mechanics were only introduced just as they would become relevant. The first scene of the game, the introduction of the characters, is just prompts for them to interact with one another and a succinct list of what leads each player should be able to infer from their background.</p>
<p>Once characters had met each other and established leads a loud noise in the cellar would alert them to the presence of monsters. As you turn the page to reach the first combat encounter you're met with detailed instructions of what a Structured Scene is (one where the Investigators act, and then the Game Master act) and each of the different actions you can take.</p>
<p>It's in this way that the GM isn't just given every single piece of information of how to run the game without the context of where or when they'd apply, instead the GM is learning as the players encounter scenarios. It's not just 'tell', and it's not as daunting as 'show', but is a very educational 'tell and then show.'</p>

<p>In our game, I particularly enjoyed this because as I was trying to explain to players how using dice from their Character Dossier's would affect the game we could demonstrate on the board, and even on the creature cards how things would be affected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My table was a mix of those who had been playing TTRPG like <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3579fb91-ffa9-4c99-a750-de9f92ba642f" href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> for 40+ years, and another who was having their first experience playing a TTRPG and it was an incredibly positive experience for everyone.</p>
<h2>Action Economy In Dice</h2>
<p>The main engine that drives what you character can do, whether you're in a Narrative Scene (free roleplaying) or in a Structured Scene, is your D6 which work as action points as well as a health tracker.</p>
<p>A healthy character has 6 dice at their disposal, they can use one to perform a simple action like moving or interacting with items, or they can roll one or more to perform a complex action like aiding an ally or making a melee attack with the number on the dice representing a success or failure. Taking damage reduces your pool of dice so it also hinders how many actions you can take.</p>
<p>Doubling down on the horror and uncomfortability of the characters in this world the fastest way to regain all of your health is to suffer an injury, it's a trade-off where you get a permanent effect against your character but can go back to acting. Too many injuries can lead to death though...</p>

<p>In Structured scenes the Investigators turn is over when all players have exhausted their dice, or have opted to pass with some remaining in case they wish to make a reaction. This allows for a party to be collaborative and act as a group, but in any order individually allowing for some fun synergies to happen.</p>
<p>For the GM this level of collaboration does make it harder to be as impactful with any NPC they are running, especially when a number of player abilities have a chance to nearly one-shot the most common creature in the box.</p>
<p>Narrative Scenes also restrict players' actions to how many dice they have available to them. Like in combat, the dice are used up as they perform actions but now when the party has used up their actions they regain them and the story progresses forward in time.</p>
<p>This is helpful for a GM if events are timely, such as a ritual occurring that night, players will know they can only do so much before they need to take action. It's also a good gameplay mechanic to encourage players who might not have a strong voice at the table to speak up.</p>

<p>Proactive players might have used up all of their actions, but a quiet player could still have five dice available to them in their pool. It's also clear for the GM who they can prompt for next steps to take promoting everyone being included.</p>
<h2>What To Play After <em>Arkham Horror: The Roleplaying Game</em>?</h2>
<p>Due to the nature of this being such a heavily curated learning experience it's important to make the distinction that this Starter Set works for this adventure and this adventure alone. You won't find any additional character creation information, prompts for a GM to run another adventure, or items that won't get used immediately in this campaign.</p>
<p>If you're interested in creating your own <em>Arkham Horror: The Roleplaying Game</em> adventure then you may need to wait for additional resources. <em>Hungering Abyss</em> creates a familiar experience to those of the <em>EXIT: The Room</em> escape-room-in-a-box adventures.</p>
<p>Players will have fun over the 6-8 hour experience following the path of the cult, but after that you'll need an entirely new group if you want to play it again.</p>
<p>The upside of the box being so specifically tailored to the adventure isn't just that the game can teach you how to play as you're playing it, but it means that the pieces you'll find in the box include (almost) everything you could need.</p>
<h2>Everything In The <em>Arkham Horror: The Roleplaying Game Box</em></h2>
<p>Inside the box the GM will find the expected pieces like a GM board, Adventure Book, and Character Dossier, but there are also tokens with artwork specific for every encounter in the adventure and double sided maps for each location.</p>

<p>If a character is searching a room and comes across a shotgun then there's an item card to present to your player.</p>
<p>Players can also get further immersed by the different handouts provided, including autopsy and police documents, as well as an encoded message to decipher and multiple sliding block puzzles.</p>
<p>A lot of Starter Kits say they have everything in the box for you to run a session but this is one of the first I've seen to really follow through on that…. Well, almost.</p>
<h2>Some Dice Included</h2>
<p>Each character playing, at full health, requires six dice placed on their character sheet to indicate how many action points they have remaining, let alone d6 for the different NPC that the GM is running. Included in this box is only enough for two players, leaving out the majority of the table.</p>

<p>You could easily get around this by sourcing six-sided dice from elsewhere (like your dice hoarding wife) or other board games you may already own. There are also more than enough spare tokens included in the game to create a proxy but you won't be able to set it up as the adventure book describes.</p>
<h2><em>Arkham Horror: The Roleplaying Game</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>As a way to ease players into the world of <em>Arkham Horror</em> as well as to introduce a new TTRPG I think the <em>Hungering Abyss</em> Starter Set does an incredible job. What's even more impressible than that I think Hungering Abyss has managed to create a Starter Set that new GM and players alike can use to learn about playing TTRPGs in general.</p>
<p>While anyone can pick up any TTRPG and begin playing it's normally an easier experience if someone who is familiar with the game is leading the story. In Arhkam Horror's building block 'show and tell' style of building upon gameplay as the story progresses it offers GMs and players alike the best way to learn how to play the game.</p>
<p>Fans of TTRPG will get to have an enjoyable experience throwing too many d6 across the table trying to crush a cult and new players will get eased into the experience.</p>
<p>If you're looking for the basis to create your own adventures or continue the adventure past what's in the box though you're going to be out of luck. This adventure is so specifically tailored to the experience once you've played it then it's worth keeping around for a new group, or could be passed on to another group you know of.</p>

<h2>Review Summary</h2>

<p>
Arkham Horror: The Roleplaying Game Hungering Abyss is the perfect idea behind a one-shot in a box aimed at new players. With easy to learn mechanics and a well thought process for teaching players and GMs the game there's no way this game won't run smooth. The only downside is it's 'one and done' nature.

Fail to respond to immediate threats and invest Runes poorly, and you’re not really gonna get very far. And as someone whose anxiety centers around not being timely with my responsibilities and failing to prepare for the future, who agonizes over decisions I made 10 years ago, the prospect of playing <em>Elden Ring</em> for any serious amount of time scared me. </p><p>But the spark was lit after I <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/flintlock-game-review-soulslike-ashen-difficult-1851595559&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/flintlock-game-review-soulslike-ashen-difficult-1851595559">finished <em>Flintlock</em></a></span>. Though it doesn’t put up the toughest of challenges, it did remind me of the fun of the Soulslike’s core loop. It also made me feel better prepared for something like <em>Elden Ring</em>. And to be honest, given my anxiety, I started to think a hobby that I took my time with, slowly chipping away at on a path to unlikely victory, might be healthy for me.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/flintlock-game-review-soulslike-ashen-difficult-1851595559&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/flintlock-game-review-soulslike-ashen-difficult-1851595559"><em>Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn</em>: The <em>Kotaku</em> Review</a></span></p><p>I also chose <em>Elden Ring</em> because it allows me to do something I’m very fond of: Wander. Many have rightly said that <em>Elden Ring</em>’s open world structure makes the traditionally difficult format of the Soulslike easier as you take it at your pace and venture off to level up on lower-level monsters, and that’s true, but in the dozen or so hours I’ve put into the game recently, I’ve spent a lot of time intentionally wandering around, avoiding conflict. </p><figure id="" data-id="da605424756e26b3b3fc5a39b24c0a1c" data-recommend-id="image://da605424756e26b3b3fc5a39b24c0a1c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Tarnished chats with an unexpected guest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Tarnished chats with an unexpected guest." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="da605424756e26b3b3fc5a39b24c0a1c" data-recommend-id="image://da605424756e26b3b3fc5a39b24c0a1c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Tarnished chats with an unexpected guest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There’s a serenity to <em>Elden Ring</em>’s environment, with its bleak landscape punctuated by the imposing yet beautiful Erdtree, set to gentle, mournful strings that make up its ambient soundscape. Simply <em>existing </em>in this space, among the birds and other wildlife that too wander about, is appealing to me as the kind of “game” I sometimes like playing (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hellblade-2-senuas-saga-combat-fire-1851493666&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hellblade-2-senuas-saga-combat-fire-1851493666">I do love</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/still-wakes-the-deep-review-the-chinese-room-1851544587&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/still-wakes-the-deep-review-the-chinese-room-1851544587">a walking-sim</a></span>). </p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hellblade-2-senuas-saga-combat-fire-1851493666&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hellblade-2-senuas-saga-combat-fire-1851493666"><em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II</em>: The <em>Kotaku</em> Review</a></span></p><p>The wildlife also holds a position in the game’s ecosystem I envy: They, unlike me, aren’t destined to undertake the violent trial that is this game. I envy the rolling sheep, contemplative-looking eagles, frolicking springhares, and gentle deer. Theirs is an existence in this dark fantasy realm without inherent violence, and I won’t bring them into it regardless of what they’ll drop. So too do I give wolves and bears their space. So too do I relent when an enemy cowers in fear. Despite how violent <em>Elden Ring</em> gets, I see the challenge and the strife as an invitation to double down on my commitment to not imitate that where I needn’t. </p><p>In this way, <em>Elden Ring</em> has oddly become a refuge from the complications of my personal life. I find myself going here to “chill” as it were. But I’m still here to <em>finish</em> this game, and that means engaging in the trials of its combat. </p><p><em>Elden Ring</em>’s challenges, many of which may be initially tough, do have the effect of showing you something isn’t impossible, that you can come out of a struggle and succeed. As <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-expansion-review-1851545505&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-expansion-review-1851545505"><em>Kotaku</em>’s Alyssa Mercante said in her review of the game’s expansion</a></span>, it can bestow hope: “This is going to be hard, but I can do this.”</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-expansion-review-1851545505&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-expansion-review-1851545505"><em>Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree </em>Review: Massive, Menacing, And Magnificent</a></span></p><p>I resonate with that sentiment too. And in the face of <em>Elden Ring</em>’s challenges, I find myself also letting go. The challenge isn’t <em>my fault</em>. It’s just <em>what is</em>. I can’t beat myself up over it. I can’t blame myself. I’ll learn what I can from this challenge. I’ll continue to arrive and I’ll endeavor to be better next time. The worst of what faces me still sees me coming back, now knowing what I didn’t before. When I need space and time to recollect myself, learn from the challenge, I can go and wander among the wildlife again and stare out at the horizon. </p><figure id="" data-id="c06c044f0d2879e899de280646f56361" data-recommend-id="image://c06c044f0d2879e899de280646f56361" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Tarnished rides atop Torrent in the Lands Between." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Tarnished rides atop Torrent in the Lands Between." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c06c044f0d2879e899de280646f56361" data-recommend-id="image://c06c044f0d2879e899de280646f56361" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Tarnished rides atop Torrent in the Lands Between." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Elden Ring</em> has so far given me the time <em>away</em> from the stresses of my regular life and the torturous boss of doubt and anxiety that lurks in my own mind. It’s also teaching me the value of patience, of persistence, of acceptance of the way things simply are. I don’t expect to finish it any time soon, either. I’m taking my time with this game, because life so often won’t let me do that elsewhere. The Lands Between are proving to be a more forgiving and accepting place than I previously thought. And maybe other frightening places are, too.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Two new LEGO sets based on popular video game series have surfaced this week, including a <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/shadow-the-hedgehog-77000" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shadow the Hedgehog bust</a> and Super Mario World set. Both sets are expected to release on October 1, 2024. </p>



<p>The Shadow the Hedgehog bust will include over 700 pieces, with a price tag of $69.99. LEGO lists it as a set for adult builders, and it comes with a display stand and nameplate. </p>



<p>It also includes some neat easter eggs “including a Chaos Emerald and 3 Gold Rings, hidden in the build.” Fans can follow a digital version of the building instructions with the LEGO Builder app. </p>



<p>The Super Mario World set is unrelated to the popular and interactive “Adventures” product line. Instead, the new set emulates the 2D pixel art of the classic video game.</p>



<p>Although the official LEGO site doesn’t have pictures and details for the set up yet, those did surface <a href="https://jaysbrickblog.com/news/lego-71438-super-mario-world-mario-yoshi-is-a-16-bit-ode-to-the-super-nes-classic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via Jay’s Brick Blog</a>. Twitter user Wario64 also posted their set pictures on X.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>According to details on Jay’s Brick Blog, the “Super Mario World: Mario &amp; Yoshi” set features over 1200 pieces. Although the set is intended for display purposes, there is a small lever that makes Yoshi stick their tongue out.</p>



<p>These sets join a packed October release schedule, as LEGO only just announced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-lego-sets-coming-in-october-2024-pre-orders-now-open/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">real-world Fortnite sets</a> for October 2024 too. Those Fortnite sets are already available for pre-order.</p>
