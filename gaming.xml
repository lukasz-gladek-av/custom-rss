		<p>Paralives will not be entering early access this year as initially planned, with Paralives Studio announcing the decision to delay the release to May 25th, 2026. The delay comes after feedback from playtesters which convinced the development team the game is in a state to be sold yet, with issues including bugs in the live mode and a lack of activities for players to do in the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Paralives - Release Date Trailer (Early Access)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uvGPV6qQuQM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a statement, Alex Massé, the lead developer of Paralives said, <em>“Unfortunately, we had to make the difficult decision to delay the release. We are truly sorry for the last-minute announcement. After thoughtful consideration, we feel it’s best for the game and the community. This year, we ran many playtests with friends and fans, and we were confident that we could improve the game enough in time for December. In the lead-up to Early Access release, we broadened our playtests with a more varied playerbase, and the latest feedback we received made us realise the game isn’t up to the standard we wanted it to meet for release. Players enjoy the flexibility and the customization of the Paramaker and Build Mode. However, there are still impactful bugs in the Live Mode and a lack of activities to do in the town, which dampened the enjoyment of the players, and we feel it is necessary to work on these before delivering the product to the community.</em></p>
<p><em>I started this project wanting it to be a fresh and indie take on the doll-house life simulation genre, which had not been tackled by many game developers. I attribute this partly to the fact that a project like Paralives is a colossal task. Life sims are really 3 games in one: an advanced and flexible build mode, a greatly customizable character creator and a complex life simulation mode. Over the last 6 years of development, starting with 2-3 developers for the first years, to growing to an average team size of only 10 people, we had to alternate long stretches of development between these 3 parts of the game. We are so proud of what we have built, but now, we just need a bit more time to polish the simulation part of the game. This would ensure Paralives offers a great first experience when it launches, making players come back for every exciting free update and expansion that we will put out afterwards. The new Early Access release date is May 25, 2026. We have updated our detailed roadmap (paralives.com/roadmap) with what we will be improving over the coming months, with a focus on fixing important issues and improving the first-time user experience. This will ensure that more players will be happy with the state of the game at launch when comparing it to other great life simulation games that sparked everyone’s love for the genre.”</em></p>

<p>Paralives is a life simulation game that could challenge The Sims. It is one of the most followed games on Steam with over a million wishlists. In Paralives, players will be able to build their own homes, create characters, and develop bonds with the other characters that populate the world.</p>

      <div><p>Wizards of the Coast is expanding their partnership with TCGPlayer. The <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> publisher will work alongside the virtual card marketplace for exclusive content designed to engage the dedicated enthusiast community.</p>



<p>According to the press release, Wizards of the Coast's TCGPlayer partnership is expanding from something offered earlier this year: the introduction of WPN badges to eligible TCGPlayer storefronts.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tcgplayer-promo-logo.jpg?itok=ObQXZVMF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tcgplayer-promo-logo.jpg?itok=zzRzTYZO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Now, Wizards of the Coast will offer exclusive content to the TCGPlayer community. This includes exclusive previews, interviews with game designers, and exclusive reveals. For convenience, users can filter search results to discover any Magic: The Gathering products held exclusively in WPN-verified stores.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>TCGplayer is focused on innovating for our community, enhancing buyer and seller<br>
experiences, and offering the best selection across trading card games,” said Stephanie Mims,<br>
Senior Vice President, Seller Experience. “Being designated the preferred online marketplace<br>
for the WPN represents a milestone in our quest to be the most trusted trading card platform for<br>
Magic players and retailers.</p>

<p><br>
Our investment in local game stores and the Wizards Play Network is at the core of this<br>
initiative,” said Brian Trunk, Vice President of Wizards Commercial, Hobby and WPN at Wizards<br>
of the Coast. “By teaming up with TCGplayer, we’re not only giving players greater confidence<br>
in their purchases, but also empowering WPN retailers to thrive, reach new audiences, and<br>
continue building strong Magic communities.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>TCGPlayer is one of the largest virtual card retail platforms on the internet. The platform, acquired <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/ebay-enters-agreement-for-tcgplayer-acquisition" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">by eBay</a> in early 2023 for the sum of $295 million, has helped dedicated card game players and aspirational competitive players obtain the cards they want for their respective game. Be it <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/disney-lorcana" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Disney Lorcana</em></a>, or even the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/pokemon-trading-card-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Pokemon TCG</em></a>.</p>

<p>The platform recently came under fire due to it quickly shutting down an authentication center down in Syracuse. This was seen by the workers as an attempt to shut down the worker's union seeking better wages. This lead to a boycott starting in May 2025 before a new contract was renegotiated by the worker's union in June.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crystal-dynamics-layoffs-november-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tomb-raider-studio-crystal-dynamics-hit-by-layoffs-again.1353820/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>developer Crystal Dynamics has announced yet another round of layoffs across "various departments and projects", and the layoffs are apparently an attempt to "restructure the company and business".</p>

<p>In a post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/crystal-dynamics_today-weve-made-the-difficult-but-necessary-activity-7394805539140169729-lwXF/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>, Crystal Dynamics calls the decision to lay off "just under 30" employees a "difficult but necessary decision", and blames the evolving "realities of the industry" for the need to let more team members go.</p>

<p>The studio says that the layoffs are an attempt to "optimize the continued development of [its] flagship&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>game", in addition to "shaping the rest of the studio to make new games for the future".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider-crystal-dynamics.jpg?itok=_PCW5_St 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider-crystal-dynamics.jpg?itok=XMhUvaNA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Tomb Raider</em>'s Crystal Dynamics is laying off yet more staff.</figcaption></figure><p>This is the third time that Crystal Dynamics has engaged in layoffs this year; it first laid off a round of employees in March, then <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crystal-dynamics-layoffs" rel="nofollow">again in August</a> following the cancellation of Xbox's&nbsp;<em>Perfect Dark&nbsp;</em>reboot (and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow">shuttering of the studio</a> chiefly responsible for making it).</p>

<p>At the time of August's layoffs, Crystal Dynamics reassured fans that&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider</em>'s development was "unaffected" by the decision. Technically, no such reassurance has been offered for this latest wave of redundancies.</p>

<p>It's also worth noting that the next game in the&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>series has yet to be announced; there's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/amazon-tomb-raider-lara-croft" rel="nofollow">an Amazon series</a> headed up by&nbsp;<em>Fleabag</em>'s Phoebe Waller-Bridge in the works, but that's the only piece of genuinely new&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>media fans have to cling to for now.</p>

<p>As far as we know, the as-yet-unrevealed&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>title is the only thing on which Crystal Dynamics is actively working, so I'd imagine there's quite a lot of pressure within the studio to deliver on this one (although what exactly "this one" is, we don't yet know).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/crystal-dynamics-layoffs-avengers.jpg?itok=8V8wm3qe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/crystal-dynamics-layoffs-avengers.jpg?itok=tkJ58oB2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Crystal Dynamics' last major project before&nbsp;the next&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>game was 2020's ill-fated&nbsp;<em>Marvel's Avengers</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>We still don't have anything approaching an idea of when a new&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>game might be revealed, either; Crystal Dynamics simply says it "look[s] forward to sharing the team's amazing new work with the world in the future". Until then, stay tuned for more.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/misery-steam-return</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/misery-returns-to-steam-following-stalker-2-devs-dmca-claim.1353817/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><i>Misery&nbsp;</i>developer Platypus Entertainment has announced that the game has made a return to Steam, following a DMCA claim that was issued by&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>developer GSC Game World.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2119830/view/809086547679772954" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> on Steam, the studio says that it has "resolved" the "misunderstanding" it had with GSC Game World, following a conversation with one of the Ukrainian developer's lawyers.</p>

<p>Specifically, Platypus makes reference to two issues it says were "not mentioned in the DMCA claim" and that the studio wasn't aware of. Both issues have now been resolved, and it seems like that's what has allowed&nbsp;<em>Misery&nbsp;</em>to be reinstated on Steam.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/misery-steam-return-room.jpg?itok=RcpZB2U2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/misery-steam-return-room.jpg?itok=SDTTJ7N1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Misery&nbsp;</em>is now back on Steam for your enjoyment.</figcaption></figure><p>The first issue revolved around a "helicopter model in the files" of&nbsp;<em>Misery</em>. Platypus says the game is "an evolution of education, non-commercial projects", and that the model, which has now been removed, "was unintentionally left in [<em>Misery</em>''s] resources as a legacy leftover".</p>

<p>Platypus goes on to say that the helicopter model in question can't be seen anywhere in&nbsp;<em>Misery&nbsp;</em>itself, but the studio doesn't actually state exactly where it got the model from. Still, this appears to be one of the key points of contention for GSC Game World.</p>

<p>The second point pertains to some of the guitar-based folk songs being played in&nbsp;<em>Misery</em>. Platypus says that for the&nbsp;<em>Stalker&nbsp;</em>games, GSC Game World "used popular folk songs" for ambient guitar-playing NPCs, and that someone affiliated with Platypus "wrote original covers of some of these songs".</p>

<p>However, it turns out that some of the songs used by Platypus "were specifically written or exclusively licensed by GSC", so those songs have been removed. However, the studio is adamant that "no original files from GSC games were used".</p>




<p>If you need a reminder,&nbsp;<em>Misery&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-dev-strikes-down-copycat-game-misery-with-dmca-claim" rel="nofollow">taken down</a> from Steam earlier this week following a DMCA claim by&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>'s GSC Game World, which alleged that Platypus Entertainment's game infringed GSC's copyright.</p>

<p>This led to a rather unfortunately slur-laden <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stalker/comments/1or39zs/comment/nno4g7j/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Discord message</a> from developer Maewing, who subsequently <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/stalker-dev-gsc-game-world-dmcad-a-stalker-inspired-indie-off-steam-and-the-devs-are-crying-foul-this-is-an-abuse-of-power-against-small-independent-developers-by-a-large-corporation/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">apologized</a> for their "past words" and "old posts", although that doesn't really apply to a message that was clearly posted after the strike was filed.</p>

<p>That, however, is an issue that Platypus has addressed in its most recent Steam news post; the studio says it has "established a strict policy on Discord moderation", which means it's no longer an "anarchy dumpster fire".</p>

<p>In any case, if you'd like to check out&nbsp;<em>Misery</em>, you can do so right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2119830/MISERY/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>. Stay tuned for more on this.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/funko-is-letting-the-last-advent-calendars-go-for-pennies-the-nightmare-before-christmas-fans-get-lucky.1353811/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
                  Save 15% on the Funko Pop The Nightmare Before Christmas countdown calendar over at Amazon.
                </p><div>
              
              <p>I’ll tell you what a real nightmare before Christmas is. It’s shopping for all those gifts. Finding the right gift can be a struggle, and with lots of folks to shop for ranging across your friends, family, and loved ones, that bill can add up pretty quickly. That’s why it’s great to keep an eye out for a good deal during the holiday season. And right now, Amazon happens to have this Funko Pop advent calendar on sale featuring vinyl mini figures of beloved characters from Tim Burtons’s <em>The Nightmare Before Christmas</em>. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5580/">The mystery box filled with toys is normally priced at $50, but right now you can grab it for 19% off for a limited time. That brings the price down by nearly $10 so you only end up paying $40.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5580/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>24 Days of Surprises</h2>
<p>Now, advent calendars make for a great Christmas gift* with a asterisk on it. The asterisk is to call out that by Christmas day, it’s already too late to give someone this gift. Unless there joy comes from just ripping open each door and having the instant gratification of all toys at once, which I guess more power to ya. But ideally, they should receive this before November 1 so they can enjoy beginning each day with a new treat in the form of Jack, Sally, or many of the other <em>The Nightmare Before Christmas </em>characters. Perhaps they can pair opening one of the doors with completing their daily Connections in The New York Times.</p>
<p>Okay so there’s another weird caveat I need to call attention to. At the time of writing this, all throughout the item page on Amazon, it calls out to, “Open the tiny doors to 13 unique collectable Funko Pocket Pops!” Now, there are 24 doors so I don’t know what’s going on. I’m not sure if that 13 is a typo (though it comes up twice on the page) or if more than half those little compartments are empty.</p>



<p>What I do know is the box in the images calls attention to it being a “24-piece holiday calendar.” Maybe they’re not all unique and there are some repeats in there or maybe someone on the Funko marketing team just copy/pasted this part of the description and forgot to edit it. There’s only one way to know for sure.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5580/">Buy yourself the Funko Pop <em>The Nightmare Before Christmas </em>countdown calendar for the reduced price of $40 and find out what’s inside for yourself.</a> Then come back to the comments here and let me know your findings.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/the-witcher-3s-most-important-player-choice-wasnt-always-part-of-the-game-2000644323</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>The Witcher 3</em> lets you make a lot of choices as Geralt, the open-world RPG’s titular monster slayer, but its biggest strength is in how subtly they’re woven into the broader fabric of the world. None of the choices ever feel like they’re being telegraphed with big blinking signs. The long-term consequences are yours to parse. So it is with the game’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-witcher-3-geralt-yennefer-triss-kiera-romance-love-1849487104">big love triangle</a>, a branching path that CD Projekt Red recently revealed was a late edition to the best-seller.</p> <p>The sorceress Yennefer is who Geralt begins the game with, during a flashback at Kaer Morhen. The red-headed mage Triss Merigold doesn’t show up until halfway through when he gets to Novigrad, at which point players have the option of rekindling their past relationship or moving on as friends, depending in part on their choices during the prior game. Eventually, the player has to make their mutant playboy choose between the two, with their future partner eventually joining them at a cute little cottage at the end of both expansions.</p>

 <p>“It wasn’t [there] from the beginning, but at some point we understood that this lack of kind of conflict, personal conflict—of course, there’s Ciri—but there was a lack of <em>something</em>.” CD Projekt Red co-CEO Adam Badowski <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/the-witcher-3-didnt-originally-make-you-choose-between-romancing-yennefer-or-triss-this-decision-was-made-pretty-late/">told <em>PC Gamer</em></a>. “This decision was made pretty late, but it was great. It was a great decision.”</p>

 <p>While Yennefer is Geralt’s canonical love interest, she’s not actually in <a href="https://kotaku.com/first-witcher-game-remake-unreal-engine-5-1849816995">the first two games</a>. Triss, however, is, leading to a weird scenario&nbsp; in which many players actually have a stronger connection to her than to the witcher’s ongoing on-again, off-again partner. It would have been easy to steer him back to her for the duration of the third game, but playing up Geralt’s divided heart does a lot to give the otherwise gruff and sardonic mercenary a more emotionally engaging mini-arc within the final game.</p> <p>While Geralt will still make an appearance in <a href="https://kotaku.com/witcher-4-2027-release-window-investor-call-ps6-cdpr-1851772310"><em>The Witcher 4</em></a>, CDPR’s next sequel will pass the baton to Ciri as the main hero instead. Fortunately, fans of the grey wolf will get another chance to revisit the beginning of his journey in a <a href="https://kotaku.com/witcher-remake-open-world-rpg-cd-projekt-red-cyberpunk-1849832000">remake of <em>The Witcher 1</em></a> that is also in the works. Neither project has a release window just yet.</p>

Apple just kicked off most of its Black Friday deals on Amazon and spans everything from iPads and MacBooks to Apple Watches and AirTags. But perhaps the star of the show <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4533/">is the 11-inch iPad with the A16 chip (WiFi + 128GB) which is now down to $299 from its original $349 sticker price</a>. This <strong>model launched in early 2025</strong> and quickly became the best-selling tablet on the market so to see it drop to an all-time low this quickly almost feels too good to be true.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4533/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Apple redesigned this iPad to handle the kind of multitasking most of us throw at our devices daily. The A16 chip powers through photo editing, gaming and streaming without hesitation. You get 128GB of storage right out of the gate and gives you plenty of room for apps, photos, videos, and documents before you even think about cloud storage.</p>



<h2>Best Value for Money Tablet</h2>
<p>It’s an <strong>11-inch Liquid Retina display</strong> that brings colors to life in such a way that streaming movies or editing photos becomes genuinely enjoyable. True Tone technology changes the color temperature of the screen with respect to your surroundings, so you are not squinting at a harsh blue glow by night or straining to see details by bright sunlight. This may sound minor until you realize how much easier it makes long reading sessions or late-night work sessions go on your eyes. The screen hits that sweet spot where it’s large enough for serious work but compact enough to toss in a bag without thinking twice.</p>
<p><strong>Wi-Fi 6 connectivity</strong> keeps you moving at full speed when you’re downloading files, uploading content, or jumping between video calls. The USB-C connector finally standardized charging and data transfer, meaning you can use the same cable for your iPad that you use for most of your other devices. There are 12MP cameras on both the front and back of the device, giving you solid options for video calls, document scanning, or just quick photos when you don’t have your phone handy. An important addition is Center Stage, a technology in the front camera that automatically pans and zooms to keep you in frame during video calls.</p>



<p>Touch ID built into the top button gives you quick access without typing passwords constantly. You unlock the iPad, sign into apps, and authorize Apple Pay transactions with just your fingerprint. The <strong>iPadOS uses hardware to full capacity</strong>, and allows you to run multiple apps side by side, use the Scribble to handwrite in any text field with an Apple Pencil, and organize your workflow in ways that actually make sense.</p>
<p>For $299, this iPad offers good value to anyone who needs a capable tablet that can handle real work without compromise.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’ve ever wanted to create the wackiest and wildest Black Ops 7 content imaginable, you can now do so with the new green screen innovation found in one of the game’s various matchmaking features.</p>



<p>Black Ops 7 has some interesting new features. There’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-what-is-cursed-mode-zombies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cursed Mode</a> and, from a gameplay perspective, there’s a significant lack of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-no-aim-assist-cod-world-champ/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aim Assist</a>. There’s so much more in between, but we know why you’re here: Call of Duty’s first-ever in-game green screen—which is exactly as it sounds.</p>







<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-has-a-green-screen">Black Ops 7 Has A Green Screen</h2>

<p>It seems like Treyarch is specifically catering to streamers and content creators with the introduction of a new green screen map. The first-time-ever feature can only be found in <strong>Private Match</strong>—which makes sense—and it literally is just a green screen map, and wouldn’t be ideal for a competitive lobby.</p>



<p>Once you load into the map, the world is just one giant green screen. This allows you to seamlessly create thumbnails for all types of content creation.</p>







<p>Here’s what Treyarch had to say on it:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“A little surprise for content creators: our new Green Screen map is available in Private Matches for all your thumbnail creation needs. This has been a goal for us ever since we added a green screen to the Studio map back in BO2. Go forth and create!”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Black Ops 2 only had the green screen as a bit-part aspect of a wider map. However, this is a fully-fledged green screen map, acting as your own personal home studio. It allows you to switch out your guns, pose with them, and handily whip up thumbnails.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>A little surprise for content creators: our new Green Screen map is available in Private Matches for all your thumbnail creation needs. </p><p>This has been a goal for us ever since we added a green screen to the Studio map back in BO2. Go forth and create! <a href="https://t.co/zxonI8Eha7">pic.twitter.com/zxonI8Eha7</a></p></div>— Treyarch (@Treyarch) <a href="https://twitter.com/Treyarch/status/1989005194781450488?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 13, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>To be fair, in a game that’s had its fair share of ups and downs already, this feels like a bona fide winner. It’s a perfect quality of life addition that makes the lives of many easier. Plus, even if you’re not a content creator, who’s to say you can’t find some inspiration and bring out the inner-Picasso from within?</p>



<p>Is this a smart move from the dev team? What other game-changing content like this could CoD do?

                <p>Sony and NCSoft just announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/horizon-steel-frontiers-mmo-is-skipping-ps5-for-now/1100-6536174/" data-ref-id="1100-6536174">Horizon spin-off called Horizon Steel Frontiers</a>, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/horizon-franchise-was-created-with-multiplayer-in-mind-says-guerrilla-games-boss/1100-6536213/" data-ref-id="1100-6536213">mobile-first, multiplayer-focused MMO</a> that's in the works for mobile and PC--but not Sony's flagship PlayStation 5 console.</p><p>Executive producer Sunggu Lee <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horizon-steel-frontiers-interview-with-ncsoft-is-aloy-in-the-game-how-will-it-work-on-pc-and-what-about-those-stylized-characters" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">spoke to IGN</a> about the game and answered some questions people might be wondering, like if Aloy is in the game, what the game's inspirations are, how combat works, and more.</p><p>Asked if Aloy, or other well-known Horizon characters, are in Horizon Steel Frontiers, Lee said, "We haven't finalized whether characters from the original game will appear, so it's too early to share any specific plans."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qwAulK6db4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9qwAulK6db4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Another question that came up is where Horizon Steel Frontiers fits within the wider Horizon universe. Lee said it is indeed set inside the Horizon world, but in a new place, the Deadlands, which is inspired by Arizona and New Mexico. "While Aloy and her allies are fighting for the fate of the world in the north, the southern Deadlands face a new threat. Players step into the role of machine hunters drawn to this dangerous frontier," Lee said.</p><p>As for the Horizon Steel Frontiers combat mechanics, Lee said the MMO and the main game series from Guerrilla share the same core idea of fighting big machines. But the combat systems are "quite different," Lee said. "In Steel Frontiers, it’s all about managing distance and making quick decisions--when to attack and when to dodge. We've kept the tension and excitement of the original hunts, but redesigned the combat to deliver a fresh experience that's optimized for multiplayer hunting action," Lee said.</p><p>We also learned in the interview that NCSoft was inspired by Capcom's Monster Hunter series for Steel Frontiers. "Monster Hunter was definitely one of the key inspirations for Steel Frontiers. When we started expanding Horizon's core concept of hunting massive machines into a multiplayer experience, the cooperative hunting system from the Monster Hunter series felt like a natural reference point," Lee said.</p><p>What's more, Lee discussed the differences between the mobile and PC versions of Horizon Frontiers. "Mobile offers quick, on-the-go session play, while PC provides a richer, more strategic combat experience--each platform playing to its strengths," Lee said.</p><p>Steel Frontiers does not have a release date yet. For fans of the main Horizon series, developer Guerrilla says <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/more-horizon-games-are-coming-including-a-non-mmo-multiplayer-game-it-seems/1100-6536178/" data-ref-id="1100-6536178">more games are coming, including a possible multiplayer game. </a></p>

                <p>Dragami Games has announced that the upcoming Switch 2 port of Lollipop Chainsaw has been delayed. It was previously set to launch this November but is now coming in "early 2026."</p><p><a href="https://x.com/Dragami_Games/status/1989252238347567413" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The developer said</a> the delay was due to the volume of requests for a physical edition of the game's RePOP remaster version. The studio wanted to align the digital and physical releases, so it opted to delay all versions to 2026.</p><p>"We sincerely apologize for the extended wait and any inconvenience this may cause. We appreciate your understanding and continued support," Dragami said.</p><p>James Gunn--the co-CEO of DC Studios and the director of the recently released Superman reboot--co-wrote the story for Lollipop Chainsaw, which was co-directed by Goichi Suda aka Suda51.

The new edition includes "the latest graphics," along with "speedier chainsaw action." For anyone unaware, Lollipop Chainsaw tells the story of Juliet Starling, a student who loves cheerleading and killing zombies.</p><p>The Switch 2 is soaring right now, recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-continues-to-be-a-massive-hit-selling-over-10-million-units-in-six-months/1100-6535903/" data-ref-id="1100-6535903">passing 10 million units sold</a> to become Nintendo's fastest-selling console ever.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>We know that Neowiz, the parent company of Round 8 Studio, the team behind<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lies-of-p-review/"> Lies of P </a>and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lies-of-p-overture-one-more-lie/">its recent DLC, Lies of P: Overture</a>, is <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-is-getting-balance-tweaks-dlcs-and-a-sequel/">working on a sequel to its Bloodborne-like hit</a> that <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-has-sold-over-3-million-units/">has sold over 3 million copies since its launch</a>. But a Lies of P sequel isn't the only project that Neowiz has on the go. In fact, it's not even the only Souls-like game Neowiz has in development.</p>



<p>Per the studio's <a href="https://cdn.neowiz.com/neowiz-site/assets/ir-library/3Q25_NWZ-IR-PPT_EN-itjp3znq.pdf">latest investor presentation</a>, it has a total of five projects set to release on PC and consoles in development at its in-house studios. If you add its mobile games, it has seven total projects on the go from its internal teams.</p>



<p>Of those five projects, one of them is the sequel to Lies of P. Another is a new Souls-like project led by Kay Lee at Neowiz. Another is a new narrative-focused RPG led by Seungho Jin, and rounding out the remaining two is a new life simulator game, and a new survival action title.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Image credit: Neowiz</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The company definitely has a lot on its plate, but after Lies of P, it's difficult not to be completely excited for whatever the studio is cooking up. With Lies of P, the studio proved it could enter a highly competitive and, for many players, oversaturated genre and still find ways to improve and innovate on what came before, even if it didn't hit its mark perfectly.</p>



<p>So, hearing that it'll be trying to do that again with both a sequel to Lies of P and an entirely new Souls-like, and it'll be entering the survival-action game genre, and a new life simulation game, sparks further excitement around how the studio could potentially innovate in those genres. At least, that's the hope.</p>

Using a standalone VR headset can feel more freeing when playing games than being connected to a PC with a cable, but it’ll still weigh heavily on your head, so you may feel some strain after wearing it for a little while. However, its sale price and included extras make it an especially great choice if you’ve never tried a VR headset before, or are shopping for a gift for a gamer.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6Njg3NzIw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Brandt Ranj</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/820921/meta-quest-3s-black-friday-deal-sale]]></content:encoded>

              <p>Black Friday is just around the corner, and early deals are already coming in hot. This is a great time to grab both the essentials and big-ticket items you have been keeping an eye on, without paying the full price. Those looking for a powerful tablet that can turn into a full-fledged Windows laptop when needed should consider the Microsoft Surface Pro, especially now that it’s going for a lot less on Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5579/">The 2024 model of this machine typically retails for $2,100, but you can now snag it for $1,550 after a nice 26% discount.</a> This discount applies to the Platinum model and is available to both Prime and non-Prime members. It’s also one of the steepest price drops we have seen on this model, but we’re not expecting it to last long. It’s best to grab yours before the price shoots back up.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5579/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Massive Screen, Plus All-Day Battery Life</h2>
<p>It’s slightly bigger than most tablets out there. You’re getting a 13-inch OLED touchscreen display that delivers brilliant visuals with exceptional color accuracy in both bright and dim settings. Your favorite shows will come to life, and even gaming will feel immersive. Touchscreen makes it easy to navigate; you can swipe, scroll, pinch, sketch, and even type with ease.</p>
<p>The tablet also comes with a built-in stand at the back, which makes it easy to prop the screen up however you like. Working on the go? Stand it upright. Going through a long, boring document? Use it as a notebook. Feeling a bit creative? Lay it flat on the table to paint or sketch. You can also add the Surface Pro Flex keyboard (which is sold separately) to your setup and turn it into a laptop when needed.</p>



<p>Performance-wise, you’ve got a Snapdragon X Elite processor with 12 cores. It’s powerful enough to handle all your heavy-duty tasks like content creation, video production, multitasking, and more. The 32GB RAM makes sure you don’t experience any frustrating slowdowns as you work, while the massive 1TB SSD offers plenty of space to store all your photos, videos, and files with ease.</p>
<p>Copilot+ integration makes your everyday tasks a breeze. You can use it to ask questions, get help with studies, generate art using a simple prompt, and even enjoy better video calls with improved lighting and real-time subtitles. This 2-in-1 tablet also won’t give up on you in the middle of a busy day, as the battery life is designed to last up to 14 hours on a single charge.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a> <span>is so focused on its single-player story that you might have forgotten the RPG has a competitive mode like most other </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games. This four-player versus mode pits you and the other trainers against one another in a race to see who can defeat the most monsters in a short amount of time. Even if you’re not a competitive person, you might still be playing this mode to try and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension-dlc-raichu-ranked-2000625708"><span>unlock some of the Mega Stones gated behind it</span></a><span>. So you want it to be fair, right? Well, it sounds like the mode is being overrun by hackers who are cheating their way to victory.</span></p>   <p><span>I don’t play much of </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s multiplayer myself, so the first time I was clued into the hacking epidemic was through a video on TikTok that showed a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-mega-evolutions-best-worst-designs-legends-z-a-2000625459"><span>Mega Garchomp</span></a><span> repeatedly using its powerful ground-type attack Earthquake without any cooldowns. Because there was no gap in between these devastating area-of-effect moves, its trainer racked up points on the scoreboard so quickly that there was no way anyone else could catch up.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>What I didn’t realize at the time was that this has become so widespread that </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>creators are weighing in and providing their own footage of rigged online matches. Some of the possible hacks might not be that recognizable to the untrained eye. AustinJohnPlays has an </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAqhVep_5dc"><span>extensive video</span></a><span> on several hacked Pokémon he and others have encountered online, though not all of the exploits are as damning as a Garchomp with no cooldowns.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>For example, he shows a Lucario who seems to have been captured with a Poké Ball that isn’t available in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>. This doesn’t give anyone a competitive advantage but it’s an example of how some people are clearly modding the game in various ways. Some are advantageous in competitive play, like someone having an </span><a href="https://x.com/amiosi/status/1986910946556535092?s=20"><span>Alpha Xerneas</span></a><span>, a larger, more powerful form of a Legendary Pokémon that is only obtainable once in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>and not as an Alpha. Clearly, some players are up to hacked shenanigans and taking these unobtainable Pokémon online.</span></p>

 <p><iframe title="Hackers are Ruining Pokemon Legends Z-A!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bAqhVep_5dc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p> <p><span>Some of the hacks AustinJohnPlays highlights might seem harmless, such as some players changing their in-game trainer ID card images to real photos, but when you see there’s an astronomical gap between their online scores and those of regular players, it’s probably safe to assume they’re also messing with the stats, movesets, and properties of their Pokémon.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>At the moment, </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>doesn’t have any kind of reporting or blocking feature, so these hackers are running around in competitive battles, spamming moves and using Pokémon they shouldn’t be able to access. We’ve reached out to The Pokémon Company for comment on the situation and will update this story if we hear back.</span></p>

Another option, meanwhile, sees the player convincing Karlach to depart Faerûn to live in Avernus and hope for a more permanent cure — leaving the character's ultimate survival open to debate.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, fans think they finally have an answer for what happens next if Karlach does go back to Avernus, thanks to the canon Astarion's Book of Hungers D&amp;D Expansion.

In the game's epilogue, set six months later, Karlach mentions a recent adventure where she obtained a set of blueprints offering a possible solution for her infernal engine. Seemingly, then, these worked — for another few years, at least — to allow her back to Faerûn and hopefully another reunion with your party.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian may be done with major updates, but it's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-hotfix-34-adds-native-steam-deck-build-reduces-framerate-spikes-in-busy-areas-such-as-the-lower-city-in-act-3-across-all-platforms">still releasing occasional hotfixes</a>.

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Mario Kart DS is celebrating its 20-year anniversary today, November 14, 2025. Below, we examine how the fan community has kept the game alive, and online, long after official servers were retired.</em></p><p dir="ltr">When Mario Kart DS launched in 2005, it felt like a glimpse into the future. For the first time, Nintendo’s chaotic, shell-filled racer could be played online, pitting players from around the world against each other in real-time competition. It was a leap few handheld games had dared to make at the time.</p><p dir="ltr">Two decades later, the official Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection servers that powered those matchups are long gone, but the race never really stopped. Through fan-built tools, open-source servers, and emulation projects, Mario Kart DS remains alive and well--still spinning its wheels in the hands of a dedicated community that refuses to let it drift into the past.</p><p dir="ltr">When the Nintendo DS debuted, it was marketed as a “third pillar” for the company--a strange, dual-screen experiment meant to sit alongside the GameCube and Game Boy Advance. But with Mario Kart DS, the touch screen rarely came into play. The game focused the series’ easy-to-pick-up gameplay with a forward-thinking approach that accelerated Mario Kart into the future. GameSpot, in fact, loved the game in 2005.</p><p dir="ltr">"Mario Kart DS is without a doubt one of the best games to hit the Nintendo DS to date," GameSpot's reviewer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mario-kart-ds-review/1900-6139765/">wrote</a>. "The game plays every bit as well as any of its predecessors, and adds just enough new features to the mix to make it worthy of your attention, even if you're still playing any of those games on a regular basis. The online play is undoubtedly the icing on an especially yummy cake, and even if you're not in a position to sample said icing, a yummy cake without icing is still a yummy cake."</p><p dir="ltr">Using Nintendo’s Wi-Fi Connection service, players could race online via local hotspots or home internet connections. It wasn’t perfect--online matchmaking was limited to a handful of tracks, and finding friends required clunky friend codes--but it was enough to ignite a new kind of competition. Suddenly, players could test their drifting skills against strangers halfway across the globe. For many, it was their first taste of online console gaming at all.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pC4Ohj0jdBQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pC4Ohj0jdBQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Beyond its online capabilities, Mario Kart DS also raised the bar for what handheld racing could be. It introduced retro cups, reimagining classic tracks from previous entries. It popularized snaking, a technique where skilled players could chain boosts by quickly alternating drifts, giving the game a competitive depth.</p><p dir="ltr">When Nintendo shut down its Wi-Fi Connection servers in 2014, it seemed like the end of an era. Online play for Mario Kart DS--and dozens of other Nintendo titles--was suddenly gone. But like any good racer, fans found a way to take a shortcut.</p><p dir="ltr">"I just found a way to play Mario Kart DS online again. It's really cool that you can still do this,' one player <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MarioKartDS/comments/1cfjera/playing_mario_kart_ds_online_in_2024/" rel="nofollow ">wrote</a> in 2024. "It's not as active as the Wii, but it's actually pretty easy to find a match."</p><p dir="ltr">Through reverse engineering and open-source initiatives like Wiimmfi and AltWFC, the game’s online features were kept alive by the community. Players could still race together. The process wasn’t always simple--it required custom patches or modified DNS settings--but it worked.</p><p dir="ltr">Today, fan communities continue to organize races and tournaments. Whenever players went online to post that they found a new way to play Mario kart DS online, but that they couldn't find other players, other Mario Kart DS fans pointed them towards a thriving <a href="https://discord.gg/mario-kart-ds-network-569870981213061120" rel="nofollow ">Discord server</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">That sense of community and legacy is what drives many of these projects. In an era where online games can disappear with the flip of a server switch, Mario Kart DS has become a case study in fan-powered preservation. It’s proof that players can keep a game alive long after its corporate support ends--through passion, a little technical skill, and sheer determination.</p><p dir="ltr">Even by today’s standards, Mario Kart DS feels remarkably tight. Its track design, item balance, and snappy controls strike a near-perfect blend of skill and chaos. The game’s focus on pure mechanics--no anti-gravity, bikes, motion controls, or touch-screen gameplay--makes it a favorite for players who crave the series’ classic feel.</p><p dir="ltr">Its simplicity is part of its staying power. Modern entries like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Mario Kart World are spectacular in scope, but DS captures a more stripped-down energy--a focus on short bursts of fun that perfectly fit the handheld format. Races are quick, items are well-tuned, and the roster, while smaller with 12 standard racers including most of Mario's immediate family, friends, and rivals, is iconic.</p><p dir="ltr">It’s also a game that rewards mastery. Snaking and mini-turbo management turned what looked like a casual party racer into a surprisingly deep competitive title. The best players could maintain near-constant boosts, flying through tracks with dizzying speed. Nintendo eventually toned this down in later games, but among longtime fans, Mario Kart DS remains the “technical” entry--the one that truly separated the pros from the pack.</p><p dir="ltr">As Mario Kart DS turns 20, its community, while small, is firmly in cruise control. Players continue to introduce newcomers to its underground online scene. For many, keeping the game alive isn’t just nostalgia--it’s a statement about access in the digital age.</p><p dir="ltr">The future of Mario Kart will likely continue to evolve, beyond the sandbox experiment of Mario Kart World and the fun augmented reality of Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit. But in many ways, Mario Kart DS set the standard. It proved that online play could work on a handheld and that great design never goes out of style.</p><p dir="ltr">Twenty years on, the finish line isn't even on the track. The race, at least for now, feels endless.

                <p dir="ltr">Starting with Horizon Zero Dawn and followed up with Horizon Forbidden West, the PlayStation franchise has seen players following protagonist Aloy on a single-player adventure. With the recent reveal of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/horizon-steel-frontiers-mmo-is-skipping-ps5-for-now/1100-6536174/">Horizon Steel Frontiers</a>, the focus changes from a solo affair to an MMO. But Guerrilla Games studio director Jan-Bart van Beek has stated the series started with multiplayer in mind.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/lego-horizon-adventures-review-for-buildin-jest/1900-6418316/">Lego Horizon Adventures</a> was apparently Guerilla dipping its toes in the water with multiplayer, according to van Beek <a href="https://x.com/janbartvanbeek/status/1989193333491790157" rel="nofollow ">on X</a>. But going forward, the studio will focus more on this social aspect. "From the first moment we imagined Horizon, we always thought about it as a multiplayer game," wrote van Beek. "Lego Horizon Adventures was our first small step, with Steel Frontiers we're taking a bigger one. There is much more to come, and we're excited to show you what is coming."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/janbartvanbeek/status/1989193333491790157" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">From the first moment we imagined Horizon, we always thought about it as a multiplayer game. <br>LEGO Horizon Adventures was our first small step, with Steel Frontiers we’re taking a bigger one.

That would be a first for the franchise, as even the spin-off <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/horizon-call-of-the-mountain-review-new-heights/1900-6418028/" data-ref-id="1900-6418028">Horizon Call of the Mountain</a> was released for PlayStation VR 2. The MMO looks a bit inspired by the Monster Hunter series and will feature large-scale raids. Meanwhile, Sony has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-sues-tencent-over-horizon-lookalike/1100-6533493/">filed a lawsuit against Tencent over Light of Motiram</a>, arguing the game is a "slavish clone" of Horizon.</p><p dir="ltr">As van Beek implies, multiplayer looks here to stay with the Horizon franchise. In fact, it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/more-horizon-games-are-coming-including-a-non-mmo-multiplayer-game-it-seems/1100-6536178/">reported that a multiplayer Horizon game is the next project from Guerrilla</a>. There is also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonys-horizon-movie-gets-release-window-update/1100-6535520/">a live-action Horizon movie in the works</a>, though no directors, writers, or cast members have been announced.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>For those who have been waiting for a new installment in the Metroid Prime series since August 28, 2007, somehow, now that we're 20 days away (at the time of this writing) from the launch of Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, the waiting feels even more excruciating. At least in the lead-up to December 4, 2025, Nintendo is putting out new trailers to help tide players over in the last stretch of this long, almost two-decade wait.</p>



<p>The latest overview trailer is a significant look at gameplay, as it goes through several of the game's key systems, showcasing the main game mechanics players will interact with and utilize over the course of Samus' latest adventure.</p>



<p>It also features a solid look at the Galactic Federation soldiers who put out the distress call that Samus responds to at the start of the game, the same call that brings her to the planet Viewros. It seems like these allies will be with her for most of the game, which is definitely a shift from the classic Metroid style of Samus being the lone warrior adventuring out on her own.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Last week, at the one-month mark ahead of the game's launch, <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-trailer-ups-the-ante-month-from-release/">a new action-packed trailer </a>showed off some stunning cinematic shots of the game. Now that Nintendo put out another trailer a week later, it feels like that might have been the start of a month-long marketing campaign that'll lead into the game's launch. If that's the case, it'll be great to regularly see more of the game as we get closer to its release.</p>



<p>Back in April, shortly after the reveal of the Nintendo Switch 2, <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-hands-on-impressions/">Wccftech got to preview the upcoming long-awaited release, with our Nathan Birch writing</a>, "<em>Based on my early hands-on, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond probably won’t change how most fans feel about the series. It’s more of a good thing that we haven’t got a fresh dose of in a long time, and make no mistake, this is going to be the most playable, technically-sound version of Metroid Prime to date. A few easily-tweakable issues aside, the mouse controls work, and 120fps on a Nintendo console is a real thing that’s actually happening. I still have a lot more I need to play, but it seems like Metroid Prime fans have a rewarding bounty coming their way<strong>.</strong></em>"</p>



<p>Hopefully, Nathan's feeling that there's a game worth the wait on the way remains true when it arrives on December 4, 2025, on Nintendo Switch 2 and Nintendo Switch.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Escape from Tarkov is Offline for 24 Hours to Deploy 1.0]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-offline-24-hours/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/escape-from-tarkov-is-offline-for-24-hours-to-deploy-1-0.1353706/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Escape from Tarkov has just been pulled offline by Battlestate Games for a whopping 24 hours, and potentially longer if the 1.0 rollout needs to be extended. This is to allow the teams at Battlestate to deploy the complete overhaul coming with the 1.0 version of the game, which is the culmination of more than 10 years of development.</p>



<p>Tarkov going offline is a significant moment for the game, as when it comes back up, nothing will ever be the same again…</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-tarkov-back-online">When is Tarkov Back Online?</h2>



<p>Escape from Tarkov will be back online when the 1.0 update has been deployed. Battlestate Games has stressed it will be 24 hours from 11:00 GMT, which means 11:00 GMT <strong>tomorrow</strong>, it should be ready to go. When you boot tomorrow, you’ll be loading a new version of Escape from Tarkov, and for the first time in eight years, it <strong>won’t be a beta</strong>.</p>



<p>Escape from Tarkov’s 1.0 version comes with a new map, weapons, and equipment, and much more besides. The game will wipe and introduce a new campaign that players can follow to ultimately <strong>escape from Tarkov</strong>, securing one of four endings to wrap up the game’s core loop.</p>



<p>PvE players will need to wipe their game (but it’s not mandatory) if they want to complete Escape from Tarkov’s new story.</p>



<h3 id="h-what-is-error-262-in-escape-from-tarkov">What is Error: 262 in Escape from Tarkov?</h3>



<p>Don’t worry, this is just the error message Battlestate Games has applied to the Escape from Tarkov launcher while the 1.0 deployment is being rolled out.</p>



<p>This weekend, a Twitch Drops campaign will go live, with thousands of streamers coming forth to broadcast the 1.0 version for the first time. Typically, a Tarkov wipe heralds a monumental time for the game, and it skyrockets on platforms like Twitch. This will be no different, as this is the most significant event in the game’s storied history.</p>







<p>Love it or hate it, Escape from Tarkov is likely back and (we hope) better than ever. Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> what you’re most excited about from the 1.0 Tarkov update.</p>

            <p>On the reveal of Horizon Steel Frontiers yesterday, there was one big question on everyone's lips. Why is it not coming to PlayStation?</p>
<p>After all, Horizon is one of Sony's most prolific first party franchises, with over <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/guerrillas-horizon-franchise-has-sold-over-38m-copies-worldwide">30m copies sold across PC and PlayStation consoles</a>. But, despite this, the upcoming Horizon MMO from NCSoft is currently only slated for PC and mobile. What gives?</p>

<p>In the time since Horizon Steel Frontiers' announcement, executive producer Lee Song has shed a bit more light on why NCSoft's game isn't coming to PlayStation, suggesting excluding the platform was not NCSoft's decision.</p>
<p>The Horizon Steel Frontiers developer told Japanese outlet <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/960/G096074/20251113059/">4Gamer</a> that a lack of PS5 release was the "most comment reaction" following the announcement (via machine translation). He added that NCSoft has "no reason" not to bring its game to a PlayStation console.</p>
<p>"We would like to do it," the developer continued, "but it is not something we can decide on our own, so we would like to proceed with discussions."</p>
<p>It's been speculated, therefore, it may be Sony's decision not to release the game on PlayStation. Eurogamer has asked Sony for further comment.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/guerrilla-affirms-its-working-on-new-games-in-the-horizon-franchise-as-ncsoft-mmo-skips-ps5">Horizon Steel Frontiers is described as a "fierce survival adventure"</a>, in which players take on the role of machine hunters in a region known as Deathlands. The team promises "large-scale raids" and an "advanced combat system" on the game's eventual release.</p>
<p>In related news, earlier today Guerrilla's studio head celebrated Steel Frontiers' announcement with the revelation that the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-horizon-series-was-always-thought-about-as-a-multiplayer-game-says-studio-head-following-mmo-announcement">team had always imagined Horizon as a multiplayer game</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>I recently got to go hands-on with the Switch 2 Edition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, and not just to play that opening section that everyone and their mum has played at this point. No, I got to play over an hour of one of the game’s earlier parts proper, once Samus has appropriately lost all her abilities because the plot demands it.</p>
<p>I can’t say I was sceptical of the whole psychic angle for the new abilities, but I wasn’t <em>completely</em> sold, either. More fool me, as Metroid Prime 4 leans into the psychic schtick more than I expected, and does so in a way that blends nicely into the gameplay you expect, but is also refreshingly different to classic Metroid Prime fare.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, it’s not breaking any major boundaries or anything, but it is <em>fun</em>.</p>
<p>For example, there are these little glowy orbs called Psychic Motes that you need to use your special psychic glove to attract and throw into appropriate receptacles in order to open certain doors. You do this using the scan visor (trust me), which is now also the psychic visor (told you to trust me).</p>

<p>You can also use your powers to move certain objects from a distance in a manner that somewhat resembles the motion control nonsense from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/metroid_prime_3_corruption">Metroid Prime 3: Corruption</a>, but far less invasive and rhythm-breaking. Lovely stuff.</p>
<p>Not only did I manage to unlock all of this within about 40 minutes, but also another ability that allowed me to fire a charged shot which could then be controlled as it flew, slowing down time in the process to make it even marginally controllable. Honestly, it was a tiny bit too slow for my tastes, but I understand that not everyone is as great as I am.</p>
<p>And if you’ve even glanced at any of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/metroid-prime-4s-sweet-new-trailer-builds-the-hype-for-next-months-launch">the trailers</a> that have been released, you’ll already know that the game is absolutely stunning. The lighting engine doesn’t always hit the mark (as shown in the trailers within a desert area, which was sadly not a part of this preview), but when it does, it <em>really does</em>. The audio design is also stellar, especially the soundtrack. That mysterious, lonely vibe that is quintessential to the Prime series is here in full force, and I am unbelievably grateful for that.</p>
<p>What I’m not grateful for, however, is something that happened just under halfway through my playtime; Samus saves a marine from the snarling wildlife, and he decides to follow her like a worthless little worm, and brings his sub-Marvel humour along with him.</p>

<p>Mackenzie (presumably named after the least socially adept member of <strong>The Inbetweeners</strong>) is fully voice-acted, and reminds you of this fact <em>constantly</em>. I don’t want to blow things out of proportion, but he really did tarnish my time with the game, as not only does he keep yammering away with such classic lines as "Watch out, if you go that way I won’t be able to protect you," but I was also forced to protect him numerous times as I escorted him to a room he mercifully felt comfortable to stay in.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Samus barely engages with him. It would’ve been heartbreaking to hear one of my favourite video game characters break her stoic silence for this clown, so to have the maximum response she gives be a simple nod (even if said nod resulted in him hanging around even more) was a blessed relief. She didn’t even once say "the baby".</p>
<p>My hope is that Mackenzie is saved and sent home nice and early and never spoken of again, or better yet, suffers a painful, embarrassing death offscreen. But we’re going to have to wait until we can play the full release to know for sure. I tried shooting him with a missile, but it didn’t do anything.</p>

<p>If anyone thinks I’m being a little unfair, one of the biggest and most important parts of the Prime series (and the Metroid series as a whole) is the feeling of isolation, loneliness, and that you’re being forced to fight against the environment that doesn’t want you there to begin with. That notion is entirely destroyed once you introduce a character that blathers away at you incessantly, and it'll be a crying shame if this is something that is present throughout the full game’s runtime.</p>
<p>That being said, the rest of my time with the game was excellent, so I’m hopeful that it’ll all be enough to still make Metroid Prime 4 an absolute delight. I’m crossing two of my fingers, and you should too.</p>

<p>Not long to go!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>With just a few weeks to go until release, Nintendo has shared a new 7-minute overview trailer for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>.</p>
<p>The trailer gives us our best look yet at what we can expect from Samus' hotly anticipated adventure. There's a detailed rundown of the planet Viewros, a summary of Samus' sweet new abilities (as well as some returning favourites), and quick look at some of Galactic Trooper friendly faces that you'll have to save along the way.</p>

<p>The trailer dropped early on the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_today">Nintendo Today!</a> app, but we've now added it in its full YouTube glory at the top of this post — enjoy!</p>
<p>And if you want to hear what we make of it so far, you can check out our full <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/metroid-prime-4-beyond-is-great-but-i-want-to-kill-one-of-its-characters">preview</a> below — including our preliminary thoughts on those Galactic Troopers...</p>

		<p>Darling, listen up because I’m only saying this once,&nbsp; from today until December 14th, Balenciaga has swanned into PUBG Mobile and turned the whole battlefield into a catwalk for people who like their couture with a side of carnage.</p>
<p>It’s all terribly <em>now,</em> sweetie.</p>


<p>Exclusive items, special rewards, a whole World of Wonder map smothered in Balenciaga. It’s like Paris Fashion Week got drunk and wandered into a warzone.</p>
<p>Models… I mean, players, can unlock all these divine little Balenciaga numbers, the sort of pieces that whisper “high fashion” and scream “don’t touch me, I’m expensive.” There’s the Couture Armor look, inspired by that delicious 3D-printed armour couture moment from Balenciaga’s 52nd show. Very sculptural. Very futuristic. Very “I’m going to obliterate you but make it fashion.”</p>
<p>Then there are all the Winter ’25 bits — the corseted hoodie, the pink puffer, the standard look, it is Balenciaga saying, “Yes, we know you’re in a firefight, but do try to look couture”</p>

<p>And it doesn’t stop there, sweetie. You can also get the Invisible Rectangle Sunglasses (perfect for pretending you haven’t slept in three days), the Faux Fur Helmet (lush), and a Balenciaga Backpack in three upgradeable levels — because even your virtual luggage should be aspirational. Parachutes, avatar frames, graffiti, space gifts, so much to buy!</p>
<p>In World of Wonder, there’s a whole official Balenciaga map, where you can faff about expressing yourself — ghastly concept — but at least there’s a chic snowboard involved.</p>

<p>And of course, because Balenciaga never misses a chance to dress you.. normal.. people, there’s a real-world merch capsule too: T-shirts, caps, keychains, all that “I holiday in Monaco” nonsense. You can pick it up at select Balenciaga stores and online in Australia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, the UAE, and the US.</p>
<p>Now, where’s the Bolly?</p>

		<p>The wait for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4</a> is almost over, a new first person, 3D adventure for Samus for the first time in 18 years. Heck, it’s been 8 years since this game was announced, and now it’s a cross-gen release for Switch and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a>! Having gone hands on with a more extended portion of the game’s opening, has it been worth the wait?</p>
<p><iframe title="Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Final Preview – Psychics &amp; Sidekicks" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-GT-zzppAAk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The game’s opening sees Samus answer a distress call from a Galactic Federation base besieged by the Space Pirates. It’s always felt a little funny to me how sparse the Space Pirate forces were during previous games. You’d be blasting your way into their base, but only really encounter them one or two at a time, giving far less of an impression of a galaxy-spanning threat than they’re made out to be in the series’ expanding lore. Similarly, the Federation come off as utterly helpless and incompetent, outside of knowing when to call Samus for help. Metroid Prime 4’s opening finally gives a proper sense and feeling of how these two might face off, with giant, stompy mechs, Space Pirates dropping into the fray, and a desperate battle to escort a mysterious artefact to safety.</p>


<p>It all goes rather wrong, with a stray shot from Space Pirates leader Sylux hitting the artefact and absorbing everyone into a big glowy explosion of psychic energy – yes, they’ve finally decided to embrace new management after reanimating the skeleton of Ridley for the thirtieth time.</p>
<p>And that’s when things get really quite strange. Finding herself on a totally different planet known as Viewros, Samus is confronted by an alien race, the Lamorn, who have died out but wishes for their legacy to be preserved, and have tasked Samus with doing so by heading to five nearby regions and biomes.</p>


<p>So, Samus has been stripped of many of her abilities, but the artefact has seen fit to grant her with some new ones. Psychic ones! Samus’ visor? That’s psychic now. Her armour? It’s enhanced with a new psychic glove. Her morph ball? It lays psychic bombs. But this does all come to mean something more than just making everything purple – the most psychic of colours, as we all know. When scanning the environment, Samus can now spot things like power nodes and door locking mechanisms, reaching out to manipulate them in various ways as part of the environmental puzzling. Similarly, you quickly gain the ability to fire off a charged shot and then guide it remotely with the world in super slow motion.</p>
<p>Taken alongside the series staples of just shooting everything in sight with various elemental gun types, morph ball bombs, and using enhanced movement, all of this this brings a different tone to the exploration. You might need to convert morph ball bombs into psychic energy motes to charge a mechanism, a door blocked from one side might now be opened with a guided bolt, or just use telekinesis to shift some stuff around. It’s an intriguing new aspect, though I’ll admit there were a few moments where I didn’t quite put two and two together during these puzzles. There are layers of possibilities that now need to be remembered together, I feel, with the psychic abilities relying on switching to the visor view to trigger them. I’m sure this will become more natural through longer play in the full game.</p>

<p>The fundamentals of playing Metroid Prime 4 are slick and smooth, though. The core controls and feel are those of a modern first person shooter, though there’s also some leanings back to the older style of Metroid Prime controls as well. There’s no aiming down sights, but the left trigger will instead lock on that will snap to targets in a satisfying way, so you can just blast away. There is some motion control after touch while doing so, which did take a moment of getting used to, but allows for targeting weak spots.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can switch to mouse mode, if you’re playing with Switch 2 and detached Joy-Con 2 in hand. It’s effortless to switch back and forth between console gamepad controls and mouse mode, simply by tipping your hand on its side so the mouse sensor is on a table, sofa arm or trouser leg. This immediately gives you free aim, again making it easier to quickly target weak spots.</p>

<p>That really comes to the fore during boss battles, the first of which sees a Metroid-enhanced Space Pirate monster covering glowing blobs on its body with forearm shields, forcing you to target the exposed area, and then later hitting tentacle weak spots on a giant carnivorous plant. Regular combat encounters have also got bigger than in classic Metroid Prime, with many more enemies and waves of them coming in from multiple angles. It can be quite frantic. Frantic enough, maybe, that Samus could maybe use some help?</p>
<p>This brings us to what I feel will be one of the most controversial additions to Metroid Prime 4. One of the key aspects of this series and the genre it spawned has always been the sense of isolation, while still allowing for degree of human contact for mission briefings and updates. Well, Specialist Myles MacKenzie will seriously undercut that tone.</p>

<p>After saving him from being stranded on a vine-ensnared transport, and then from a horde of Jungle Griever enemies, he joins Samus for the next leg of exploration, and fight alongside with his pistol. That’s fine, but…. Myles is chatty. He will tell you to consult your map, he’ll marvel at Samus’ morph ball, he’ll be all ‘quirky’ during cutscenes in that Marvel movie kind of way. I fear that he will grate in the long run, though it’s not too long before he stays behind at a control panel and lets Samus get some alone time once more.</p>
<p>Sadly our time with Metroid Prime 4 came to an end after exploring this first region, and before getting to hop on the new motorbike to explore the open desert area between regions. That looks like it could be a lot of fun and a real change of pace.</p>
<p>In general, I enjoyed my time with Samus’ latest 3D adventure. It’s long overdue, of course, and there’s a tonal shift from close to two decades difference in game design and script writing. Hopefully that doesn’t skew too heavily away from the classic isolated feel of Metroid, but I’m certainly keen to see how the full game has come together.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dell-ryzen-7-laptop-bundle-32gb-ram-1tb-ssd-is-almost-70-off-savings-youll-never-see-on-a-macbook-2000644033</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Grabbing a powerful, sturdy laptop from a known brand doesn’t have to put a dent in your wallet. We’re spotting plenty of early Black Friday deals dropping in left, right, and center across different retailers. Amazon, specifically, is offering a wide range of high-end laptops for less.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5578/">For instance, the 15-inch Dell Inspiron 3535 touchscreen laptop is currently sitting at just $800 at the retailer, which is a massive 64% off its retail price of $2,200.</a> It’s packed with tons of useful features that are sure to support you during busy workdays and even make those late-night entertainment sessions a lot more fun. Alongside the direct discount, you’re also getting several handy accessories thrown in for free, including pre-installed Windows 11 Pro. The offer, however, is only around for a limited time, so it’s best to get your orders in sooner rather than later.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5578/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Powerful Processor to Work, Stream, and Game Easily</h2>
<p>The laptop runs on an AMD Ryzen 7 7730U processor, delivering impressive performance that even outpaces Intel’s i7-1355U in most competing models. Paired with AMD Radeon Graphics, the machine is more than capable of handling everyday work, browsing, streaming, and even light gaming without slowing down.</p>
<p>There’s 32 GB of RAM to keep things running smoothly. It makes using demanding applications, as well as multitasking, a breeze. You will be able to work with different programs at the same time, take video calls, create presentations, push some creative boundaries, hop through tabs, and more; without a hint of lag. Best of all, storing everything locally won’t be an issue either. Dell Inspiron 3535 packs a massive 1TB SSD that offers enough space to house a ton of high-resolution photos, videos, programs, and even games without feeling limited. Plus, SSDs ensure fast boot/load times, so you won’t have to wait long to get started.</p>



<p>Display-wise, you’re covered with a modest 15.6-inch Full HD (1920×1080) touchscreen. Its narrow border maximizes the overall space, while the built-in Dell ComfortView technology keeps the screen easy on your eyes. Touch support means you don’t have to limit yourself to the trackpad or the mouse to navigate. When you’re not in the mood to press buttons, simply use your fingers directly on the screen to scroll long documents, swipe through photos, sketch, and even take notes!</p>
<p>Some other features that deserve a mention include the 720p HD webcam, ergonomic lift-hinge keyboard, Wi-Fi 5, and Bluetooth 5.0. All things considered, this laptop is great for work, studies, and even casual use.</p>
