            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/aardman-pokemon-collaboration<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Stop-motion animation studio Aardman, best known for the&nbsp;<em>Wallace and Gromit&nbsp;</em>series and movies like <em>The&nbsp;</em><em>Pirates! In an Adventure with Scientists!</em>, has announced a collaboration with&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em>&nbsp;that's set to debut in a couple of years.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.aardman.com/latest-news/2024/december/pokemon-aardman-team-up-for-exciting-collaboration-coming-2027/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">an announcement on its website</a>, Aardman says its collaboration with The Pokemon Company will consist of "a special project" that'll arrive in 2027, and that the project will involve Aardman "bringing its unique style of storytelling to the <em>Pokemon</em> universe in brand-new adventures".</p>

<p>Aardman managing director Sean Clarke says that the collab will bring together&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>and Aardman's "love of craft, character and comedic storytelling", so it sounds like Aardman will be given at least a degree of creative control over the project, although The Pokemon Company isn't likely to let the studio do whatever it wants.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wallace-and-gromit-aardman-pokemon.jpg?itok=n1NjTG5f 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wallace-and-gromit-aardman-pokemon.jpg?itok=KFSuT0G- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Aardman is perhaps best known for the&nbsp;<em>Wallace and Gromit&nbsp;</em>series.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>marketing and media VP Taito Okiura, meanwhile, says that the teamup between Aardman and&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>is "a dream partnership", describing Aardman as "masters of their craft" and teasing that "global <em>Pokemon</em> fans are in for a treat".</p>

<p>This won't be&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em>'s first dalliance with stop-motion animation. Back in February 2023, The Pokemon Company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-dlc-hidden-treasure-of-area-zero-revealed" rel="nofollow">announced&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Concierge</em></a>, a stop-motion series that was then in production for Netflix. It aired in December last year, attracting <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/pokemon_concierge/s01" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">strongly positive reviews</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, we don't yet know whether&nbsp;the Aardman collaboration will be another series or a movie, but the announcement refers to "brand-new adventures", so we'll seemingly be getting more than one of whatever the two companies are cooking up.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-concierge-wooper.jpg?itok=Azy1sRY- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-concierge-wooper.jpg?itok=IihTiqJF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>has dabbled in stop-motion animation before.</figcaption></figure><p>As for what's next for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em>, the next game in the series <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-a-announced" rel="nofollow">will be&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em></a>, which is supposedly currently in development for Switch and which is intended to land next year, although we haven't heard much about the game since its announcement back in February.</p>

<p>Otherwise, the next major mainline installments in the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>series will probably be appearing on the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-confirmation" rel="nofollow">long-awaited Switch 2</a>, so much like the Aardman collab, we'll probably be waiting a while for more news on that one. Stay tuned for more.</p>

Fieldwork missions can be broadly generalized as other, unrelated archaeological investigations; Discoveries involve collectibles and short-term activities, like an underground boxing circuit; and Mysteries are shorter and typically based around a single puzzle.</p><p>Due to the way that <em>The Great Circle </em>is structured, many of these missions tend to be interconnected. It’s easy to follow one mission only to end up pursuing another as you go about finding collectibles and quest items.<em><strong>gc-sm02.jpg]</strong></em></p><p>There’s nothing wrong with letting that spontaneous objective structure play out for you. In fact, you’ll end up benefiting if you stray from the main path from time to time. The two primary rewards for successful missions in <em>The Great Circle </em>are Books and Adventure Points. While Books are rarely an actual mission reward, it’s very common for access to a Book to be locked behind progress in a particular side mission.</p><p>Books are used to unlock passive bonuses to Indy’s skills, such as faster stamina recharge or more blocks of health, while Adventure Points are spent to gain those bonuses. Picking up any collectible, such as a note, photo, or artifact, is usually worth 15-50 AP, while side missions can earn you up to 300 at once.</p><figure id="" data-id="284f8101032df313479e56c721b9e4a7" data-recommend-id="image://284f8101032df313479e56c721b9e4a7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Indiana Jones looks through a camera viewfinder." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Indiana Jones looks through a camera viewfinder." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->MachineGames / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="284f8101032df313479e56c721b9e4a7" data-recommend-id="image://284f8101032df313479e56c721b9e4a7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Indiana Jones looks through a camera viewfinder." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><br>If you’re looking to prepare for the later challenges in <em>The Great Circle</em>, especially when playing on a higher difficulty, it’s worth taking the time to knock out at least a few side missions in order to improve Indy’s stats. It’s particularly useful to pick up the Moxie books from “A Remedy for All,” which extend Indy’s health meter, and to acquire the Blackshirt disguise in Vatican City so you can take the “Brawler II” Book from inside the fascists’ campsite.</p><p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle </em>is available on PS5, Xbox Series X?S, and Windows via Steam. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/kick-streamer-performance-report-2024/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kick%E2%80%99s-streaming-performance-soared-in-2024-report-reveals.1057995/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/kick-streamer-performance-report-2024/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a new breakdown published by StreamsCharts, it was revealed that Kick.com underwent monumental growth through 2024. It’s only the platform’s second year in the business, but it’s already making waves and proving that it could be a legitimate contender to both Twitch and YouTube.</p>



<p>As YouTube is seemingly moving away from supporting live streamers in favour of short-form content, could there be a hole for Kick to step into and truly rival Twitch?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-big-numbers-in-2024">Big Numbers in 2024</h2>



<p>In 2024, Kick’s hours watched metric skyrocketed by 142% to <strong>2.1 billion</strong>. The platform’s peak viewer count also swelled, hitting lofty heights of <strong>1.75 million</strong>, a 79.7% improvement year-on-year.</p>



<p>These metrics were aggregated and revealed <a href="https://streamscharts.com/news/kicks-second-year-recap-viewership-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by StreamsCharts recently</a>.</p>



<p>It has been a busy year for Kick.com, with the platform moving more into the esports space, expanding into fresh and key regions, and some more big names being signed to the site.</p>



<p>The year-end metrics published recently revealed that the site has 933,572 unique channels, which marks a 19% increase over 2023. The average online channel count at any one time is 3,035, up 52% from last year, which shows how many more users are jumping onto and actively using the site.</p>



<p>The average viewer count is the money-maker, though.</p>



<p>It was revealed that Kick’s average viewer count through 2024 sits at around 258,293. That’s a whopping 149% increase over last year’s figure, and it’s fully indicative of the platform’s ongoing success.</p>



<p>However, not <strong>everything </strong>is looking bright for Kick’s future. The site’s second-most popular streamer, Adin Ross, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/adin-ross-leaving-kick-ludwig-back-twitch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently revealed he’s stepping away</a> from Kick indefinitely and trying to move back to Twitch. That’ll have a noticeable impact going into 2025, as this year, the controversial streamer was responsible for 60.5 million watch hours.</p>

<p>Marvel Rivals and SVP go hand in hand like Spider-Man and Venom or Groot and Rocket Raccoon. It adds an extra dimension to Rivals’ gameplay—standing out from other hero shooters—but many in the community are unsure of what it means, or how it affects you.</p>



<p>I didn’t see how Marvel Rivals’ launch could fail, and it didn’t. It accumulated <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-10-million-players-count/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10 million players in three days</a> and an early <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-first-post-launch-patch-is-now-live/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post-launch patch</a> made significant improvements. The online shooter has a lot going for it—including a whopping <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/complete-marvel-rivals-achievements-trophies-list-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trophy and Achievement list</a>—and one thing it adds is SVP.</p>



<p>SVP is something I’d never heard of in an online shooter, but it makes a lot of sense.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-does-svp-mean-in-marvel-rivals">What does SVP Mean in Marvel Rivals?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>My Spidey senses are tingling on this one. Credit to NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>SVP stands for Second Valuable Player in Marvel Rivals</strong> <strong>and gives recognition to the best player of the losing team.</strong></p>



<p>I presume you’ve heard the term MVP before, which most people know as “Most Valuable Player.” This applies to gaming, sports, and anything where the value of individuals is judged in a team-based environment. The top-performing participant, in terms of points or a graded display, is awarded the MVP—highlighting their contributions by awarding them for being the best player.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals also has an MVP award, and this is clearly marked at the end of a game where a victory screen indicates the MVP of the lobby by showing their name and most recently used character. Fairly standard stuff so far.</p>



<p>If you look at the final leaderboard at the end of a match though, as well as the winning team’s “MVP,” you should see “SVP” on the opposing side.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-do-you-get-svp-in-marvel-rivals">How do You Get SVP in Marvel Rivals?</h2>



<p><strong>To be SVP in Marvel Rivals, you need to be on the defeated team in a match and be the top-performing player of the losing side.</strong></p>



<p>There’s no clearly defined metric or quantitative data to suggest how SVP is measured. However, common sense suggests you need to contribute the most to your team’s effort: </p>



<ul>
<li>Assists</li>



<li>Earning objective points</li>



<li>Few (if any) deaths</li>



<li>Healing teammates</li>



<li>Kills</li>
</ul>



<p>If you consistently hit these five criteria, chances are, you’re in the running for SVP. Sitting at the back of the map and farming kills won’t get the job done. We all hate a teammate not contributing to the objective, so if you want to use Hawkeye with the only intention of padding your kill count and boosting your KD, don’t expect to be SVP.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-does-svp-do-in-marvel-rivals">What Does SVP do in Marvel Rivals?</h2>



<p><strong>If you are SVP, you don’t lose ranking points in Marvel Rivals—and this is a big boost to your rank and matchmaking.</strong></p>



<p>Ranked play is all about wins and points. The more wins you get, the more points you earn, and the higher up the leagues you climb. Losing a match is detrimental to ranked progress. On the other hand, if you earn SVP status on the defeated team, your ranking points stay the same. Again, this is a huge deterrent to negative play, and incentives players to get involved and be as useful as possible.</p>



<hr>



<p>Let us know how many times you’ve been SVP and if you think more online shooters should add this. Check out every Marvel Rivals <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-marvel-rivals-leaked-characters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked character</a> so far, along with the quickest ways to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-units-in-marvel-rivals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">get Units</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Is CSGO and CS2 Skin Gambling Legal?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/is-csgo-and-cs2-skin-gambling-legal/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-csgo-and-cs2-skin-gambling-legal.1057986/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/is-csgo-and-cs2-skin-gambling-legal/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>CSGO and CS2 skin gambling is still a prominent part of the wider Counter-Strike betting market. Instead of betting real money, players can wager the value of skins in their Steam inventory on professional match results and casino-like jackpot games.</p>



<p>The reputations and legitimacy of some of these sites have always been a major debate point within the Counter-Strike community. But is the act of skin gambling itself legal?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-can-you-gamble-using-cs-skins">Can You Gamble Using CS Skins?</h2>



<p>Gambling using CSGO and CS2 skins is legal, depending on the country or U.S. state you are in. You also have to be 18+ to gamble in any country or state where it is legal.</p>



<p>Up until 2018, it was illegal in the United States to gamble on sports using cash outside of the states of Oregon, Delaware, Montana, and Nevada, under the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992. </p>



<p>Because of this, several sites used skin gambling as a way to navigate around these laws, as virtual items were not prohibited. Even as gambling laws in the U.S. have changed, these laws don’t explicitly cover the gambling of virtual items like skins.</p>



<p>While skin gambling is not illegal, the skin gambling industry has been in the crosshairs of Valve since 2016. Valve was hit with a number of lawsuits in 2016 that were directly tied to various skin gambling sites. </p>



<p>Since then, Valve has <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/7/30/12332802/counter-strike-gambling-crackdown-valve-cease-and-desist-csgo-shuffle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">sent several cease and desist letters</a> to dozens of skin gambling sites and threatened them with legal action. The developer has also limited several features through Steam that contribute to skin gambling sites. As a result, many of these sites went dark or closed down completely.</p>



<p>Most sites now don’t let you wager skins directly. Instead, you can sell or trade in these skins for a site-specific currency. Then, you use that currency to either wager on matches or play casino-like games. If you win, you can use your currency to buy new skins or open cases on the site.</p>



<p>What are your thoughts on skin gambling? Let us know in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

                <p>GameScience has <a href="https://www.heishenhua.com/news/detail?id=149" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">released a new patch</a> for Black Myth: Wukong and it's a rather hefty one, featuring two challenge modes and loads of new equipment. There are some quality-of-life changes too.</p><p>The two challenge modes can be accessed after beating the game at least once. At any save point, called Keeper's Shrine, the player can find the "Return of Rivals" and "Gauntlet of Legends." The former lets players challenge any former opponents at three levels of varying difficulty.</p><p>The latter challenge mode lets players fight against multiple enemies in successions, with customized curses impacting the difficulty. Some old enemies will also have new moves. Completing the gauntlet will provide rewards such as new equipment, weapons, drinks, and medicine. In both modes, however, if any opponents haven't been defeated in the campaign, then they can't be challenged until doing so.</p><p>One of the game's criticisms is that it didn't provide a map while traversing. It now looks like there are purchasable maps called Journeyer's Charts. Whenever a player reaches a new territory, a corresponding Journeyer's Chart can be purchased at the Keeper's Shrine.</p><p>A new Armor Set of Opulence has been added to celebrate an early Chinese New Year, which includes four special armor pieces that can be claimed through "Trailblazer's Gift" at any Keeper's Shrine. Players can check out the Black Myth: Wukong Soundtrack Selection as a new soundtrack application as well.</p><p>Black Myth: Wukong is now out on PS5 and PC. It's also one of the nominees for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-game-awards-2024-nominees-announced-see-them-all-now/2900-5956/" data-ref-id="2900-5956">Game of the Year at The Game Awards 2024</a>.</p><h2>Patch 1.0.12.16581</h2><h3><strong>What to Know Before Patch Installation</strong></h3><ul><li>Due to the platform's update mechanism, your computer will need to reserve a larger amount of free disk space for temporary storage of the update files.</li><li>If you have installed any mods in the game, installing the patch may cause compatibility issues.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-country-returns">Donkey Kong Country Returns</a> HD is set to release on Switch in January and will come with a new, easier difficulty mode.</p>
<p>While Original Mode will preserve the high difficulty of the original release, the new Modern Mode will give the titular gorilla three hearts by default instead of two, plus players can carry up to nine items to help out.</p>
<p>The more forgiving option is detailed in a new gameplay trailer for the game released by Nintendo. Check it out below.</p>

<p>The HD re-release of Rare's game takes inspiration from both its original Wii release and its subsequent 3DS release.</p>
<p>The 3DS release, for instance, also featured an easier difficulty mode known as New Mode. Here Donkey Kong had an extra heart and a wider variety of items available to buy in Kranky Kong's shop.</p>
<p>And like the Wii release, players on Switch will be able to use Joy-con motion controls to slap the ground.</p>
<p>Co-op mode will also be included with one pair of Joy-con controllers.</p>
<p>Donkey Kong Country Returns released on the Wii in 2010, followed by its 3DS release in 2013. Its sequel, Tropical Freeze, came to WiiU in 2014 and was then ported to Switch in 2018.</p>
<p>The release of Donkey Kong Country Returns HD on Switch follows the addition of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-land-is-available-now-via-nintendo-switch-online">Donkey Kong Land Game Boy games to Switch Online</a> earlier this month.</p>
<p>It's all to celebrate the opening of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/watch-miyamoto-take-a-tour-of-super-nintendo-worlds-new-donkey-kong-country-theme-park-expansion">Donkey Kong Country theme park expansion at Universal Studios Japan</a>, after a six month delay.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p><a href="https://enotriathelastsong.com/">Enotria: The Last Song</a>, the soulslike developed by Jyamma Games released earlier this year on PC and PlayStation 5, will launch very soon on Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S.</p>
<p>Today, it has been confirmed the game will be released on Microsoft's current generation consoles tomorrow, December 12th. Besides being able to explore the sunny game world inspired by Italian landscapes, Xbox players will be able to enjoy the experience complete with all the improvements that have been introduced on PC and PlayStation 5 over the months, such as improved weapon menu interface that now displays average damage of weapons and rarity value, improved fast travel menu and much more.</p>
<p>Enotria: The Last Song was originally supposed to be released on Xbox consoles at the same time as on PC and PlayStation 5, but the game was delayed shortly before launch due to communication issues with Microsoft that prevented the certification process from proceeding as intended. Once the issue had become public, however, Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-reportedly-apologises-to-enotria-the-last-song-developers/">apologized</a> to Jyamma Games and started working closely with them to get the issues sorted out and release the game on Xbox Series X and S as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Enotria: The Last Song is now available on PC and PlayStation 5. The game will launch on Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S tomorrow, December 12th.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Possible New Bend Studio IP In-Development After Screenshots Surface]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/possible-new-bend-studio-ip-in-development-after-screenshots-surface/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/possible-new-bend-studio-ip-in-development-after-screenshots-surface.1057950/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/possible-new-bend-studio-ip-in-development-after-screenshots-surface/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It appears that there is a new IP being developed by Bend Studio, the developers behind Days Gone and the Syphon Filter franchise. There are already plenty of great games in development from Sony-owned studios, with games like Ghost of Yotei and Marathon being announced to be in development. Despite that, these games don't yet have a release date, and we all know that PlayStation loves to keep its secrets. However, it seems that one of the secrets has accidentally surfaced online and has potentially been revealed before it was supposed to.</p>
<p>This project is a new game from Bend Studio, who created Days Gone in 2019. Although Days Gone was highly successful, with many fans wanting a sequel, it seems that they have chosen to avoid that route and have instead decided to work on a new IP, presumably with Sony's blessing.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/days-gone-studio-sony-bend-seemingly-working-on-playstation-live-service-game/">Several job listings have surfaced online</a>, suggesting that Bend Studio's new IP will be a live-service title with the makings of the open-world systems that appeared in Days Gone. However, other than the job listings and some screenshots, there hasn't been much information to go on. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/dkxvre/sony_bend_days_gone_studio_already_in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eurogamer reported in 2019</a> that Studio Bend was already in pre-production for its next game, roughly six months after Days Gone had been released.</p>
<p>Since this information was covered, a new discovery has been made of an online portfolio of a UI designer who worked at Bend Studio from 2022 until March 2024. Their name has been protected, but their portfolio shows that they were working on an unannounced Bend Studio project and had several images in their portfolio that were seemingly concepts from the Bend project.</p>
<figure>

<p>These images have been <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-sony-bend-new-ip-in-development-screenshots-surface" target="_blank" rel="noopener">uploaded to MP1st</a>, which showcases a Military style game, with a futuristic sci-fi feel to it. Admittedly, the images don't reveal much other than some of the UI elements, and weaponry that players would be able to access. There were some images of the overworld, but it wasn't fully developed yet, and didn't really show off anything that could be seen as significant.</p>
<p>As it's been <a href="https://wccftech.com/days-gone-bend-studio-next-game-multiplayer-open-world-systems/">confirmed by Bend Studio</a> that there are going to be multiplayer elements and an open-world, the theme of a Military style game has potential, especially as it could play relatively similar to Days Gone, just without the zombies.</p>
<p>Of course, this is all speculation at the moment, and it could be that this information isn't relevant at all to the supposed new game in development. While The Game Awards will be taking place this weekend, it's hard to say whether a game like this will make an appearance.</p>

Hassabis and Kavukcuoglu also say that the agents can also “tap into Google Search to connect you with the wealth of gaming knowledge on the web.”</p><p>Google is testing the agents’ “ability to interpret rules and challenges” in games like <em>Clash of Clans</em> and <em>Hay Day </em>from Supercell<em>, </em>according to Hassabis and Kavukcuoglu.</p><p>I’m not surprised Google is chasing these ideas: in theory, an AI agent coaching you through a strategy or puzzle could be useful. It sounds like this work is very early, though, and I have many questions about whether or not these agents actually give sound advice.</p><p>Google is also investing in video games and AI in another way: creating playable virtual worlds on the fly from a prompt image using a “foundation world model” called Genie 2 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/4/24313409/a-google-ai-model-can-create-playable-virtual-worlds-on-the-fly">that it showed off last week</a>. That work seems early, too: Genie 2 can only generate consistent worlds for “up to a minute,” <a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/genie-2-a-large-scale-foundation-world-model/">Google says</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Spotted on r/balatro by user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/balatro/comments/1hb9o5d/new_cyberpunk_2077_update_adds_balatro_sidequest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">dirtygoodking</a> (via <a href="https://in.ign.com/cyberpunk-2077-2/221017/news/cyberpunk-2077-players-discover-secret-quest-based-on-hit-indie-game-added-with-patch-22" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>), the new Balatro quest for Cyberpunk 2077 will begin through a message from Jim B. This character will inform V about “a gang of rogue jokers” that have invaded Night City and are plotting and scheming to seize the city’s gambling scene.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As soon as you get this message, the players are sent on a collection quest to round up all the Jokers across the city. Once you complete the hidden Balatro quest from Cyberpunk 2077’s patch 2.2, you will be rewarded with a new Joker shirt, and a set of Balatro cards will be displayed at your apartment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Radek Grabowski, the Global PR director at CD Projekt Red, provided <a href="https://x.com/gamebowski/status/1866824502988185901" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">additional information</a> on the quest. Grabowski stated that he had already discussed with the quest design team at CDPR about bringing Balatro cards to Cyberpunk 2077. This was made possible thanks to the help of quest designer Maria Mazur and in-house artist <a href="https://x.com/gamebowski/status/1866853584077459647" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Olgierd Ciszak</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Xenoblade Chronicles developer Monolith Soft is now a wholly-owned subsidy of Nintendo. </p>



<p>First spotted by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendo-now-owns-100-of-monolith-soft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Automaton Media</a>, Nintendo <a href="https://www.monolithsoft.co.jp/company/#overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recently acquired</a> the final outstanding shares of Monolith Soft. This comes 17 years after the company first purchased 80% of the shares from Bandai Namco.</p>



<p>Prior to the full share purchase, Nintendo owned 96% percent of the shares. The first 80% came in 2007 while another 16% was purchased from Bandai Namco in 2011. The outstanding 4% were owned by company founders Hirohide Sugiura, Tetsuya Takahashi and Yasuyuki Honne.</p>



<p>It’s unclear when this transaction took place. However, as of <a href="https://www.monolithsoft.co.jp/media/2024/02/monolithsoft_brochure2024-01.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">February 2024</a>, Sugiura, Takahashi, and Honne still owned 4% of the company. That means it clearly happened within the last handful of months.</p>



<p>As far as the future goes, it’s not expected that anything will change. Nintendo has had a controlling stake in the studio for years, and will likely continue on business as usual. What it means, though, is that for the first time since the company was founded in 1999, the original founders will have no official stake in it.</p>



<p>In addition to work on the Xenoblade Chronicles franchise, Monolith has provided support development to games such as Animal  Crossing: New Horizons and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.</p>

                <p>Actor Rob Wiethoff famously portrayed John Marston in Rockstar's acclaimed 2010 Red Dead Redemption, and now he's starting a new project that is completely different and unexpected. Wiethoff, 48, has launched an OnlyFans, but it's not <em>that kind </em>of OnlyFans. After fans discovered he had an OnlyFans set up, Wietoff released a video responding to what he described as "panic" surrounding this.</p><p>"I have an OnlyFans page. I do," Wietoff told his 200,000 followers on Instagram in a video address. It costs $5/month to subscribe.

            <p>The Pokémon Company is teaming up with Wallace and Gromit maker Aardman for a "special project" due in 2027.</p>
<p>Though it's unclear exactly what the project will be, Aardman will be bringing its "unique style of storytelling to the Pokémon universe in brand-new adventures" - presumably a film or TV series.</p>
<p>Aardman is best known for its stop-motion Wallace and Gromit films, but has also dabbled in video games with Shaun the Sheep and Chicken Run spin-offs, as well as the BAFTA-nominated 11-11: Memories Retold set in WW1.</p>

<p>"This is a dream partnership for Pokémon," said Taito Okiura, VP of marketing and media at The Pokémon Company. "Aardman are masters of their craft, and we have been blown away by their talent and creativity. What we have been working on together ensures our global Pokémon fans are in for a treat!"</p>
<p>"It's a huge honour to be working with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/the-pokemon-company">The Pokémon Company International</a> - we feel sincerely privileged to be trusted with bringing their characters and world to life in a brand-new way," added Sean Clarke, managing director of Aardman.</p>
<p>"Bringing together Pokémon, the world's biggest entertainment brand, together with our love of craft, character and comedic storytelling feels incredibly exciting. Aardman and TPCi share an emphasis on heritage and attention to detail as well as putting our fans and audiences at the heart of what we do, which we know will steer us right as we together create charming, original and new stories for audiences around the world."</p><div>

            <p>It's the most wonderful time of the year, and the lovely <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a> lot are embracing the festive season and gifting us all with a Winter Wonder update.</p>
<p>This is a gift, so the update will be free for those who have completed Astro Bot. In a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/12/11/astro-bot-winter-wonder-update-out-tomorrow/?sf275746168=1">PlayStation blog</a> update, developer Team Asobi said it was the studio's way of saying thank you for all the kind words and support since Astro Bot's release back in September.</p>
<p>As for what is actually included, this update adds a new level for players to platform their way through, and yes, it has a wintery theme. Team Asobi is keeping further detail pretty schtum for now, as it says it wants to keep things as much of a surprise as possible. However, the developer has said to expect its snowy level to be filled  with "shiny presents, a good dose of jingle bells, and brand-new special bots to add to your crew".</p>

<p>"This winter update was made with every user in mind, meaning it is a celebration enjoyable for children and adults alike," the Astro Bot team furthered, "so, no hair-pulling challenge this time! :) We had a lot of fun making this special present for you all, and we hope you enjoy it very much, too."</p><p>The update will go live tomorrow, 12th December, at 6pm Pacific time. That's 2am on 13th December, for those of us on the chilly shores of Blighty (where I live, it was -8C last night and I am still defrosting).</p>
<p>Again, to access this Winter Wonder update, players will need to have completed Astro Bot. An internet connection is also required.</p>

			<p>ASTRO BOT is a game that took the world by storm when it was released, giving plenty of fun nods to the expansive history of PlayStation while you get to play as ASTRO BOT, who first made an appearance in The Playroom, with ASTRO BOT being a sequel to Astro's Playroom. It's now been confirmed by Sony Interactive Entertainment and Team ASOBI that a new free update will be released for ASTRO BOT on December 12 at 6 PM PT / 9 PM ET, which adds a little bit of content to the game. There will be a brand-new level for players to explore, as well as new special bots for you to rescue, much like you had to in the previous levels.</p>
<p>However, to be able to access this update, you need to have completed the game first. "Since we want it to remain a little surprise, we will not say too much, but you should expect a fun-filled level with shiny presents, a good dose of jingle bells, and brand-new special bots to add to your crew!" says Studio Director Nicolas Doucet.</p>
<p>While the update isn't as big as the previous one they added to the game, it's nice to see that they are still adding content to the game, especially due to how beloved it is. Across multiple award ceremonies, ASTRO BOT has been the receiver of awards and many nominations, with the game already winning five awards. The Game Awards will be taking place on Friday, where they are nominated for a whopping seven awards this year.</p>
<p>When it comes to the audience they had in mind for this update, it's been confirmed by Doucet that there is no sort of trickery and challenges involved, and it's just meant to be a good time had by all.</p>
<p>"This winter update was made with every user in mind, meaning it is a celebration enjoyable for children and adults alike. So, no hair-pulling challenge this time! We had a lot of fun making this special present for you all, and we hope you enjoy it very much, too."</p>
<p>For more details about the update, you can check out the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/12/11/astro-bot-winter-wonder-update-out-tomorrow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation Blog</a> post, which is where they announced the new content coming to the game.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/golf-with-your-friends-2-brings-more-golf-madness-next-year.1057887/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/golf-with-your-friends-2-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Team17 has announced&nbsp;<em>Golf With Your Friends 2</em>, a followup to the 2020 multiplayer minigolf game&nbsp;<em>Golf With Your Friends</em>, and it's due out sometime next year.</p>

<p>While the first game was developed by Australian studio Blacklight Interactive, development work on the sequel will be handled by UK-based developer Radical Forge. As you'd expect from a sequel,&nbsp;<em>Golf With Your Friends 2&nbsp;</em>will bring new courses, new gameplay mechanics, and more.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://x.com/GolfWYF/status/1866845983797022820" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement post on social media platform X</a>, Team17 and Radical Forge say the game will introduce cross-platform multiplayer, so you'll be able to play it with your friends no matter where they're playing, as well as a "cross-platform level editor" to help you share your crazy golf creations.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/golf-with-your-friends-2-announced-course.jpg?itok=seuMr0kW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/golf-with-your-friends-2-announced-course.jpg?itok=_QwGfoK0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Golf With Your Friends 2&nbsp;</em>will bring new courses and more next year.</figcaption></figure><p>In addition to these features,&nbsp;<em>Golf With Your Friends 2</em>&nbsp;will also bring a new "hazardous weather system" that sounds like it'll throw a spanner in the works, as well as "improved physics" and more. It sounds like this'll be exactly the kind of sequel you've been expecting if you're a fan of the first game.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to new customization options for your golf balls, as well as rewards you can accrue through the game's XP system. It doesn't sound like it'll be a live-service game, though, so it's unlikely you'll need to pay real money to unlock anything.</p>

<p>You can take a look at the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Golf With Your Friends 2&nbsp;</em>right here. It doesn't give much away, but it should get you hyped to play another installment in this franchise.</p>




<p>If you want to check out the original&nbsp;<em>Golf With Your Friends&nbsp;</em>ahead of the sequel's release, you can do so right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/431240/Golf_With_Your_Friends/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/235061" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS4</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/golf-with-your-friends/9N14G09PWG74" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox One</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/golf-with-your-friends-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.</p>

In <a href="https://press.pokemon.com/en/releases/Pokemon-Aardman-Team-Up-for-Exciting-Collaboration-Coming-2027">a press release</a> about the collaboration, TCP marketing and media VP Taito Okiura described it as “a dream partnership for Pokémon.” Aardman’s managing director Sean Clarke added that it was both a huge honor and privilege to be tasked with presenting the Pokémon world in a new way.</p><p>“Bringing together Pokémon, the world’s biggest entertainment brand, together with our love of craft, character and comedic storytelling feels incredibly exciting,” Clarke said. “Aardman and TPCi share an emphasis on heritage and attention to detail as well as putting our fans and audiences at the heart of what we do, which we know will steer us right as we together create charming, original and new stories for audiences around the world.”</p><p>Aside from the projected release year, there aren’t all that many details about what the collaboration is or how we’ll be able to consume it. Clearly, stop-motion claymation will be involved, but what’s less obvious is whether this will end up being a movie, a series, or perhaps a game — which <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYJuoDhPDfE">wouldn’t be a first for Aardman</a>. This sort of team-up makes a lot of sense for TCPi after the success of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/2/18525323/detective-pikachu-review-pokemon"><em>Detective Pikachu</em></a><em> </em>and surprise delights like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24017505/pokemon-concierge-review-netflix"><em>Pokémon Concierge</em></a><em>. </em>And the closer we get to 2027, it’s feels like there’s a very strong chance this will be something that has people buzzing.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Another season, another TOTY. The EA community picks their favorite eleven players for the men’s and women’s professional games each season, culminating in the best promo each game. EA FC 25’s Team of the Year promo beckons, and we have everything you need to know.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-ea-sports-fc-25-tactics-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA FC 25</a> has a ton of promos each game. Gone are the days when Team of the Week is the main course from which to pull cards. Now, EA’s soccer titles have a new promo almost every week. But it doesn’t matter how cool the designs get or how special the cards are, there’s one promotion to rule them all—Team of the Year. </p>



<p>We are fast closing in on 2025, and TOTY kickstarts the year off with a bang. It doesn’t matter if this is your first TOTY or your tenth, check out the latest details regarding the promo.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-the-ea-fc-25-toty-release-date">Do we Know the EA FC 25 TOTY Release Date?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>EA FC 24 was stacked. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>There is no official start date for EA FC 25’s Team of the Year promo; however, if we look at FIFA 23 and FC 24’s TOTY start dates, the first round of cards go into packs on the <strong>third Friday of January</strong>—although there are five Fridays in January 2025. So, you can probably expect to start your TOTY card hunt on either <strong>Friday, Jan. 17, 2025, or Friday, Jan. 24, 2025</strong>.</p>



<p>The Goalkeeper and Defenders, Midfielders, or Attackers are released for a couple of days, then another position gets 48 hours to shine, and the final set of players goes last. After everyone gets their turn, it’s time for a week-long pack hunt as the entire Team of the Year is put into packs and crashes the market.</p>







<p>We expect the EA FC site to have a <strong>dedicated Team of the Year Promo Vote page</strong>—like every year—<strong>allowing you to vote for the eleven players you feel have earned their spot in the best XI</strong>.</p>



<p>A ton of nominees are decided before the official TOTY announcement. You have the difficult choice of choosing one player for every position, and this is done for the Men’s and Women’s TOTY. The winners are eventually announced, showing you who earned the much sought-after spots.</p>



<h2 id="h-potential-ea-fc-25-toty-nominees">Potential EA FC 25 TOTY Nominees</h2>



<p>It’s been another year of incredible football around Europe and the rest of the world. EA FC 25’s TOTY vote is expected to be fiercely contested, and this is only fair when you’re dealing with potential game-breaking cards rated 95, 96, 97, and maybe higher!</p>



<p>Here are our predictions for who we think is in contention for EA FC 25’s Team of the Year promo.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/toem-2-announced</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/toem-2-promises-more-monochrome-photography-shenanigans.1057851/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/toem-2-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Swedish studio Something We Made has announced&nbsp;<em>Toem 2</em>, a followup to its 2021 monochromatic photography puzzler, and it's currently in the very early stages of development.</p>

<p>We don't know too much about the game right now, but Something We Made is promising a "brand new adventure" that's all about "documenting the world's little wonders", so it sounds very much like the sequel will be following in <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/toem" rel="nofollow">the original game</a>'s footsteps.</p>

<p>It looks like <i>Toem 2</i>'s visual style will also be an upgrade over the original; while it'll sport the same monochromatic color scheme, the graphics seem to have been improved, and it seems as though the new game will adopt a more traditional 3D perspective as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/toem-2-announced-square.jpg?itok=BFcetWiX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/toem-2-announced-square.jpg?itok=-z3YFmQt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Toem 2&nbsp;</em>looks like it's taking a slightly different visual direction to the original.</figcaption></figure><p>Like the first game,&nbsp;<em>Toem 2&nbsp;</em>will revolve around "uncovering little details" in the game's world, and you'll also be "helping friends along the way", so it sounds like you'll be taking on photography requests just like in&nbsp;<em>Toem</em>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we don't have a release date or even a release window for&nbsp;<em>Toem 2&nbsp;</em>yet; Something We Made says the game is in very early development right now, so it could be a few years before we hear from this one again.</p>

<p>While you wait, you can check out the teaser trailer for&nbsp;<em>Toem 2&nbsp;</em>right here. It shows off what the game's art style will be like, but (understandably given the game's stage of development) it doesn't give too much away beyond that.</p>




<p>If you didn't check out the original&nbsp;<em>Toem</em>, it was a low-key cozy photography game in which you took on a variety of tasks given to you by a range of quirky characters.</p>

<p>The original game is available to check out right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1307580/TOEM_A_Photo_Adventure/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/toem/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/toem/9n7zcllr01b3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/toem-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>, and you can wishlist&nbsp;<em>Toem 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2900640/TOEM_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a> if you want to keep up with its progress.</p>

But another thing it is, on PC at least, is buggy. I’ve had a bunch of freezes, which suck, but worst was the moment when companion Gina just refused to follow her script, and my game—which offers no way to manually save—was softlocked. But, it turns out, there’s a rather hidden feature that got me out of trouble!</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Searching around on the worldwide information superhighway, I know I’m not alone in hitting an issue with Gina’s AI in the Collapsed Hall section within Gizeh. While I’ve seen posts from others reporting it occurring in slightly different sections of the level, the problem remains the same: she just refuses to budge, and therefore doesn’t trigger an obligatory sequence of dialogue that’s required to let you continue. And that sucks too. </p><p>It sucks even more that without a quicksave, nor even a manual save (why? <em>why?!</em>), the bug was locked in already at the point the game had last saved for me. Jumping into a pit caused Gina to wake from her stupor and wail at my demise, but then she was back, catatonic, staring at a wall when I miraculously revived. I felt completely stuck, no way to get out of this pickle. Until I saw mention of a “rollback” option.

The standard pause screen has an option to “Restart Checkpoint,” which is useless if you’re in a similar situation.

It’s like finding an ancient artefact in a mysterious tomb! Because tucked away at the bottom-left of the screen is text that opaquely says, “Save Rollback.” </p><p>This odd terminology hides a little menu that contains the three previous checkpoint saves that occurred before the current one (there’s no clear explanation of this, but none of them is the most recent), letting you jump back in time to an earlier moment. The times they’re labeled with are not clock times, but rather indicate how long you’d been playing, so you’ll be able to see how many minutes of progress you’re about to lament repeating—in my particular case it was only about five minutes, although it involved solving a boring mirror puzzle for a second time, complete with unskippable cutscenes.</p><hr><p>I’m so relieved this feature is in the game, given otherwise I’d have lost 10 hours of progress and likely never bothered playing again. But it remains a mystery greater than any Indy ever investigated why you can’t just manually save for yourself.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The First Berserker: Khazan, the souls-like game from Nexon, has had its release date leaked by the reliable <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/on-vous-devoile-la-date-de-sortie-et-de-nouvelles-informations-sur-le-jeu-the-first-berserker-khazan-59763" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">billbil-kun</a>.</p>



<p>According to the leaker, the game will be released on March 27, 2025. He also said that the official announcement will be made tomorrow at The Game Awards 2024. Pre-orders will start immediately after the event.</p>



<p>Interestingly, the game will be sold 10 dollars lower than usual, going for U$60. I had the opportunity to test a closed beta of the game and I had the impression that the title was ready for release.</p>



<p>During my playthrough, all I got was the feeling that it needs some slight balancing adjustments, given that some enemies can destroy the protagonist with two hits. The bosses, even the initial ones, were extremely challenging, and I’m a veteran of the genre. It’s a similar feeling to the first NiOh, with the first demo on the beach.</p>



<p>The First Berserker: Khazan is set in the DNF universe. As the subtitle suggests, the game stars Khazan, a legendary general who ended up being betrayed by the Empire. The narrative sets the general on a journey of revenge.</p>



<p>The game is scheduled for release on PS5, PC and Xbox Series. Unlike other Nexon games, this title will be single-player focused.</p>
