<p>It’s not a strange concept whatsoever – footballers are investing in the esports industry all the time. From David Beckham’s ambassadorship of Guild Esports to Sergio Aguero’s foundation of KRU, these top-tier sports personalities are moving more into esports with each passing day. I recently had a sit down with Robert Lewandowski to discuss the synergy between esports and traditional sports, which was enlightening.</p>



<p>Now, according to one of Diogo Jota’s managers, the Liverpool player wants to start a Counter-Strike team, which would assumedly sit under the banner of Luna Galaxy, the superstar player’s established esports organisation.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-next-step">The Next Step</h2>



<p>Diogo Jota’s esports organisation – Luna Galaxy – already has a foothold in various games, such as Rocket League and EA Sports FC, but Counter-Strike 2 could be the player’s next vertical. He was recently spotted at the Esports World Cup attending the grand final in the Counter-Strike 2 tournament between G2 Esports and Natus Vincere. </p>



<p>In a quick chat with one of his managers, it was revealed that while Jota doesn’t play CS2 himself, he wants to field a team in the space.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s not a bad idea – Counter-Strike sits at the top of the esports table and is one of the most consistently popular games in the world. The esports ecosystem around Counter-Strike 2 has tens of millions of dollars pumped into it every year, and it’s one of the most prolific games in the landscape – Jota would undoubtedly enjoy making a foray into the scene.</p>

<p>Fallout: London was released on July 26 to a relatively mixed reception, with the launch of the game-sized mod being marred by instability and constant crashes. I managed to get hands-on with the mega-mod after a lot of work which saw me installing it first for Steam, realising it wouldn’t work, then buying Fallout 4: GOTY on GOG and reinstalling the entire setup. It then worked, but it wasn’t without issues.</p>



<p>Here’s my Fallout: London review and early impressions of the snippets I’ve seen before I was blocked entirely by constant crashes.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-can-t-beat-free">Can’t Beat Free</h2>



<p>Fallout: London is free – unless you’re like me and you need to buy the game on GOG to get it running. The mod is hosted on GOG, it’s downloaded via GOG <strong>exclusively</strong>, and when you do so, you’ll notice that there’s a GOG-themed outfit you can pick up in Fallout: London right off the bat. It’s a bit shady that it runs best on GOG’s version of Fallout 4, but that’s a debate for another day.</p>



<p>I’m (almost) a Londoner – I live around half a mile outside one of the city’s boroughs and regularly dip in to do the tourist thing. I think I’m relatively well-placed to pass judgment on the city represented in Fallout: London, and I’d love to do so, but I managed to explore so little of the city that it’s moot.</p>



<p>From what I did see, I can stress that Fallout: London is deeply authentic in its representation of the United Kingdom. Everything is quintessentially British, from the scenery to the finer details (such as calling an elevator a ‘lift’), and as someone local to London, the minor opportunities I had to explore did reveal to me an environment that felt accurate. I had a glimpse at the top-down map in the game’s ‘Atta-Boy’ device and was surprised at the size and scope of it – it’s <strong>enormous</strong>.</p>



<p>That’s where a lot of my positivity about Fallout: London comes from. It’s hard to believe that something this big is completely free. With 200 quests, 20 factions, an entire city built from the ground up, celebrity voice actors, and a genuinely innovative take on a long-established post-apocalyptic series, Fallout: London feels like a premium game.</p>



<p>It even launched with immense issues – which is typical for an AAA title these days.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-fallout-london-good">Is Fallout: London Good?</h2>



<p>I’m basing this on about 20 minutes of gameplay, but Fallout: London <strong>is </strong>good. I didn’t want to like it because it’s a lore-breaking concept at best, but it has so much potential, that it’s unreal. Let me reel off some of the things that impressed me the most:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>The voice acting is the best I’ve ever heard in a mod</strong> – it’s studio quality</li>



<li><strong>The world-building is phenomenal</strong> – you feel like you’re in a Bethesda-crafted city</li>



<li><strong>The sheer depth of originality is unmatched</strong> – every weapon, creature, character, and even the detritus and base concepts of the game such as perks and skills are original</li>



<li><strong>The scope of this mod is awe-inspiring</strong> – the size of the map, the depth of the story, and the sheer number of people involved in its creation are all mind-boggling</li>
</ul>



<p>Fallout: London incorporates elements of other mods and is inspired by other successful creations brought about by the Fallout community. Some base elements are such subtle improvements to the overall Fallout 4 experience, it’s nuts. For instance, the movement mechanics – you don’t just break into a straight sprint, but a run turns into a sprint over a few seconds, giving you the impression of your character having inertia applied to them.</p>



<p>I’m genuinely quite heartbroken that Fallout: London appears to be unplayable for many people. It’s being hit hard on social media and in reviews because it’s so difficult to get it running. The installation process is far from being simple, and it looks as though you need to buy the game on GOG to get anywhere with it. I managed to get 20 – 25 minutes into the game before a string of crash loops made it <strong>impossible </strong>to progress.</p>



<p>I sincerely hope the FOLON team can patch some of these issues up, as the minute they do, I’ll be neck-deep in Fallout: London.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/adin-ross-unbanned-on-twitch/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Adin Ross was banned on Twitch more than a year ago, and it was months after that we learned why. During a ‘multistream’, he had a chat window open on his Twitch stream taken from <strong>Kick</strong>, and in that chat window, multiple slurs and insults were displayed. This earned him a permanent ban, and to this day, the idea of him resurfacing on Twitch hasn’t really been considered. </p>



<p>Now, Twitch’s CEO, Dan Clancy, has revealed that a sit-down with Adin Ross and a genuine chat could result in the controversial creator being reinstated on the platform.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-changed">Changed</h2>



<p>Following a lengthy break from streaming, Adin Ross recently returned to the scene to stress that he was ‘changed’ and that he didn’t want to spend his time aggravating people on stream or falling in and out of scandalous situations. Instead, he revealed that he wanted to partner with other creators and make genuinely interesting and innovative content to ‘fix’ his image.</p>



<p>It seems that this promise has piqued the interest of Dan Clancy, the CEO of Twitch who recently engaged in a phone call with FaZe Ronaldo, stressing his openness to gauging Adin Ross’ new mentality for himself:</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>FaZe Ronaldo called the Twitch CEO Dan Clancy to ask him to unban Adin Ross</p><p>“I’m open to chatting with him… to see if he can convince me that he really is different” <a href="https://t.co/4babRVqBhv">pic.twitter.com/4babRVqBhv</a></p></div>— Jake Lucky (@JakeSucky) <a href="https://twitter.com/JakeSucky/status/1816675536195793223?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 26, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>It wouldn’t be the first time that Clancy has been instrumental in reversing a permanent ban. Some will likely never get the opportunity to return to the platform, like the recently disgraced Dr Disrespect, but the door is now open ever so slightly wider for Adin Ross. Given that for a time he was Kick’s flagship creator, how will the Stake-backed streaming site react to Clancy’s interest in bringing Ross back to Twitch?</p>

<p>Activision has just published a document online titled ‘Matchmaking Series: The Role of Skill in Matchmaking’, which blows the lid off SBMM, the much-debated mechanic that’s designed to keep players engaged in Call of Duty for as long as possible. This expansive, revealing document spends 25 pages breaking down the concept of ‘skill’ in the overarching SBMM model, with Activision’s teams confirming <strong>what skills </strong>are examined by the mechanic.</p>



<p>Oh, and they also revealed a secret experiment that took place to see how players performed with massively lowered levels of SBMM.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-everything-is-revealed">Everything is Revealed</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://www.activision.com/cdn/research/CallofDuty_Matchmaking_Series_2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the sizeable document published by Activision</a>, one of the biggest contributors to ‘Skill-Based Matchmaking’ is discussed: <strong><em>Skill</em></strong><em>.</em></p>



<p>The opening pages of the document revealed that ‘skill’ is calculated using three criteria:</p>



<ul>
<li>Match Total Kills</li>



<li>Kill / Death Ratio</li>



<li>Kills / Deaths by Enemy</li>
</ul>



<p>That last one is clever, as it enables Activision to give you an accurate skill reading regardless of ‘self-killing’ deaths. That means that players can’t ‘break’ SBMM by repeatedly killing themselves to drop their K/D artificially. The team went in-depth about the various tests they’ve performed over the years to continually refine SBMM. </p>



<p>In 2024, Activision performed a secret experiment on Modern Warfare 3, dropping the skill metrics from SBMM for thousands of players to see how it panned out. The test was run for an entire month, during which players would have been matched more ‘randomly’ against competitors. In a report discussing the findings of this experiment, Activision noted that with reduced skill considerations in the SBMM mechanics, 90% of players suffered from a reduced ‘returning player rate’.</p>



<p>Put simply, when lobbies were more randomised and skill wasn’t taken into consideration, players quickly abandoned the game and took long to return. Further, the team tracked an increase in ‘quit rate’ in 80% of all players taking part in the secret test, which is a huge figure. It proves that players get increasingly frustrated when SBMM <strong>isn’t </strong>as strong as it should be.</p>



<p>Again, Activision pointed out that the first thing the matchmaking process looks for is geolocation, matching players with other gamers that are close to them geographically. Then, the system considers skill, using a player’s percentile rating to match them with closely aligned users. Then, the players’ desired control schemes are considered. </p>



<p>There was an interesting scenario outlined by the team that shows how matchmaking works when you queue with a talented player:</p>



<p><em>‘Take for instance a party of two players, Alice and Bob, Bob is an average player with 50% skill percentile and Alice is an elite player with 99% skill percentile. If we matchmake them with Bob’s skill, Alice is practically guaranteed to be the best player in every lobby they join, more so than if she played solo. If we matchmake on Alice’s skill, then Bob will likely be the worst player in every lobby they join. Thus, we must match them in the middle such that the worst player gets some opponents of equal footing while minimizing the inherent advantage of the better player.’</em></p>



<p>Ultimately, this is the deepest dive we’ve ever had into how SBMM works. While it’s understandably being tweaked all the time, the fundamentals have remained the same for years. It’s nothing short of interesting for Call of Duty fans and pro players.</p>

<p>It seems like every day there is a new esports tournament being announced with a massive prize pool and various games being showcased. Many of these tournaments would never exist if not for some of the biggest events in esports that still stand at the top of the industry each year. There is a staggering list of the best esports events that make up the core following of the wider industry – they’re the shining gems that glow amid thousands of annual competitions.</p>



<p>To that end, here is a list of some of the top esports tournaments in the business today.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-top-esports-tournaments">The Top Esports Tournaments</h2>



<p>Some of the best esports tournaments are being run yearly, making them incredibly popular. With increasing popularity, it seems as if a large majority of these tournaments will continue every year, as there is no shortage of funding.  From fighting games to first-person shooters, many of these tournaments focus on one title, while others mix a variety of games for a massive weekend of events.</p>



<p>Some of the biggest esport events even hold multiple tournaments a year, giving viewers and players a chance to participate at least once.</p>



<p>Here are some of the best and biggest tournaments in esports.</p>







<figure></figure>







<p>Being one of the world’s largest MOBAs, League of Legends is deserving of its World Championship that is held each year. In fact, in 2023, the League of Legends World Championship broke records as the most-viewed esports tournament of all time.</p>



<p>The game continues to keep itself at the top with one of the biggest viewer bases on Twitch and millions of dollars on the line each year during the World Championship.</p>



<p>For casual players, the game continues to keep itself in the spotlight, which has helped push its esports events to the top.</p>



<h2 id="h-dreamhack">DreamHack</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>DreamHack has been around for years now, as this massive convention is a stronghold within the esports world. With some of the best esports events taking place at DreamHack, many fans from around the world travel to attend.</p>



<p>The best part about DreamHack? It has multiple events a year. Not only that, but the convention showcases multiple games. From Fortnite tournaments to Rocket League tournaments to Super Smash Bros. tournaments, DreamHack has it all. </p>



<p>It’s a relatively cheap event to attend and happens in multiple cities around the world, giving everyone a chance to travel to it. Some of the tournaments also feature prize pools that sit around a quarter million dollars.</p>



<p>DreamHack has everything a gamer could need, from large tournaments to free-to-play small ones, making it one of the best esports events in the world.</p>







<h2 id="h-fortnite-globals">Fortnite Globals</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Following the success of the Fortnite World Cup back in 2019, Fortnite officially launched Fortnite Globals. This large esports tournament happens once a year in the fall, as many big online tournaments are held throughout the year leading up to it.</p>



<p>Those who qualify in one of the three FNCS (Fortnite Championship Series) that are held throughout the year will be flown to wherever Fortnite Globals is held. The tournament only features 200 players (100 duos) and usually has a prize pool of a couple of million dollars.</p>



<p>With a massive fan base, competitive Fortnite continues to grow as more and more people have been attending these large events. The event usually brings out multiple creators too, such as SypherPK, Sommerset and more, to help push popularity.</p>



<p>Fortnite Globals still stands to be one of the most valuable esports tournaments, as many Battle Royales struggle to gain the traction that Fortnite has.</p>







<figure></figure>







<p>The Apex Legends Global Series (ALGS) is another massive Battle Royale series that happens once a year. With some of the best Apex Legends teams in the world competing, this tournament never seems to fall short of a massive viewership.</p>



<p>In 2023, the ALGS had a $2,000,000 prize pool, making it one of the top esports tournaments in the world. While the game continues to thrive on Twitch and YouTube, it also continues to make a name for itself within the competitive gaming world.</p>



<p>Many organizations have their own Apex Legends team, as it is one of the top esports for organizations to invest in right now.</p>



<h2 id="h-dota-2-the-international">Dota 2: The International</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>While Dota 2 may not have as big a fan base online as some of the other games listed, this title still has one of the largest tournament series in the world. The Dota 2: International has been around since 2011, making it one of the longest-running major esports series.</p>



<p>With only 16 teams making it to the finals held each year in Copenhagen, and a $1,600,000 prize pool, The International continues to shape the way esports tournaments run throughout the world.</p>



<p>Standing as a pioneer within the competitive gaming tournaments world. Dota 2: The International continues to stay at the top.</p>







<h2 id="h-call-of-duty-league-championship">Call of Duty League Championship</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Call of Duty League is another yearly tournament that features the popular title, Call of Duty. Each year, the Call of Duty Championship is held, which takes place at the end of the league’s season. </p>



<p>With hundreds of thousands of viewers each year and millions of dollars on the line, the Call of Duty League is by far one of the most important esports tournaments in the world. As the Call of Duty franchise continues to release games, this tournament series will only grow to bigger and better heights.</p>



<p>Like Apex Legends, many organizations have invested in the Call of Duty League, putting together teams of their own to compete. In the COD esports space, there’s nothing bigger than COD Champs.</p>







<figure></figure>







<p>The Capcom Cup, part of the Capcom Pro Tour, is one of the biggest fighting game tournaments in the world. With a focus on Street Fighter, this esports series has been a leading path for other fighting game tournaments.</p>



<p>The event series began back in 2013 and is now holding yearly events with the most recent Street Fighter title, Street Fighter 6. Like other top esports tournaments, the Capcom Cup has multiple qualifiers that players have to go through to make it to the finals.</p>



<p>The Capcom Cup has been held in multiple regions, including Japan, the US and Europe, making it incredibly popular throughout the entire globe.</p>



<h2 id="h-evo">Evo</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>While on the topic of fighting game tournaments, a massive esports series such as the Evo tournaments needs to be mentioned. Held yearly, the Evo esports events feature a plethora of fighting games, including Street Fighter, Tekken, Mortal Kombat and more.</p>



<p>This series is easily one of the biggest esports events in the world, as it takes fan bases from multiple different games and clashes them together. With large prize pools for every game (some bigger than others), the Evo series has yet to decline in popularity.</p>



<p>The event is commonly held in the summer each year, making it an extremely popular esports event.</p>







<h2 id="h-rocket-league-championship-series">Rocket League Championship Series</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Rocket League Championship Series (RLCS) is a one-of-a-kind in the world of esports tournaments. Having an event held each year, the RLCS continues to prove why Rocket League is one of the top competitive games.</p>



<p>The tournament series features multiple Majors that players must participate in to qualify for the finals. Not only does the event feature a large prize pool, but its broadcast has consistently done great numbers throughout the past few years.</p>



<h2 id="h-esports-world-cup">Esports World Cup</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>There is no tournament series out there that is as big as the Esports World Cup at the moment. Held every summer in Saudi Arabia, this <em>huge </em>esports tournament features almost every large title in gaming.</p>



<p>From Fortnite to Counter-Strike to Rocket League, the Esports World Cup has millions of dollars on the line for each game. The 2024 Esports World Cup had a prize pool accumulative of $60 million.</p>



<p>The event features some of the top gamers around the world, as many pro players get an invite ahead of the game. There are also various qualifiers, too, that bring players to the event, as many are held throughout the year (DreamHack, PGL Stockholm, etc).</p>



<h2 id="h-olympic-esports-games">Olympic Esports Games</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Being recently announced, the Olympic Esports have already gained quite a bit of traction in the world of gaming. While the first esports event in the Olympics will not happen until 2025, many are already expecting it to be one of the most-viewed tournament series in gaming.</p>



<p>While we only have speculation of the games that will be involved in the Olympics, competitive players are already gearing up to try and participate in next year’s event.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-games-announces-mortal-kombat-1-khaos-reigns/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Warner Bros. Games announced that Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns, a new expansion, will be released. A new Kombat Pack, adding six new characters to the game, will launch alongside the expansion. The expansion will be released digitally on September 24 at 8 AM PDT / 10 AM CDT / 11 AM EDT / 4 PM BST for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation, and PC.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PF7nFD80g3M" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new expansion</a> adds a new cinematic narrative to the pre-existing story mode. After ridding of the invaders who endangered Fire God Liu Kang's New Era of Peace, a new threat arrives in their place from an alternate timeline. The invaders are led by Titan Havik, who aims to bring the realm to its knees, prompting Liu Kang to rally his army once more to defeat the danger.</p>
<p>With the addition of Kombat Pack 2, returning combatants such as Noob Saibot, Cyrax, and Sektor will be joining the fray. In addition to the three returning fighters, guest fighters such as Ghostface, T-1000 (Terminator), and Conan the Barbarian are making their debut appearance in Mortal Kombat 1.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, those who aren't interested in the story mode but want to get their hands on Kombat Pack 2 will have to purchase the entire Khaos Reigns expansion, as Kombat Pack 2 is not being sold as a standalone bundle. Khaos Reigns will cost $49.99 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and $39.99 for those who play the game on Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>For those who already own <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mortal-kombat-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mortal Kombat 1</a>, the fan-favorite feature of Animalities will return as a free content update for all game owners. This feature allows characters to morph into their spirit animal to decimate their defeated opponents. Animalities can be performed by all playable fighters and will be available on September 24 in conjunction with the expansion release.</p>
<p>In addition to these new add-ons, all owners of Mortal Kombat 1 will receive a free MK 95 Scorpion character skin inspired by the original Mortal Kombat movie, which will be available in-game today.</p>
<p>For those eager to get their hands on the expansion, you can pre-order it on all platforms as of today. The expansion will include both the Khaos Reigns expansion and the Kombat Pack 2. All pre-orders will receive four new character skins at launch, which include Wedding Scorpion, Empress Mileena, and Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 versions of Sub-Zero and Noob Saibot.</p>
<p>Ghostface, T-1000, and Conan the Barbarian will be released post-launch, with a one-week early access period provided to those who own the Khaos Reigns expansion.</p>
<p>If you are someone who doesn't yet own the game, you can additionally pre-order the Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns Bundle on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC for $59.99 and Nintendo Switch for $49.99, which will grant you immediate access to the previous Kombat Pack. Additionally, for any new Mortal Kombat 1 players, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/mortal-kombat-1-trailer-reveals-dlc-fighter-takeda-takahashi/">first Kombat Pack</a> is now available as part of the Mortal Kombat 1 Premium Edition, or you can purchase it separately.</p>

It unfolds after the events of the story campaign and centers on the invasion of Titan Havik from an alternate reality, who seeks to spread anarchy across all timelines.</p>

<p>The expansion's cinematic story introduces new playable characters, Noob Saibot and the now female Sektor and Cyrax. These three fighters make up half of Kombat Pack 2 and will be available when the DLC launches on September 24.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In keeping with the tradition of prior games, the second half of Kombat Pack 2 features guest fighters from various films. <em>Scream</em>’s Ghostface, <em>Terminator 2</em>’s T-1000, and Conan the Barbarian are on the way, but there’s no release window for their arrival. Kombat Pack 2 comes included with Khaos Reigns and cannot be purchased as a standalone character bundle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Animalities are making their return as a free content update upon Khaos Reigns’ release. First introduced in Mortal Kombat 3, these beastial finishing moves see fighters morph into animals to eviscerate opponents. The trailer reveals Mileena can turn into a giant, horrifying praying mantis, for example, and a press release states every playable fighter will have an Animality (which would include the movie-born guest fighters for an interesting thought).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Speaking of free content, today, owners will receive the MK95 Scorpion skin modeled after his appearance in the live-action 1995 Mortal Kombat film.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Khaos Reigns launches digitally on September 24 for all platforms MK1 is available on. It will run for $49.99 on every platform except for Switch, where it costs $39.99.

Alongside gameplay we have first-look images of each DLC fighter joining the Mortal Kombat 1 roster. The DLC, titled Khaos Reigns, includes the three aforementioned movie representatives, as well as Noob Saibot, Sektor, and Cyrax. It launches digitally on September 24 across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC (Steam and Epic Games Store).</p><p>Like many characters in the alternate universe that is Mortal Kombat 1, Noob Saibot, voiced by Kaiji Tang, sports a new look. It’s Sektor and Cyrax who get the biggest changes, though, as NetherRealm has revealed that both characters are female in this universe. Sektor voice actor Erika Ishii also says that their character is not a robot like in past entries and is instead human this time around. Cyrax is voiced by Enuka Okuma.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Here's the Khaos Reigns story setup, per publisher Warner Bros. Games:</p><blockquote>After repelling the invaders who endangered Fire God Liu Kang’s New Era of peace, Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns expands the story campaign with an all-new cinematic narrative. When a perilous threat arrives from an alternate timeline, led by the ruthless Titan Havik whose sole mission is to throw the realms into khaos, Liu Kang must rally his champions and put faith in his enemies to defeat this grave danger. If they fail, the New Era will be reduced to anarchy.</blockquote><blockquote>Adding to the growing roster of playable fighters, Kombat Pack 2 features returning kombatants Noob Saibot, voiced by Kaiji Tang; Cyrax, voiced by Enuka Okuma; and Sektor, voiced by Erika Ishii, all with unique backstories as part of the reimagined Mortal Kombat 1 Universe. As Sub-Zero, Bi-Han was the Lin Kuei’s ruthless Grandmaster, but his soul was stolen by Titan Havik to create the perfect henchman, Noob Saibot, who is now dedicated to fomenting anarchy. Born into the Zaki, one of the Lin Kuei's many sub-clans, Cyrax became a martial arts prodigy with an independent streak and untamed desire to serve the clan on her terms, or not at all. Growing up immersed in Lin Kuei culture under the tutelage of her parents, Sektor becomes a master armorer, skilled warrior, and Sub-Zero’s most trusted lieutenant, committed to advancing the clan’s future at all costs.</blockquote><p>Ghostface is one character who keeps nearly the same look across each movie they appear in, so it's no surprise to see them show up here with few changes. Terminators, on the other hand, come in many shapes and sizes, with NetherRealm using Arnold Schwarzenegger's take on the character for DLC in Mortal Kombat 11. Patrick provided voice work and his likeness for Khaos Reigns, while Conan brings back Schwarzenegger's appearance for another round, too.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/26/kombat-pack-2-1722031394032.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Mortal Kombat 1 Kombat Pack 2 roster.</figcaption></figure></output><p>It's currently unclear when each of Mortal Kombat 1's Kombat Pack 2 fighters will be released. It's also unclear when more gameplay will be released or how NetherRealm has chosen to tackle each of their innevitably gory Fatalities.</p><p>Unfortunately, every character in the Khaos Reigns Kombat Pack 2 was known a month ahead of today's SDCC reveal thanks to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-dataminer-unearths-what-looks-like-the-next-6-dlc-characters">a datamine leak</a>. Still, the official announcement brings fresh looks at how these characters will be portrayed, with NetherRealm also confirming that longtime Scream actor, Roger L. Jackson, voices Ghostface. Arnold Schwarzenegger does not provide voice work for Conan.</p><p>Mortal Kombat 1 Kombat Pack 2 continues the studio's trend of bringing crossover characters into the fold. In addition to a host of other classic fighters, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-homelander-peacemaker">Kombat Pack 1</a> introduced a few not-so-super comic book characters, including Homelander from The Boys and Omni-Man from Invincible.

Between historic union wins at <a href="https://aftermath.site/bethesda-union-unionize-fallout-elder-scrolls-starfield" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bethesda</a> and <a href="https://aftermath.site/wow-activision-union-microsoft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blizzard</a> and, as of yesterday, <a href="https://aftermath.site/sag-aftra-video-game-voice-actor-strike" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a video game voice actor strike over AI</a>, gaming’s version of hot labor summer is in full swing. On this week’s episode of Aftermath Hours, we talk about the rapidly-growing movement that could reshape game development as we know it.</p><p>We tackle a very eventful week, beginning with news that broke mere minutes before we started recording: video game voice actors and mocap performers are going on strike. Major companies – including EA, Take-Two, and Activision – aren’t guaranteeing them necessary AI-related protections, so they’re taking to the picket line. We reflect on how things reached this boiling point and consider what might happen next.&nbsp;</p><p>After that, we discuss Humble Games, which <a href="https://aftermath.site/humble-games-layoffs-closure-ziff-davis-ign" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">laid off its entire staff</a> – replacing them with a third-party company – and had the gall to call it a “restructuring.” Then we talk about what might protect other game workers against similar ravages: Hundreds of game developers at both Blizzard and Bethesda unionized, giving them leverage previously unheard of among rank-and-file employees at massive, multinational video game companies. Others, inevitably, will learn from their example.&nbsp;</p><p>Next we discuss Ubisoft’s decision <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-statement-yasuke-1851602337" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to try to appease bad-faith arguments</a> against the next <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, and then finally, Chris tells us about<em> </em><a href="https://aftermath.site/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-feels-like-it-shouldnt-exist" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Kunitsu-Gami</em></a>, a game that just sounds neat. Also, we decide which animal – aside from apes – would be the best gamer.&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can cover labor movements in video games from now until the end of time.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation:</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>I imagine what comes out of the contract negotiation process for these unions will be very enlightening and very useful to lots of unions – just seeing how they work together.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Relevant to all of this is the fact that another one of the unions associated with all of this, the 376-member Zenimax union – so, you know, parent company of Bethesda – <a href="https://aftermath.site/as-video-game-industry-goes-all-in-on-ai-workers-race-to-secure-their-rights" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced last December</a> that they had reached an agreement with Microsoft about AI. That directly ties back to all the voice actor strike stuff, albeit within a company versus pertaining to voice acted performances. The agreement they reached said that it will commit Zenimax to uses of AI that "augment human ingenuity and capacities ... without causing workers harm" and requires that Zenimax provides notice to the union in cases where "AI implementation may impact the work of union members and to bargain those impacts upon request."</p><p>So basically, the idea is that they are trying to ensure that AI will not be used to replace people’s jobs – and that it will only be able to assist people in particular ways. They’re already going to bat on that. They’re already trying to ensure that they’ve secured protections on [a similar front to SAG-AFTRA]. As we’re seeing, the sooner you can build that labor power and make that happen, the better off you are. </p><p>Because then at these other companies – and this is unfortunate, but that includes Activision Blizzard, per <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-is-already-taking-jobs-in-the-video-game-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reporting from Wired this week</a> – video game companies are already moving really quickly to implement AI in ways that are not always great for workers and that often push them out. So again, the sooner the better, and the bigger these unions grow – and the more power they have through both strength in numbers and in terms of being cross-disciplinary and able to understand through communication with each other how workers stand to be impacted – the faster they can get on the same page and prevent these sorts of worst case scenarios from coming to pass.</p><p>I think Riley, as you were saying, when these bigger unions are able to secure protections – and even just pay increases and quality-of-life improvements that everybody wants – other people in the games industry are gonna be looking. They’re gonna be like “I want that too, and I see how they managed to make that happen. It doesn’t seem that hard. There’s a clear path.” It’s not just this nebulous thing of “It sure would be cool if I could have that, but oh well, it’s never gonna happen for me.” It’s like, no, here’s how you do it. Here’s a guide. In fact, if you reach out to the people who did this, they’ll probably help you. They’ll probably say “Yeah, of course we want more unions in the industry. We’ll send you all our resources. We’ll talk to you and walk you through it. Whatever you need.”</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>Would you say this was a good week or a bad week? More good than bad?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I think it’s a week where you can see forces playing off each other. You can see the possible bad outcomes and then also the ways that people can band together to prevent them from happening again in the future. And again, these are really big wins. These are incredibly significant. I saw Jason Schreier on <a href="https://x.com/jasonschreier/status/1816198662478877089" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a> repeatedly saying that we’re seeing the beginning of what will probably become a much bigger movement. This time next year, the sorts of numbers we’re seeing right now could seem quaint by comparison.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> Similar to what you were saying before, I know that in the <em>World of Warcraft</em> union’s press release, they talked about the protests in 2021 against Activision Blizzard, and then they also referenced Game Workers Unite at GDC. And when you think about how long this has been, I remember when we first started talking about “Could the games industry unionize?” And I feel like the vibe back then was “Oh, it’ll never work.” To see how far that’s grown since those <a href="https://kotaku.com/it-s-time-for-game-developers-to-unionize-1823992430" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first conversations</a> – to get that sense of historicity and how this has built – I think is really exciting. It’s cool to see those seeds that were planted way back then flowering now.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> It’s really cool. And to your point, there was a time when it felt like none of this would ever really happen. At most, we’d have these little QA unions, and that would be a cool thing, an important thing, but we’d be like “Well, that’s kinda where the buck stops, and other than that our industry will just remain what it is.”</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I also will say that just generally speaking, I think it’s really important to acknowledge the actual work that QA unions did. QA was there first putting their flag down. You can see that bleeding into other parts of companies. That was such important work, and I think that it shouldn’t be diminished or even considered as separate. Because these are people who need it probably the most. Not that other people don’t, but they are the most precarious and subject to the changing winds of the market – the ones that are gotten rid of first. They were there first. It’s important to acknowledge that because it comes part and parcel with failing to emphasize the importance of QA generally, because it’s not as glamorous.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>I think you’re exactly right. I think it’s not an overstatement to say that without QA, none of this would have been possible. They made it all happen. They were in the trenches when there wasn’t a neutrality agreement with Microsoft. They were really sticking their necks out.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">There's no shortage of great VR headsets to pick from in 2024. For us, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Meta-Quest-128GB-Breakthrough-Reality-3/dp/B0C8VKH1ZH?tag=gamespot-vrheadsets-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Meta Quest 3</a> offers the perfect balance of price and power along with a streamlined all-in-one design to make it our go-to recommendation for the best VR headset, but there are plenty of other worthwhile options. Some leverage the power of gaming PCs or consoles for better performance and visual fidelity. Others might be even more affordable. Whatever you're looking for, there's a VR headset out there for you. So, to help you find the perfect fit, we've put together this list of the best VR headsets available in 2024.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Finding the best VR headset for you</h2><p dir="ltr">The first thing that's important to know before buying a VR headset is that some VR games are exclusive to specific headsets. Meta and both PlayStation headsets have their own storefronts that offer unique games, unavailable to HTC, Valve, and other companies' headsets. Of course, you can still get an impressive experience with the Valve Index or HTC Vive line of headsets, especially considering the great library of VR games on Steam. Each VR headset has its advantages and unique qualities, such as high resolutions, AMOLED displays, and built-in speakers.</p><p dir="ltr">The Meta Quest 3 is a powerful mobile VR headset that gives you great experiences without connecting to a PC--no sensors required (though you can, if you so choose). The Valve Index requires you to connect to a PC and use sensors, but it also provides the most high-end VR experience available today. And, of course, there's the PSVR 2, which has the benefit of being compatible with Sony's first-party lineup of VR games. Keep in mind the original PSVR has its own library of games separate from the PSVR 2. You cannot play original PSVR games on PSVR 2 unless the developer releases an upgraded version. Each headset has its unique features and benefits, so you'll need to decide which one is the best for you, based on your price range.</p><p><em>Editor's Note: Article updated on July 26, 2024</em></p><h2 dir="ltr">The best VR headsets in 2024</h2><div title="6473057 - Best VR Headsets - Listicle" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="312" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6473057 - Best VR Headsets - Listicle" data-collection="">                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Meta-Quest-128GB-Breakthrough-Reality-3/dp/B0C8VKH1ZH?tag=gamespot-vrheadsets-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Meta-Quest-128GB-Breakthrough-Reality-3\/dp\/B0C8VKH1ZH?tag=gamespot-vrheadsets-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Meta-Quest-128GB-Breakthrough-Reality-3/dp/B0C8VKH1ZH?tag=gamespot-vrheadsets-20">Best VR headset</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Meta-Quest-128GB-Breakthrough-Reality-3/dp/B0C8VKH1ZH?tag=gamespot-vrheadsets-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Meta-Quest-128GB-Breakthrough-Reality-3\/dp\/B0C8VKH1ZH?tag=gamespot-vrheadsets-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Meta-Quest-128GB-Breakthrough-Reality-3/dp/B0C8VKH1ZH?tag=gamespot-vrheadsets-20">Meta Quest 3</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Like the previous Meta Quest headsets, the Meta Quest 3 is an all-in-one headset that can run games and VR apps directly on its internal hardware. Since it doesn't require an expensive gaming PC or console to work, it makes for a more approachable--and more affordable--VR option. However, that doesn't mean the Meta Quest 3's specs are lacking--quite the opposite, in fact.</p><p dir="ltr">The Meta Quest 3 runs on a second-generation Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 chipset and 8GB RAM, with either 128GB or 512GB internal storage, depending on the model. Its LCD screen features a 120Hz refresh rate and 2064 x 2208 per-eye resolution. It even has built-in stereo speakers that support 3D spatial audio.</p><p dir="ltr">The Meta Quest 3's hardware is strong enough to run a large number of games and apps natively, but if you need a bit more horsepower, you can plug it into a PC and enjoy a boost in processing power and wider app and game support. But even as a standalone device, you can access a vast library of VR games and applications via the Meta Store or Xbox Games Pass.</p><p dir="ltr">The Meta Quest 3 is also a capable XR (mixed reality) device. It boasts a pair of RGB cameras with 18 PPD (pixels per degree) that offer full color passthrough with double the resolution of the Quest Pro and ten times that of the Quest 2. The overall design is also a step up from its predecessors, with a lighter headset that's 40% thinner than the Quest 2.</p><p dir="ltr">The Quest 3 is available in two models: a $500 128GB model, and a $650 512GB model. Obviously, the 512GB model lets you install more games, but otherwise, both versions offer identical features and app support.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/valveindex" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/valveindex&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://store.steampowered.com/valveindex">Best high-end PC VR headset</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/valveindex" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/valveindex&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://store.steampowered.com/valveindex">Valve Index</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>In terms of pure technical prowess, the Valve Index is the best gamer-oriented PC VR headset on the market. It doesn't increase the resolution past 2880x1600 on its LCD display, but the Index nails VR where it's most important: refresh rate and field of view. Boasting a max 144Hz refresh rate and a field of view of 130-degrees, it makes for the best, smoothest-feeling experience in virtual reality. With the higher field of view, you can see more of the game at any one time, as opposed to the relative tunnel vision found in other headsets. An Index and a good gaming PC will provide the optimal VR experience, assuming you're okay with a few wires and spending big on a PC gaming rig and the tethered headset experience.</p><p dir="ltr">Another key aspect of the device is its unique motion controller, which features individual finger tracking and is a step up from something like the Oculus Touch. There aren't a lot of applications for this yet, but finger-tracking is a great way to make your virtual reality experience more immersive--games like Boneworks use it well. And while it's absolutely usable in seated or stationary settings, it excels most with room-scale VR. Thus, gamers without a lot of space may find it hard to push the Index to its full potential.</p><p dir="ltr">The Valve Index also needs to be powered by a PC with a wired connection. At the moment, there is no option for wireless use, as the Vive Wireless Adapter--made for HTC's Vive headsets--is incompatible. However, the Valve Index is compatible with the HTC Vive's controllers and base stations, so Valve offers the Index headset on its own and in a kit. Additionally, the Valve Index's controllers and base stations are compatible with HTC's Vive headsets. A <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2154720/nofio_wireless_adapter_for_Valve_Index/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wireless adapter</a> is in the works for the Valve Index, too.</p><p dir="ltr">The Valve Index VR kit comes with the headset, controllers, a powerful pair of built-in speakers that make it easy to enter the virtual world without totally disconnecting from the real one, and base stations. Alternatively, you can purchase a bundle with the headset and controllers or the headset by itself. Every purchase of the Valve Index comes with a complimentary copy of Half-Life: Alyx on Steam, letting you continue the story of that character right away.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Meta-Quest-Pro-Oculus/dp/B09Z7KGTVW?tag=gamespot-vrheadsets-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Meta-Quest-Pro-Oculus\/dp\/B09Z7KGTVW?tag=gamespot-vrheadsets-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Meta-Quest-Pro-Oculus/dp/B09Z7KGTVW?tag=gamespot-vrheadsets-20">Best standalone high-end VR headset</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Meta-Quest-Pro-Oculus/dp/B09Z7KGTVW?tag=gamespot-vrheadsets-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Meta-Quest-Pro-Oculus\/dp\/B09Z7KGTVW?tag=gamespot-vrheadsets-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Meta-Quest-Pro-Oculus/dp/B09Z7KGTVW?tag=gamespot-vrheadsets-20">Meta Quest Pro</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Originally retailing for $1,500, the Meta Quest Pro is now available for $1,000. That makes it a bit more realistic for shoppers with a cushy budget, and it’s worth every cent if you’re going to be using it regularly and don't have a gaming PC. Along with a sleek, ergonomic design, you’re also getting tons of luxurious features that simply can’t be found on other standalone VR headsets.</p><p>Whatever you’re using the Meta Quest Pro for, it’ll look great on its LCD panels, which offer 1800x1920 pixels for each eye and a 106-degree field of view. They also support local dimming, allowing deep contrast for a vivid viewing experience. Its controllers are just as advanced, with three camera sensors per controller, ten hours of battery life, and Qualcomm Snapdragon 662 processors running the show.</p><p>The list of impressive features goes on and on--built-in speakers and microphone, support for 3.5mm audio inputs, backward compatibility with the Quest 2 library, 12GB RAM, 10 VR/MR sensors, and multiple face tracking sensors allow the Quest Pro to achieve things you won't find anywhere else (without a PC). It’s not cheap, but it offers one of the best VR experiences money can buy.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/HTC-VIVE-Virtual-Reality-System-PC/dp/B09FPCT3H8?tag=gamespot-vrheadsets-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/HTC-VIVE-Virtual-Reality-System-PC\/dp\/B09FPCT3H8?tag=gamespot-vrheadsets-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/HTC-VIVE-Virtual-Reality-System-PC/dp/B09FPCT3H8?tag=gamespot-vrheadsets-20">Best display</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/HTC-VIVE-Virtual-Reality-System-PC/dp/B09FPCT3H8?tag=gamespot-vrheadsets-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/HTC-VIVE-Virtual-Reality-System-PC\/dp\/B09FPCT3H8?tag=gamespot-vrheadsets-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/HTC-VIVE-Virtual-Reality-System-PC/dp/B09FPCT3H8?tag=gamespot-vrheadsets-20">HTC Vive Pro 2</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>It might not be receiving the fanfare of the Valve Index, Quest Pro, or PSVR 2, but the Vive Pro 2 has quietly made a name for itself among VR enthusiasts.

Combined with its 120-degree field of view, the Vive Pro 2 makes it easy to get immersed in your favorite games. It’s not a standalone device (and you’ll need a PC with at least a GTX 1060), but that’s a small price to pay for just a good-looking device.</p><p>Plenty of other high-end features are loaded into the Vive Pro 2 (such as integrated dual microphones and ergonomic controllers), which makes its hefty price tag a bit easier to stomach.

The low resolution and pixel density cause a significant screen-door effect--you see the black space between each pixel. It makes it look like you're viewing the game through a screen door. This can be frustrating for experienced VR users, but with no other VR headset on the PS4, it's an issue you just have to deal with. But where PSVR falls short in its specs, it makes up for in its exclusive games. These titles feature some of the best experiences in VR and are well worth playing if you own it. The PlayStation Move controllers are required for some games--like Farpoint and Concrete Genie--but there are plenty of great titles that use the DualShock 4, including Astro Bot: Rescue Mission and Resident Evil 7: Biohazard. </p><p dir="ltr">The PSVR requires the PlayStation Camera for tracking, but thankfully it's included with the headset in most bundles. And if you already own a PlayStation Camera for the PS4, then you're ready to go no matter which version of it you have. The tracking isn't up to par with PC VR options, especially when turning away from the camera, though it does work fine for most gaming. Thankfully, wearing the headset is extremely comfortable, which makes longer sessions much more manageable.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-Advanced-All-One-Virtual/dp/B099VMT8VZ?tag=gamespot-vrheadsets-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Oculus-Quest-Advanced-All-One-Virtual\/dp\/B099VMT8VZ?tag=gamespot-vrheadsets-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-Advanced-All-One-Virtual/dp/B099VMT8VZ?tag=gamespot-vrheadsets-20">Best affordable headset</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-Advanced-All-One-Virtual/dp/B099VMT8VZ?tag=gamespot-vrheadsets-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Oculus-Quest-Advanced-All-One-Virtual\/dp\/B099VMT8VZ?tag=gamespot-vrheadsets-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-Advanced-All-One-Virtual/dp/B099VMT8VZ?tag=gamespot-vrheadsets-20">Meta Quest 2</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p dir="ltr">The Meta Quest 2 is the perfect combination of price and performance. As a standalone headset with no requirement for additional hardware such as a PC or console, the Meta Quest 2 offers the easiest and most convenient way to start gaming in VR. It's a nice step up from the original Quest (which was already great), and you no longer need a Facebook account to use the device. Best of all, for those looking for better performance, you can use Oculus Link to connect it to VR-capable PCs and play games like Half-Life: Alyx.</p><p dir="ltr">The Meta Quest 2 is equipped with a fast Qaulcom Snapdragon XR2 processor and 6GB of RAM. The fast-switch LCD displays may not be OLED, but they still look fantastic once you've adjusted the comfortable new backpack-like elastic strap and selected one of three inter-pupillary distance settings. Thanks to 1832 x 1920 pixel resolution for each lens, the picture is crisp and clear.</p><p dir="ltr">The Meta Quest 2 is an improvement on the original in almost every way, but if you're upgrading from the original, you may not be as blown away by the newer VR machine. That speaks to the quality of the Quest 1 more than anything, as it's still an excellent headset. That said, some games are only compatible with Quest 2, like the excellent Resident Evil 4 VR. For the most part, though, the Quest 2 is more of a smart iteration on the original.</p><p dir="ltr">Over the past couple of years, the Meta Quest 2's library has expanded significantly. There's a wide range of games across all major genres as well as a slew of apps for watching TV, movies, and other entertainment experiences.</p><p dir="ltr">The Meta Quest 2 comes in two storage capacities: 128GB and 256G. The 128GB model costs $400, while the 256GB model is $430. Considering the small jump in price, we'd recommend the 256GB. Both models come with Golf+ and Space Pirate Trainer DX. Though the Quest 2 is more comfortable than its predecessors, some users may still experience discomfort and neck strain.

Or that they were in France. So I was extra surprised when the opening ceremony looked like a scene out of a classic <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> game. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195776" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Assassin's Creed Mirage" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="157" data-playlist="195776,195719,196394" data-current="195776"><div><p>The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Assassin's Creed Mirage</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195776/195776_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195776/195776_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195776/195776_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195776/195776_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21286.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Apparently everyone else was, too. The opening ceremony for this year’s Games, kicked off in Paris on July 26 and running through August 11, featured everything you need to know about French culture, including soccer star Zinedine Zidane, a beheaded queen, and what appeared to be a mysterious revolutionary-era figure in a hood leaping off rooftops. All it was missing was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/TechnicallyRon/status/1816893006588575762&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/TechnicallyRon/status/1816893006588575762" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a giant baguette</a></span>. </p><p>Here is how people reacted to seeing the Halloween Spirit version of an<em> Assassin’s Creed </em>protagonist show up at the international sporting event:</p><p><em>Assassin’s Creed</em> publisher Ubisoft—a French company—appeared to tease the surprise cameo of its history-defending killer in a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1816901108968624424&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1816901108968624424" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">couple of posts earlier today</a></span>, one winking at the official Olympics account and another sharing a trailer for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-unity-the-kotaku-review-1657368877&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-unity-the-kotaku-review-1657368877"><em>Assassin’s Creed Unity</em></a></span>, the one that takes place in France during the French Revolution. It’s still not entirely clear how much this was a direct homage to the country’s video game heritage rather than a vague gesture in the direction of a brand activation. </p><p>“We were impressed by the opening ceremony and very proud to see that <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>was one of the inspirations for the show’s talented creators,” a spokesperson for Ubisoft told <em>Kotaku</em> in a statement. “It is a true testament to video games’ influence on popular culture.”</p><p>While seeing gaming recognized IRL is always a neat surprise, not everyone was impressed with the opening ceremony more generally. Budget Olympics began trending on various parts of social media, with online onlookers critiquing the fact that the event wasn’t held in a stadium and felt more dollar-store Eurovision than Hollywood Super Bowl half-time show. </p><p>I am not in a position to judge. Maybe those naysayers would have felt differently if the assassin had jumped off a restored Notre Dame Cathedral into a giant cart of hay. </p><p>If the Olympic Games in France have you pining for a getaway you can’t afford, <em>Assassin’s Creed Unity</em> isn’t the worst alternative. The infamously buggy game at launch plays great now and will let you explore some of Paris’ most famous landmarks in-between many grisly (but necessary) murders. It’s $30 on PS4, Xbox One, and PC, but you can also rent it for a paid month of PS Plus Extra or Ubisoft+, both of which are under $20. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

When a perilous threat arrives from an alternate timeline, led by the ruthless Titan Havik whose sole mission is to throw the realms into khaos, Liu Kang must rally his champions and put faith in his enemies to defeat this grave danger.

As Sub-Zero, Bi-Han was the Lin Kuei’s ruthless Grandmaster, but his soul was stolen by Titan Havik to create the perfect henchman, Noob Saibot, who is now dedicated to fomenting anarchy. Born into the Zaki, one of the Lin Kuei’s many sub-clans, Cyrax became a martial arts prodigy with an independent streak and untamed desire to serve the clan on her terms, or not at all. Growing up immersed in Lin Kuei culture under the tutelage of her parents, Sektor becomes a master armorer, skilled warrior, and Sub-Zero’s most trusted lieutenant, committed to advancing the clan’s future at all costs.</p><p>“Kombat Pack 2” also brings a new batch of guest fighters into the mix with Ghostface, the recurring identity donned by antagonists from the <em>Scream</em> <a title="Genres > Horror [444 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/horror">horror</a> movie franchise, voiced by Roger L.

Allowing characters to morph into their spirit animal to annihilate defeated opponents, Animalities can be performed by all playable fighters and will be available in conjunction with the <em>Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns</em> release. Furthermore, all owners of <em>Mortal Kombat 1</em> will receive a free MK 95 Scorpion character skin, inspired by the original <em>Mortal Kombat</em> (1995) film, available today.</p></blockquote><p>“With <em>Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns</em>, we’re looking forward to an exciting second year of content that will continue the cinematic story, add more fighters, and bring back popular game features,” said <a title="Companies > NetherRealm Studios [166 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/warner-bros-games/netherrealm-studios">NetherRealm Studios</a> chief creative officer and <em>Mortal Kombat</em> co-creator Ed Boon in a press release. “The expansion marks the long-awaited return of Animalities, which will be a free content update for all <em>Mortal Kombat 1</em> players and a token of appreciation for our amazing community.”</p><p><em>Mortal Kombat 1</em> is available now for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, Switch, and PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1971870/Mortal_Kombat_1/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/mortal-kombat-1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Epic Games Store</a>.</p><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Mortal Kombat 1 Khaos Reigns Official Announcement Trailer</p>
      </div>
<ul><li dir="ltr">Sektor</li><li dir="ltr">Cyrax</li><li dir="ltr">Noob Saibot</li><li dir="ltr">Conan the Barbarian</li><li dir="ltr">Ghost Face</li><li dir="ltr">T-1000 Terminator</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Some of the Mortal Kombat characters are showing up as new variations, notably Sektor and Cyrax are both now women. In addition, instead of being full cyborgs, both characters are now just humans wearing armored suits. This is a nice touch to make these characters stand out more and it stands in line with how Mortal Kombat 1 takes place in a new rebooted universe.</p><p dir="ltr">All of these characters are part of the Khaos Reigns expansion, which is scheduled to release on September 24. Not only does the expansion introduce new characters to the game's ever-growing roster, but it also features a new story that picks up after the events of Mortal Kombat 1, with Havok being the new big bad.</p><p dir="ltr">Last but not least, Khaos Reigns brings Animalities back to Mortal Kombat. Animalities are special finishers that see your character turn into various animals and brutally eat, eviscerate, or puncture your opponent. They essentially serve as a new form of fatality that players can perform at the end of each game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/kunitsu-gami-path-goddess-game-pass-capcom-1851606852<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The world of <em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em> is meant to feel fantastical and from another time, but the game itself also feels like an anachronism. Something that shouldn’t exist in 2024. It’s not a sequel in a hit franchise. It’s not working in a popular genre. And it’s not pandering to an international audience. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/kunitsu-gami-path-goddess-review-game-pass-1851600358&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/kunitsu-gami-path-goddess-review-game-pass-1851600358">It’s just an excellent game</a></span>, and it shows what’s possible when big publishers take a chance on something completely different.</p><p>“We believe it is important to respond to the expectations of our users with new titles in [existing] series and remakes, but we also believe it is equally important to take on the challenge of creating something new,” the game’s producer, Yoshiaki Hirabayashi, a more than 20-year veteran of Capcom, told <em>Kotaku</em> in a recent email interview<em>. “</em>As a completely new title, we are taking on a number of challenges.”</p><p><em>Path of the Goddess</em> has you play as the sword-dancing warrior Soh, who must rally villagers and protect the Maiden Yoshiro on a treacherous journey to purge evil from a mountain. But instead of a straightforward third-person action game that has you exploring levels and slicing through hordes of demons,<em> Path of the Goddess </em>is structured like a tower defense game where, in addition to killing enemies yourself in fluid arcade combat, you can also conscript villagers into unique classes and order them around the battlefield.</p><p>One key was to make sure that neither side overshadowed the other and each was viable in its own way. “We did not want to force players to have to use both elements equally, so we spent a lot of time adjusting the balance between action and strategy,” Kawata said. “Therefore, players could enjoy more [of either one], depending on their equipment and assigned villager roles.” It’s an unlikely mashup that works surprisingly well and doesn’t sacrifice quality to realize its experimental creative vision. It’s also presented in a context that’s unabashedly Japanese.<br></p><p>“I am a fan of old Japanese folklore and other bizarre folktales, and I thought it would be interesting to incorporate them into a game set in the mountains of Japan, where a messenger from the other world appears every night and you must fend them off and protect the gods,” said the game’s director, Shuichi Kawata, also a long-time Capcom employee. “A major part of this idea was that I thought it would be compatible with tower defense. I think we were able to make every aspect of the game cohesive by incorporating player actions and the relationship between the enemies with Japanese culture.”<br></p><p><em>Path of the Goddess</em> features dozens of intricate and evocative enemy designs for the evil spirits you face, called The Seethe. Some have heads shaped like massive mouths with tongues jutting out of them. Others look like pearly white tumors floating through the air with dangerous hooks hanging off the bottom of them. In one stage you face a massive corrupted tree whose roots come alive and attack you like a giant mutant earthworm. Their variety and level of detail is one of the key ways the game punches above its weight.</p><p>But the other main thing that helps <em>Path of the Goddess</em> stand out is just how bespoke and carefully considered every small detail of the game feels. “Mixing multiple game elements will always increase the complexity of the game, but it is important to choose carefully what is and isn’t necessary for the game,” said Kawata. “In order to prevent the game from becoming a ‘grinding’ game, I think it is important to allow the users to think about what to do based on the given game materials, and the result should lead to a sense of accomplishment.”</p><p>The UI is carefully integrated with the rest of the game’s look and feel. To access the main menu, you have to go into a village and visit Yoshiro’s tent where a table in front of her collects the various ornaments, artifacts, and other objects you’ve gathered throughout your journey that double as the game’s power-ups, status-enhancing relics, and other unlockable upgrades. You increase the level of your villagers’ roles by decorating their masks, and the save screen is a long horizontal piece of folded paper that you stamp with each new file. One of the game’s collectibles, an array of desserts, sit in a nearby box for you to examine at your leisure.<br></p><p>There are over 20 stages in <em>Path of the Goddess</em>, and each one has two phases to it. The result is three to five enemy waves per stage with generous checkpointing. While no gameplay ideas were discarded during its development, testing revealed that most of the stages originally felt too long and drawn out, so they ended up making them shorter. “Many people commented that this part of the game was tiring and made the play time longer, so we decided to shorten it and increase the tempo of the game progression.”</p><p>The game feels stripped down to its essentials, preserving only what’s elegant, polished, and meaningful to the overall experience. Where other games devolve into ticking boxes on a marketing strategy, <em>Path of the Goddess</em> feels bereft of bloat. It’s the opposite of the open-world RPG with skill trees, gear scores, and random loot that pads itself out with extra hours of content just to hit a certain number on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howlongtobeat.com/game/83146&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/83146" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How Long To Beat</a></span>.</p><p>“I think that the sandbox in a playground is similar to this situation, and used that concept to explain it to my team,” Kawata said. “The scope is fixed and the use of sand is fixed, but you are free to use the sand to your liking.” This is part of why I think people keep referring to it as a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/24201259/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-capcom-game-pass-impressions&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/24201259/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-capcom-game-pass-impressions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PS2 cult-classic</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Papapishu/status/1816547398816268365&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Papapishu/status/1816547398816268365" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">or lost PS3 game</a></span>. It feels made for an era where a good idea, cool look, and fun gameplay were enough, if not to sell millions of copies, than at least to convince a well-known publisher to take a chance on something new.</p><p>Before pitching <em>Path of the Goddess</em>, Kawata directed <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://www.kotaku.com.au/2020/03/capcoms-wonderful-underwater-2d-action-adventure-shinsekai-into-the-depths-was-just-surprise-relea/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.kotaku.com.au/2020/03/capcoms-wonderful-underwater-2d-action-adventure-shinsekai-into-the-depths-was-just-surprise-relea/"><em>Shinsekai: Into the Depths</em></a></span>, an underwater action puzzle game on Apple Arcade that was later ported to Switch. Much of that team was carried over to <em>Path of the Goddess</em>, but developers from other bigger-budget Capcom franchises like <em>Resident Evil</em> joined as well, bringing additional know-how and experience with the RE Engine that’s become increasingly standard across all of Capcom’s portfolio (<em>Monster Hunter </em>is also moving to it <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-ps5-preview-release-date-1851535133&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-ps5-preview-release-date-1851535133">with <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em></a></span>). Still, Hirabayashi said the team remained “relatively compact for the size of the production volume.”</p><p>Unlike a lot of those games, however, <em>Path of the Goddess</em> is priced at $50, just below the premium next-gen price tag of things like <em>Street Fighter 6</em> and <em>Dragon’s Dogma 2</em>, but just above cheaper Steam games like <em>Helldivers 2</em>, whose $40 price many regard as a key component of its runaway sales success. I asked what goes into making that call, which anecdotally some PC players feel is still too high.<br></p><p>“As a completely new title, we have taken on a number of challenges, such as a ‘unique Japanese-inspired setting’ and a ‘new gaming experience’ that combines action and tower defense,” Hirabayashi said. “We have decided to set the price as affordable as possible to allow as many people to get their hands on this game.” He stressed that the size of the game is comparable to a full-price game, but you can see Capcom hedging in the fact that <em>Path of the Goddess </em>is also “free” for paid Game Pass members on Xbox and PC. When I asked previously at Summer Game Fest how that deal came about, Hirabayashi said the goal was to try to get the game in front of as many people as possible, given it was an unknown IP in an unusual genre.<br></p><p>I hope it works. We’ve seen that a bold vision that delivers and a cult of enthusiasm from fans isn’t always enough to guarantee a sequel or a chance to continue building on the work that came before. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hi-fi-rush-review-tango-gameworks-shutdown-xbox-1851473875&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hi-fi-rush-review-tango-gameworks-shutdown-xbox-1851473875">That’s now the sad story of <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em></a></span>, the 2023 GOTY contender from Tango Gameworks. That studio was founded by <em>Resident Evil</em> director Shinji Mikami (Kawata and Hirabayashi were on the cinematics team for <em>Resident Evil 4</em>, the last one Mikami directed), who left a year before Microsoft announced it was shutting down Tango Gameworks.</p><p>As exploding development costs push publishers to retreat into proven sellers and popular licenses, there’s a real fear the top end of the gaming industry could calcify even more than it already has in recent years through remakes, sequels, and live-service lottery machines. When I asked if we might see more experiments like <em>Path of the Goddess</em> from Capcom, Hirabayashi said he couldn’t comment on the larger company’s policy. “However,” he added, “as an individual, I am very grateful that there were so many people within the company who agreed with me to deliver this title to the users.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The DLC will not only see an artistic update to its ensemble cast and weapons, but it will also let players design their characters using the Steam workshop. Paint Boss Paradise will also introduce a new playable character named Paint Junior, whom the devs describe as someone who can “vanquish enemies with the very power of their imagination.” Seeing as how the live stream is titled “The Behemoth Roadmap,” Painter Boss Paradise’s announcement wasn’t couched with a release date, though The Behemoth says it will divulge those details at a later date. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We used to be enemies.

<p>SAG-AFTRA has called for a strike of all its members working in video games, with the union demanding that its next contract not allow "companies to abuse AI to the detriment of our members."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-members-who-work-video-games-go-strike">The strike</a> mirrors similar actions taken by SAG-AFTRA and the Writers Guild of America (WGA) last year, which, while also broader in scope than just AI, were similarly focused on concerns about AI-generated work product and the use of member work to train AI.
</p><p>"Frankly, it’s stunning that these video game studios haven’t learned anything from the lessons of last year—that our members can and will stand up and demand fair and equitable treatment with respect to A.I., and the public supports us in that,” Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, chief negotiator for SAG-AFTRA, said in a statement.</p>
<p>During the strike, the more than 160,000 members of the union will not provide talent to games produced by Disney, Electronic Arts, Blizzard Activision, Take-Two, WB Games, and others. Not every game is affected. Some productions may have interim agreements with union workers, and others, like continually updated games that launched before the current negotiations starting September 2023, may be exempt.</p>
<p>The publishers and other companies issued statements to the media through a communications firm representing them. "We are disappointed the union has chosen to walk away when we are so close to a deal, and we remain prepared to resume negotiations," a statement <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/25/business/hollywood-actors-strike-video-game-companies.html">offered to The New York Times</a> and other outlets read. The statement said the two sides had found common ground on 24 out of 25 proposals and that the game companies' offer was responsive and "extends meaningful AI protections."</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>The Washington Post says <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/07/25/artificial-intelligence-sagaftra-ai-video-games/d01249ae-4abc-11ef-9149-c75da5dd9201_story.html">the biggest remaining issue</a> involves on-camera performers, including motion capture performers. Crabtree-Ireland told the Post that while AI training protections were extended to voice performers, motion and stunt work was left out. "[A]ll of those performers deserve to have their right to have informed consent and fair compensation for the use of their image, their likeness or voice, their performance. It’s that simple," Crabtree-Ireland said in June.</p>
<p>It will be difficult to know the impact of a game performer strike for some time, if ever, owing to the non-linear and secretive nature of game production. A game's conception, development, casting, acting, announcement, and further development (and development pivots) happen on whatever timeline they happen upon.</p>
<p>SAG-AFTRA has <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/videogamestrike#production_search_result">a tool for searching game titles</a> to see if they are struck for union work, but it is finicky, recognizing only specific production titles, code names, and ID numbers. Searches for <em>Grande Theft Auto VI </em>and <em>6</em> returned a "Game Over!" (i.e., struck), but <a href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-gta6-voice-actor-strike-saf-aftra-1851606082">Kotaku confirmed</a> the game is technically unaffected, even though its parent publisher, Take-Two, is generally struck.</p>
<p>Video game performers in SAG-AFTRA <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/10/its-official-unionized-video-game-voice-actors-are-on-strike/">last went on strike in 2016</a>, that time regarding long-term royalties. The strike lasted 340 days, still the longest in that union's history, and was settled with pay raises for actors while residuals and terms on vocal stress remained unaddressed. The impact of that strike was generally either hidden or largely blunted, as affected titles hired non-union replacements. Voice work, as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/10/video-game-voice-actors-struggles-extend-well-past-bayonetta-3-drama/2/">noted by the original English voice for <em>Bayonetta</em></a>, remains a largely unprotected field.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/sag-aftra-video-game-voice-actor-strike-grand-theft-auto-6<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As of today, video game performers and voice actors are <a href="https://aftermath.site/sag-aftra-video-game-voice-actor-strike" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">officially on strike</a> over disagreements about AI that 18 months of negotiations couldn’t solve. Where, exactly, are companies and the union at odds, though? SAG-AFTRA chief contracts officer Ray Rodriguez told Aftermath that the core problem comes down to protections being extended to voice actors, but not physical performers.&nbsp;</p><p>"Until a couple of days ago, the employers were adamant that AI protections would only extend to voice, not to on-camera coverage," said Rodriguez. "So anybody doing a stunt or creature performance, all those folks would have been left unprotected under the employers' offer. At the 11th hour, when we were about to go on strike, they gave us new language that does make a reference to on-camera performers."</p><p>Unfortunately, according to Rodriguez, that new language came with asterisks that, in SAG-AFTRA’s eyes, made it untenable.&nbsp;</p><p>"The protections only extend to on-camera performers and to voice performers under their offer if the performer is identifiable in the output of the AI digital replica,” he said. “But the truth is, in video games, it's not going to be identifiable, as you could be doing the stunts that form the movement for Spider-Man, but what the player is going to see is Spider-Man. So that requirement of identifiability really leaves movement performers out of the scope of coverage."&nbsp;</p><p>Similar – and similarly disqualifying – requirements reared their head elsewhere, as well.</p><p>"There is a requirement of a one-to-one relationship between the performer and the resulting character that you see in the game, and that's not how games are usually made,” Rodriguez said. “There's usually more than one person whose work will be integrated into the character. So again, when you compare that to the reality of this work, they're really not covered."</p><p>He added that there was another stipulation concerning AI systems trained on “the whole internet” – in other words, not meant to resemble any specific person – where protections once again only covered voice actors, not physical performers.</p><p>“We're not going to leave half our members behind and make a deal only on behalf of voice performers,” said Rodriguez.&nbsp;</p><p>Audrey Cooling, a spokesperson representing EA, Take-Two, Activision, Insomniac, and <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-members-who-work-video-games-go-strike" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other companies with which SAG-AFTRA has been bargaining</a>, told Aftermath that the proposed agreement is in line with those of other major industries.</p><p>“I would reiterate that we have proposed terms that provide consent and fair compensation for anyone employed under [SAG-AFTRA’s Interactive Media Agreement], if an AI reproduction or digital replica of their performance is used in games,” Cooling said. “Our proposal clearly extends AI protections to all performers working under the IMA; it ensures companies will get consent before using a digital replica of their performance in games and also ensures fair compensation for the use of that performance. These terms are among the strongest in the entertainment industry.”</p><p>Other industries’ agreements, however, tend to cover 1:1 performances, which are standard in Hollywood but not necessarily the default in video games. Thus, the current impasse.</p><p>That said, the terms of the strike are not as rigidly defined as they might initially seem. Companies can sign <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/contracts-industry-resources/contracts/video-game-strike/video-game-strike-interim-agreements" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interim agreements</a> to continue working with SAG-AFTRA talent, which is all well and good as far as Rodriguez is concerned. However, there are also agreements in place that render any game that was in development before September 2023 exempt from the strike – including, as <a href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-gta6-voice-actor-strike-saf-aftra-1851606082" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kotaku recently reported</a>, <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>"We're obviously not happy about that," Rodriguez said. "That language was bargained into one of the legacy Interactive Media Agreements before merger [of SAG and AFTRA]. It's language that the merged union basically inherited, that I think is insane. But it’s there.”</p><p>Rogriguez went on to say that video game performers are typically hired as day players, meaning that their contractual agreement only lasts for a day. After that, performers are free to do as they please. This, he hopes, will include opting out of further work on exempt games made by struck companies.</p><p>“We're hopeful that performers, in solidarity with their fellow members – and recognizing that showing solidarity is going to shorten this strike and help us gain critical protections – will exercise their discretion, even with respect to some of those non-struck titles," he said.</p><p>Some exempt games, Rodriguez added, may not stay that way.</p><p>“We do believe that there are certain titles that we can challenge, and we are preparing ourselves to bring a challenge with respect to the application of this language with respect to some of the titles,” he said. “So we are doing our best to wage the strike as effectively [and] as strongly as we can – even in spite of that language being there."</p><p>Live-service games like <em>Fortnite </em>and <em>Apex Legends</em> are also currently exempt under this provision, as they’ve been in development for many years. But if the strike lasts 60 days or more, it’s a whole different ball game.&nbsp;</p><p>"If you apply this [language] that we're talking about to live-service games, they become contracts of unlimited duration, and there is a law that a contract of unlimited duration can be terminated on reasonable notice,” said Rodriguez. “So that's what we've done: We have provided reasonable notice that we are terminating our contract with respect to those live-service games."</p><p>SAG-AFTRA is pulling every ripcord it can because its leaders believe that AI represents a potentially existential threat to performers’ careers. The previous video game performer strike in 2016 and 2017 set the stage, but Rodriguez sees this one as the main event.</p><p>"This is an even more dangerous threat to performers [than what we struck over in 2016 and 2017],” he said. “Not achieving AI protections risks [performers] putting themselves out of work, maybe permanently. It is a career-derailing development if your unique qualities as a performer – what you do, your skill set – can in effect be expropriated from you by a computer, and employers then have the right to generate what would have been your performance without your consent, without paying you, in perpetuity. ... That is potentially a very dim career prospect."</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Earth Defense Force 6 launched this week for PC, PS4, and PS5, and the Steam version has faced criticism for requiring an Epic Games Store login for online play. But a change to this controversial requirement is already being explored by the game's developer."</p><p>The announcement seemingly came out of nowhere, as the Epic requirement wasn't communicated to players until launch day when the developers <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2291060/view/4361257526914035378" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">revealed it</a> in a Steam post. Of course, players weren't thrilled about this, and the review status of the game was "mostly negative" upon launch, as <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/cult-classic-shooter-series-returns-to-steam-after-5-years-and-immediately-takes-a-piledriver-into-the-review-dumpster-over-epic-games-account-requirement/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Gamesradar reports</a>.</p><p>Developer Sandlot <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2291060/view/4361257526917398046?l=english" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">responded to the backlash</a> with a new post on Steam, saying, "The EDF 6 development team for Steam is reviewing and planning changes to the specification that requires sign-in to Epic Games account, which has received the most feedback."</p><p>The studio didn't provide a timeline or what it would change, but the team is now working on a solution. As of right now, Earth Defense Force 6's review status is sitting at a slightly better "mixed" on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2291060/EARTH_DEFENSE_FORCE_6/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>. The Epic requirement for a game on Steam is unusual, but not unprecedented. Another game, Bigfoot, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/509980/discussions/0/3812910932501573788/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previously required an Epic account</a> on Steam before later removing it. </p><p>Earth Defense Force 6 is the latest entry in the series that lets players kill giant alien bugs and creatures bent on destroying the planet. The game has been compared to Helldivers and Starship Troopers: Extermination. Coincidentally, Helldivers 2 faced similar criticisms earlier this year due to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-pc-players-will-be-forced-to-link-a-psn-account-sarting-this-month/1100-6523147/" data-ref-id="1100-6523147">Sony implementing mandatory PSN account</a> logins after launch, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-cancels-helldivers-2-mandatory-psn-sign-in-requirement-following-player-uproar/1100-6523180/" data-ref-id="1100-6523180">walked back the requirement following a backlash</a>.</p>
