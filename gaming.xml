Ubisoft has now said that’s not the case, claiming the game is still “deep” in development.</p><p>“Yep, we’re still deep in the game — exploring, building, and ensuring the sands move with purpose,” said Ubisoft on Monday. “This game is being crafted by a team that truly cares, and they’re pouring their hearts (and a lot of coffee) into every step. Thank you for sticking with us.”</p><p>In a follow-up message on Twitter, Ubisoft told people to go check out a different, already released entry in the series, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/rogue-prince-of-persia-early-access-dead-cells-1851401038&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/rogue-prince-of-persia-early-access-dead-cells-1851401038"><em>The Rogue Prince of Persia</em></a></span><em>, </em>while “development continues behind the scenes.”</p><p>So...there you go. Ubisoft is still remaking <em>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time.</em> If it lands its 2026 release date, it will be out just in time to celebrate the original game’s 23-year anniversary. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">The souls-like genre has become the flavor-of-the-industry in recent years, thanks to games like Elden Ring and the namesake Dark Souls becoming massively successful. Nowadays, in order to stand out in this highly competitive space, a game needs some sort of engaging hook to reel players away from other titles--be it a gameplay mechanic, overarching story, or unique visual style.</p><p dir="ltr">Blighted--the latest from Guacamelee developer Drinkbox--is attempting to lure souls-like fans into its desolate world with all three of those elements, and the result is shaping up to be another hit under the Drinkbox banner. While at its core, it feels familiar to what players will expect, Blighted's unique attributes waste no time in shining through, and after my time with the game at Summer Game Fest, I expect souls-like fans will have another incredible experience to sink their teeth into come 2026.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGU-7zvoNfU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OGU-7zvoNfU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">For those who missed the trailer at SGF Live, Blighted is an isometric action-RPG with combat similar to other souls-like games--slashing, dodging, and parrying are key to victory. It is set in a world befallen by Blight, a plague that alters reality itself. Before the Blight, the people of this world would plant a seed in the brain of those who passed away, and when a Memory Tree grew from that seed, the people would eat the fruit from the tree and gain the deceased person's memories.</p><p dir="ltr">However, a sinister being named Sorcisto found that by eating the brain directly, he would gain overwhelming power and knowledge. Sorcisto then consumed the brains of all the dead he could find, setting the Blight into the world and becoming the malevolent demon the player sets out to defeat.</p><p dir="ltr">As the player defeats boss monsters, they too must devour the brains of the conquered, which then threatens to make Sorcisto's methods cyclical instead of a one-off aberration. That sort of overarching threat, and the way the game presents the ever-building Blight in the player character after defeating a boss in the demo, is teasing a story that could turn out to be one of the best the genre has ever seen.</p><p dir="ltr">Combat is probably the most "normal" thing in the Blighted demo when it comes to souls-likes, but by creating a familiar system for new players to jump into, Drinkbox simply isn't fixing what isn't broken. Battles with enemies are tense affairs, marked by the ability to dodge, parry, and find openings for attacks--all hallmarks of what makes these types of games so beloved.</p><p dir="ltr">Fighting, despite that familiarity, felt really good; parrying attacks and turning the parry into a damaging counterattack was as satisfying here as it ever is in other games of the ilk. The boss battle--a fight against a giant spider-like creature with a horse's head--drove these points further, as watching the spider-horse-thing hit the ground after a well-timed parry was immensely satisfying.</p><p dir="ltr">Better still, I didn't have to play the game solo, either, as the developer walking me through the game also revealed Blighted's co-op features--which means those who struggle with souls-likes (like me) can bring a friend to help right from the jump. Having the dev with me on the journey allowed me to get my bearings faster, and in turn, upped my enjoyment of the demo.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4514694-screenshot3.png" data-ref-id="1300-4514694" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4514694-screenshot3.png" data-ref-id="1300-4514694"></a><figcaption>Blighted</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4514694-screenshot3.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4514696-screenshot2.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4514697-screenshot3.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4514698-screenshot4.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4514701-screenshot7.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4514702-screenshot8.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4514703-screenshot9.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4514704-screenshot10.png" data-ref-id="1300-4514696,1300-4514697,1300-4514698,1300-4514701,1300-4514702,1300-4514703,1300-4514704" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4514696-screenshot2.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4514697-screenshot3.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4514698-screenshot4.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4514701-screenshot7.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4514702-screenshot8.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4514703-screenshot9.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4514704-screenshot10.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4514696-screenshot2.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4514697-screenshot3.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4514698-screenshot4.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4514701-screenshot7.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4514702-screenshot8.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4514703-screenshot9.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4514704-screenshot10.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Despite the combat being familiar, Blighted also presents a unique mechanic with a ton of promise: The concept of Blight itself. On-screen at all times is a "Blight meter," which rises and falls depending on your performance in the game. The more Blight I had stored, the harder the game became; when I died and had to restart, I lost some of my Blight meter, which lowered the difficulty.</p><p dir="ltr">By tying the game's difficulty directly to the player's performance, Blighted ingeniously sidesteps one of the souls-like's genre definite debates: How <em>hard</em> should the game be? Here, the answer is "as hard as you make it by your ability to play it," which places the onus on the <em>player</em>; it's a system that, should it pan out in the final release, could be the next major step in the souls-like genre as a whole.</p><p dir="ltr">My brief demo offered only a snapshot of the Blight system in action--I could see the meter rise and fall with my actions, but I didn't notice any tangible change to enemy strength or any other difficulty indicators. That said, the idea still holds a ton of promise, even if it'll take some more time to truly feel its effects.</p><p dir="ltr">All of Blighted is set in a world with a visual style that seems to be at war with itself. The vestiges of the fallen civilization--colorful buildings, extravagant murals, and more--are all besieged with darkness and rot thanks to the Blight, creating an interesting visual dynamic. Each world I walked into during my time in the demo told its own story, and all of it led back to Sorcisto, the demon who tried to forsake the tried-and-true traditions of his fellow man--and ruined an entire population in the process.</p><p dir="ltr">Drinkbox is definitely onto something with Blighted; the mix of familiar souls-like mechanics, unique story, and innovative approach to difficulty has the potential to further invigorate a genre that is already teeming with new ideas. The Blight concept could be a game-changer if it pans out, and if it doesn't, there's still plenty to like in Blighted that Drinkbox seems likely to have another success story to add to the list with Guacamelee, Severed, and Nobody Saves The World.</p><p dir="ltr">Blighted is set to launch in 2026 on consoles and PC.</p>

He realized he had been burning out and that he needed to bring in new leadership.</p><p>Scott didn’t specify who the new owner or owners are, and the company didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment sent to its support email address. However, users will be seeing more of two people, who Scott identifies as “<a href="https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/Foledinho">Foledinho</a> (Victor)” and “<a href="https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/rapsak">Rapsak</a> (Marinus),” as they have “come on board to lead this next chapter,” Scott says. “They’ve got deep roots in gaming, tech, and most importantly, they give a damn; about the site, the community, and the future we’re trying to build here.”</p><p>While the site has changed hands, Scott says that “this isn’t some corporate ‘exit’ or a backroom deal.” Instead, “this is me doing something I probably should’ve done years ago: taking care of myself. Reclaiming some headspace. And finally letting go of the idea that I have to do everything and be responsible for everything myself.”</p><p>Scott will also still be a presence. “I’ll still be annoying people on the Mod Author Discord, lurking on the forums, and sticking my nose into community matters when I can’t help myself,” he says. And he’ll work with the team to “help guide the overall direction of the site.”</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
It's now been five years since Ubisoft's beleaguered Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake was originally revealed, and a little over a year since the publisher last popped up to remind us all the project was still alive. But here we are again, 12 months on, with another brief update, this time letting fans know the remake remains "deep" in development.
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft's Sands of Time remake was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-details-whats-new-in-its-prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake">initially unveiled back in September 2020</a>, when it was expected to arrive in January the following year. However, after its announcement trailer was met with a less than positive reception, Ubisoft kicked off what would prove to be a succession of delays. Eventually, the project moved from its original developers Ubisoft Pune and Mumbai to Ubisoft Montreal, where it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/three-years-on-ubisofts-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-still-in-the-conception-phase">seemingly rebooted from scratch</a>, and last year brought the news it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-now-targeting-2026-gets-briefest-of-trailers">wouldn't be ready for release until 2026</a>.
</p>
<p>
But while it seemed like Ubisoft might opt for radio silence until its remake was finally ready for its big re-reveal, the publisher has instead shared the <a href="https://x.com/princeofpersia/status/1934642136500060166">briefest of updates today on social media</a>, a little over a year since its last one. "Yep, we're still deep in the game," it wrote, "exploring, building, and ensuring the sands move with purpose."

<p>
"This game is being crafted by a team that truly cares," it continued, "and they're pouring their hearts (and a lot of coffee) into every step. Thank you for sticking with us." And that's pretty much all we're getting for now, aside from an accompanying bit of art showing a glass palace against a pink sky. Ubisoft also pointed fans in the direction of series spin-off The Rogue Prince of Persia, from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-cells">Dead Cells</a> studio Evil Empire, which is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-finally-leaving-early-access">set to leave early access this August</a>.
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft's Sands of Time remake woes have continued to a tumultuous few years for the publisher, which has faced tumbling share prices and a number of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-following-learnings-from-star-wars-outlaws">high-profile flops</a> in recent times, resulting in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-suffers-third-round-of-job-losses-this-year">string of layoffs</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-announces-studio-closure-as-it-lays-off-185-staff">studio closures</a>. As part of its attempts to right the ship, Ubisoft announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-launches-new-business-for-assassins-creed-and-other-big-ips-with-116bn-tencent-investment">launching a new subsidiary dedicated to its big three IPs</a> - Assassin's Creed, Rainbow Six, and Far Cry - earlier this year. With those game under a new banner, Ubisoft itself will concentrate on a number of key areas, including "nurturing the development of iconic franchises", including - presumably - Prince of Persia.

                <p>Historically, collecting coins in the Mario Kart series generally grants a bit of a speed boost. While never a huge improvement, it gives players another way to build a marginal edge in races. In <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-world/" data-ref-id="5000-658545">Mario Kart World</a>, coins do grant additional speed, but it's a more complicated process than in past titles.</p><p>New evidence surfaced by TikTok user <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@shortcatt321/video/7515145980736490783?_r=1&amp;_t=ZT-8xGBJ9WlJbZ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">shortcatt321</a> suggests that each additional coin (up to the max of 20) does not grant a constant speed boost. In other words, coins add speed on a curve--rather than the speed bonus building on a linear scale. In <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@shortcatt321/video/7515145980736490783?_r=1&amp;_t=ZT-8xGBJ9WlJbZ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a TikTok video</a>, the user explains that this speed boost curve is actually different depending on the kart and character a player selects.</p>

<p>The curve for low top-speed builds is front-loaded, where early coins add a bigger bonus than later coins. High top-speed builds, meanwhile, are the inverse: later coins matter much more. At 20 coins acquired, both types of builds receive the same boost of 5.1% faster top speed.</p><p>Because of this discrepancy, optimal strategies toward collecting coins can differ depending on whether you choose a lightweight or heavyweight combo. Shortcatt321 suggests that collecting at least seven coins is important for lightweight, low-speed character/kart players, while heavyweight combos should either commit to collecting 20 coins, or not worry about coins at all.</p><p>Mario Kart World launched with the Switch 2 earlier this month, and it has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/79-of-switch-2-buyers-in-the-us-also-bought-mario-kart-world/1100-6532449/" data-ref-id="1100-6532449">an immediate hit with Switch 2 early adopters</a>. Mario Kart World's refinements to the core Mario Kart formula have inspired <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/mario-kart-world-tips-and-tricks-to-help-you-cross-the-finish-line/2900-6670/" data-ref-id="2900-6670">a wealth of new tips and tricks</a>, such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dodge-blue-shells-in-mario-kart-world-with-this-one-weird-trick/1100-6532191/" data-ref-id="1100-6532191">by exploiting the rewind feature to dodge blue shells</a>.

                <p>Obsidian Entertainment released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/pillars-of-eternity-2-deadfire-review-a-pirates-li/1900-6416907/" data-ref-id="1900-6416907">Pillars of Eternity 2: Deadfire</a> just over seven years ago, but there hasn't been any firm news about a sequel in that time. If Pillars of Eternity 3 ever happens, director Josh Sawyer says it will likely take some influence from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/baldurs-gate-3-review-let-freedom-reign/1900-6418131/" data-ref-id="1900-6418131">Baldur's Gate 3</a>.</p><p>Sawyer--who directed both of the Pillars of Eternity games--recently suggested that that the franchise's isometric perspective needs to shift to the 3D style in Baldur's Gate 3 in order to enhance the overall presentation of the game.</p><p>"I think if we did go into a 3D environment, we could patch up one of the things that's really lacking," Sawyer told <a href="https://www.gamepressure.com/editorials/i-dont-feel-good-about-the-industry-but-i-feel-good-about-the-abi/z377e" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Gamepressure</a> (via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/josh-sawyer-says-a-hypothetical-pillars-of-eternity-3-would-be-3d-just-like-baldurs-gate-3-with-environmental-mechanics-elevation-hazards-and-dynamic-terrain/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>). "Because [Pillars of Eternity 2] is isometric, there's no sense of height, and the environment can't be that dynamic. When you compare it to something like [Baldur's Gate 3], you realize it's such a huge part of the appeal. I think, at some point, I would like to see a game that used all those Deadfire mechanics, plus more environmental mechanics, elevation hazards, and dynamic terrain stuff. That could be super cool... I think that a third game should be an isometric 3D with an environment more like Baldur’s Gate 3. It would work."</p><p>In 2020, Sawyer suggested that Pillars of Eternity 3 would only happen <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pillars-of-eternity-director-says-a-3rd-game-will-/1100-6480569/" data-ref-id="1100-6480569">if the dev team were excited to make it</a>.

That title was launched earlier this year.</p><p>Sawyer hinted at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pillars-of-eternity-director-is-working-on-a-new-p/1100-6480578/" data-ref-id="1100-6480578">his follow-up to Pillars of Eternity 2</a> in 2020, which turned out to be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/pentiment-review-layers-of-history/1900-6417998/" data-ref-id="1900-6417998">Pentiment</a>.

And players couldn’t re-order the upcoming games. Since then,  Nintendo games have largely been unavailable for purchase directly from Amazon. Instead, when purchased on the site, they were sold and shipped via third-party sellers. And earlier this month, the Switch 2, its first-party launch games, and its official accessories, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-wont-find-switch-2-consoles-on-amazon-but-you-can-get-games-gear/1100-6531143/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-wont-find-switch-2-consoles-on-amazon-but-you-can-get-games-gear/1100-6531143/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">were similarly unavailable to pre-order on Amazon</a></span>. It’s been a frustrating situation for gamers who rely on the online retailer. But it’s finally, possibly, coming to an end. </p><p>Over the weekend, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-amazon-switch-2-freeze-out-update&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-amazon-switch-2-freeze-out-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as spotted by <em>IGN </em>and others</a></span>, a handful of first-party Nintendo games popped up on Amazon and are being officially shipped and sold by the retail giant. <span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/amazon-switch-2-nintendo-mario-donkey-kong-pre-orders-1851784603&amp;asc_source=&amp;asins=B0F66KLYVH,B0F66JNF9W,B0F66GWKZS,B0F66DW2X7,B0F66DXJNM,B0F66GQLHH,B0F66DHVR7&amp;isPreview=1&amp;isSlp=1&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody" data-amazonasin="" data-amazontag="kinjakotakulink-20"><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, <em>Super Mario Party Jamboree, </em>and<em> Kirby and the Forgotten Land + Star-Crossed World</em></a></span><em> </em>are some of the first-party Nintendo games now available to pre-order directly from Amazon and Nintendo. This seems to indicate that the two companies have come to an agreement and ended the lockout. There was even a listing for the Switch 2, though that has been removed for now. But this all seems to point to Nintendo products and games returning fully to Amazon in the near future. </p><p>As for why Nintendo stopped selling new games and consoles on Amazon, there’s never been a confirmation from either company. Some fans speculate that Amazon was shipping games ahead of their release and that this led to leaks, but that has yet to be confirmed. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Blitz Royale is, according to Epic, a new twist on battle royale "with a rogue-like design specifically crafted for mobile play" with 32 players and five-minute rounds.</p><p>Despite the bit about Blitz Royale being "crafted for mobile," the mode will be available on all platforms, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-cross-platform-games/2900-5425/" data-ref-id="2900-5425">cross-play</a> as usual.

It's a bit chunkier and wider than the real thing, so it doesn't have the same exact form factor, but it adds several compelling features that make it a versatile option for GameCube games on Switch Online as well as modern Nintendo games.</p><p>Beyond offering conventional bumpers and triggers, the Warrior Lite has two remappable back buttons. The right and left back buttons have a one-piece panel design that can be removed and switched with an alternate panel inside the box. The main difference between the two styles of back buttons is that one of them is textured and slightly raised for increased tactile feedback.</p><p>The Warrior Lite is equipped with anti-drift Hall Effect sticks. The right stick mimics the GameCube's yellow C-stick, but you can swap it out for a yellow stick with a more conventional, larger grip. Similarly, you can switch between octagonal stick gates inspired by the GameCube controller and regular stick gates with a circular range of motion.</p><p>Face buttons, the 8-way D-pad, and shoulder bumpers are actuated by microswitches, giving them a mouse-click feel. Like the sticks, the triggers are activated with Hall Effect sensors, and can be set at two different stopping points with the locking switches on the back. Other core features include built-in, adjustable rumble and 6-axis motion controls.</p><p>The main downside is battery life, as the Lite version has a smaller battery that only runs for up to five hours on a full charge. Like many Bluetooth controllers for Switch 2 and Switch, you can use the Warrior Lite on PC, mobile, Steam Deck, and other devices.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Controller-Nintendo-Switch-Joysticks-Mechanical/dp/B0D83WDY28?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Bluetooth-Controller-Nintendo-Switch-Joysticks-Mechanical\/dp\/B0D83WDY28?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Controller-Nintendo-Switch-Joysticks-Mechanical/dp/B0D83WDY28?tag=gamespot-promos-20">NYXI Warrior Wireless Controller for Switch 2</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Controller-Nintendo-Switch-Joysticks-Mechanical/dp/B0D83WDY28?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Bluetooth-Controller-Nintendo-Switch-Joysticks-Mechanical\/dp\/B0D83WDY28?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Controller-Nintendo-Switch-Joysticks-Mechanical/dp/B0D83WDY28?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$69 | Adds support for original GameCube hardware</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Bluetooth Wireless: Switch 2, Switch, PC, Mobile</li><li><strong>2.4GHz Wireless: GameCube, Wii, PC</strong></li><li>Connects wirelessly via Bluetooth</li><li>Hall Effect sticks and triggers</li><li>Modern trigger and bumper design</li><li>Adjustable trigger locks</li><li>Two remappable back buttons</li><li>Swappable back button module</li><li>Swappable sticks and gates</li><li>Microswitch face buttons</li><li>8-way microswitch D-pad</li><li>6-axis gyroscope for motion controls</li><li>Adjustable dual-rumble motors</li><li><strong>Up to 10 hours of battery life</strong></li></ul><p>NYXI released the original Warrior controller last year.

The Warrior also has a larger battery that can run for up to 10 hours between charges, which is a nice perk.</p><p>The Warrior comes in three different colors--purple, orange, and black--though only purple is still in stock at Amazon.</p></div>                      </div>   </div><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4514616-nyxiwarriorback.png" data-ref-id="1300-4514616" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4514616-nyxiwarriorback.png" data-ref-id="1300-4514616"></a><figcaption>NYXI Warrior back button module and trigger locks</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4514616-nyxiwarriorback.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4514617-nyxiwarriorfront.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4514618-nyxiwarriorside.png" data-ref-id="1300-4514617,1300-4514618" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4514617-nyxiwarriorfront.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4514618-nyxiwarriorside.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4514617-nyxiwarriorfront.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4514618-nyxiwarriorside.png"></figure><h2>GameCube-style Controllers for Switch 2 &amp; Switch</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/GameCube-Wireless-Controller-Nintendo-Gaming-Console/dp/B0CT5JPCCC?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PowerA GameCube Style Wireless Controller (Toad)</a> -- $39 (<del>$60</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Wireless-Battle-Gamecube-Controller/dp/B08896ZBZK?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hori GameCube Style Wireless Controller (Zelda)</a> -- $48</li><li><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-switch-2-nintendo-gamecube-controller-120833/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Official Nintendo GameCube Controller (Switch 2)</a> -- $65</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/GameCube-Wireless-Controller-PC-Mechanical-Vibration/dp/B0F631L416?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">NYXI Warrior Lite</a> -- $50</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Controller-Nintendo-Switch-Joysticks-Mechanical/dp/B0D83WDY28?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">NYXI Warrior</a> -- $69</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=This+GameCube+Controller+With+Back+Buttons+And+Hall+Effect+Sticks+Works+On+Switch+2&amp;fnauthor=stevenpetite&amp;fndate=2025-06-16+12%3A18%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-06-16+12%3A18%3A29&amp;fnarticle_id=6532458&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.skimresources.com%3Fid%3D225336X1707200%26xs%3D1%26xcust%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fnyxigame.com%2Fproducts%2Fnyxi-wizard-2-wireless-joy-pad-for-switch-switch-oled&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fthis-gamecube-controller-with-back-buttons-and-hall-effect-sticks-works-on-switch-2%2F1100-6532458%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">NYXI Wizard 2</a> -- $80 (<del>$90</del>)</li></ul><p>From a customization perspective, the Warrior lineup is the most impressive GameCube-style controller we've tried, but there are other GameCube controllers for Switch 2 that offer a more authentic experience. As mentioned, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-switch-2-nintendo-gamecube-controller-120833/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo's new wireless GameCube controller for Switch 2</a> is as close to the original as you'll find. It feels almost exactly like the original, just without the cable and with a few extra small buttons on the top: C button for GameChat, home/menu buttons, and a small ZL button to make up for the fact the GameCube controller only had one shoulder button. But while this is best option for GameCube games on Switch Online, the aforementioned tiny ZL button makes it less than ideal for modern games.</p><p>Officially licensed <a href="https://www.amazon.com/GameCube-Wireless-Controller-Nintendo-Gaming-Console/dp/B0CT5JPCCC?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GameCube-style controllers from PowerA</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Wireless-Battle-Gamecube-Controller/dp/B08896ZBZK?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hori</a> add Nintendo-inspired designs and have modernized shoulder and trigger layouts. The form factor of these controllers is closer to the original GameCube controller, as they have slimmer profiles compared to the NYXI Warrior.</p><p>NYXI is also soon releasing an updated version of its Wizard controller with TMR electromagnetic sticks. The Wizard replaces the Joy-Con controllers on the original Switch and Switch OLED in handheld mode, but the left and right sides can connect together as a wireless controller in docked mode. It's important to note, however, that the Wizard 2 will only work in handheld mode on original Switch consoles.

The follow-up to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/team-sonic-racing/" data-ref-id="5000-482784">Team Sonic Racing</a> aims to combine its predecessor's formula with the more competitive make-up of the Sonic Riders games, but the culmination lacks both the cooperative nature of the first game and thrilling sense of speed of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sonic-riders/" data-ref-id="5000-25205">Riders</a> or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sonic-riders-zero-gravity/" data-ref-id="5000-32739">Zero Gravity</a>. All that's left is a game that plays fine, but feels like a lesser version of arcade racer juggernaut Mario Kart. CrossWorlds might have been better off solely building on the teamwork focus of Team Sonic Racing (or, better yet, giving us a true follow-up to Zero Gravity that isn't built around gimmicky motion controls).</p><p dir="ltr">If you have played any kart racer, you already have an idea as to how CrossWorlds works. Like its contemporaries, you pick a character and a kart for them to drive, and then after a brief countdown, do your best to drive around a track a set number of times while going over jumps, drifting around corners, and smashing into glowing boxes that reward you with an item to use to mess with other players. The first to finish the race wins.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds - Summer Game Fest Guest Characters Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">CrossWorlds' main gimmick is how each track can cross into another--when the player currently in first place finishes their first lap, they can choose to drive into one of two portals, each of which provides a clear view of a different track on another world. Whichever portal the player picks decides the outcome for everyone, and the second lap is then run on the new track. As lap three begins, the race returns to whatever the original track was.</p><p dir="ltr">At Summer Game Fest 2025, I played a demo that showcased the CrossWorlds' Grand Prix mode, trying it on easy as Jet the Hawk and then again on normal with Amy Rose. Like Grand Prix modes in other racers, this saw me competing in back-to-back races, earning a set number of points for the place I took in each one. CrossWorlds' take on the formula is three races on three different tracks, concluding with a fourth race where lap one is the first track in the series, lap two is the second track, and so on. There's also a "rival" feature, where the game told me which opponent was my rival, and I'd earn extra points for ensuring I at least finished ahead of that character.</p><p dir="ltr">All in all, I had a good time. Racers like this are always more exciting with friends than computers, so despite the game repeatedly reminding me that so-and-so was my rival, I just couldn't muster up the level of hatred in my heart for an AI-controlled opponent that I do for my back-stabbing "friends" who use a well-timed item to take away a hard-fought victory. But I couldn't help but compare CrossWorlds to Mario Kart. The changing maps and rival character are neat, but they don't add anything to the experience that fundamentally changes how you race.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4514620-sgf.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4514620" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4514620-sgf.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4514620"></a><figcaption>Several guest characters will be included in the playable roster, including Persona 5's Joker and Minecraft's Steve.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4514620-sgf.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">It's such a shame how large a departure CrossWorlds is from its predecessor, Team Sonic Racing. The main gimmick of Team Sonic Racing was that every player was racing as part of a team. For example, whichever member of the team was in front would leave behind a draft their allies could use to speed up. There was this great back-and-forth, pull-and-push nature to the gameplay, which didn't exist in other mainstream competitors. Being a good racer was still important, but it was crucial to work in tandem with your teammates to maintain your top speed. It was a new way to play a kart racer.</p><p dir="ltr">I think there's a lot that a sequel could have built upon that foundation, especially as a means to differentiate itself from Mario Kart, which CrossWorlds is clearly trying to emulate. Alternatively, if the teamwork element had to be abandoned in the sequel, going even further and switching to the Riders formula might have also worked. That game leaned into Sonic's legendary speed to deliver another arcade racer that's all about going almost uncontrollably fast, while needing to strategically weigh the risks of pushing forward or replenishing your fuel. That focus would also have been a fantastic way to stand out from similar racers.</p><p dir="ltr">By taking the middle ground, CrossWorlds doesn't rise to the level of what's come before. It's still fun, but any sort of unique flavoring it could have brought to the genre feels absent. Granted, there might be a lot more to the game than what I played at Summer Game Fest--if so, that could change my mind about it.</p><p dir="ltr">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is set to launch for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PS5, PS4, Switch, and PC on September 25. A Switch 2 version of the game is also in the works, but no release date has been confirmed.</p>

Perkins and Crawford will now serve as Darrington Press' Creative Director and Game Director, respectively, <a href="https://darringtonpress.com/welcoming-chris-perkins-and-jeremy-crawford-to-our-team/">according to an announcement on the company's website</a>.</p><p>This is a massive shakeup for the TTRPG world. Critical Role, known for its livestreamed games of Dungeons &amp; Dragons played by high-profile voice actors, launched Darrington Press in 2020. While the company's first projects were Critical Role adjacent, this year it released Daggerheart, a standalone role-playing game designed to compete with Dungeons &amp; Dragons and other similar games. The cast is currently in the midst of a mini-arc using the game system, and fans have speculated the company might intend to move away from D&amp;D entirely one day.</p>

<p>By bringing on Crawford and Perkins, Darrington Press's pedigree increases significantly. The two have worked at Wizards of the Coast for many years (Crawford for 18, Perkins for 28), and are considered two of the primary architects behind Dungeons and Dragons' extremely popular fifth edition and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2024/05/14/the-art-of-the-new-dungeons-dragons">its 2024 overhaul of that ruleset</a>. The designers were public spokespeople for the brand as well, appearing in videos to explain new books or playtests and even clarifying rules on social media. Shortly after the new books were released, however, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/chrisperkinsdnd.bsky.social/post/3llyvdjkphk2p">Chris Perkins</a> and <a href="https://screenrant.com/jeremy-crawford-chris-perkins-leaving-dnd-interview/">Jeremy Crawford</a> each announced they had decided to leave the company.</p><p>Their jump to Darrington is an unexpected move, to say the least, but it seems Wizards of the Coast was aware of the transition, making a point to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dndbeyond.com/post/3lrqh6lyth22l">congratulate the move on Bluesky</a>. <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2025-06-16/critical-role-raids-dungeons-and-dragons-coffers-to-sign-storytelling-duo">The pair also did an interview with <em>The Los Angeles Times</em></a><em> </em>explaining their decision process and generally praising the Critical Role team.</p><p>The two will be "developing novel game concepts as well as expanding the games [Darrington has] released so far," according to the announcement. This likely involves additions to Daggerheart, which launched a few weeks ago. For more Daggerheart and its inspirations, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/tabletop/2025/05/15/exclusive-diving-deep-into-critical-roles-daggerheart">you can read our interview with its lead game designer, Spenser Starke</a>.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/06/16/borderlands-4-standard-edition-confirmed-to-cost-70<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Gearbox has opened pre-orders for <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/04/30/borderlands-4-deep-dive-details-new-vault-hunters-open-world-changes-loot-shakeups-and">Borderlands 4</a>, confirming a $69.99 price for the Standard Edition. This news alleviates fan concern that the upcoming shooter would retail at $80 and follows CEO Randy Pitchford’s controversial comment last month that “real fans” would find a way to purchase the game at that price.</p><p>The worry over Borderlands 4’s price stemmed from an <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1922454876803551555">exchange on X</a> with Randy Pitchford on May 13 where a fan told him the game “better not be 80 dollars.” Pitchford responded by saying the decision was “Not my call”, then added the following:</p><p>“If you’re a real fan, you’ll find a way to make it happen. My local game store had Starflight for Sega Genesis for $80 in 1991 when I was just out of high school working minimum wage at an ice cream parlor in Pismo Beach and I found a way to make it happen.”</p><p>Pitchford’s comment attracted criticism from those who took this as him implying that players who couldn’t afford to pay $80 are not true fans. It also fueled speculation that Borderlands 4 would indeed follow the growing trend set by <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/04/07/nintendo-says-mario-kart-worlds-value-justifies-its-80-price">Mario Kart World</a> of retailing at the higher price point.</p>

<p>Following the backlash, Pitchford addressed his comment by <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1925108385625809225">sharing a clip</a> from a PAX East developer panel (which occurred before Pitchford’s controversial X post), where he elaborated on Borderlands 4’s then-potential price by speaking on the current realities of video game development budgets and pricing.</p><p>“It’s an interesting time, right?” says Pitchford during the Q&amp;A session. “On one level, we’ve got a competitive marketplace where the people who make those choices want to sell as many units as possible and they want to be careful about people who are price-sensitive. So there’s some folks who don’t want to see prices go up, even the ones deciding what the prices are. There’s other folks accepting the reality that game budgets are increasing and there’s tariffs for the retail packaging and it’s getting gnarly out there, you guys. Borderlands 4 has more than twice the development budget than Borderlands 3. More than twice. So the truth is, I don’t know what the price is going to be.”</p><p>He then added, “As artists, we want everybody to have it. We want to make it as easy as possible for everybody to enjoy what we’re creating.”</p>

If you’re playing a V that is wholly uninterested in Johnny’s wants and views his engram as nothing more than a digital parasite, it might not make sense to follow this path. But if you’re even the least bit curious about the impact Johnny’s left on those still alive in 2077, do these quests.

Kerry’s quests take a fascinating look at how art persists in a capitalist hellscape like Night City, and explore how even if you preserve yourself with expensive cybernetics, age and time come for us all. It’s just a matter of how you adapt to its passage.</p><p>That’s what makes Kerry’s quests interesting regardless of the V you’re playing, but if you’re rolling a male V, you can also enter a relationship with Kerry, which is one of the most interesting explorations of V and Johnny’s cohabitation. He’s the last companion you meet in the game so his story comes pretty late, but it’s definitely worth seeking out before you head into the endgame.</p><p><strong>Available in:</strong> Act 3 after A Like Supreme</p><p><strong>How to acquire:</strong> Phone call from Kerry</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="17304c88a409d71d17e978f9aaab38ba" data-recommend-id="image://17304c88a409d71d17e978f9aaab38ba" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Judy is shown sitting on the hood of a car in diving gear." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Judy is shown sitting on the hood of a car in diving gear." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->CD Projekt Red / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="17304c88a409d71d17e978f9aaab38ba" data-recommend-id="image://17304c88a409d71d17e978f9aaab38ba" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Judy is shown sitting on the hood of a car in diving gear." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Judy Alvarez is one of the few unambiguously good people in Night City, and her questline, in which she attempts to fight for better working conditions for sex workers in the city, is some of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>’s best introspective work.</p><p>The final quest, “Pyramid Song,” is one of the most memorable in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, and shows Judy wrestling with what “home” means to her when Night City has only chewed her up and spit her out.

But that new path is only open to you because Panam and her Nomad family opens V up to a new way of thinking. Vibing with the Aldecaldos, who have no connection to the city and are mostly just passing through, offers a perspective you don’t hear very often in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>. So much of the time you spend in Night City is with people who put the city and its values up on a pedestal, whereas Panam and her family have the perspective to see through its bullshit.</p><p>Panam’s questline is all about helping her get the nomads into a better position to leave Night City, and maybe by the time you’re done, you’re at least considering other possibilities for yourself.</p><p><strong>Available in:</strong> Act 2 after Life During Wartime</p><p><strong>How to acquire:</strong> Phone call from Panam</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="309233db0c8fe5f9ec83638d58eae9c7" data-recommend-id="image://309233db0c8fe5f9ec83638d58eae9c7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="V and River are shown looking at a computer in a bedroom." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="V and River are shown looking at a computer in a bedroom." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->CD Projekt Red / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="309233db0c8fe5f9ec83638d58eae9c7" data-recommend-id="image://309233db0c8fe5f9ec83638d58eae9c7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="V and River are shown looking at a computer in a bedroom." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Unlike Panam, Judy, and Kerry, River is the one companion you have to go out of your way to meet. Finding the Night City cop and helping him sort through a local mystery that weaves in and out of his family life makes for one of the most interesting breaks in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>’s usual action. Expect a little combat and chatter, but also light adventure game mechanics and some pretty horrifying Night City lore.</p><p>This questline does, however, unmask <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>’s weird, inconsistent framing of cops and law enforcement, even weaponizing the ACAB saying in a particularly tacky lift that I’m not wild about. But if nothing else, these quests offer, for your inspection, a layer of the game’s inherent worldview that’s worth examining and dissecting.</p><p><strong>Available in:</strong> Act 2 after Life During Wartime</p><p><strong>How to acquire:</strong> Phone call from Elizabeth Peralez</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="900670a1c9768768ed74cb62383e0c4b" data-recommend-id="image://900670a1c9768768ed74cb62383e0c4b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="V and Jackie are shown standing in an elevator." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="V and Jackie are shown standing in an elevator." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->CD Projekt Red / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="900670a1c9768768ed74cb62383e0c4b" data-recommend-id="image://900670a1c9768768ed74cb62383e0c4b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="V and Jackie are shown standing in an elevator." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The trouble with “Heroes” is the quest can take different forms depending on what decisions you make during “The Heist” in Act 1.

On the other hand, if you send him to Ripperdoc Viktor Vektor you’ll experience a much worse result that is pretty bleak.</p><p>The “good” version of “Heroes” is one of the game’s best examples of how human connection can help people weather the harsh realities of Night City. The quest reflects on Jackie’s life and legacy, and lets you insert a little of your own relationship with him, too.</p><p><strong>Available in:</strong> Act 2 after The Heist</p><p><strong>How to acquire:</strong> Phone call from Mama Welles</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="69d3d472a97106d78ae61d41e4121aff" data-recommend-id="image://69d3d472a97106d78ae61d41e4121aff" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Joshua and a corpo are shown sitting at a restaurant table while he eats." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Joshua and a corpo are shown sitting at a restaurant table while he eats." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->CD Projekt Red / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="69d3d472a97106d78ae61d41e4121aff" data-recommend-id="image://69d3d472a97106d78ae61d41e4121aff" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Joshua and a corpo are shown sitting at a restaurant table while he eats." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The questline known colloquially as “Sinnerman” is harrowing, but offers one of the most rewarding hypotheticals V will face in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>. It follows convicted murderer Joshua Stephenson, who has a religious awakening in prison.

Each AI-powered car you round up has a distinct personality. Some are great, like a car terrified of drive too fast that you have to carefully direct back to its home base. Some are obnoxious, like one that is literally just GLaDOS from <em>Portal</em>, which was a dated reference in 2020 and even more dated now.

It comes with confirmation that Scott has already officially stepped away from Nexus Mods, “following months of meetings, face-to-face talks, and a whole lot of soul searching.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The message keeps many of the behind-the-scenes details under wraps but says two new individuals — one named Victor (a.k.a. <a href="https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/Foledinho" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Foledinho</u></a>) and another named Marinus (a.k.a. <a href="https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/rapsak" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Rapsak</u></a>) — have adopted the leadership role, with both of their profiles now bearing the “Site Owner” title. The leadership change signals the beginning of a new era for Nexus Mods, and for Scott, a much-needed break.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"The strain of being responsible for the behemoth I created has taken its toll.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“The strain of being responsible for the behemoth I created has taken its toll,” Scott explained. “The stress of the job has been a regular source of anxiety and stress-related health issues. I realised that I have been burning out and this started to have an impact on my staff and Nexus Mods as a whole. So, I firmly believe that the best thing for the future of Nexus Mods is for me to step aside and bring in new leadership to steer the business forward with renewed energy to make Nexus Mods the modding community we all truly deserve.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The small project born in Scott’s bedroom for The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind eventually ballooned into a massive entity in the gaming space. The Nexus Mods <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/about" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>About Us page</u></a> notes that this beating heart of the PC gaming community is made up of 63.4 million users and 16.8 billion file downloads, positioning it as one of the most highly trafficked UK-based websites on the planet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Nexus Mods has grown, so too has its impact on Scott, who has spent “every single day” for more than 20 years “on call.” Losing his direct input in the day-to-day operations of Nexus Mods will surely result in some changes, but Scott assured modders and gamers alike that the shift should not be cause for concern.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This is me doing something I probably should’ve done years ago: taking care of myself.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“Behind the scenes, I’ve already been stepping back bit by bit,” Scott clarifies. “Over the past few years, the team has taken on more of the weight and the site’s been doing better than ever. What’s changing now is simply the formality of it, making sure the right people are in place to guide Nexus Mods into the next era.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Scott says his stepping down from Nexus Mods, as well as a few small structural changes, are moves made to ensure “long-term stability” and won’t impact how the site has been operating recently. He goes as far as to say, “Nexus Mods is community-first and mod-author focused, that’s not up for negotiation.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Scott steps away from his direct leadership position, the modding creator says he’ll still engage with the Nexus Mods community on its Mod Author Discord, forums, and more. He’ll also help guide the site’s 40-person team as the page is turned, relieving his duties as its face and figurehead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So yes, the ownership of Nexus Mods has changed hands, but I want to be clear, this isn’t some corporate ‘exit’ or a backroom deal,” Scott adds. “This is me doing something I probably should’ve done years ago: taking care of myself. Reclaiming some headspace. And finally letting go of the idea that I have to do everything and be responsible for everything myself.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nexus Mods has housed thousands of fan-made creations for games like franchises like The Elder Scrolls, Fallout, Stardew Valley, Baldur’s Gate, Cyberpunk 2077, and many, many more for decades. In fact, just moments after The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion shadow-dropped earlier this year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-mods-have-already-been-published-online">dozens of minor mods had already been published on the site</a>. It’s the go-to place for PC gamers to modify their games to their liking, and with its first change in leadership in 24 years comes a fair amount of uncertainty for its future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

After some initial controversy around the cost of the game, the price has officially been <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-standard-edition-price-set-at-70-after-all">confirmed by 2K Games</a>. At $70 for the standard edition, the newest <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-games-in-order">Borderlands game in the series</a> is going to be the most expensive so far.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Borderlands is set to release on September 12, but there is another related preorder that won't come out until later that same month. The Art of Borderlands 4 oversized coffee table book that features art and commentary from the game's development will be released on September 30. At $55, it is priced closer to what the previous standard edition video games were at launch.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Preorder The Art of Borderlands 4 Book</h2><div catalogid="fb8ef5f1-c9e0-48f9-bf13-2cc15119b5e0" id="223041"><div id="223041" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Art of Borderlands 4</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Art of Borderlands 4 was <a href="https://gamerant.com/art-of-borderlands-4-official-artbook-cover-reveal/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced last month</a> when the cover was officially revealed. The book itself will feature 224 pages in a 9x12-inch format that is perfect for coffee tables or your bookshelf. It features a mixture of sketches, line art, concept art, and commentary about how all of these things went into the development of the new game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With a release date of September 30, the main downside of this art book is that it won't arrive until after the game. So if you were hoping to get an early look at how Borderlands 4 came together visually before you play the game itself, you're out of luck. If you're just a fan of the Borderlands series and want to add this book to your collection, however, it's worth checking out.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What Is Amazon's Preorder Price Guarantee?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If you've never actually preordered anything from Amazon before, it's worth noting that if you purchase this art book ahead of the release date, it includes Amazon's preorder price guarantee. According to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=G4BRP7LCB9DSDNCR" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon's own help page</a>, this means that if the price decreases between now and when the item ships, you'll pay the lowest price. So in this case, if this preorder gets a discount before the book actually starts shipping then you'll pay whatever it dropped to rather than the full price.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although not every preorder gets discounted, physical editions of books seem to drop in price fairly often compared to other product categories. With Borderlands 4 arriving a full two weeks ahead of this art book, it seems likely we could see a preorder discount appear somewhere in that window this fall.</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jun 16, 2025 5:14 pm</p></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
