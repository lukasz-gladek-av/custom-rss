            <p>
Sony has announced its next State of Play showcase.
</p>
<p>
After being rumoured and speculated about for some time, the Playstation maker has finally confirmed that yes, we will be getting a showcase event in May.
</p>
<p>
It all kicks off tomorrow, 30th May, at 11pm UK time. That's 3pm PT / 6pm ET for those across the pond.

<p>
The show is set to last for "30+" minutes, and will cover PS5 and PS VR2 titles. It will also provide us with a look at some upcoming PlayStation Studios games, which are arriving later this year. In total, 14 titles will be shown.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps, we will hear more about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-ragnarok-is-the-next-sony-game-coming-to-pc-leaker-suggests">God of War: Ragnarök's reported PC release</a> here? Or, more on Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, which was first announced at a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-sonys-playstation-showcase">PlayStation showcase around this time last year</a>.
</p>
<p>I suppose, we will have to wait and see. Stay tuned for more!</p>

<p>
If you fancy making an evening/early morning combo of video game broadcasts, remember Konami also has its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-announcement-stream-scheduled-for-this-week">Silent Hill Transmission show set for tomorrow</a> as well. This particular show will air after State of Play, at midnight (again, that is UK timing). </p>
<p>
Both essentially act as a kick off into this year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-2024-conference-schedule-all-dates-times-streams">not-E3/Summer Games Fest/IGN Live week</a>, with showcases from Ubisoft and Xbox to follow.</p>

            <p>Many moons ago, premiere wordsman Nate Crowley <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/maneater-review">reviewed</a> shark ‘em up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/maneater">Maneater</a>, decrying its incurious perpetuation of anti-shark propaganda, and calling it “an ecstatically violent simulation of being a fool's idea of a shark.” My own frothing penchant for the plan-schemes of Warhammer’s Skaven ratboys has been documented in these pages to the point of rabidity, but I do feel broadly similarly about media that sullies rats - clean, smart and good folk that they are. Lively tactics <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/trash-of-the-titans">Trash Of The Titans</a> does not aim to emancipate its villainous vermin. But, like Warhammer, it gets a pass for its evident affection towards its antagonistic dumpster diving scuttlers. Also, it's just plain fun.</p>

<p>Solo-willed-into-existence by developer Alex 'Thayer And Back Again', Trash Of The Titans’ grid-based, elevation-respecting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> most immediately evokes <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-tactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a>. You play as a party of assorted trash mammals trying to protect your rotting hauls from a gang of criminal vermin known as The Rat Crue. Misspelling ‘crew’ is, of course, the telltale signature of only the most badbutt crews. It’s vaguely roguelike in structure, with one stage leading to the next as you nab upgrades based on how much trash you managed to protect. The game’s setting is left vague, although it is clearly set somewhere with a bizarre culture of nibbling at whole chickens before discarding them, since that's most of the trash.</p>

<p>Turn order is set before each round, and each trash mammal has their own specialisation. Badger is a tank, able to clear gaps by charging, with a bonus buff to attack damage based on how much health they’re missing. Racoon is a sneak thief, able to turn invisible and backstab. They can actually cloak, stab, then re-cloak in a single round, although this eats through MP, which regens slowly throughout. Happily, they also provide some bonus regen for squad cohesion. Possum is an archer, able to take advantage of the aforementioned elevation, and Skunk is a fart-shaman, with poison gas attacks used for board control.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, there’s some lovely QOL features, like previews for specific attack damage. Also, move and attack points are spent separately, so you can mix and match for dastardly plays. There’s plenty of additional non-trash additions, like boons you can collect for extra abilities, and bonus buffs and upgrades at the end of each mission depending on how much trash you save. It’s neat! I said “this looks neat” when I saw it, and then I played it, and it’s neat! If only life in general could unfold so smoothly! Trash Of The Titans, you are forgiven for your rat slander. It’s out today, and there’s a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2450400/Trash_of_the_Titans/">demo available</a> at time of writing.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-helldivers-2-npd-circana-april-2024/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The former NPD Group (now named “Circana”) has released its <a href="https://x.com/MatPiscatella/status/1795803675530522972" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full North American sales data for April</a>, and it was a bit of a down month for the industry. Players spent $4.1 billion on games, additional content, and hardware in April, down 3 percent year-on-year. While software spending was up slightly, hardware numbers were down a whopping 43 percent year-on-year. As has been the case for a several month straight, PS5 was #1 in terms of unit and dollar sales, Switch was #2 in terms of unit sales, and Xbox Series X/S was #2 in terms of dollar sales.</p>
<p>Sony had a lot to be happy about on the software front, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/stellar-blade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stellar Blade</a> debuted at #1 and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/helldivers-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Helldivers 2</a> held steady at #2 in its third month on the market. A number of previously-Xbox-exclusive games that launched on PlayStation in April also hopped up the charts – <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/sea-of-thieves/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sea of Thieves</a> went from #55 in March to #4 in April and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/grounded/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grounded</a> went from #167 to #12. Meanwhile, the effect of the Fallout TV series was also felt, boosting Fallout 4 to #5 and Fallout 76 up to #8.</p>
<p>Here are April’s top 20 premium games according to Circana:</p>
<p><em>1 - Stellar Blade</em></p>
<p><em>2 - Helldivers 2</em></p>
<p><em>3 - Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III</em></p>
<p><em>4 - Sea of Thieves</em></p>
<p><em>5 - Fallout 4</em></p>
<p><em>6 - MLB The Show 24</em></p>
<p><em>7 - Dragon's Dogma 2</em></p>
<p><em>8 - Fallout 76</em></p>
<p><em>9 - Hogwarts Legacy</em></p>
<p><em>10 - EA Sports FC 24</em></p>
<p><em>11 - Rise of the Ronin</em></p>
<p><em>12 - Grounded</em></p>
<p><em>13 - Minecraft</em></p>
<p><em>14 - Madden NFL 24</em></p>
<p><em>15 - Princess Peach: Showtime!</em></p>
<p><em>16 - Rainbow Six Siege</em></p>
<p><em>17 - Tekken 8</em></p>
<p><em>18 - Mario Kart 8</em></p>
<p><em>19 - Elden Ring</em></p>
<p><em>20 - Spider-Man 2</em></p>
<p>And here are the top games of 2024 to date:</p>
<p><em>1 - Helldivers 2</em></p>
<p><em>2 - Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III</em></p>
<p><em>3 - Dragon's Dogma 2</em></p>
<p><em>4 - MLB The Show 24</em></p>
<p><em>5 - Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em></p>
<p><em>6 - Tekken 8</em></p>
<p><em>7 - Madden NFL 24</em></p>
<p><em>8 - Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em></p>
<p><em>9 - Hogwarts Legacy</em></p>
<p><em>10 - Persona 3 Reload</em></p>
<p>What are your thoughts on the April NPD/Circana charts? Any big surprises or things you’re happy to see?</p>

		<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/644930/They_Are_Billions/?ref=remapradio.com" rel="noreferrer"><em>They Are Billions</em></a><em> </em>is a steampunk zombie survival RTS, which is probably not the most enticing collection of words and might tell you a lot about the particular moment it emerged from. On the other hand, it’s a game made of everyone’s favorite RTS mission archetype: the hold-out mission. Carentan in <em>Company of Heroes</em>, the mountaintop defense at the culmination of <em>Warcraft III</em>, any number of missions in the Terran campaigns of <em>StarCraft</em>… the list of all-time classic missions goes on.&nbsp;<em>Homeworld 3 </em>recently made a couple <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F368tbT9QQ&amp;ref=remapradio.com" rel="noreferrer">worthy additions</a> to the list as well.</p><p>Structurally they tend to solve the biggest problem with RTS games, which is that they are so fast-paced and ask so much of the player that it’s rare they give you a chance to sit back and watch the fireworks. They were so popular you could argue they spawned the tower defense genre, which goes back to <em>StarCraft </em>and really took off with special game modes for <em>Warcraft III. They Are Billions </em>just winds the clock back to the <em>Age of Empires II </em>era with an RTS where the entire game is about surviving huge onslaughts of enemies that will gratifyingly march headlong into your defenses.</p><p>It’s also a game designed to be very dangerous to me personally. It’s conceptually straightforward, but lends itself, via its No Reloads survival mode, to repeated runs. I constantly work to beat the odds and get a high score, but I can pour hours into a run only to have it completely undone due to an obvious-in-retrospect error. As the zombies overrun my sprawling colony and the its little clockwork defenses crack and then crumble, I’m primed to move on to the next run immediately.</p><p>The problem is that I’m never sure I want to. This past winter, when I finally had a week to myself and was still reeling from grueling months of medical emergencies involving my dog Mina, I had a stack of great games I’d wanted to dig into before the end of the year. The trouble was, while I had a lot of good games to play, I felt like they were all too good to be wasted on the tatters of mental energy and slivers of free time that I had available. Restless scrolling through my Steam library brought <em>They Are Billions </em>back to my attention. Five minutes later, I was launching into my first game. “I’ll just mess around in there until I figure out what I really want to play,” I told myself.</p><p>For months, I found myself playing it whenever I had a few loose minutes. It went from feeling like a welcome return to an old favorite to something closer to a fixation. I'd quit the game and consider watching or playing something else, but the only thing I could think about is how much better I think I’d do on the next run.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo via </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/developer/NumantianGames?snr=1_5_9__2000&amp;ref=remapradio.com"><span>Numantian Games</span></a></figcaption></figure><p>I don’t know if it was always like this for me. However, when I think back to my love affairs with <em>Europa Universalis III</em>, <em>Medieval: Total War</em>, or <em>Civilization II, </em>they had a lot of the same characteristics. I internalized these games so much that I could almost play them on mental autopilot, racing through rehearsed steps toward the trickier parts I was dying to master. </p><p>Now, all those franchises have gotten just complicated enough that I find they require more mental investment, which both saves me from this compulsive loop but also creates the kind of friction that makes it almost too easy for me to bounce off a game entirely. There are a lot of days I don’t want to think <em>quite</em> that<em> </em>hard, so I’ll save a strategy game or a tricky RPG “for later when I have more time and I’m in a better place.” (It looks like, far from being the only one, I am part of <a href="https://quanticfoundry.com/2024/05/21/strategy-decline/?ref=remapradio.com" rel="noreferrer">a measurable trend</a>.) Meanwhile, games like <em>They Are Billions </em>keep slipping under my guard. Hours that I didn’t think I had available to spend will go flying by, and I’ll find myself wondering, “What was the point of doing all that again and again?”</p>

  <p id="wskIZk"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/23414847/rings-power-season-1-review"><em>The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power</em></a> is doing what no Lord of the Rings adaptation has done before: putting <a href="https://www.polygon.com/lord-of-the-rings/2021/1/20/22239302/who-is-tom-bombadil-poem-hobbit-lotr-books-movies">Tom Bombadil</a> in the thing. </p>
<p id="YoY6IL">Rory Kinnear (<em>Black Mirror</em>) will play the puissant and pacifistic character in season 2 of the Prime Video series, <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/tom-bombadil-the-rings-of-power-first-look">Vanity Fair</a> revealed on Wednesday. With a few months ahead of its Aug. 29 premiere date, showrunners <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23329258/lord-rings-power-review-episode-release">J.D. Payne and Patrick McKay</a> were ready to explain how and why they brought the oft-overlooked Tolkien character to the screen. </p>
<p id="g3vcec">To fans of J.R.R. Tolkien’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/lord-of-the-rings"><em>The Lord of the Rings</em></a>, Tom Bombadil is divisive out of proportion to his prominence. The linchpin of a three-chapter digression early in the pages of <em>The Fellowship of the Ring</em>, Tom rescues Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin from an intelligent and malicious tree known as Old Man Willow and takes them back to his house to meet his wife. But also, he’s apparently so powerful that the One Ring has no effect on him. </p>

<p id="gCZBjF">Tom is neither hobbit nor human, nor dwarven, nor elven. He says that he’s older than the existence of rivers, and trees, and paths. Though he has Gandalf’s deep respect, he’s not a wizard, and aside from saving the hobbits’ lives a couple times, he has no interest in weighing in on the Ring Quest. But also he’s cheerful, has a big bushy beard, wears a funny hat, and he constantly spouts almost nonsensical rhyming couplets.</p>
<p id="Y7VxpS">It’s that mystery and dichotomy that made Payne and McKay interested in bringing him into <em>The Rings of Power</em>, despite his canonical appearances being limited to those few chapters in <em>The Fellowship of the Ring</em>. </p>
<p id="Fxj54b">“Tom Bombadil is singing and saying lines that could be nursery rhymes from children’s poems,” Payne told Vanity Fair. “So he sort of defies the tonal shift of the rest of the season and is a real point of light amidst an otherwise sea of darkness.” </p>
<p id="soFybX">Payne and McKay’s Bombadil is concerned with the fate of natural life on Middle-earth: “In our story, he has gone out to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23365209/lord-rings-power-white-robe-character-sauron-dweller-nomad-ascetic">the lands of Rhûn</a>,” said Payne, “which we learn used to be sort of Edenic and green and beautiful, but now is sort of a dead wasteland.” This isn’t a big stretch for a figure who soothes angry trees and married the daughter of a river, but in <em>Rings of Power</em>, he’ll drop some cryptically-put advice to Stranger, who <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23403120/rings-power-who-is-stranger-wizard-actor-daniel-weyman">may or may not be an amnesiac Gandalf</a>, instead of a group of hobbits.</p>
<p id="TOb3ST">“He nudges the Stranger along his journey, which he knows will eventually protect the larger natural world that he cares about. So I’d say our Tom Bombadil is slightly more interventionist than you see in the books, but only by 5% or 10%,” Payne said.</p>
<p id="Pfko8u">For decades, casual readers have puzzled over Tom’s place in the Lord of the Rings, but the truth is that the character is something of a relic of the origin of Tolkien’s high fantasy trilogy as a simple sequel to his episodic adventure for children, <em>The Hobbit</em>. Tolkien wrote Tom, a figure <a href="https://www.polygon.com/lord-of-the-rings/2021/1/20/22239302/who-is-tom-bombadil-poem-hobbit-lotr-books-movies">originally invented to entertain his children</a>, into the story before he had even conceived of Aragorn’s kingly destiny, or that Sauron was the ultimate antagonist, or that Frodo’s name shouldn’t be “Bingo Baggins.”</p>
<p id="a6KXaR">So why did Tom stay in, through all processes of revision? </p>

<p id="YVaWeh">“Tom Bombadil is not an important person — to the narrative,” Tolkien once wrote to his proofreader for <em>The Lord of the Rings.</em> “I suppose he has some importance as a ‘comment.’ I mean, I do not really write like that... He represents something that I feel important, though I would not be prepared to analyze the feeling precisely.”</p>
<p id="ESuFGH">Tolkien was an academic specializing in Old English and Scandinavian languages, one who held a lifelong fascination for the folklore, mythology, legends, and epic poetry of those regions. His fiction is a constant mix and remix of stories he invented for his children, fairy tales, Norse myth, Arthuriana, epic poetry like <em>Beowulf</em>, and other references, allusions, and motifs familiar pretty much only to other academics in his field. </p>
<p id="A3VK4S">Tom Bombadil began as a cameo for his children, but he stayed in the story because he made it feel more like Tolkien’s favorite <em>kind</em> of stories. Tolkien just liked what Tom Bombadil contributed to the vibe — and so does <em>The Rings of Power</em>, apparently. </p>

<p>A new trademark has been filed by FireFly Studios named Stronghold: The Dark Ages, which could suggest it will be the next name for the series’ next installment.</p>



<p>The trademark was first spotted by <a href="https://respawnfirst.com/a-new-installment-in-the-stronghold-series-possibly-trademarked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Respawn First</a>, which was filed on April 8th, 2024, and is currently in the ‘”examination” stage. </p>



<p>If you thought ‘The Dark Ages’ sounded familiar, well, you’re right, as last week Insider Gaming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/doom-the-dark-ages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exclusively reported that the next Doom game</a> would be called ‘Doom: The Dark Ages.’ Our reporting (and the impending reveal of the next Doom game) suggests that the title is likely to be rejected.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, the filing does tell us that the next Stronghold game is almost certainly to be set in the ‘Dark Ages’, which began after the fall of the Western Roman Empire.</p>



<p>The next Stronghold game would mark FireFly Studios’ first major new release following the studios’ acquisition by Devolver Digital in 2021. Currently, FireFly Studios is focused on post-launch content of Stronghold: Definitive Edition, which was released in November 2023 and has received ‘Very Positive’ reviews on Steam based on 6400 reviews at the time of writing.</p>



<p>What do you think of a new Stronghold title? Let us know in the comments below!</p>

<p>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion played a massive role in my childhood. It was one of my first true open-world RPG experiences, and I lost myself for the longest time. I explored every inch of Cyrodiil, favoring Anvil. Despite my undying love for the RPG, I can admit that it’s showing its age. We could use more information about the Oblivion Remaster release date, so here’s what we know currently!</p>



<h2 id="h-is-oblivion-getting-a-remaster">Is Oblivion Getting a Remaster?</h2>



<p>Thanks to the FTC leaks, specifically the ZeniMax Management Forecast, we know that Bethesda was working on an Oblivion Remaster at one point. The open-world RPG project was said to launch sometime in Fiscal Year 22, meaning sometime between July 2021 and June 2022, but that didn’t happen. Most projects received significant delays following the pandemic and a tumultuous games industry.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Phil Spencer said you can’t always trust these leaks, as projects constantly shift and change in game development. He’s likely trying to cast a shadow of doubt over the entire leak, but that doesn’t mean it’s not happening sometime this year or next!</p>



<p>Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/do-we-know-the-fallout-3-remaster-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Do We Know the Fallout 3 Remaster Release Date?</a></p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-oblivion-remaster-release-date">When is the Oblivion Remaster Release Date?</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, we don’t yet have an official Oblivion Remaster release date. There is very little information surrounding the project, including whether it’s still happening. Unlike with the Fallout franchise, there’s less of a wait time from this point until the launch of The Elder Scrolls VI, though we still don’t have an official release date for that title either.</p>



<p>That said, remaster The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion would make a lot of sense. It was a fan-favorite RPG, and it would help bridge the gap between The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim and The Elder Scrolls VI.</p>

Games has revealed gameplay for Homelander, the next DLC character for <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/mortal-kombat-1">Mortal Kombat 1</a>.</p><p>Homelander, who is based on the supervillain from Prime Video’s mega hit show <a href="https://www.ign.com/tv/the-boys">The Boys</a>, appears as a guest DLC character in NetherRealm’s gory fighting game, and based on the gameplay trailer below, the ‘evil Superman’ is a good fit.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Homelander joins the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MortalKombat1?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#MortalKombat1</a> roster on June 4, Ferra Kameo joins later in June.

In a world where “Supes” are made, he’s the strongest of them all. Homelander presents himself as the ultimate patriot and protector, but don’t let his movie star good looks or high approval rating fool you. He is a murderous, narcissistic sociopath with an insatiable need for validation, love, and power. Homelander’s destruction of enemies and lust for power does not end with his world. Challengers from other realms will also face his wrath. As seen in the new video, Homelander asserts dominance over opponents through his super strength, aerial attacks, and capacity to laser enemies with his eyes. </blockquote><p>If you can get through Homelander’s disgusting milk-drinking victory pose, you’ll see he uses his famous laser eyes in much of his combo building, as a launcher, an interrupt, as well as a combo extender. Indeed, the laser eyes are the basis of one of Homelander’s Fatalities, which we get a glimpse at at the end of the clip.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/29/screenshot-2024-05-29-143348-1716989639063.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Mortal Kombat 1 fans have wondered who Homelander might differ from similar Superman-style characters already in the game, such as Omni-Man from the Invincible series. Based on the gameplay trailer, we can see Homelander shares many abilities with Omni-Man, such as flight and heavy hitting attacks, but the difference appears to be in speed and, again, those laser eyes.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/29/screenshot-2024-05-29-143110-1716989487729.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Warner Bros. has remained coy about the voice actor behind Mortal Kombat 1’s Homelander. Antony Starr, who plays Homelander in The Boys, has said he is not voicing the character in the game, much to the disappointment of fans. Omni-Man voice actor J. K. Simmons reprised his role for Mortal Kombat 1, as did Peacemaker actor John Cena. It is unclear why Starr did not do the same here. Still, fans will be able to live out their Homelander versus Omni-Man fantasies through Mortal Kombat 1 when the character is made available next month.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/29/screenshot-2024-05-29-143232-1716989566907.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Meanwhile, we also get a look at Kameo character Ferra, who Homelander uses to set up a number of combos. Ferra is the small fighter who sat atop the hulking Torr as part of the combined Ferra &amp; Torr character from Mortal Kombat X. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/29/screenshot-2024-05-29-143542-1716989748027.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Homelander hits Mortal Kombat 1 on June 4 for early access players, followed by wide availability on June 11, whereas Ferra has a June release window. You need the Premium Edition or the Kombat Pack to play early. The Mortal Kombat 1 Kombat Pack includes the Jean-Claude Van Damme character skin for Johnny Cage (available now), and one-week early access to six playable DLC characters: Omni-Man (available now), Quan Chi (available now), Peacemaker (available now), Ermac (available now), Homelander (out soon), and Takeda Takahashi, as well as five DLC Kameo fighters. The Boys Season 4, meanwhile, kicks off June 13.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

<p>The families of multiple victims of the 2022 mass shooting at Uvalde's Robb Elementary School are suing Activision in a California civil court, alleging that the company's <em>Call of Duty</em> games act as a "training camp for mass shooters."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/736998045/Activision-Uvalde-suit-via-Polygon">The lawsuit</a> (as <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24166245/uvalde-school-shooting-activision-blizzard-negligence-lawsuit">obtained by Polygon</a>) compares Activision's <em>Call of Duty</em> marketing to the cigarette industry's use of <a href="https://tobacco.stanford.edu/cigarettes/cartoons/joe-camel-cartoons/">now-barred spokescartoon Joe Camel</a>, putting the gaming company "in the wildly lucrative business of training adolescents to become gunmen." The <em>Call of Duty</em> games "are chewing up alienated teenage boys and spitting out mass shooters," the lawsuit alleges, and in Uvalde, the games "knowingly exposed the Shooter to the weapon, conditioned him to see it as the solution to his problems, and trained him how to use it."</p>
<p>Meta platforms is also a party to the lawsuit for "explicit, aggressive marketing" of firearms to minors via Instagram.</p>
<h2>Too real</h2>
<p>While <em>Call of Duty</em> may have started as a mere video game, the lawsuit argues that more recent versions have crossed the line into a realistic "simulation" that "enables the operator to reproduce or represent under test condition phenomena likely to occur in actual performance." The extreme realism in the game desensitizes players to killing in familiar environments like malls, airports, and restaurants, the suit says, and exposes "high-school aged boys with developing brains" to "morally complex situations with an assault weapon."</p>
<p>By "manipulating players' brain chemistry so that killing was associated with dopamine release, reward, and/or pleasure," the suit alleges that the games cause a "real life physical and neurological response" that some users are likely to try to replicate in the real world. "It is highly foreseeable that the addictive and hyper-realistic content of Call of Duty products will lead some users, including minors, to attempt or achieve the real-life enactment of what the Call of Duty products simulate so effectively, including the use of firearms for mass killing," the suit alleges.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>In 2015, the American Psychological Association <a href="https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2015/08/violent-video-games">said</a> that "violent video game play is linked to increased aggression in players." But in a 2020 update, the APA clarified that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/03/apa-warns-against-linking-violent-video-games-to-real-world-violence/">there was no statistical link</a> between exposure to violent video games and incidence of real-world violence, affirming <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2007/11/meta-analysis-uncovers-no-real-link-between-violence-and-gaming/">earlier meta-analyses</a> on the topic.
</p><p>In a statement provided to Polygon, an Activision spokesperson said that “the Uvalde shooting was horrendous and heartbreaking in every way, and we express our deepest sympathies to the families and communities who remain impacted by this senseless act of violence. Academic and scientific research continues to show that there is no causal link between video games and gun violence.”</p>
<h2>Real virtual guns</h2>
<p>The lawsuit pays particular attention to Activision's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shooters-how-video-games-fund-arms-manufacturers">long-standing licensing agreements with real-world gun manufacturers</a>, which bring additional realism to the games while promoting the gun-makers' products. Gun-maker memos cited in the lawsuit show how the industry feels that "a primary means for young potential shooters to come into contact with firearms and ammunition is through virtual gaming scenarios." And while the specific brands of those guns are not highlighted in the game itself, the lawsuit lays out significant evidence that gun buyers seek out the real versions of the weapons they use in the <em>Call of Duty</em> games.</p>
<p>"In service of... their bottom line, Activision created a firearm showroom for its millions of users—one where adults and teenagers alike could browse, test, covet, and compare each weapon's capacity to kill," the lawsuit alleges.</p>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/codweapons.png" data-height="759" data-width="1000" alt="Some of the weapons that appear in <em>Call of Duty</em> games."></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/codweapons.png" data-height="759" data-width="1000">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> Some of the weapons that appear in <em>Call of Duty</em> games.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>Daniel Defense, which manufactured the actual gun used in the Uvalde shooting, is not a defendant in the suit. While the plaintiffs say the gun maker's actions are "contemptible, reckless, and at times unlawful," it adds that the company "cannot reach its target demographic, teenagers and young men, without the substantial and critical assistance of the Defendants."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Modern Warfare III &amp; Warzone - Official Season 4 Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The patch notes include weapon balancing for Modern Warfare 3's multiplayer, including a huge nerf for the popular BP50 assault rifle. The gun now has a 4% decrease to movement speed and sprint speed, as well as a 13% reduction to the maximum damage range, 11% less near-medium damage, and 8% decrease to the medium damage.</p><p dir="ltr">Several submachine guns are buffed to have increased damage ranges, with the list including Season 3's FJX Horus, the RAM-9, AMR9, Rival-9, HRM-9, Striker-9, Striker, and WSP-9.</p><p dir="ltr">A few perks are corrected in the big update. It fixed an issue with the Gunslinger Vest, which previously caused Throwing Star kills not to refresh stamina, and it corrected the issue that caused Throwing Star kills not to trigger health regeneration with the Compression Carrier Vest equipped.</p><p dir="ltr">Season 4 also makes several adjustments to killstreaks, which should hopefully make them feel more effective. The Precision Airstrike now has a 17% increase to the explosive damage radius, the Cruise Missile received a 50% increase, and the SAE has a 7% increase to the explosive damage radius as well. For the Carpet Bomb, the streak is decreased in price from 10 kills or 1,250 score down to eight kills or 1,000 score, the explosive damage radius is increased by 25%, and the flight speed of the bomber is now 40% faster.</p><p dir="ltr">On the Zombies side, the update includes several fixes for bugs and stability issues. This includes a correction for a bug that previously prevented players from activating the third punching bag in the Tattered MMA Gloves attunement challenge, and fixes a problem that previously caused a loss of weapons when dying while the Juggernaut suit was active.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4309946-mwiii-s4-announcement-tout3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4309946" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4309946-mwiii-s4-announcement-tout3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4309946"></a><figcaption>Season 4 roadmap</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4309946-mwiii-s4-announcement-tout3.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The big highlight for Warzone's Season 4 update is the raised player count in standard battle royale mode, with the increase from 100 to 120 players per match. The developer addresses these changes by saying, "Player feedback continues to indicate a desire for more action. So with that in mind, we have made the necessary changes to accommodate a higher player count without disrupting the delicate balance" of the matches.</p><p dir="ltr">Changes also arrived to the Urzikstan map. Exit hatches were added to the open bunkers to provide an additional escape route, and the Gulag now has a silo setting with four different map layouts to provide more variation to the 1v1 arena. A circle change is also made to delay the time before the initial circle begins to shrink on the map, which is increased from one to two minutes, and the developer says this change was made to give players more time to find bunkers and also adjusts the match pacing to fit 120 players.</p><p dir="ltr">A stealing feature is added to the Champion's Quest nuke challenges across all maps and modes.

Wanting to be with Hammer for as long as possible, Manoel trained him as a working dog, and enrolled in the military with Hammer by his side. First, he was part of the Guard Battalion utilizing Hammer as a guard dog, and later, moved his way into the Brazil Special Operations where Hammer’s hunting and tracking skills became invaluable in chasing down targets.</i></p><p><i>One day, on a tracking mission, Hammer was killed in action by the SpecGru organization.

100.</li></ul></li></ul><p>In an effort to enhance the Battle Royale experience on Urzikstan, we've decided to increase the number of players in each match from 100 to 120.</p><p>Our initial design intent at the launch of Modern Warfare 3 was to focus on mid-game pacing, ensuring a steady and consistent build-up throughout the match. To strike a balance between matchmaking times, client performance, and match pacing, we initially centered our game balance around 100 players. This required extensive revisions and balancing across various aspects of the game, including early game looting, engagement times, weapon damage, armor values, movement mechanics, redeploy mechanics, economy, and strategic and defensive tools. We’re proud to say that overall we’ve been quite pleased with the results over the past few seasons.</p><p>That said, player feedback continues to indicate a desire for more action. So with that in mind, we have made the necessary changes to accommodate a higher player count without disrupting the delicate balance we have worked hard to achieve. This time around, these adjustments have been primarily focused around redeploy mechanics and our match economy.</p><p>Gulag tokens now have a low chance to appear in general loot, with specific spawn rates from different chest types and guaranteed availability from Most Wanted and buy stations. Redeploy tokens are now part of a new tier of legendary items and have specific spawn conditions to maintain balance. Additionally, redeploy flares have a controlled spawn rate in legendary chests and other support item locations.</p><p>Our goal with the economy is to make cash more meaningful and create clearer paths for acquiring key items. We've slightly reduced the amount of cash found in loot, increased the number of supply boxes, updated the cost of buy station items, and adjusted the rarity of certain items to promote a more engaging and strategic looting experience.</p><p>With all these changes live in Season 4, we aim to deliver a more strategic experience that emphasizes risk-reward while maintaining consistent, action-packed pacing throughout the match. As always, our team will be carefully monitoring internal data as well as external player feedback - and adjustments will be made where necessary as we move forward.</p><h2>MAPS</h2><h3><b><u>MAP UPDATES</u></b></h3><h4>» URZIKSTAN «</h4><ul><li><b>Bunkers</b><ul><li>Unlocked bunkers now have an escape hatch as an alternative exit.</li><li>New rewards have been added to various locations.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><b>Gulag</b><ul><li>4 new Gulag layouts have been added:  <ul><li>S: Stacked equipment and L-shaped plywood walls with an S-shaped central wall over the circular floor grate.</li><li>2: A three-panel curved wall, stacked equipment against two walled sections, and two curved inner walls above the circular floor grate.</li><li>3: Stacked equipment against two walled sections, with concrete L-shaped walls around the central circular floor grate.</li><li>8: A rectangular concrete barrier wall outside long central section around the central circular floor grate with one plywood wall sprayed with a blue “8”.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h2>MODES</h2><h3><b><u>RETURNING</u></b></h3><h4>» URZIKSTAN | BATTLE ROYALE «</h4><ul><li><b>Buy Back Royale</b><ul><li>Cash is everything in this returning game mode.

                <p>For the first time since 2014, EA is releasing a college football game--and people are pretty excited about. EA Sports College Football releases in July behind a mountain of hype and some notable changes.</p><p>First up, EA is no longer working with the NCAA, which is why the series has changed names. In another big step, the game features real player names and likenesses thanks to the Name, Image, Likeness, (NIL) program in college sports. Players are being paid for their appearance in the game.</p>

      </div>
<p>While the NCAA is not involved in EA Sports College Football, EA has separately struck deals with the relevant rights-owners to secure 134 FBS schools, including their stadiums, fight songs, mascots, and thousands of players.</p><p>In this post we're rounding up everything we know about EA Sports College Football 25, including the game's release date, platforms, new gameplay features, and more.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Who_s_on_the_cover_of_EA_Sports_College_Football_25_">Who's on the cover of EA Sports College Football 25?</a></li><li><a href="#EA_Sports_College_Football_25_release_date">EA Sports College Football 25 release date</a></li><li><a href="#EA_Sports_College_Football_25_platforms">EA Sports College Football 25 platforms</a></li><li><a href="#EA_Sports_College_Football_25_price">EA Sports College Football 25 price</a></li><li><a href="#What_s_new_in_EA_Sports_College_Football_25_">What's new in EA Sports College Football 25?</a></li><li><a href="#Why_is_NCAA_not_involved_">Why is NCAA not involved?</a></li><li><a href="#EA_Sports_College_Football_25_pre_orders">EA Sports College Football 25 pre-orders</a></li></ul></div><p>The cover of EA Sports College Football 25 has three athletes on it: Michigan running back Donovan Edwards, Texas QB Quinn Ewers, and Colorado wide receiver/defensive back Travis Hunter. These athletes are on the standard and deluxe covers. The MVP bundle, which includes copies of EA Sports College Football and Madden NFL 25, doesn't have any specific cover stars.</p><p>EA Sports College Football 25 releases on July 19. People who buy the Deluxe Edition can start playing on July 16. Additionally, there is a free 10-hour trial that begins on July 16 via EA Play.</p><p>EA Sports College Football 25 will be released across PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. There is no version of the game for PS4/Xbox One or PC.</p><p>The new college football game is priced at $70 for the standard edition, $100 for the Deluxe edition, and $150 for the MVP bundle. Head to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-sports-college-football-25-preorder-guide-ps5-xbox-series-x/1100-6523506/" data-ref-id="1100-6523506">GameSpot's EA Sports College Football 25 pre-order</a> guide to learn more.</p><p>The first thing fans may notice is that EA Sports College Football 25 simply looks a lot better than the last entry in the series. After all, it's been 10 years--which is an eternity in the video game space.</p><p>EA says player ratings are constantly changing throughout the game, so players will need to leverage their strategy skills and execution on the sticks to win. The game also has a "wear and tear" system, so when "the hits add up, players wear down." You will have to to manage your players' health, fatigue, and injuries to lead your team to victory.</p><p>A "pre-snap recognition" feature is now in the game, too, which means every snap matters more, EA said. What's more, EA Sports College Football 25 has a homefield advantage system that makes it harder for away teams to win at the toughest arenas.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4309319-screenshot2024-05-28at2.19.11pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4309319" data-ratio="0.55872483221477" data-width="1192" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4309319-screenshot2024-05-28at2.19.11pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4309319"></a><figcaption>EA Sports College Football 25 is almost here</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4309319-screenshot2024-05-28at2.19.11pm.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4309321-screenshot2024-05-28at2.19.02pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4309322-screenshot2024-05-28at2.19.11pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4309323-screenshot2024-05-28at2.19.20pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4309324-screenshot2024-05-28at2.19.26pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4309325-screenshot2024-05-28at2.19.32pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4309326-screenshot2024-05-28at2.19.39pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4309321,1300-4309322,1300-4309323,1300-4309324,1300-4309325,1300-4309326" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4309321-screenshot2024-05-28at2.19.02pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4309322-screenshot2024-05-28at2.19.11pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4309323-screenshot2024-05-28at2.19.20pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4309324-screenshot2024-05-28at2.19.26pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4309325-screenshot2024-05-28at2.19.32pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4309326-screenshot2024-05-28at2.19.39pm.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4309321-screenshot2024-05-28at2.19.02pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4309322-screenshot2024-05-28at2.19.11pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4309323-screenshot2024-05-28at2.19.20pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4309324-screenshot2024-05-28at2.19.26pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4309325-screenshot2024-05-28at2.19.32pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4309326-screenshot2024-05-28at2.19.39pm.png"></figure><p>In terms of game modes, EA Sports College Football 25 has a Dynasty mode that has players creating a coach and controlling a team through a season. This includes fine details like creating a coaching staff and even using the transfer portal. Then there is Road to Glory, which is a mode where players create a player and take them through all facets of the game, from getting a solid GPA in the classroom to excelling on the field and potentially winning a Heisman.</p><p>Of course, EA Sports College Football 25 has an Ultimate Team component. Similar to how it works in EA's other roster of sports games, players can build a "dream team" and put their teams to the test in single-player challenges or against the community online. This being Ultimate Team, it can be safely assumed this mode will feature a wide array of microtransactions and loot boxes.</p><p>There is also a Road to the CFP mode that gives players a "new way to play competitively" as they try to take their favorite team to the College Football Playoffs and ultimately the National Championship.</p><h2 id="Why_is_NCAA_not_involved_">Why is NCAA not involved?</h2><p>EA Sports worked with the NCAA on numerous college football games over the years, but the partnership ended with 2013's NCAA Football 14 due to a variety of issues, including player lawsuits. A decade later, EA opted to break off its relationship with the NCAA and instead sign licensing deals with the Collegiate Licensing Company (CLC) and others to get the rights to the 134 FBS schools in the game, along with team-specific elements like stadiums, fight songs, mascots, and more. Fans of college football know that the "gameday experience" includes much more than just school names, after all.</p><p>EA Sports College Football 25 is available now to pre-order, and there are a number of different editions to choose from.

        <p>Meanwhile, PlayStation Plus inclusion brings Immortals of Aveum into the Top 10</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>The success of Amazon's Fallout TV series continues to shape the games industry's charts, as Circana reveals that Fallout 4, 76, and New Vegas were among the most-played games in the US last month.</p>
<p>Circana has released its engagement charts for April 2024, which show Fallout 4 in the Top 10 for all three platforms that it tracks: No.8 for PlayStation 5, No.6 for Xbox Series X|S, and No.4 on Steam.</p>
<p>Additionally, Fallout 76 reached No.5 on Steam and No.10 on Xbox, with the Obsidian-developed Fallout: New Vegas appearing at No.8 in the Steam rankings based on monthly active users.</p>
<p>The appearance of these games comes as no surprise; the acclaim for the television show based on the Fallout series and streamed through Amazon Prime has seen Bethesda's post-apocalyptic RPGs rise up the sales charts in the UK, Europe and the US.</p>
<p>In fact, Circana revealed today that <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/us-game-spending-experienced-a-3-decrease-in-april-us-monthly-charts">Fallout 4 was the fifth best-selling game in the US for April 2024</a>, with Fallout 76 as the eighth.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the engagement charts, fantasy shooter Immortals of Aveum leapt more than 280 places in the PS5 rankings thanks to its inclusion as one of the monthly games for PlayStation Plus.</p>
<p>The only new entry in any of the most-played charts was Landfall Games' Content Warning, at No.3 on Steam, due to a slow month for major launches.</p>
<p>The most played games were more predictable, with Call of Duty on PlayStation, Fortnite on Xbox, and Helldivers 2 marking its third consecutive month at the top on Steam.</p>
<p>Below are the ten most played games on PlayStation 5 based on monthly active users:</p>
<p><em>* Call of Duty HQ includes Warzone 2.0, Modern Warfare 2 and Modern Warfare 3</em></p>

The game would follow a hero traveling to a fantasy kingdom of living sweets, making friends, and fighting a mysterious antagonist. This fairy tale concept shaped our entire game design approach in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Sugar Mess — Let’s Play Jolly Battle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Once we had it, our first stop was obvious: it had to look good, like a kids book, which meant developing a rich, kid-appropriate visual style. And just like a good fairy tale, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Sugar Mess</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> had to be captivating from start to finish, never once losing the attention of its players. Our solution: prioritize player engagement, make the game modular and constantly rotate level types and gameplay scenarios.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So, we knew what we were building. The only problem was finding a way to build it — and on a resource-constrained platform, no less.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We needed some kind of magic.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="When game design goals meet platform constraints">When game design goals meet platform constraints</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Any developer of a family-oriented game is in a tough spot. If mechanics and environments are monotonous, our target audience gets bored </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>fast</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Which meant that our gameplay loop should constantly stimulate the players’ attention. To add variability and keep the players’ attention span in check, we used various types of spatial arrangement for every level and mechanics. Standing shooting levels, railway shooting, logic puzzles, rhythmic levels, boss fights — you name it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">However, the decision to release on an Android-based platform meant we had a limited amount of resources to play with. We had to optimize the game’s performance while keeping the visuals as detailed as possible — super difficult given the platform’s hardware limitations.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Simply put, we had to pick our battles.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The developers of traditional PC games can often rely on taking advantage of the performance of high-end gaming PCs. But your options are way more limited when you develop a project for an all-in-one VR device.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One significant constraint is the processing power of the Meta Quest devices, which may restrict the complexity of graphics, physics simulations, and AI computations. Additionally, memory constraints limit the size of game assets and textures, requiring careful optimization to ensure smooth performance. Moreover, the limited input options, such as the Oculus Touch controllers, necessitate innovative design solutions to create intuitive and immersive gameplay experiences.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But we still had ambitious goals in mind. We wanted the game to feature a beautiful visual style, immersive world, entertaining and captivating gameplay, and elaborate narrative. We wanted to make it a fairy tale!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To achieve the balance between performance and level of detail, we had to outline the optimization methods very early in the development process — way back at the sketching stage. If you start working on it later, you will likely have to redo the work from the beginning.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="An Aside: Level progression and the importance of mini-games">An Aside: Level progression and the importance of mini-games</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the story mode, players gain access to new levels in a particular sequence:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Static Level → On-rails Level → Puzzle Level → Boss Level →&nbsp; Rhythm Level</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The player learns to shoot during the initial levels and gets used to various tools at their disposal. The puzzle levels give the player a breather before the boss fights. Once the boss level is over, the player can rest from shooting during a rhythm-based level, which is also an opportunity to earn some coins to unlock and improve guns for the next boss level.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This sequence remains in place for the whole game. The only exception is the last, 10th level, which is a singular boss fight that closes the campaign.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Our approach to level design">Our approach to level design</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We always start our level design process with a concept phase, beginning with a Blueprint representing the placement of every object in a particular scene. With </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Sugar Mess — Let’s Play Jolly Battle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, our next step was blocking the scenery. Blocking is another crucial element of visual design that determines the layout of the in-game map.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Here’s the step-by-step overview of our approach:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Create several blocks on the perimeter, including buildings, big objects, and other elements of scenery serving as limits of the map</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Transfer this part of the structure into the editor and test every 3D object to check whether they work well within general gameplay. If there’s something wrong with a scene’s composition or gameplay, it’s much easier to fix at this stage.</span></p></div></li><li></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Full-scale testing of the detailed scene</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After the 3D models are in place, we start working with textures and light sources. If extra optimization is needed, developers can employ baking and pattern atlases. That’s what we did in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Sugar Mess</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, saving even more resources.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="An Aside: Ambiance">An Aside: Ambiance</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Level ambiance is crucial when creating a family-oriented VR game. The right kind of ambiance makes the game feel unique and exciting to the player… just like a good fairy tale.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Several levels in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Sugar Mess</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> are set in their dedicated environments. These environments are still based on the primary Sugar Realm setting but switch things up just enough to keep the player entertained.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In addition, our team used various particles, VFX effects, and sounds to immerse a player in the scene and enhance the player's immersion.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The need for optimization">The need for optimization</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To keep performance high when the visuals are loading, all objects in the foreground, middle ground, and background should be optimized. But those bright and colorful objects are </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>exactly</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> what draws the players’ attention in a family-oriented game!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A high level of detail (LOD) impacts memory and CPU, demanding intense rendering and increasing the file size. Basically, we had to carefully choose which groups of objects will have different LODs depending on their size, importance, and distance.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Here are a few examples:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The LOD value for mobs that move toward the player is 2,500 polygons</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Large objects located at a medium distance, such as barrels, have a value of LOD-1000</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The towers situated further away need to be</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">less</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">detailed, so their value is LOD-500</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Generally, you have three options when it comes to designing 3D models:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Go for near-perfect high-poly geometry</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Opt for a lightweight, low-poly mesh</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Use mid-poly models that are detailed enough but use fewer resources than high-poly</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That last option is the middle road we took with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Sugar Mess</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> – all objects in the foreground are built with optimized mid-poly 3D details.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We have also swapped all 3D objects in the background and the 3D backgrounds themselves for 2D illustrations. That’s how we’ve got those picturesque skyboxes with images of the sky, faraway objects, and the horizon, while also keeping them very lightweight.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We also used other optimization tricks and psychological cues. For example, to draw the player’s attention to an interactive object, we used leading lines, highlights, or emphasized them with a surrounding composition. This way, we guided the player through the level and showed them new opportunities… While keeping their eye away from some of the cutbacks.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The stylized visuals demand optimization and resource efficiency. Since we’re not moving objects during gameplay, we didn’t have to create lighting from different angles, allowing us to choose baking over real-time lighting — another win to balance the level of detail and performance. Good topology is crucial at this stage, ensuring meshes with baked textures and lighting are free of artifacts and uniformly cover object shapes.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The chosen ‘fairy tale cartoon’ setting allowed us to further optimize on the visuals. When depicting an object (such as a tree) using fairy tale visual stylization, you can replace </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>thousands</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> of 2D images of leaves with just a few polygons. The object will look no less beautiful, and loading the image will occur without difficulty. Just imagine the performance gains!</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="An Aside: Balancing and testing a family-friendly game">An Aside: Balancing and testing a family-friendly game</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A game for all ages requires considering each family member's interests and abilities. This calls for game mechanics that are equally accessible to both experienced players and total rookies… And we spent a lot of time making sure we got it right.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We consulted multiple focus groups of players of varying ages and gaming experience. During these sessions, players were encouraged to provide feedback on their overall gameplay experience, including any challenges they encountered or aspects they found enjoyable. By observing and analyzing player interactions, we identified common pain points and usability issues.&nbsp; Additionally, testers were asked to rate their level of immersion, comfort, and engagement to gauge the effectiveness of the game's design in delivering a satisfying VR experience for players of all ages.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The insights from playtests were vital in shaping the game's UX. For example, if players struggled to transfer weapons from hand to hand, our team would explore alternative mechanics for grabbing weapons to improve accessibility and make it intuitive. Sometimes, it involved implementing a simplified control scheme or introducing visual cues to more effectively guide player interactions.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Feedback regarding motion discomfort prompted adjustments to locomotion mechanics, such as implementing a vignette view to enhance player comfort during gameplay. By iteratively refining the game based on playtest feedback, our team aimed to create a seamless and enjoyable VR experience that catered to the needs and preferences of its diverse player base.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="In conclusion">In conclusion</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Making a family-friendly VR game for an Android-based platform taught us a few valuable lessons, especially about the importance of optimization in level design. Meticulous visual optimization and resource management allowed us to achieve smooth performance and rich visuals, making the overall experience just a bit more… fairy tale.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Moving forward, we’d like to emphasize several key takeaways for fellow developers:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ol data-testid="basic-list-ordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Prioritize visual optimization to maintain a consistent frame rate and minimize performance issues.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive/2024/05/29/hive-jump-2-survivors-premieres-new-trailer-to-coincide-with-early-access<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Hive Jump 2: Survivors arrives in Steam Early Access today. To celebrate, publisher Midwest Games and developer Graphite Lab have shared an exclusive trailer for the Survivors-like sequel. The first Hive Jump caught our eye way back in 2015 when we named it <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2015/08/30/the-best-indies-to-watch-from-pax-2015.aspx">one of the most promising indie titles</a> on display at PAX West that year before its launch in 2017. The original Hive Jump served as a four-player co-op homage to Super Metroid, but Hive Jump 2: Survivors takes inspiration from a different title: <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1b4e6b9b-14ea-4052-b0b0-cd51648d523d" href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/vampire-survivors/single-stick-masterpiece">Vampire Survivors</a>.</p>

<p>The genre, called "bullet heaven," puts players in the shoes of a single character who eventually builds up to become extremely powerful as the waves of enemies grow more intense. Hive Jump 2: Survivors carries forward the look of its Metroidvania predecessor but from the genre-standard top-down perspective. You take control of a lone survivor of an alien attack who must now face seemingly insurmountable odds to survive. You can customize your loadout and upgrade your jetpack to destroy enemies and escape tough situations.</p>

<p>The jetpack also allows you to traverse the levels in ways not available in Vampire Survivors. The Jumpers have specific builds that allow you to cater to your play style, which combines with the upgrades you select before each run. You can play with auto-assist aiming or switch to manual controls. If you can survive 14 rounds, you can challenge big boss battles. As you collect goo from fallen enemies, you can earn better weapons, upgrades, and relics to improve your odds. Meanwhile, amber you find in the field can be traded for permanent upgrades to stats, magnets for auto-scavenging, or even screen-wiping nukes.</p>

<p>You can see an exclusive look at the Early Access launch trailer below.</p>

<p>In grade school, I would religiously play through The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion in any spare time I could find between studying and schoolwork. It was my escape from reality. That is, until Bethesda unveiled Fallout 3 in July of 2004. Now, here we all are, much older and impatiently waiting for the next mainline Fallout game to launch. In the meantime, do we know the Fallout 3 Remaster release date?</p>



<h2 id="h-is-fallout-3-getting-a-remaster">Is Fallout 3 Getting a Remaster?</h2>



<p>The word around town—by town, I mean the games industry—is that a Fallout 3 Remaster is currently in the works. As revealed by the ZeniMax Management Forecast, which leaked during the FTC case, several projects are underway. Of course, this could change. Microsoft and Bethesda may choose to abandon projects. Still, following the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-tv-series-65-million-viewers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">immense success of the Fallout TV series</a>, along with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-76-was-always-good/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rising popularity of Fallout 76</a>, it would be an absolutely missed opportunity not to capitalize on the hype. </p>



<p>The problem, however, is that Fallout 5 is still many years away. In the interim, we need more Fallout, and the most efficient way to deliver is by remaking or remastering past titles.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-the-fallout-3-remaster-release-date">When is the Fallout 3 Remaster Release Date?</h2>



<p>As of right now, we do not have a Fallout 4 Remaster release date. There’s no official confirmation of the game’s arrival besides a few leaks and rumors, but it’s certainly likely.</p>



<p>In the past, Todd Howard stated that he didn’t like remakes and remasters and, as such, didn’t want Bethesda working on such projects. However, that’s likely to change under new management at Microsoft and Xbox. Microsoft wants to capitalize on the immense popularity of the Fallout brand, which is currently sweeping the globe, and the timeframe for the next single-player title doesn’t work into their earnings calls very well!</p>

                <p>Recently, an interview with Naughty Dog's co-president (and The Last Of Us co-creator) Neil Druckmann <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/naughty-dogs-neil-druckmann-teases-next-game-and-shares-his-belief-in-ai/1100-6523665/" data-ref-id="1100-6523665">made waves</a> on social media, with some of Druckmann's apparent comments about AI (and other topics) drawing polarized reactions. Now, Sony has <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/creative-entertainment-vision/interview/2.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">removed the interview</a> entirely, stating that the company found "several significant errors and inaccuracies that don't represent his perspective and values."</p><p dir="ltr">The interview contained several statements that were circulated widely on social media, including one about AI "expanding creative possibilities" and another where Druckmann reportedly said that Naughty Dog's next project could "redefine mainstream perceptions of gaming." However, Druckmann later went to <a href="https://x.com/Neil_Druckmann/status/1794187392183898408" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">social media</a> to clarify that the interview did not accurately report the actual words he said, even providing his own direct transcript to show that it did not match up.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Sony pulled the interview less than a week later, offering a statement which reads in part: "In re-reviewing our recent interview with Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann, we have found several significant errors and inaccuracies that don't represent his perspective and values (including topics such as animation, writing, technology, AI, and future projects)." Sony further apologized to Druckmann for "misrepresenting his words."</p><p dir="ltr">It's unclear how exactly this sort of thing can happen in an internal company interview, or why it took Sony so long to remove the interview entirely. In recent Naughty Dog news, Jeffrey Wright (who played Isaac in The Last Of Us: Part II) was recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-casts-jeffrey-wright-in-same-role-as-the-game/1100-6523708/" data-ref-id="1100-6523708">cast to play the same role</a> in the upcoming second season of the TV show, which is based on the sequel.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/who-is-subscribing-to-game-pass-ps-plus-and-nintendo-switch-online-and-why<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

        <p>Convenience is the No.1 reason people are signing-up to video game subscription services</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Earlier this year, Ubisoft told us that one in ten people who subscribe to its Ubisoft+ service are entirely new to Ubisoft's games.</p>
<p>The data suggests some gamers are partially treating the service to trial or even rent a game they might be interested in, before unsubscribing. In October, Ubisoft saw a record number of subscribers who signed up, presumably, for Assassin's Creed Mirage.</p>
<p>The firm didn't share exact figures, and they're unlikely to be significant, but there's some evidence that subscription has unlocked some new customers for Ubisoft, if not necessarily the games industry at large.</p>
<p>It prompted us to get in touch with Newzoo to see if we can understand a bit more about who is subscribing to these services, and why.</p>
<p>According to the data firm's Global Gamer Study, the majority of subscribers are in Western markets (North America, Europe, and Australasia). They're mostly men (62%) and aged between 21 and 35 (42%).</p>
<p>And unsurprisingly, they're gamers. 52% of subscribers consider video games their favourite hobby, with 34% spending more than six hours per week on console games, and 32% spending the same the same amount of time on PC games.</p>
<p>Overall, subscription users were already average spenders of PC and console games (spending roughly $5 to $25 a month on games).</p>
<p>Interestingly, subscription users tend to have a higher income level (43%) compared with non-subscribers (34%). The definition of 'higher income' varies by country, but in the US that's anyone over $100,000 a year.</p>
<p>It suggests that, although value and saving money is clearly a big motivation for subscribers, it isn't the biggest reason why most gamers subscribe to the likes of Xbox Game Pass, PlayStation Plus, Nintendo Switch Online and others.</p>
<p>In fact, Newzoo suggests that "the potential cost savings may not be sufficient to justify the subscription for those with lower income values."</p>
<p>Its data says that "discounts or cost savings compared to buying games separately" is no more motivating to low-income gamers (31% cite this as a reason for subscribing) than it is for those on a high-income (also 31%). Low-income gamers are those earning less than $50,000 a year (and again, varies by country).</p>
<p>However, cost-savings/discounts is the joint No.1 motivation for low-income gamers, alongside "enjoying multiplayer features and online gaming." Indeed, that latter reason is the No.2 reason for subscribing for both middle- and higher-income players. (Middle-income gamers are those earning between $50,000 and $100,000).</p>
<p>The No.1 reason for mid- or high-income players when it comes to subscribing to a service is the "convenience of trying out new games instead of buying them individually." 35% of mid-income players and 38% of high-income players cite convenience as a motivator, vs 30% for low-income players.</p>

<p data-characters="299" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">A new trailer for the second season of <em>NieR: Automata Ver1.1a</em> just dropped, bringing exciting new information about the second course of <em>NieR: Automata</em>‘s beautiful but beleaguered anime adaptation to the series’ fans. Among these new tidbits was an estimated release window of July 2024.</p> <h2 id="h-carrying-the-weight-of-the-world" data-injectable="false">Carrying the weight of the world</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="アニメ『NieR:Automata Ver1.1a』Promotion File 011" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/441v-JXm0CE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="438" data-current-count="738" data-injectable="true">According to the trailer, which premiered simultaneously on X and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=441v-JXm0CE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aniplex’s official YouTube page</a>, the second season of <em>NieR: Automata Ver1.1a</em> will premiere sometime in July of this year. If the first season of <em>NieR: Automata Ver1.1a</em> is anything to go off of, the second season will feature a total of twelve episodes, meaning that its run will probably wrap up in either August or September, depending on when in July it premieres.</p>
 <p data-characters="381" data-current-count="381" data-injectable="false">While the second season is currently set to be released in the summer, <em>NieR: Automata Ver1.1a</em> developed a reputation for its production schedule. The first season was infamously marred with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/23/23567272/nier-automata-anime-delayed-episode-4-covid-19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">COVID-related production issues</a> that caused it to be delayed twice, so <em>NieR</em> fans have a right to be a little skeptical about the schedule for the second phase of 2B and 9S’s adventures.</p> <p data-characters="508" data-current-count="889" data-injectable="false">The first season of <em>NieR: Automata Ver1.1a</em> adapted a version of the game’s story through Endings A and B, which are only two of the five endings that players need to arrive at to gain a complete understanding of <em>NieR</em>‘s events. Given what we see in the trailer, the second cour will likely adapt Endings C through E, which completely flip the story of <em>NieR: Automata</em> on its head and turn what appears to be a story of humanoid androids warring against robots into something a bit more complicated.</p>

<p data-characters="272" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">You’re gunning it to the dropship with samples in tow. But before you hop in, the host blasts you and kicks you from the game, leaving you in your ship with nothing. Lobby kickers have been an issue for the <em>Helldivers 2</em> community, but a solution is being worked on. </p> <p data-characters="290" data-current-count="290" data-injectable="false">At least one is according to Arrowhead Games community manager, Thomas “Twinbeard” Petersson. Last week, in a reply on the game’s official Discord to a question about what to do with “arsehole lobby” kickers, Petersson said the team is figuring something out. </p> <p data-characters="250" data-current-count="540" data-injectable="true">“We’re actually working on a solution to mitigate problems with, well, ‘getting kicked by an arsehole lobby leader’ as someone once eloquently put it,” Petersson said. “No ETA on that, but it’s coming.”</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <h2 id="h-a-solution-to-butthead-lobby-kickers-is-coming-to-helldivers-2" data-injectable="false">A solution to butthead lobby kickers is coming to <em>Helldivers 2</em></h2> <p data-characters="453" data-current-count="753" data-injectable="true">The lobby kicker issue has been a thorn for community members for some time. I’ve read complaints about it on the official <em>Helldivers 2</em> subreddit since the game arrived. There are no penalties for kicking players without a reason in the game; in fact, it’s relatively easy to do. I’ve been kicked from games before, but thankfully it wasn’t due to a griefing lobby leader. At least a few have the courtesy to <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/a-bruised-helldivers-2-community-finds-solace-with-a-player-whos-become-everyones-new-frend/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">let you know first</a>. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="302" data-current-count="602" data-injectable="true">Johan Pilestedt, the CCO of Arrowhead Games, commented on the situation before. In a <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1766568830908662092" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">message on X back in March</a>, Pilestedt said the issue was “very hard to solve – we have some ideas but no conclusion.” Pilestedt continued, asking for ideas from the community “Hive Mind.”</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>This is so shitty. Also very hard to solve – we have some ideas but no conclusion.</p><p>You know what, let's try this: Hive Mind – do you have a design suggestion for how to improve this experience? <a href="https://t.co/HgUlV80fP4">https://t.co/HgUlV80fP4</a></p></div>— Pilestedt (@Pilestedt) <a href="https://twitter.com/Pilestedt/status/1766568830908662092?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 9, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="363" data-current-count="663" data-injectable="false">Perhaps one of those ideas shared to the team was good enough to work on. Some have suggested offering kicked players some share in the experience points and Reference Slips — one ideal solution. It’s been a couple of months since the aforementioned message, and it doesn’t sound like the fix is around the corner. But, hopefully, it’s close. </p>

			<p>Sony has officially announced a new PlayStation State of Play broadcast for tomorrow, including updates on PS5 and PS VR2 titles.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-showcase-is-planned-for-this-month-jeff-grubb-reiterates-could-happen-at-any-moment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">numerous rumors</a> about Sony organizing a new PlayStation event later this month, a new State of Play event has now been confirmed. According to the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/05/29/state-of-play-returns-this-thursday/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official announcement</a> on the PS Blog, the broadcast will be around 30 minutes in length and will feature 14 titles. As said, the event will include updates on PS5 as well as titles for PS VR2. In addition, Sony will provide a look at first-party titles arriving later this year.</p>
<p>Rumors about Sony organizing a new event surfaced last month when known journalist Jeff Grubb <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-showcase-may-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that a showcase would air in May. In addition, he said that the upcoming Silent Hill 2 Remake might very well be present during the event. Although Grubb initially thought that we might be looking at an entire PlayStation Showcase, it turns out that were only looking at a shorter 'State of Play'. Earlier this month, Grubb <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-showcase-is-planned-for-this-month-jeff-grubb-reiterates-could-happen-at-any-moment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reiterated</a> that Sony would be holding an event later this month. "The PlayStation Showcase is happening this month still apparently", Grubb said some weeks ago. "But whether it's next week or the week after I honestly don't know. Could be the end of the month, but I won't be surprised this does actually happen next week, it could happen at any moment."</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, publisher KONAMI <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-launch-date-might-be-announced-in-2-days/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced that a new Silent Hill Transmission</a> would be broadcast tomorrow as well. This event will take place on YouTube at 4 PM Pacific Time. As covered earlier, we'll likely be hearing more about Silent Hill 2 Remake tomorrow.</p>
<p>The PlayStation State of Play will air tomorrow at 3 pm PT / 6 pm ET | May 31, 12 am CEST / 7 am JST on YouTube, Twitch, and TikTok.</p>
<p>We'll update you as soon as we learn more about tomorrow's events.</p>

  <p id="roBwAW">Sony’s next big State of Play showcase is coming this Thursday, May 30, <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/05/29/state-of-play-returns-this-thursday/">the PlayStation maker announced</a>. May’s State of Play will feature reveals and new details on Sony’s game lineup for PlayStation 5 and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23601086/playstation-vr-2-review-ps5-release-date-price-horizon-vr-call-of-the-mountain">PlayStation VR 2</a>.</p>
<p id="lNAT2Q">The new State of Play will stream live at 6 p.m. EDT/3 p.m. PDT on the official PlayStation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PlayStation">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/playstation">Twitch</a>, and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@playstation">TikTok</a> channels. The showcase will run 30 minutes and feature 14 titles, including an unspecified number of games from PlayStation Studios arriving later this year, Sony said.</p>
<p id="Akb78a">PlayStation Studios’ announced lineup includes <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22665398/wolverine-marvel-insomniac-games-playstation"><em>Marvel’s Wolverine</em></a> from Insomniac Games, Guerrilla Games’ <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23513252/horizon-forbidden-west-multiplayer-online-mmo-ps5">multiplayer Horizon game</a>, Haven Studios’ <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23736464/fairgames-trailer-jade-raymond-haven-studio-sony-playstation-showcase"><em>Fairgame$</em>,</a> and Firewalk Studios’ <em>Concord</em>. Sony also has a long list of live-service games that it plans to ship in the next few years, including <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23734066/marathon-bungie-playstation-showcase-2023">Bungie’s new <em>Marathon</em></a>, and the new showcase could offer more insight into that plan. Of course, we can expect unannounced games too — maybe a <em>Spider-Man 2</em> spinoff from Insomniac? — and updates from third parties, considering <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24057311/silent-hill-2-remake-sony-state-of-play-january-2024">Konami’s <em>Silent Hill 2</em></a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23931980/metal-gear-solid-3-remake-snake-eater-unreal-engine-5-konami"><em>Metal Gear Solid 3</em></a> remakes are slated to launch this year.</p>
<p id="2f8kcz">Publisher Konami will follow Thursday’s State of Play livestream with an event of its own: the second <a href="https://x.com/Konami/status/1795228491539005800">Silent Hill Transmission</a> livestream, which promises new details on upcoming Silent Hill games and film <em>Return to Silent Hill</em>.</p>

  <p id="AVw627">We’re officially halfway through 2024, and so far the year has boasted a wealth of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/24074811/best-anime-2024">exciting new anime</a> throughout its winter and spring seasons. With the summer anime season (which runs from July through September) coming fast, there’s tons of premieres and returning anime to look forward, so let’s take a look at what we have on the horizon!</p>
<p id="7Up9fR">This summer has a little something for everyone: reboots of classic super robot anime like <em>Grendizer U</em>, historical adventure epics like <em>The Elusive Samurai,</em> action fantasies like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23983973/suicide-squad-isekai-anime-trailer"><em>Suicide Squad Isekai</em></a>, and more. We’ve also got new seasons of great anime like <em>Oshi no Ko</em> and <em>Time Patrol Bon</em>, as well as the highly anticipated <a href="https://www.polygon.com/anime/23164952/terminator-zero-netflix-anime-release-date-first-look"><em>Terminator: Zero</em></a> anime from Production I.G!</p>
<p id="wZRlZu">We’ll continue to update this list as we get a clearer picture of everything this upcoming anime season has to offer, but in the meantime, here are some of the most exciting anime airing this summer that you should look forward to.</p>

<p id="WxSXRf"><strong>Release date:</strong> July TBA<br><strong>Where to watch:</strong> TBA</p>
<p id="JVtmVw">Fans of Go Nagai (<em>Devilman</em>, <em>Cutie Honey</em>) and giant robots, rejoice: The classic Mazinger series is getting a new anime reboot this season! Based on Nagai’s original 1975 manga, the anime follows the story of the last known survivor of an alien species who flees to Earth after his homeworld is conquered by a villainous empire led by King Vega. When Vega’s forces arrive at Earth, the survivor — now named Daisuke Umon — must join forces with his friends Koji and Hikaru to pilot a giant alien robot named Grendizer to defend the planet.</p>
<p id="gnrlnp">Mitsuo Fukuda (<em>Mobile Suit Gundam Seed</em>) and art director Shun Kudo (<em>Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans</em>) will co-direct this new adaptation of Grendizer. Tatsuo Higuchi (<em>Fuuto PI</em>) will be the series’ lead screenwriter, while mechanical designs will be made up of a team of veteran artists including Ko Inaba (<em>Mobile Suit Gundam: The Witch from Mercury</em>) and Junichi Akatsu (<em>Mobile Suit Gundam Seed</em>).</p>

<p id="WyK2fw"><strong>Release date:</strong> Aug. 29<br><strong>Where to watch:</strong> Netflix</p>
<p id="GI8OZi">First <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23955474/terminator-netflix-streaming-anime-release-date">announced in 2023</a>, the new anime series set in the universe of the Terminator franchise is quickly shaping up to be one of the most anticipated premieres this summer. Produced by Production I.G (<em>Ghost in the Shell</em>) and directed by Masashi Kudo (<em>Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War</em>), <em>Terminator: Zero</em> will follow an unnamed soldier who travels from a war-ravaged 2022 to 1997 Tokyo on a mission to protect the creator of AI system with the power to combat Skynet. Aside from that, much of the story and characters are being kept under wraps, but from the look of the early promotional images, the series is shaping up to be an intriguing reinvention on the visuals and worldbuilding of the Terminator universe.</p>

The interview quoted Druckmann as saying the studio’s upcoming game “could redefine mainstream perceptions of gaming,” though Druckmann’s transcript says nothing of the sort. It’s still unclear how accurate the quotes on AI were, as Druckmann didn’t bring attention to them in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Neil_Druckmann/status/1794187392183898408&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Neil_Druckmann/status/1794187392183898408" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">his tweets on the matter</a></span>. Sony’s statement reads as follows:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>In re-reviewing our recent interview with Naughty Dog’s Neil Druckmann, we have found several significant errors and inaccuracies that don’t represent his perspective and values (including topics such as animation, writing, technology, AI, and future projects). We apologize to Neil for misrepresenting his words and for any negative impact this interview might have caused him and his team. In coordination with Naughty Dog and SIE, we have removed the interview.</p></blockquote><p>As for how this happened, we can only speculate, but when you conduct an interview internally, it will ultimately have a PR spin. It’s important to remember that Naughty Dog is wholly owned by Sony, so this was very much an internal affair. Sometimes corporate higher-ups might want to weave a narrative while using a public figure’s influence. Someone at Sony may have been eager to push AI as the future and drum up hype for Naughty Dog’s next game and made some heavy-handed edits. Or, you know, they could have given too much work to a new intern. There’s also the possibility that this could be damage control after the interview didn’t go over well with the public.</p><p>Druckmann is currently working on HBO’s <em>The Last of Us </em>show, which is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-ellie-dina-bella-ramsey-set-photos-1851473070&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-ellie-dina-bella-ramsey-set-photos-1851473070">shooting its second season</a></span>.

The games industry dwarfs movies in terms of revenue and audiences, despite the peculiar refusal of all other media to acknowledge its ubiquitous existence. Any corporation that has a requirement to make numbers go up wants to figure out a way to get a slice of that enormous, bulging pie. Hence why we see the weird, confusing efforts from Amazon and Netflix to try to be involved, and now YouTube too.</p><p>Except YouTube is exhibiting some big boomer energy with its delivery.

It’s <em>woeful</em> stuff, with scrappy logos for generic-sounding casual games with names like “<em>8 Ball Billiards Classic</em>” and “<em>Bubble Pop Star</em>.”</p><figure id="" data-id="48e7e32a31aa444b63c7039be521aa6d" data-recommend-id="image://48e7e32a31aa444b63c7039be521aa6d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1927" data-height="1084" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A useful hint for the first step in today's Hurdle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A useful hint for the first step in today's Hurdle." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->YouTube / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="48e7e32a31aa444b63c7039be521aa6d" data-recommend-id="image://48e7e32a31aa444b63c7039be521aa6d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1927" data-height="1084" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A useful hint for the first step in today's Hurdle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Hidden in the list of over 75 games are <em>some </em>names you’ve heard of. There’s <em>Angry Birds Showdown</em>, which to be scrupulously fair, <em>is</em> a Playables exclusive, the 35,821st iteration of the franchise originally announced in 2019 for mobile, and seemingly once a Facebook Messenger app? There’s also 2010's <em>Cut the Rope</em>, and, er, 2018's <em>Words of Wonder</em>? I’m struggling to find anything else notable.</p><p>But if what you’re after is a large selection of solitaire games to play in your browser, then welcome to Yahoo Games for the new millennium!

Some of these games will be distracting in the way casual games are supposed to be, but I’m at a loss as to what YouTube thinks it’s offering here that every other site isn’t.</p><p>The games run in your browser, like you’re used to, but this time you’re playing <em>Gin Rummy</em> or <em>Lunch Box Ready</em> with a YouTube URL? It’s bewildering that this could go live without some big-name mobile games beyond a long-forgotten <em>Angry Birds </em>variant, and it’s just wildly unclear what this actually exists for, beyond something else into which Google can stick irritating adverts.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
