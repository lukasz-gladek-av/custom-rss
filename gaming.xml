<div>
  <p id="32Eto1">Although fans of <em>The Boys </em>will often refer to Butcher (Karl Urban) as the main character, it was Hughie (Jack Quaid) and Annie (Erin Moriarty) who served as the early seasons’ real co-protagonists. They were the ones who changed the most, who had their worldviews shattered in the pilot episode and had to rebuild themselves from scratch. Butcher’s stayed the same cranky, morally dubious bastard, but Hughie and Annie are unrecognizable from where they began.</p>
<p id="Takniu">And though Hughie had more screen time between the two, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tv/2019/9/17/20870279/the-boys-comics-history-amazon-starlight">season 1 Annie</a> was the more compelling main character. Whereas Hughie had the comfort of at least being surrounded by people who shared his hatred of supes like A-Train, Annie was thrown right into the viper’s nest. She was forced to smile and make things work on a team filled with rapists and murderers, in a position where escape wasn’t a real option and coming forward publicly seemed pointless. Annie’s gradual self-actualization was more complicated than Hughie’s, but that only made it more interesting. Annie is always being pulled between multiple evolving teams with conflicting, dubious motives, but in season 1 the show was pulling off this delicate balancing act. Now, in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24173211/rewatch-the-boys-season-3-4-what-know-gen-v">season 4</a>, almost all sense of consistency or direction with Annie has fallen apart. </p>
<p id="X01vmX">Annie was well loved in season 1 among the <em>Boys</em> fandom, breaking the usual sexist internet trend that the most prominent female character in a franchise is the most loudly hated. As early as season 2, however, the fan sentiment started to sour, largely thanks to one giant misstep in “Nothing Like It in the World.” That’s the mid-season 2 episode where Annie kills an innocent civilian, a guy who was defending himself from what he assumed were violent carjackers. (An assumption that was basically correct.)</p>
<div id="du1kr0"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d8eJiUQRnJw?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="RBZeEl">The story uses this as part of a bonding subplot between Annie and Butcher, two characters who’d struggled to trust each other up to this point. “You know what I was thinking when I was looking at him?” she tells Butcher afterward. “<em>Why’d you pull a gun, you stupid fuck?</em> That’s all. Maybe once I would’ve cried over him, but... now he was just another person in our way.” This hardened, cynical way of thinking is presented as the turning point in her and Butcher’s relationship, the moment when they’ve fully got each other’s backs. </p>
<p id="23Idj4">The monologue is often unfairly interpreted by fans as Annie bragging, or mocking the guy for defending himself. But even among fans who understand this as Annie expressing regret and self-hatred, kicking herself for how callous she’s become, it still doesn’t work. Her murder of that civilian was way more uncalled for than the episode seemed to realize, something that should’ve lingered on Annie’s mind far longer than it does. The show really didn’t seem to understand the parallels to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/9/16/21440032/the-boys-stormfront-american-nazis-white-supremacy-fascism-themes-politics-supervillains-comics">the villain Stormfront</a>’s murder of an innocent driver earlier in the season; it drew that connection between the two characters, seemingly by accident, and then did nothing with it. </p>
<p id="ZQcnxg">This incident has always stuck in the minds of fans who’ve grown irritated with Annie’s role as the virtuous voice of reason, an approach that stirred up even more controversy <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23150171/the-boys-season-3-review-amazon">in season 3</a>. First there was the messy season-long conflict between Annie and Hughie over whether or not Hughie should be using the Temp V. It was an interesting argument between the two; Annie was reasonably concerned about Hughie’s attitude shift and the potential consequences of the drug, while also not quite empathizing enough with just how scary life is for Hughie as a non-supe in this violent world. The problem is that it’s a storyline that doesn’t give Annie an arc. Hughie’s the one who changes, who learns a lesson and grows from it in the end, whereas Annie is presented as correct from start to finish. The end of the season shuts down any moral complexity on the topic when it reveals that Temp V will 100% give Hughie terminal cancer if he takes it again. After that, anything interesting the storyline might’ve told us about Annie’s value system is tossed to the side.</p>
<p id="AUTGrj">Season 3 in general felt uninterested in diving into the hows and whys of Annie’s choices. Beyond Hughie, her decision to focus on taking down Soldier Boy, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23200207/the-boys-finale-homelander-black-adam-superman">not Homelander</a>, also lacked a clear, sympathetic explanation. Annie had three seasons’ worth of personal reasons to want Homelander dead, not to mention the ever-increasing likelihood that he’d snap completely and burn down the whole world. When she instead turned all her focus on opposing the one guy who could take Homelander down, the show’s explanation for it didn’t feel organic. Rather, it felt motivated by the show’s need to keep Homelander alive as long as possible, not by any natural continuation of her character growth from the first two seasons.</p>

<p id="bjr4Gb">There’s a similar sense of aimlessness with Annie throughout the first three episodes of season 4, with her already backtracking on her season 3 decision to give up the Starlight persona once and for all. Her feud with Homelander, which seemed to be her main priority for the first episode, at least, has also given way to refocusing on a new secondary villain. This time it’s Firecracker (Valorie Curry), a new member of The Seven who reveals that her main motivation is to get back at Annie for a mean, slut-shaming prank she did to her in their early teenage years. “Everybody thinks you’re so decent,” Firecracker tells Annie. “Know what I see? A conniving little mean-girl bitch in there. And when I’m done, the rest of the world is going to see it too.” </p>
<p id="aTfGMP">It’s a weird revelation, almost like the writers are engaging with the section of the fandom that resents Annie’s angelic-voice-of-reason status, essentially throwing the haters a bone in response to their increasingly loud complaints about the character. Although the show will almost certainly side with Annie in this feud — basing your whole adult life around a mean-girl incident when you were 13 is deeply unhealthy on Firecracker’s part, and the show is aware of this — the whole dynamic feels oddly trivial. Annie spent the first two and a half seasons having to hold her own against Homelander, and now she’s been thrown into a mean-girl feud with the least powerful new member of The Seven. If you were hoping season 4 would give Annie a sense of direction again, this is not a good sign.</p>
<p id="4RP0yP">It helps that Annie is so clearly better than her comic counterpart, an empty two-dimensional love interest that writer Garth Ennis barely seemed to care about. It’s hard to get too mad at the show’s depiction of Annie when we already know just how sloppily the character could’ve been portrayed. And season 4 is taking steps to deepen her relationship with her powers, establishing that Annie’s legitimately getting stronger, so hopefully during the next big fight scene she won’t be such an afterthought (the way it was with Soldier Boy in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBoys/comments/vwm066/starlight_vs_soldier_boy_expectation_vs_reality/">a widely mocked moment</a> in the season 3 finale). </p>
<p id="4CiVcC">But it’s also hard not to be frustrated when we know how well she could be written. Annie’s arc across the past two seasons so far has seemed scattershot, and unappreciative of just how fun Annie is when she’s actively shaping the plot with her decisions, rather than just the plot shaping her. Season 1 Annie was a vital character, someone whose scenes were filled with constant tension and intrigue. It’s hard to picture how <em>The Boys</em> will return to this, but here’s hoping they give Annie something meaningful to do again sometime soon. </p>
<p id="M2Mx8Z"><small>The first three episodes of </small><small><em>The Boys</em></small><small> season 4 are now streaming on Prime Video. New episodes are released every Thursday.</small></p>

                <p dir="ltr">There are a few interesting guns to be claimed from the Pale Heart of the Traveler in Destiny 2's new expansion, The Final Shape, but The Call is the standout. This little sidearm fires rockets--it's only the second rocket-assisted sidearm to come to Destiny 2, with the first being Indebted Kindness, a gun you could only get from the Warlord's Ruin dungeon. The Calling is easier to get and comes with a mess of good perks, but most importantly, it hits like a truck; once you get a good one of these, it's likely to stay in your loadout for a good, long time.</p><p dir="ltr">The Call sports a lot of options for perks, and quite a few of the combinations are pretty good. There are at least a couple versions of this gun you might want to chase depending on your loadout. What's more, it's also craftable, so you can slap enhanced versions of your favorite perks on the gun for even more devastation. Honestly, there might be a couple "god rolls" for The Call. Here's how you can nab The Call and the perks you're going to want to chase for it.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#How_To_Get_The_Call">How To Get The Call</a></li><li><a href="#The_Call_God_Rolls">The Call God Rolls</a><ul><li><a href="#The_Call_PvE_God_Roll">The Call PvE God Roll</a></li><li><a href="#The_Call_PvP_God_Roll">The Call PvP God Roll</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_To_Get_The_Call">How To Get The Call</h2><p dir="ltr">The Call will likely come into your inventory naturally through the course of The Final Shape's story campaign. It's one of the weapons that comes from Pale Heart engrams, which you'll get for completing Pale Heart activities and for ranking up your reputation with Ghost as you work through the new destination. There are also some activities, like Alone in the Dark missions in the Pale Heart, that will specifically dish out Deepsight Resonance (red border) versions of Pale Heart guns, so you can unlock the crafting pattern for the weapon.</p><p dir="ltr">So generally, focusing your Pale Heart engrams is the best way to reliably pull new versions of The Call. You can unlock focusing once you've gathered five different Pale Heart weapons, which you can do pretty easily by completing the campaign and doing some Alone in the Dark quest steps. As you rank up with Ghost, you'll also unlock a perk that makes your first focused weapon of the week a guaranteed Deepsight Resonance version, helping you get to the crafted version of The Call faster.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318813-20240613103241_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4318813" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318813-20240613103241_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4318813"></a><figcaption>The Call</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318813-20240613103241_1.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="The_Call_God_Rolls">The Call God Rolls</h2><p dir="ltr">While The Call isn't much of a PvP weapon because of its slow firing rate and slow projectile speed, it's an absolute monster in PvE activities. It has excellent stopping power, often one- or two-shotting enemies even in raids and at higher difficulties. It also sports a range of perks that offer a ton of build synergy and boost its damage to make it more effective. One of the specific, interesting perks it carries is Beacon Rounds, which gives the gun tracking as you log kills with it and increases that tracking's effectiveness with more final blows. Tracking is actually really handy on this thing, because it allows you to fire into crowds or in the direction of distant enemies without really having to think or aim. Firing The Call from the hip to indiscriminately annihilate whatever's vaguely in front of you can be extremely handy.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="The_Call_PvE_God_Roll">The Call PvE God Roll</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Barrel</strong>: Quick Launch / Volatile Launch  <ul><li dir="ltr">Quick Launch: +10 Velocity, +15 Handling</li><li dir="ltr">Volatile Launch: +15 Blast Radius, -5 Velocity, -5 Handling</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Magazine</strong>: Tactical Mag  <ul><li dir="ltr">+3 Magazine size, +5 Stability, +10 Reload speed</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>First Perk</strong>: Demolitionist / Subsistence  <ul><li dir="ltr">Demolitionist: Kills from this weapon generate grenade energy. Activating your grenade ability reloads this weapon from reserves.</li><li dir="ltr">Subsistence: Defeating targets partially reloads this weapon from reserves.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Second Perk</strong>: Desperate Measures / One For All  <ul><li dir="ltr">Desperate Measures: Weapon final blows grant bonus damage. Melee and grenade final blows grant a large damage bonus that can stack.</li><li dir="ltr">One For All: Hitting three separate targets increases damage for a moderate duration.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Masterwork</strong>: Velocity / Blast Radius</li></ul><p dir="ltr">It's tough to go wrong with just about any roll of The Call, but there are quite a few great options that, when paired together with the right build, push it over the edge. The first question you want to ask yourself is whether you want to prioritize direct hits over potential splash damage. The Call does fire rockets, but at base, their explosions aren't very big; you can spec the gun to have a larger Blast Radius to mess up more enemies in groups, and that can be great if you go for perks like One For All. But if you expect to use it more like a long-range shotgun, Velocity is probably more useful to make sure the projectiles get to their targets before those targets have a chance to move out of the way. After that, go for putting as many rounds in the magazine as you can with Tactical Mag.</p><p dir="ltr">Perks will depend on how you want to use The Call, but if you've got no other more specific plans, go with either Demolitionist or Subsistence. Demolitionist will give you synergy on restoring your grenade as quickly as possible, because you're very likely to use The Call to put down lots of enemies in quick succession because it's so damn useful. If you don't need the grenade energy or would rather increase your uptime with The Call without reloading it, Subsistence keeps giving you rockets back for each kill--and because so many kills will be one or two shots, you'll just keep firing.</p><p dir="ltr">One other good alternative in this column: Lead from Gold. An issue you might have with The Call is that it's <em>too</em> effective, running you out of Special ammo in a hurry. Lead from Gold can help keep your reserves up if you find you're scrounging a lot of the time. Oh, and finally, Beacon Rounds is probably not a go-to, but can make for a fun version of this gun, with the tracking making it so you barely have to think about what you're shooting at and helping you take out pesky enemies at long ranges.</p><p dir="ltr">The second Perk column is full of damage-boosting options and they're basically all good, so you can pick here based on what's best for your build. Desperate Measures and One For All are the main choices because they're both easy to activate, specifically with the way you'll be using The Call. One For All gives a slightly better damage boost if you can kill three enemies within three or so seconds of one another, which is the primary use case for this gun, but Desperate Measures stacks with your melee and grenade ability and lasts longer. If you're running something like a Prismatic Hunter build with Combination Blow and Liar's Handshake, Desperate Measures is excellent, getting a big damage boost every time you start punching your way through enemies.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="The_Call_PvP_God_Roll">The Call PvP God Roll</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Barrel</strong>: Quick Launch  <ul><li dir="ltr">Quick Launch: +10 Velocity, +15 Handling</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Magazine</strong>: High Velocity Rounds  <ul><li dir="ltr">+10 Reload speed, +10 Velocity</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>First Perk</strong>: Beacon Rounds  <ul><li dir="ltr">Final blows grant this weapon tracking. Dealing further damage extends the duration</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Second Perk</strong>: Vorpal Weapon  <ul><li dir="ltr">Increased damage against bosses, vehicles, and Guardians with their Super active.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Masterwork</strong>: Velocity</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Where The Call has lots of perks that give good synergy in PvE, where you're racking up kills against smaller at a constant clip, most of its perks offer very little in PvP, where kills can be harder to come by. Here, you want to focus on Velocity over Blast Radius because the utility of The Call will be in dealing big direct-hit damage to opposing players, and you want those projectiles to get to their targets as quickly as possible.</p><p dir="ltr">There aren't many great perk options here that you're getting to get a lot of use out of. Beacon Rounds is probably your best bet, adding tracking to your rockets after you notch a kill, which will help you earn a second kill if you're in a fight with more than one Guardian and can live that long. The second column has very little in the way of reliable PvP damage boosters, though. Vorpal Weapon is a decent pick specifically because you don't have to do anything in particular to activate it. If you're scoring a lot of kills, you can opt for one of the other boosters like Desperate Measures, but most don't become effective until <em>after</em> you've already won the fight you're in, making them all pretty equal in being unappealing.</p><p dir="ltr">We've got lots more coverage from Destiny 2's new expansion, so check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-guides-hub/1100-6523936/" data-ref-id="1100-6523936">Final Shape guides hub</a> and our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review/1900-6418239/" data-ref-id="1900-6418239">Final Shape review</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/parasol-stars-the-story-of-bubble-bobble-3-floats-down-to-consoles-on-july-11/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=parasol-stars-the-story-of-bubble-bobble-3-floats-down-to-consoles-on-july-11<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="283" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">It was almost a year ago that we <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/parasol-stars-the-story-of-bubble-bobble-3-is-being-ported-to-modern-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learned</a> of modern console port plans for <em>Parasol Stars: The Story of Bubble Bobble 3</em>. Now ININ has come through with a date, opening the umbrella for a smooth glide to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and Xbox consoles on July 11, 2024.</p> <p data-characters="319" data-current-count="319" data-injectable="false">With that lovely news comes an appropriately bubbly release date trailer, showing some footage of the port and promising “many quality-of-life enhancements.” Please, enjoy another pre-release peek at Bub and Bob in their stout little human forms and prep for the arrival of the <em>Rainbow Islands </em>sequel below.</p> <figure data-current-count="619" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Parasol Stars - The Story of Bubble Bobble III Release Date Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Sdflq9NwxCg?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="400" data-current-count="400" data-injectable="true">As for what those enhancements are, the updated port has added in the usual retro bells and whistles, namely the inclusion of save states and the ability to rewind gameplay. There are also shaders and filters that aim to recreate the experience of playing on a CRT screen. Beyond that, the hook here is very much the ability to play and own a relatively obscure entry in Taito’s storied series.</p>
 <p data-characters="477" data-current-count="477" data-injectable="false">There’s no mention of including the other versions — which spanned Atari ST, Amiga, Game Boy, and NES — so it looks like we’re just getting the PC Engine/Turbografx-16 version of <em>Parasol Stars</em>. That’s fine and dandy, especially considering the fact that it’s priced at a cool $9.99. Nintendo Switch pre-orders are <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/parasol-stars-the-story-of-bubble-bobble-iii-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">live now</a> and 10 percent off until July 12, with Xbox pre-orders to follow on June 19. The game can also be <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10008544" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wishlisted</a> on PlayStation.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>One of the rarest skins in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/overwatch-2/" data-ref-id="5000-504256">Overwatch 2</a> is making its return and all of its sales are going to charity. The Pink Mercy skin has returned to Overwatch 2 for the first time since 2018, along with a new Rose Gold variant and the money from its sales are being donated to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation (BCRF.)</p><p dir="ltr">Announced in a <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24104271/" rel="nofollow ">blog post</a>, the Pink Mercy skin will be available for purchase from June 25 to July 8, costing $15, the same price it was back in 2018. All of the money, excluding taxes and platform fees, will be donated to the BCRF. During that same period a second charity bundle will be available, the Rose Gold Mercy Bundle. This bundle costs $20 and features the Rose Gold Mercy skin and weapon skin, along with three player icons, sprays, and banners. All proceeds from that bundle will also be donated to charity. It's important to note that since the proceeds are going to charity, these bundles can't be bought with Overwatch Coins and must be bought as a direct purchase.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4318825-rosegoldmercylarge.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4318825" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4318825-rosegoldmercylarge.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4318825"></a><figcaption>The new Rose Gold Mercy skin will also be available, with all of the proceeds going to charity as well.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4318825-rosegoldmercylarge.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Pink Mercy skin quickly became one of the rarest and most sought-after skins in Overwatch, thanks to its limited availability. It was only on sale for a short period of time and at the time it was one of the few skins that was being sold for direct purchase instead of being included in loot boxes. It also hasn't been available since 2018, so anyone who started playing Overwatch since that time hasn't even had a chance to get it.</p><p dir="ltr">According to Blizzard, the last time the Pink Mercy skin was sold it raised $12.7 million for the BRCF and it still holds the record for the largest single donation. Overwatch 2 Season 11, Super Mega Ultrawatch, launches on June 20, just a few days before the Pink Mercy skin returns to the store.</p>

<p data-characters="313" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Amidst the flurry of Steam Next Fest demos, <em>Codename: Ocean Keepe</em>r from RetroStyle Games emerges as a standout, blending underwater mecha action with the survival challenges of <em>Vampire Survivors</em>. Quite the exciting twist, and one that brings with it an interesting new take on the action survival roguelike genre.</p> <p data-characters="472" data-current-count="472" data-injectable="true">At first glance, <em>Codename: Ocean Keeper </em>entices with its premise, merging the allure of ancient horrors with the futuristic focus of underwater mech combat. Players assume the role of a pilot tasked with navigating treacherous undersea environments teeming with monstrous creatures. Drawing from the survival roguelike elements of <em>Vampire Survivors</em>, the game challenges players to scavenge for resources, upgrade their mech, and battle increasingly formidable adversaries.</p>
 <h2 id="h-gameplay-undersea" data-injectable="false">Gameplay Undersea</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Ocean-Keeper-Add-3.jpg"></a><figcaption>Image via RetroStyle Games</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="446" data-current-count="746" data-injectable="true">The gameplay loop of <em>Codename: Ocean Keeper</em> revolves around strategic decision-making based on an ever-looming timer. Each dive into the abyss presents new dangers and opportunities, from important resource gathering to artifact scavenging, testing both reflexes and tactical prowess. Your mech can be customizable with an array of weapons and utilities and becomes the player’s lifeline against the tide of increasingly monstrous denizens.</p>
 <p data-characters="626" data-current-count="626" data-injectable="true">Resource and artifact harvesting are critical aspects of the gameplay loop in <em>Codename: Ocean Keeper</em>. To survive the waves of alien lifeforms that arrive at specific time intervals, players must constantly gather resources and artifacts to purchase upgrades within a session. These upgrades are essential, not only for sustaining themselves but also, for upgrading their mechs and enhancing their chances against the relentless onslaught from the depths. As the countdown to these encounters ticks away, strategic resource management becomes paramount, adding a layer of constant urgency that eats away at you as you progress.</p>
 <h2 id="h-demo-dives-unveiling-the-adventure" data-injectable="false">Demo Dives: Unveiling the Adventure</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Ocean-Keeper-Add-1.jpg"></a><figcaption>Image via RetroStyle Games</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="494" data-current-count="794" data-injectable="true">From the moment I jumped into <em>Codename: Ocean Keeper</em>’s demo, I was immersed in a world where action and strategy merge seamlessly. The game wastes no time throwing you into the thick of it as soon as you start the game for the first time. This immediate engagement hooks instantly, as you’re encouraged by the game’s short tutorial to explore the abyssal depths for vital resources. After this tutorial, the ticking timer begins, and the frantic race for upgrade resources begins.</p>
 <p data-characters="541" data-current-count="541" data-injectable="true">Navigating the murky depths in search of resources felt exhilarating yet perilous. Yes, you’re in an undersea spider mech, but that alone is far from enough to survive the horrors that lurk in the dark. Every moment-to-moment decision counts as resources carry weight, forcing you to carefully balance the amount you gather against the time needed to return them to your mech. This dynamic adds a layer of tension and strategic depth that kept me constantly on my toes, calculating risks and rewards with each venture into the unknown.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Ocean-Keeper-Add-4.jpg"></a><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="430" data-current-count="730" data-injectable="true">The timer looming in the background heightens the sense of urgency, reminding you that every second counts. It’s a thrilling balancing act that demands both quick thinking and precise execution, ensuring that each gameplay session is a gripping challenge. The monsters of the depths grow stronger with each passing moment, and you’re tasked with keeping up with the tide or risk becoming derelict at the bottom of the sea.</p>
 <p data-characters="668" data-current-count="668" data-injectable="true"><em>Codename: Ocean Keeper </em>shines with its gameplay mechanics, however, I did find myself occasionally distracted by the repetitive nature of its music and audio design. The soundtrack initially sets a mood of suspense and anticipation, which I enjoyed, but the repetitive loops became somewhat annoying after only a few minutes. Particularly, the singular track that played during combat encounters became especially tiresome. Nevertheless, exploring the depths and overcoming challenges in this captivating underwater world was still an enjoyable experience for me, and I have no doubts RetroStyle Games will make the necessary changes for the game’s full release.</p>
 <h2 id="h-looking-forward" data-injectable="false">Looking Forward</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Ocean-Keeper-Add-2.jpg"></a><figcaption>Image via RetroStyle Games</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="477" data-current-count="777" data-injectable="true"><em>Codename: Ocean Keeper</em> beckons players into its intriguing universe. A recent <a href="https://youtu.be/21JOxYMcH_8">trailer</a> teases a game filled with danger and peril, offering an adventure that’s both captivating and challenging for indie gaming enthusiasts. Setting itself apart from <em>Vampire Survivors</em>, <em>Codename: Ocean Keeper</em> introduces a distinctive twist that seamlessly blends undersea adventure with strategic resource gathering, a blend that highlights the promising bright future ahead for this title.</p>
 <p data-characters="442" data-current-count="442" data-injectable="false">If you’re interested in trying out <em>Codename: Ocean Keeper</em>, you can jump in right now with its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2845630/Codename_Ocean_Keeper/">free demo available on Steam.</a> It’s a great way to explore the game’s universe and experience its challenging strategic gameplay firsthand. Whether you’re drawn in by its unique premise or just looking for something new in indie gaming, the demo offers a taste of what promises to be an exciting change of pace for the genre.</p>

            <p>The latest <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> patch is memorably titled 01.000.400, but for my money, it's hovering on the  brink of being one of your gold-varnished "X.0" updates of note. It adds a fair few mechanics and makes various substantial adjustments to Arrowhead and Sony's liberty-humping, cheerily xenocidal squad shooter. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>These include making supply lines and attack origins visible on the Galactic War map, so you can (in theory) cut off invasions at their root, together with an absolute slew of stratagem and weapon balancing changes, an accompanying tsunami of tweaks for Automaton and Terminid enemies, and a positive landslide of, errrrm, reworks for planetary maps. Also, invite-only lobbies! Though they're currently only localised in English.</p>
<p>It's late here, I still have jetlag from SGF and Geoff Keighley or one of his agents seems to have given me some kind of plague, thankfully not Covid, so permit me to dive in and pull out a few things from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/4150709804553746157?l=english">the full patch notes</a>, rather than committing to a comprehensive digest. One thing that catches my eye is that they've adjusted enemy spawning so that you'll get fewer heavily armoured enemies, such as Bile Titans or Hulks, and more smaller, squishier enemies, with a view to making your tactics less monotonous. "Our intent is to ease up on the demand of anti-tank weapons and by having more of the other enemies give a better incentive for the group to bring stratagems and weapons that take care of hordes," the developers explain. </p>
<p>This desire for variety also informs their tweaks to the game's Stratagems. "With these balance changes we wanted to buff up some of the weaker stratagems to make them more viable and add more possibility for variety in the loadouts," the post goes on. "We also changed a few to make them more consistent, but the goal was to keep a similar or higher power level."</p>
<p>As regards the above Galactic War stuff, Arrowhead note that "supply lines were previously not shown on the Galactic War map to reduce clutter and improve readability". The developers are, nonetheless, keen to expose the game's table-toppy metagame workings to players and encourage us all to strategise properly rather than dogpiling whichever world starts trending on Twitter. "You will now also be able to see which planet an attack is originating from, potentially allowing for the community to stop the attack at its source," the Steam post suggests.</p>
<p>Last but not least, the cavalry is finally coming for stealthy solo Helldivers such as myself, as the game's plants will now actually screen people from view. "Vegetation that's large enough to slow the player now has an extra function," the post reads. "When inside the vegetation helldivers will be harder to detect, reducing their detection range by enemies. This effect stacks with other detection reducing effects such as nighttime, being crouched or prone, or things such as the scout armor passive." </p>
<p>A meaty update, by all that's Super-Democratic! I'm sure the internet's Pandemonium-Dippers will find much to chew over and complain about, for the cycle of feedback and updates must continue to spin, though hopefully it'll be nothing as severe as what happened when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-drops-psn-account-linking-requirement-for-steam-players-after-widespread-backlash">Sony insisted everybody get a PSN account and effectively banned whole countries from the game</a>. The only thing it's missing, really, is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-major-order-turns-planet-into-black-hole-as-rumours-of-returning-illuminate-faction-intensify">a new enemy faction</a> of some kind.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24177794/metallica-stage-fortnite-festival-new-season<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="1GJMvA">James Hetfield, Lars Ulrich, Kirk Hammett, and Robert Trujillo — the members who make up the world-famous band Metallica — are taking to the virtual stage. Starting Thursday, the band is headlining <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23998496/fortnite-festival-the-weeknd-meme">Fortnite Festival</a>. Its arrival brings Metallica tracks that fans can play, specially-themed cosmetic items, and most notably, a new PvP mode in case you want to put your rhythm game chops to the test and compete against others. </p>
<p id="zTP6CO">Fortnite Festival, a rhythm game available within <a href="https://www.polygon.com/fortnite"><em>Fortnite</em></a>, has featured pop stars like The Weeknd and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24078316/fortnite-lady-gaga-festival-dlc">Lady Gaga</a> in the past. Now, the theme will get a bit more metal. Epic Games announced six tracks that collect some of Metallica’s popular hits. They are as follows: “Enter Sandman,” “Fuel,” “Master of Puppets,” “Ride the Lightning,” “The Unforgiven,” and “Wherever I May Roam.” </p>
<p id="sNU1f4">As usual, the new season will introduce a separate battle pass for Fortnite Festival where players can unlock a variety of cosmetic items for both the free and Premium Reward Track. The Premium track unlocks the Lars Ulrich Outfit right away, but you’ll have to progress through the battle pass to unlock the other three band members. And if you really want to get into it, alternate “Puppet Master” versions of each bandmate will be purchasable in the Fortnite Shop for the duration of Season 4. You can view the full list of cosmetics available on the <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-festival-season-4-prepare-for-battle-with-metallica">Fortnite blog</a>. </p>
<p id="4wUBP7">Chapter 5 Season 4 in <em>Fortnite </em>starts June 13 and ends Aug. 16. </p>

The studio held a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5oyn4xIYRY&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5oyn4xIYRY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reveal lifestream</a></span> today, June 13, and on top of interviews with the development team and Max voice actor Hannah Telle, the stream concluded with 18 minutes of gameplay footage. The stream was enlightening, both in that it answered questions fans have had since the reveal trailer premiered, and in reassuring anyone worried that Max might be less of an absolute dork this time around.<br></p><div data-video-id="195891" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Alan Wake 2" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="156" data-playlist="195891,196307,196470" data-current="195891"><div><p>The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Alan Wake 2</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195891/195891_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195891/195891_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195891/195891_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195891/195891_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21406.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>One of the key points brought up during the stream is that <em>Double Exposure</em> will respect both of the original game’s divergent endings. Spoilers for a nearly decade-old game, but <em>Life is Strange </em>ended with Max choosing to either save her friend/possible girlfriend Chloe or the town of Arcadia Bay. Those are two very different outcomes, but it looks like Deck Nine isn’t making a choice about which one is canon in <em>Double Exposure</em>.</p><p>At some point in the game, players will talk to Max’s friend Safi about her past, and that will include defining their relationship with Chloe and whether or not they chose to save her. It’s unclear how, if at all, this will affect <em>Double Exposure</em>’s story, but at the very least everyone will get to see how Max’s life played out in either scenario. <em>Double Exposure </em>finds Max incollege, where her life seems pretty distanced from her time back in Arcadia Bay, so if <em>Double Exposure</em> can acknowledge the player’s decision without engaging with it too much, that’s probably easier on the team.</p><p>Beyond that, we also got a pretty extensive look at what seems to be an early segment in the first episode. <em>Double Exposure </em>is a murder mystery that follows Max as she learns that she can jump between two timelines. She’ll move between them to search for clues, but it’s possible for the player to get confused and pick dialogue options that should only apply to one timeline or the other. For instance, one clip shown during the stream had Max apologizing for “being nosy” talking to someone in one timeline, seemingly for mentioning something she’d talked about in the other. That’s an interesting way of making sure you’re paying attention. We don’t see Max using her timeline-jumping abilities in the 18 minutes of footage that capped off the stream, but there are clips of it interspersed between the interviews.</p><p>The segment we do see has Max hanging out with her new friends Fari and Moses. Even as a <em>Life Is Strange </em>diehard, I felt a little awkward watching the scene unfold. Many players, myself included, found the dialogue in the original <em>Life Is Strange</em> often pretty stiff and silly, and I was kinda hoping that revisiting Max a few years later would have gotten us past that. Maybe the tone of things will shift when the murder mystery begins properly. Check out the footage below:</p><p><em>Life Is Strange: Double Exposure</em> launches on October 29 on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Switch. The game has only been announced for under a week and it’s already got a little bit of controversy after it was revealed that people who pay extra for the game’s Ultimate Edition <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure-ultimate-edition-early-1851529762&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure-ultimate-edition-early-1851529762">can play two episodes weeks in advance</a></span>, leaving people who can’t afford it open to spoilers.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s being developed by Strange Scaffold, the same developers behind last year’s amazing <em>Max Payne</em>-like shooter <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/el-paso-elsewhere-max-payne-control-creepy-ps1-review-1850871547&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/el-paso-elsewhere-max-payne-control-creepy-ps1-review-1850871547"><em>El Paso, Elsewhere</em></a></span><em>. </em>And like that fantastic game, <em>Beast</em> is an indie shooter that feels incredible to play and lets you step into the boots of a true alpha predator.<br></p><p>In <em>Beast</em>, you start every level with no guns or weapons. Instead, you have to find them, either by killing enemies or scavenging them from the level. Knives, pistols, shotguns, and even tree branches are all fair game and can be quite deadly if used correctly. There’s also no reloading, forcing you to hunt down enemies for more weapons. Of course, you can also forgo weapons and just use your bare hands and feet to punch and stomp enemies to death. All attacks in <em>I Am Your Beast </em>are snappy and responsive. I always felt in control during combat, even when things got hectic or I fucked up and missed my last shot or tossed a knife the wrong way.<br></p><p>With a bit of practice, you’ll quickly become (and feel like) a deadly, unstoppable predator. And that’s when<em> I Am You Beast</em> goes from good to amazing. That’s because, once you nail the controls and learn how combat flows, you can then focus on completing each level as quickly and smoothly as possible to receive a perfect rating.<br></p><p>This is where <em>I Am Your Beast </em>sunk its claws into me. I spent over two hours just replaying the four main levels in the demo, trying to get faster and faster times. When you die or reset, the game loads almost instantly, making it easy to repeat a level over and over and over until you get that perfect run. And once you nail that incredible run you’ll be hungry to shave off another second. Maybe next time don’t jump up to the branch, but instead slide into the guard and get his rifle first. Try blowing up the barrels after you kill the guard on the center hill. These kinds of thoughts—hunting for every possible opportunity to optimize your time—will flood your brain as you play levels in <em>I Am Your Beast </em>again and again.</p><p>The few levels in<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1876590/I_Am_Your_Beast/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1876590/I_Am_Your_Beast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>I Am Your Beast</em>’s demo</a></span> were more than enough to keep me busy for a night. I can’t imagine how much time I’ll be able to sink into the full game when it arrives on PC on August 15. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> World of Warcraft: The War Within Cinematic Trailer | Xbox Games Showcase 2024</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Sulfuras is an iconic weapon. It's the first Legendary item players were able to obtain in the original version of WoW, a massive two-handed mace wielded by the Ragnaros the Firehold himself that can hurl fireballs at opponents. It also requires a significant amount of time and gold in order to craft. While the weapon was good originally, there were still better options out there for some classes, despite Sulfuras being a Legendary.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard clearly wants to make Sulfuras even more fitting of its Legendary status in phase four of Season of Discovery. According to the datamine, Sulfuras will feature a slightly slower swing speed, resulting in higher top-end damage. Its chance-on-hit fireball effect has been tweaked to not only deal damage but also sunder a target's armor. The weapon will feature a 20% chance to deal 25 fire damage to all nearby enemies when struck by a melee attack (a change from a guaranteed 5 fire damage dealt to melee attackers), giving the weapon a little AOE splash damage when fighting a group of enemies. And last but not least, the weapon is getting a Druid specific attack power bonus, making the item especially appealing to Feral Druids.</p><p dir="ltr">Sulfuras is hardly the only change that has been datamined. It seems the game's first raid, Molten Core, will be receiving additional difficulty modifiers in the form of "Heat Levels." There are <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/news/ashbringer-placeholder-quest-item-datamined-on-season-of-discovery-phase-4-ptr-342918" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">hints</a> that Blizzard may make one of the Warcraft universe's most iconic weapons, the Ashbringer, actually obtainable in WoW Classic, something that wasn't possible in the original game despite long standing rumors and fan theories stating otherwise. There's even indications that Blizzard may add yet another all-new Legendary weapon, the <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/news/broxigars-axe-model-datamined-in-season-of-discovery-phase-4-ptr-axe-of-cenarius-342902" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Axe of Cenarius</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard has not yet given a date for when phase four of Season of Discovery and all of its endgame changes will go live, but has said it will be discussing more details in the weeks ahead. Meanwhile, WoW Classic Cataclysm is in full-swing, while players who enjoy the modern version of WoW can level-up in the ongoing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-might-make-leveling-a-new-character-fun-again-with-mists-of-pandaria-remix-event/1100-6522559/" data-ref-id="1100-6522559">Mists of Pandaria Remix event</a> ahead of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-the-war-within-release-date-announced-during-xbox-showcase/1100-6524083/" data-ref-id="1100-6524083">The War Within's launch on August 26</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/gigsky-esim-data-plan/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=gigsky-esim-data-plan<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="165" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Tired of spending hundreds of dollars on high roaming fees during your international trips? <a href="https://inkdesk.click/THgfW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><mark>GigSky</mark></a> is here to help with their <a href="https://inkdesk.click/THgfW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><mark>low-cost International eSIM Data Plans</mark></a>.</p> <p data-characters="222" data-current-count="222" data-injectable="false">With GigSky, you can pay a fraction of the cost for a cellular data plan, make a couple of small changes in your phone settings, and have <a href="https://inkdesk.click/THgfW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><mark>instant, high-quality cellular data</mark></a> the moment you land for your international trip.</p> <p data-characters="221" data-current-count="443" data-injectable="true">Trusted by over 250,000 travelers around the world and with an above-average 4.6 rating out of nearly <a href="https://inkdesk.click/Buf-_" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><mark>800 customer reviews on Apple’s App Store</mark></a>, GigSky is the premier choice for all your international travel data needs.</p>
 <h2 id="h-what-is-gigsky" data-injectable="false">What is GigSky?</h2> <p data-characters="359" data-current-count="359" data-injectable="false">Founded in 2010 and headquartered in Silicon Valley, GigSky has been a champion of global mobility and an advocate of consumer choice for over a decade. They are the first <a href="https://inkdesk.click/THgfW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><mark>eSIM Based Mobile Network Operator</mark></a>, and their data-only network covers <a href="https://inkdesk.click/THgfW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><mark>200+ destinations</mark></a> and access to over 400 networks worldwide including maritime networks (cruise ships) and inflight.</p> <h2 id="h-how-is-gigsky-different-from-traditional-esim-resellers" data-injectable="false">How is GigSky different from traditional eSIM resellers?</h2> <p data-characters="298" data-current-count="657" data-injectable="true">Almost every eSIM company on the market today is just a reseller of someone else’s services. They buy a handful of eSIM profiles from a local carrier and resell these to their customers. Unfortunately, this means that they are not able to offer any meaningful support to those who buy a plan.</p>
 <p data-characters="406" data-current-count="406" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://inkdesk.click/THgfW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><mark>GigSky</mark></a>, on the other hand, is an <a href="https://inkdesk.click/THgfW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><mark>actual network operator</mark></a>. They partner with over 400 cellular providers across the globe and are able to provide their customers with top-flight data connectivity. If a certain network goes down, GigSky simply shifts its users to one that is not down. eSIM resellers are not able to do this. Heck, they wouldn’t even know the network they sold to the customer is down.</p>
 <p data-characters="557" data-current-count="557" data-injectable="true">Being an operator provides one other major customer benefit – the ability to use one eSIM, no matter where you travel. For resellers, each plan you buy generates a new eSIM, requiring customers to download, activate, and change over to this new eSIM. That can be quite complex for many people. <a href="https://inkdesk.click/THgfW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><mark>With GigSky</mark></a>, once your eSIM is set up, it doesn’t matter where you travel. You’ll be able to continue to use a single eSIM. Even as you <a href="https://inkdesk.click/THgfW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><mark>travel back and forth between countries</mark></a>, GigSky will automatically shift your plan to the country you are in.</p>
 <p data-characters="324" data-current-count="324" data-injectable="false">In addition to providing <a href="https://inkdesk.click/THgfW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><mark>service in over 190 countries</mark></a>, GigSky users can use their product while at sea (on over 190 different cruise ships), offshore (throughout the Gulf of Mexico and North Sea), and inflight (on over 20 different airlines). No other eSIM competitor can boast the same combination of land/sea/air options.</p> <h2 id="h-trusted-by-companies-like-apple-and-visa" data-injectable="false">Trusted by companies like Apple and Visa</h2> <p data-characters="248" data-current-count="572" data-injectable="true">Did you know that <a href="https://inkdesk.click/THgfW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><mark>GigSky was a launch partner with Apple</mark></a> when the eSIM was first released in 2018? Apple selected GigSky to be one of its launch partners due to GigSky’s deep expertise in data connectivity and history of technical innovation.</p>
 <p data-characters="474" data-current-count="474" data-injectable="true">Also, <a href="https://inkdesk.click/THgfW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><mark>GigSky’s global partnership with Visa</mark></a>, whereby eligible Visa cardholders can redeem a complimentary data plan as a cardholder benefit highlights the quality of GigSky’s service and their ability to integrate their product with one of the leading financial services companies in the world. Visa selected GigSky as their global partner due to their <a href="https://inkdesk.click/THgfW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><mark>unsurpassed network quality</mark></a>, their <a href="https://inkdesk.click/THgfW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><mark>24/7/365 Live customer support</mark></a>, and the simplicity of the user experience.</p>
 <h2 id="h-the-only-esim-company-with-a-free-plan" data-injectable="false">The only eSIM company with a free plan</h2> <p data-characters="671" data-current-count="671" data-injectable="false">GigSky recently released a unique offering on the market – <a href="https://inkdesk.click/THgfW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><mark>a free 100 MB plan</mark></a>. There are no strings attached and no credit card is required. Whether a customer is new to eSIM and wants to play around with the technology, or is new to GigSky and wants to test the quality of our service, <a href="https://inkdesk.click/THgfW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><mark>their FREE plan</mark></a> is a difference maker in the industry. Consider this Free plan to be GigSky’s way of helping grow global awareness of eSIM technology and getting everyone connected no matter where they travel. <a href="https://inkdesk.click/THgfW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><mark>Check out the GigSky website</mark></a> or <a href="https://inkdesk.click/Buf-_" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><mark>download their app on Apple’s App Store</mark></a> for more information on how you can save some money with your upcoming travel plans.</p>

		<p>While we’re in the thick of not-E3, it’s fair to say that the announcements are coming thick and fast. Amongst the minute by minute trailer drops, the fantastic-looking new hero shooter from Bad Guitar studio, FragPunk, immediately stood out to me amongst the other games appearing in the Xbox Showcase. Coming from publisher NetEase, this 5v5 competitive shooter has all the hallmarks of a multiplayer hit, especially if it plays as good as it looks.</p>
<p><iframe title="FragPunk: Official World Premiere Trailer - Xbox Games Showcase 2024" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fN8EdlB0P10?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>First up, this is a console exclusive, coming to Xbox Series X|S as well as the mighty PC, so PlayStation fans will have to look over the wall at this one, at least for the moment. The trailer gives you a taste of the vibrant visual design, as well as a hefty dose of attitude that you’d expect from a game named FragPunk.</p>
<p>Set in a futuristic, hyper-stylised universe, players can use various cards to modify how they approach combat, unlocking special abilities and modifiers to keep things consistently fresh. Netease have also announced the first Closed Alpha Test on Steam, running from June 27 to July 1 for selected participants, focused this time on North America.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/jackbox-megapicker-july</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-jackbox-megapicker-lets-you-pick-and-choose-your-games-on-pc-next-month.900738/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/jackbox-megapicker-july<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Jackbox has announced&nbsp;<em>The Jackbox Megapicker</em>, a new free Steam app that lets you pick and choose individual games from all of your&nbsp;<em>Jackbox&nbsp;</em>collections.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<em>Jackbox Party Pack&nbsp;</em>series <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/jackbox-games-10-years-of-laughing-quipping-and-fibbing">began in 2014</a>, and nine further installments have been released since then, with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/jackbox-party-pack-10-review-decade-of-brilliance">tenth launching late last year</a>. If you own them all on Steam, it can be pretty tricky to remember which minigames belong to which collection.</p>
<p>Thankfully,&nbsp;<em>The Jackbox Megapicker&nbsp;</em>will soon make that problem a thing of the past, as long as you're using Steam.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-jackbox-megapicker-party-pack-announcement-comments.jpg?itok=AiAcAHXh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-jackbox-megapicker-party-pack-announcement-comments.jpg?itok=49JgSWnI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Jackbox has had a fair few requests for a <em>Megapicker</em> app.</figcaption></figure><p>In a press release, Jackbox says that many users have asked for a&nbsp;<em>Megapicker</em>-style app over the years, and that with more than 50 games now available via the&nbsp;<em>Jackbox Party Pack&nbsp;</em>titles, the time is ripe for such an app to debut.</p>
<p>Essentially,&nbsp;<em>Megapicker&nbsp;</em>will do exactly what you think it'll do. It'll scan your Steam library for&nbsp;<em>Jackbox Party Pack&nbsp;</em>games, then add them to a unified app from which you can launch whichever games you like.</p>
<p>You'll also be able to sort and filter the games you own, although Jackbox hasn't said exactly how you'll be able to do this or what the limitations of the system will be yet.</p>
<p>We do know that&nbsp;<em>The Jackbox Megapicker&nbsp;</em>is launching sometime in July, and that Jackbox will provide more information about exactly how it'll work in the coming weeks.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-receives-a-major-balancing-patch/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Helldivers 2 patch 1.000.400 is live and introduces many balancing changes for weapons and stratagems. Johan Pilestedt, the now Chief Creative Officer at Arrowhead Game Studios, took the time to explain the new patch to the community and explain why they made certain decisions through a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/5998312279129319530?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> on Steam.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Pilestedt’s first focus was on addressing the community’s feedback and the aim of the new Helldivers 2 patch. The team’s goal was to enhance the usability of weaker stratagems by significantly boosting their capabilities. This includes changes to other stratagems to ensure a more consistent gameplay experience and to introduce a wider variety of play loadouts.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-helldivers-2-balancing-changes">Helldivers 2 Balancing Changes</h2>



<p>The A/MLS-4X Rocket Sentry has been made more effective against medium to large enemy types, with improved ammo economy. This change enhances the stratagem’s performance and creates a clear distinction between it and the autocannon sentry. The A/MG-43 Machine Gun sentry’s cooldown has been reduced, allowing players to use it more frequently when transitioning between positions. Additionally, the durability of several sentries has been increased by 80%, providing players with more robust defensive options.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The E/MG-101 now has a 100% increase in rotation speed, making it more effective for defending a fixed position. The explosion damage for the MD-6 Anti-Personnel Minefield and MD-14 Incendiary Mines has been increased to enhance the effectiveness of these stratagems, with more improvements planned for the future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The developers have reduced the cooldown times for Orbital Gatling, Precision Strike, and Orbital Airburst Strike in the Orbital stratagems. For the Eagle stratagems, the 110mm Rocket Pods now have improved targeting, better projectile armour penetration, reduced projectile damage, and reduced explosion armour penetration. The Eagle Strafing Gun has also increased uses and improved armour penetration, enabling players to damage heavily armoured enemies.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The damage caused by the GL-21 Grenade Launcher has been increased to better handle large groups of enemies. The standard projectile damage and projectile damage against durable body parts for the MG-206 Heavy Machine Gun, MG-43 Machine Gun, A/MG-43 Machine Gun Sentry, A/G-16 Gatling Sentry, and EXO-45 Patriot Exosuits Gatling have been improved as well. Additionally, the reload time for the MG-206 Heavy Machine Gun and the MG-43 Machine Gun has been reduced, making these weapons faster and more effective.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Moreover, the Helldivers 2’s 1.000.400 update included various adjustments to several other stratagems too. Balancing is an ongoing process, and despite the numerous changes, the developers will need to revisit these stratagems soon. However, it’s great to see that players in the comments section of the Twitter post about this patch are pleased with the new buffs and are eager to test these changes in the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-helldivers-2-gameplay-changes">Helldivers 2 Gameplay Changes</h2>



<p>In patch 1.000.400, there are many gameplay changes as well. The AA-Defenses modifier is no longer in the game, the Retrieve Essential Personnel has been disabled for now, and Super Samples will spawn on difficulty six after the new patch. Also, you can now say goodbye to randoms joining your lobbies, as Invite-Only lobbies will be supported in the latest update. Additionally, there are several more changes to the Galactic War and many bug fixes in Helldivers 2 patch 1.000.400. You can check out the full patch notes <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/4150709804553746157?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p data-characters="263" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">2023 and 2024 have been banner years for fantasy anime thanks to two shows in particular: <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/frieren-is-a-gorgeous-melancholic-anime-set-after-the-rpg-adventure-ends/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End</a> </em>and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/delicious-in-dungeon-netflix-first-episode-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Delicious in Dungeon</em></a>.

While we wait for more info on the followup, a new trailer and key visual made their way online along with the reveal.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via official Dungeon Meshi Twitter</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="496" data-current-count="796" data-injectable="true">Based on the manga of the same name by Ryoko Kui—known as <em>Dungeon Meshi </em>in Japan—<em>Delicious in Dungeon </em>really is the ideal adventure for fans of dungeon-crawling RPGs. The story follows Laios and his party, who end up losing all their money and provisions after a powerful dragon attacks them deep in a dungeon. They also lose a key party member in the process, so their primary objective is to return and save Laios’s sister Falin from the dragon’s maw before it’s too late.</p>
 <p data-characters="443" data-current-count="443" data-injectable="true">With the party now strapped for food and coin, though, they’re going to have to get creative if they want to survive long enough to find her. That’s where Laios’ brilliant plan to “eat the monsters” comes into play. <em>Delicious in Dungeon</em> quickly becomes a dungeon foodie travelogue, as Laios enlists the assistance of Senshi, a veritable gourmand of the grotesque.&nbsp;Fans of bestiaries, I implore you to watch. </p>
 <h2 id="h-pipin-hot-provisions" data-injectable="false">Pipin’ hot provisions</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Kadokawa Anime Channel on YouTube</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="398" data-current-count="698" data-injectable="true"><em>Delicious in Dungeon </em>works for a lot of reasons. It has a strong cast of characters, fantastic designs and animation from anime studio TRIGGER (<em>Kill la Kill</em>, <em>PROMARE</em>), and countless inventive ways to catch, prep, cook, and devour the denizens of the deep. It’s not all lighthearted fun and games, and the latest trailer above closes out with a foreboding tease of what’s to come. &nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="427" data-current-count="427" data-injectable="false">Yoshihiro Miyajima (episodes of <em>DARLING in the FRANXX</em>, <em>BNA: Brand New Animal</em>) directed the first season of <em>Delicious in Dungeon</em>, which is available to stream on Netflix. Kimiko Ueno (<em>Little Witch Academia</em>) handled writing duties, with Naoki Takeda (chief animation director for <em>BNA</em>) adapting Ryoko Kui’s original character designs for the screen. Whichever staff members return for the second season, let them cook.&nbsp;</p>

After its initial launch in 2017, the game is getting a major update, and Nintendo Switch launch with <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/bigmode-videogamedunkeys-indie-publisher-announces-their-debut-title/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VideogameDunkey’s publisher, Bigmode</a>. </p> <p data-characters="509" data-current-count="509" data-injectable="true">The first game that Bigmode ever published was the phenomenal <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-animal-well/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Animal Well</a></em>. <em>Star of Providence</em> already has a big fan base on Steam, but the Nintendo Switch release, alongside a major update, will bring new players who have never experienced it before and could be a massive moment for developer Team D13. Bigmode picked a fantastic game to help bring to market with <em>Animal Well</em>, and I’m confident that when released, the Switch version and major update for this next game will feel just as good to play. </p>
 <h2 id="h-when-is-the-release-date-for-the-star-of-providence-major-update-and-nintendo-switch-version" data-injectable="false">When is the release date for the <em>Star of Providence</em> major update and Nintendo Switch version?</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Star of Providence is Coming" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CRvv1ezR_Rs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="379" data-current-count="679" data-injectable="true"><em>Star of Providence</em>‘s major update and Nintendo Switch version will be released in <strong>February 2025</strong>. We don’t have an exact date yet, but the fact that it’s eight months away at the time of writing shows that, hopefully, enough time has been set aside for development so that, when they arrive, the major update and Nintendo Switch version will be highly polished. </p>
 <p data-characters="301" data-current-count="301" data-injectable="false">We don’t currently have any details on what the new content in the major update for <em>Star of Providence</em> will add. It’s worth keeping an eye on the <a href="https://bigmode.com/games/star-of-providence" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official Bigmode page</a> for the game to catch updates as they’re added, though I suspect we won’t hear much until closer to launch. </p> <h2 id="h-what-is-star-of-providence" data-injectable="false">What is <em>Star of Providence</em>?</h2> <figure data-current-count="601" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Bigmode</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="218" data-current-count="218" data-injectable="false">As I mentioned above, <em>Star of Providence</em> is a top-down shooter with procedurally generated elements. You must explore a facility and fight your way through each level, beating up bosses and gaining upgrades as you go. </p> <p data-characters="271" data-current-count="489" data-injectable="true">The game boasts over 120 unique enemies to shoot your way through, dozens of powerups and modifiers, and six playable ships to try out. Each ship has its own unique play style, so runs will be completely different if you swap your ship from the one you’re used to. </p>
 <p data-characters="266" data-current-count="266" data-injectable="false">The layouts of levels are randomized in each run with some very lethal hand-crafted death traps to run into, and all the while, you’ll be battling against the intricate attack pattern of whatever combination of enemies the level has decided to throw your way. </p> <p data-characters="317" data-current-count="583" data-injectable="false">If you want to try <em>Star of Providence</em> out ahead of its major update and Nintendo Switch release, you can do so right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/603960/Star_of_Providence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>. In March 2024, a team finished putting together a level editor for the title, meaning there will likely be dozens of user-created levels to play through while you wait for February 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/after-10-hours-in-the-tiny-glade-demo-im-still-not-bored/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=after-10-hours-in-the-tiny-glade-demo-im-still-not-bored<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="289" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The <em>Tiny Glade</em> demo released on <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ultimate-cozy-game-tiny-glade-to-release-first-playable-demo-on-may-30/">May 30</a> and is featured as part of Steam’s Next Fest. It seems to have taken over the cozy gaming corner of Twitter, with players sharing their miniature creations in droves. I’ve spent over 10 hours absorbed in the demo, and I’m still loving it.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="268" data-current-count="268" data-injectable="false">Back in March, I wrote about <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/its-easy-to-lose-hours-playing-new-house-building-game-summerhouse/"><em>Summerhouse</em></a> and how amazing it is to just place blocks in order to build adorable houses. <em>Tiny Glade</em> is like taking <em>Summerhouse</em> and making it 3D, giving you creative control over a small area to create dioramas fit for any RPG world.&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="568" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="346" data-current-count="346" data-injectable="false">The <em>Tiny Glade</em> demo offers you control over an appropriately tiny piece of land, on which you can erect square buildings, circular towers, build crumbling walls, plant flowers, and even hang your laundry between windows. There’s not a lot to it, admittedly, but that doesn’t mean there isn’t a tiny world of possibilities to discover.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="369" data-current-count="715" data-injectable="true">One of the things which makes<em> Tiny Glade </em>so endlessly enjoyable, at least for me, is the camera mode. Not only do you have free reign over your builds, but also free reign of the camera. You can take wide angle shots of an entire build, or zoom in incredibly close to capture the most minute of details, really putting yourself into the tiny world you’ve built.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="302" data-current-count="602" data-injectable="true">The buildable zone is very small compared to the space we’ll have once the game releases fully and we don’t have access to all features, which does limit you somewhat. However, the space is ample for miniature builds and the features we do have access to reduce the feeling of limitation somewhat. </p>
 <p data-characters="525" data-current-count="525" data-injectable="true">Buildings can be circular or square, and windows can be placed pretty much anywhere on flat walls, in corners or as dormers in the roof. They come in different designs which automatically connect to create bigger windows, allowing you to make a feature out of them if you want. There is a certain window which comes with a towel hanging out of it. Placing two of these windows close together, but not quite touching, will result in a washing line stringing between the two, even stretching across alleyways between buildings.</p>
 <p data-characters="524" data-current-count="524" data-injectable="true">Whether you’re building Rapunzel’s tower or a ramshackle town fit for a medieval saga, each building can be modified in whichever way you choose, with any paths you place automatically creating doors or archways which grow depending on the size of the path. You can stretch walls, curve the roof or flatten it entirely to create turreted lookout towers and walkways. If you place two roofs together just right, a small nest filled with eggs will appear in the joint. Those small touches make the game feel alive.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="457" data-current-count="757" data-injectable="true">Once you’ve designed your miniature vista, you can add flowers and lanterns. While flowers are always the same, something I’m hoping is worked on before the full release to add more variation, lanterns will change from free-standing to wall-hanging with no effort, allowing you to place them wherever you like. If you change the time setting to nighttime, those lanterns automatically light up, casting soft light across the paths and brickwork.</p>
 <p data-characters="476" data-current-count="476" data-injectable="true">All of this works together to bring whatever you create to life, despite the lack of people wandering the streets. Thanks to the free roaming camera mode, you can explore your creation from within and it’s easy to imagine meeting people in the streets, or residents in the houses going about their lives as the windows illuminate the dark of night. The mode feels like walking through a quaint English village late at night and I can almost smell the wood burning fires.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="615" data-current-count="915" data-injectable="true">With that said, <em>Tiny Glade</em> isn’t entirely devoid of life. There are some sheep wandering the area and one particularly cute feature is what happens when you modify the terrain underneath a wandering sheep, or erect a building on top of them. Moving the ground underneath a sheep will cause it to fly up into the air and do their best Mary Poppins impression by floating down with the aid of an umbrella. If you happen to trap a sheep inside a building, they will audibly voice their confusion and a speech bubble will periodically appear until you let them out again. Did I mention that you can pet the sheep?</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="357" data-current-count="657" data-injectable="true">During Next Fest, the team at Pouncelight are issuing daily prompts over on <a href="https://x.com/PounceLight">Twitter</a>. There have been three so far – House on a Hill, Secret Garden and Tiny Neighborhood – which have seen players sending in a ton of screenshots. I’ve sent in one myself, though I’ve been put to shame by some of the other beautiful diorama builds I’ve seen.</p>
 <p data-characters="290" data-current-count="290" data-injectable="false">I have to admit, it’s taken me this long to feel like I’m getting the hang of things and I still don’t fully understand how to do everything I want to do in <em>Tiny Glade</em>. I want to build huge arches and elevate buildings, but I’m just going to have to keep playing to figure that out.</p>

<p data-characters="398" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">It’s always fun trying to track down Minerva so you can acquire her valuable rare goodies, but with the new Skyline Valley update for <em>Fallout 76</em> things have shifted a little bit for Minerva. While her location always jumps around, thankfully we already know her plans for the first couple of weeks of Skyline Valley. Here is where to find Minerva in <em>Fallout 76</em> with the Skyline Valley update.</p> <h2 id="h-where-to-find-minerva-in-skyline-valley-now-week-of-june-13" data-injectable="false">Where to find Minerva in Skyline Valley now (Week of June 13)</h2> <p data-characters="511" data-current-count="511" data-injectable="true">Unfortunately, Minerva is not in <em>Fallout 76</em> this week. If you’re hoping to trade with her, you’ll need to wait a little longer until next week. Sadly, there was no indication she would be leaving, so those looking to settle up with her ahead of the Skyline Valley release will not be able to do so. While this gives players time to explore the new Skyline Valley region of the Appalachia, we will have to do so without being able to trade with Minerva until she returns the following week in a new location.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <h2 id="h-where-minerva-be-located-starting-june-20" data-injectable="false">Where Minerva be located starting June 20</h2> <p data-characters="428" data-current-count="728" data-injectable="true">Minerva will return to the Appalachia region on June 20. When she does, you will be able to find her at The Whitespring Resort, located in the Forest Region. It’s a bit strange she isn’t going to locate to the new Skyline Valley region since that’s where most players will be with it being the new content. However, it’s likely that Bethesda wanted to make sure she’s in a more accessible location.</p>
 <p data-characters="155" data-current-count="155" data-injectable="false">We also know the items Minerva will have available once she moves to The Winterspring Resort. Here is everything you can buy from Minerva starting June 20:</p> <figure data-found-rows="12" data-current-count="935" data-injectable="false"><table><thead><tr><th>Item</th><th>Gold Bullion Cost</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Gauss Pistol</strong></td><td>188</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Floater Gnasher Grenades</strong></td><td>113</td></tr><tr><td><strong>The Gauntlet</strong></td><td>188</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Secret Service Armor Set</strong></td><td>4428</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Strangler Heart Armor Set</strong></td><td>5176</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Chinese Stealth Armor</strong></td><td>3000</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Chinese Stealth Armor Helmet</strong></td><td>1238</td></tr><tr><td><strong>War Glaive</strong></td><td>2000</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Sympto-Matic</strong></td><td>2000</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Scavenged Solar Panel</strong></td><td>1500</td></tr><tr><td><strong>T-65 Stealth Boy Mod</strong></td><td>563</td></tr><tr><td><strong>T-65 Overdrive Servos Mod</strong></td><td>563</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

            <p>
Life is Strange: Double Exposure will support and respect whichever ending you chose in the original Life is Strange game, developer Deck Nine has said as part of an extended look at its upcoming sequel.
</p>
<p>
Announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-returns-with-its-original-protagonist-now-all-grown-up">last week during Summer Game Fest</a>, Double Exposure continues the story of the Life is Strange series' original teenage protagonist Max Caulfield, now an adult.
</p>
<p>
But the surprise return to Max's story immediately prompted questions from fans as to whether their previous narrative choices will be supported, and their consequences shown on screen. Now, we know more.

<p>
"We knew that this had to be something special," narrative director Felice Kuan said of returning to Max's story. "We knew we had to respect the two unforgettable endings to the first chapter of Max's story, while also crafting something new, something fresh that echoed Max's past challenges even while it moved Max's personal story forward."
</p>
<p>
As to which of Life of Strange's endings was canon, Deck Nine said that there was no single canon choice - fitting, perhaps, for a game about dual timelines.
</p>
<p>
"It was really important at Deck Nine that if we were to make another Max adventure that the game we'd have to respect both those endings," game director Jon Stauder adds. "Life is Strange: Double Exposure does that very thing. 
</p>
<p>
"There's no canon ending in our book to the first game. Double Exposure will respect both endings in Max's thoughts, her journal, her SMS, her interactions with other characters, what she opts to reveal about her past to her new friends, it's all reflective of that final choice."
</p>
<p>
As for how Double Exposure will 'import' players' choices, Deck Nine has said this will be handled organically in the game's early scenes, through a conversation with Max and her new friend Safi. 
</p>
<p>
Today's presentation on Double Exposure appeared to show a fragment of that, where Safi asks Max about the "girl with the blue hair whose picture you keep in your wallet". Max can choose to reply that she and Chloe were friends, or that she was a high-school sweetheart. 
</p>
<p>
Double Exposure sees Max - once again performed by original actor Hannah Tell - now a "photographer-in-residence" at Caledon University, a Vermont college that looks as if it will play a similar role to the original game's Blackwell Academy. 
</p>
<p>
Now an adult, Max's role here at the college is as a mentor to students - which presumably means you get to hang around without the hassle of having to actually go to class. 
</p>
<p>
It's here, after a stargazing session with Safi and her friend Moses, that tragedy strikes. Safi is found dead - at least, in one timeline. Max soon discovers she can move between two worlds - one where Safi is dead, and the other where she is still alive. Double Exposure is a double mystery, then - finding the identity of the murderer in one timeline, before they can still carry it out in the second. 
</p>
<p>
Life is Strange: Double Exposure is set to launch on 29th October for PC, PlayStation and Xbox, with a version for Nintendo Switch also planned. If you pay an extra $30 you can play Double Exposure's first two chapters a fortnight early - something <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-fans-criticise-30-upgrade-to-play-new-games-early-chapters-two-weeks-early">fans have criticised over its cost and due to the likely leak of story spoilers</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24176406/overwatch-2-pink-mercy-skin-rerelease-blizzard-charity<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="IbZVhQ">After years of requests from Overwatch fans, Blizzard is bringing back the <a href="https://www.heroesneverdie.com/2018/5/8/17332528/overwatch-mercy-skin-breast-cancer-research-foundation">Pink Mercy skin it released in 2018</a> as part of the “Mercy for a Cause” charity campaign with the <a href="https://www.bcrf.org/">Breast Cancer Research Foundation</a>. That skin <a href="https://www.heroesneverdie.com/2018/7/9/17548832/pink-mercy-raises-13-million-for-charity">raised $12.7 million in proceeds</a> six years ago, during its two-week window of availability, and Overwatch players who missed out on it the first time have long begged for its return.</p>
<p id="lITDMo">Later this month, Blizzard will make the Pink Mercy skin available for purchase once again in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23385539/overwatch-2-review-battle-pass-free-to-play-blizzard-entertainment"><em>Overwatch 2</em></a>. And just as it was in 2018, all purchase proceeds will be donated to support life-saving breast cancer research.</p>
<p id="7rY129">The original Pink Mercy skin will cost $15 — the same price it was sold for in 2018 — and will be joined by a new variant of that skin, Rose Gold Mercy, pictured above. The latter skin will be available in a bundle priced at $20. Those charity cosmetics will be available from June 25 to July 8.</p>
<p id="oP6VRw">The original “Mercy for a Cause” campaign led to the largest single donation ever made to BCRF, the organization said in a news release. Blizzard and the BCRF said in a news release they hope to repeat that success with the Pink Mercy skin’s relaunch.</p>

<p id="YH0j3Z">“Blizzard is thrilled to be working alongside BCRF once again, bringing attention and funding to such an important cause,” said Johanna Faries, president of Blizzard Entertainment, in a statement. “Overwatch recently crossed the 100 million lifetime player milestone, and we hope that our amazing community will once again rally to help support the critical work of BCRF, all while showcasing these beautiful skins in-game.” </p>
<p id="lmmuCF">“Overwatch launched one of the first charity partnerships in the gaming space with the Breast Cancer Research Foundation seven years ago—their innovation in the gaming industry mirrors the innovation BCRF is spurring in research to eradicate breast cancer,” said BCRF president and CEO Donna McKay in a statement. “Thanks to the unprecedented funds raised by passionate gamers in 2018, we also launched the first initiative designed to pinpoint exactly how to prevent breast cancer in each individual person—what we’ve dubbed The Precision Prevention Initiative (PPI). We are at a critical inflection point as incidence of breast cancer continues to rise and there is still more work to be done. We are thrilled to renew this collaboration to see how we can continue driving change, and saving lives, together.” </p>
<p id="4SZt1d"><em>Overwatch 2</em> is available on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X. Blizzard’s hero shooter is free to play, and a recent update made <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24084166/overwatch-2-season-10-new-heroes-unlocked-free-venture">all of the game’s heroes unlockable for free</a>.</p>

The "Builders Beta," as it's called, focuses on Everywhere's building and self-publishing tools, known as Arcadia. As announced previously, Everywhere is not a single game but is instead billed as a platform of sorts that features games and game-making tools, similar to Roblox in a way.</p><p>The Builders Beta begins June 18, and it allows testers to use the same tools that the developers themselves at Build A Rocket Boy are using to build the game. Check out the trailer below to see what's on offer in the Builders Beta.</p>

<p>"Anything from a small trap to a massive boss fight or a level complete with enemies and puzzles can be shared with others so they can use and remix these elements in their creations with no coding knowledge required," the studio said. "Everywhere is a haven for limitless creativity. We credit everyone’s contribution, so each game will have a full list of users who made it possible through the elements they created independently or together."</p><p>People can <a href="https://account.buildarocketboy.com/create-account" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">apply using this link</a> for the beta, though this is not an open beta so access is not guaranteed. Build A Rocket Boy said fans can increase their chances of getting in by completing the "Where do you like to build" form at the end of the account-creation process.</p><p>People who were part of the Everywhere alpha tests will get automatic access to the Builders Beta, and they will also get a few friend referral codes. Invitations to the Builders Beta are going out in the coming weeks, and invitations will come in waves, so people should keep checking their email.</p><p>The Builders Beta does not require players to sign an NDA, and in fact, Build A Rocket Boy is encouraging people to discuss and share their experiences, and this includes streaming the game and sharing videos.</p><p>Here are the recommended minimum specifications for the Builders Beta, but note that the game remains not fully optimized and the specifications could change over time.</p><ul><li>Target performance: 1080p @ 30 FPS</li><li>Operating System: Windows 10</li><li>Processor: Intel Core i7-12700 / AMD Ryzen 7 5800X</li><li>Memory: 16 GB RAM</li><li>Graphics: 6 GB of VRAM; NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 OR, AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT</li><li>Storage: 50 GB Available Space, SSD</li></ul><p>Build A Rocket Boy also discussed its narrative-driven action game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-designers-new-game-looks-like-gta-in-first-teaser/1100-6512635/" data-ref-id="1100-6512635">MindsEye</a>, saying the game remains in development and that the studio is now optimizing it to make sure it's "the best game it can be."</p><p>Benzies <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-studio-president-leaves-rockstar-after-15-ye/1100-6433743/" data-ref-id="1100-6433743">left Rockstar North in 2016</a>, following a 17-month sabbatical.

The report follows on from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-za-um-will-lay-off-25-percent-of-staff-after-project-cancellation">studio layoffs</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and the cancellation of several projects in February, with the most notable being one codenamed "Project X7."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Per the outlet, this project was planned as a spinoff to the studio's debut game, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Disco Elysium</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. It would've starred "one of [its] most beloved characters," in the vein of a game like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Current and former ZA/UM staff claim "X7" had a largely positive internal reaction.

Despite this, it's claimed there was no pre-production on the project, and the schedule was initially set for a year.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We were set up to fail from the start and it was impossible to catch up," said writer Dora Klindžić. She and co-writer Argo Tuulik pitched "X7" in August 2022 shortly after </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Disco Elysium's </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">sequel was cancelled, and the lack of prep time hurt development.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The pair were the only writers on "X7" at the time, and Tuulik said they both "had to work double-time from day one to supply other disciplines with work. [This was] whilst trying to write the first dialogues and sketch out the rest of the game at the same time."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While development was described as "fruitful," Klindžić and Tuulik noted neither were designated as project leads. They also weren't properly compensated for their extra work, and both factors began to wear on them (and other staff) over time.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Further exacerbating the issue was management having them communicate with their coworkers via an interim manager. Much of the blame was laid at Tonis Haavel, who Tuulik </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ex-za-um-writers-allege-studio-has-become-a-cold-careless-company-">implied in February</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> caused at least five women to leave ZA/UM.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ultimately, the developers who spoke to PCGamer are left feeling disappointed: both in the alleged behavior from management, and that "X7" was killed before it was basically out the door. And with the sequel canceled, its loss stings even more.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The entire X7 team loved the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Elysium</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> world⁠," said Klindžić. "As fan artists, musicians, iconic voices⁠, we only wanted to keep it going, rather than leave it to wither in some dark decrepit cellar of corporate intellectual property."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">PCGamer's full report on ZA/UM, which also explores the other cancelled projects and how they affected "Project X7," can be read </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/game-development/for-a-while-it-seemed-like-miracles-were-possible-and-with-them-redemption-a-follow-up-to-the-legendary-disco-elysium-might-have-been-ready-to-play-within-the-next-yearzaums-devs-loved-it-management-canceled-it-and-laid-off-the-team/">here</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author(s)</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributing Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A Kansas City, MO native, Justin Carter has written for numerous sites including IGN, Polygon, and SyFy Wire.

Each minigame has its own results and points values, as detailed below:</p> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="422" data-injectable="true"> <li>Shutdown – Blocked: Two points</li> <li>Shutdown – Success: Four points</li> <li>Bank Heist – Small: Four points</li> <li>Bank Heist – Large: Six points</li> <li>Bank Heist – Bankrupt: Eight points</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="408" data-current-count="408" data-injectable="false">The key to completing the Pace Pushers tournament and obtaining all 30 rewards is to increase your dice multiplier. These points directly scale with your multiplier, potentially giving you the thousands of points you need to advance through each milestone. However, this also drains your dice faster, making banner events, the Tycoon Racers event, and resources like <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/working-monopoly-go-free-dice-roll-links/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free dice links</a> more important than ever.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/despite-skipping-the-showcase-xbox-published-strategy-game-ara-history-untold-has-a-september-release-date/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=despite-skipping-the-showcase-xbox-published-strategy-game-ara-history-untold-has-a-september-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="356" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If you were hoping to see an update on grand strategy game <em>Ara: History Untold</em> at the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/everything-shown-at-the-xbox-games-showcase-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent Xbox showcase</a>, you probably would’ve assumed its absence meant it still needed time in the oven. As it turns out, the game is scheduled to launch in just a few months, which makes me wonder why Microsoft didn’t highlight it at all during the showcase.</p> <p data-characters="435" data-current-count="435" data-injectable="true">According to a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/06/12/ara-history-untold-release-date-multiplayer-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">June 12 Xbox Wire post</a>, <em>Ara: History Untold</em> will launch on Xbox Series X|S and PC on September 24, with it also slated to be available via PC Game Pass. The post also shared further details provided by Marc Meyer, president of developer Oxide Games, and Brian Stone, head of <em>Ara</em> for Xbox Game Studios, who appeared on the <a href="https://youtu.be/Pi6WEWn51H4?si=5gG9BJVYgRUENdeU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official Xbox podcast</a> to talk about how the game is structured and how its multiplayer mode works.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Xbox Games Showcase Deep Dives | Ara: History Untold &amp; Age of Mythology: Retold" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pi6WEWn51H4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="327" data-current-count="627" data-injectable="true">As a reminder, <em>Ara: History Untold</em> can be played solo. You’re provided a randomly generated world map comprised of different biomes and, after choosing a Leader from one of many real-world figures throughout history (like George Washington and Genghis Khan), must grow your nation into the most prestigious one on Earth. </p>
 <p data-characters="567" data-current-count="567" data-injectable="true">There are multiple ways to accomplish this goal, such as through industrial efforts or military conquests, but you’ll also have access to your Leader of choice’s unique abilities. As Meyer put it, “They’ve got these set of traits that they share with each other and they kind of dictate a little bit of the underlying pieces of their personality and they dictate how they’re going to get along with each other… It lets us have a huge variety in the different leaders that we offer and so that playing each one of them is very different.”</p>
 <p data-characters="706" data-current-count="706" data-injectable="true">While the game is turn-based, in multiplayer everyone takes their turns simultaneously, with players’ actions resolving all at once. It sounds like this was done to keep things fair, so players aren’t getting advantages by going before everyone else, and Stone revealed that turn processing was built in Azure Cloud, meaning multiplayer matches can constantly run even if a player drops out. If that happens, the AI takes over for them. “If you want to play a game like one turn a day or one turn every 30 seconds. It doesn’t matter. You can do that. You don’t need to worry about who’s hosting—it’s like almost unlimited flexibility in terms of how you play,” said Stone.</p>
 <p data-characters="604" data-current-count="604" data-injectable="true">Even as someone who’s not usually interested in grand strategy games like <em>Ara: History Untold</em>, this all sounds fairly interesting. So, how come all this was shared several days after Xbox’s showcase and not during the event itself? I can understand not wanting to dedicate too much time on something that’s not one of the company’s bigger first-party announcements like <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/gears-of-war-prequel-e-day-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gears of War</a></em> or <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/doom-the-dark-ages-takes-doomguy-back-to-his-days-as-a-sentinel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Doom</a></em>—Xbox Game Studios is publishing the game, but it’s being developed by third-party Oxide. But Microsoft was more than happy to highlight <em>Ara</em> during January’s Xbox presentation.</p>
 <p data-characters="365" data-current-count="365" data-injectable="false">Was there not time in the otherwise packed showcase to spare for a trailer and date? Considering the gaming community’s eyes were all on the showcase, giving <em>Ara</em> some screen time could’ve potentially introduced it to new fans. Leaving new details to a blog post risks even those who’ve been waiting for the game <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ara-history-untold-reveal-trailer-oxide-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">since its 2022 reveal</a> missing them.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[So I played the weird Banana game that’s blowing up on Steam]]></title>
            <link>https://www.destructoid.com/i-played-weird-banana-game-blowing-up-on-steam/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=i-played-weird-banana-game-blowing-up-on-steam</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/so-i-played-the-weird-banana-game-that%E2%80%99s-blowing-up-on-steam.900663/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/i-played-weird-banana-game-blowing-up-on-steam/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=i-played-weird-banana-game-blowing-up-on-steam<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="426" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">One can never truly tell whether a game will become popular, or how it even does so. I imagine it’s the bane of many developers’ professional lives, moving into uncertain territory in a shaky industry that’s prone to fickle trends and hard-to-please masses. However, according to recent experience, it seems you can always make headway in the cutthroat world of gaming by appealing to fruit lovers on Steam. </p> <p data-characters="236" data-current-count="236" data-injectable="false">Released in April this year, <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2923300/Banana/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Banana</a></em> is one of those things that can come along and just give you brief pause for thought. If you haven’t heard of it, don’t worry; you probably will soon enough (this article notwithstanding).</p> <p data-characters="261" data-current-count="497" data-injectable="true">To give it the most succinct premise: <em>Banana</em> is a game about a banana. It’s not about playing as one or being embroiled in a tale about banana theft or something of that ilk. It does, however, feature a banana as its – shall we say – main protagonist.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via aaladin66/Steam.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="277" data-current-count="577" data-injectable="true">The aim of the game is to click on the yellow fruit that sits peacefully at the center of the screen. When you click your mouse, a counter will add on a number. One, it will say. Then two, as is usually dictated in these things. And so on. The more you click, the more numbers.</p>
 <p data-characters="345" data-current-count="345" data-injectable="false">That’s it. That’s what you do. You click on the banana, and it will tell you how many times you clicked it. Over 8,900 users have decreed that this game is worthy of a “Very Positive” review score. It’s also the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fourth most-played game on Steam</a> at the time of writing, ahead of <em>GTA 5</em>, <em>Destiny 2</em>, and <em>Stardew Valley</em>.</p> <p data-characters="189" data-current-count="534" data-injectable="true">Okay, what’s going on here? <em>There has to be a bit more to it than what we’re seeing on the surface</em>, thought I, so I decided to give <em>Banana</em> a go. Not for science, you understand.</p>
 <h2 id="h-i-ate-one-for-breakfast-before-writing-this-true-story" data-injectable="false">I ate one for breakfast before writing this (true story)</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via aaladin66/Steam.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="409" data-current-count="709" data-injectable="true">At the very least, the game is free, so it’s got that going for it. If, at this point, you’re even the tiniest bit intrigued about a game where you seemingly click on a digital banana endlessly, you’ll be pleased to know you don’t have to pay a penny to do so. Honestly, I think it would be a bit rich of the developers (for there are numerous) to charge money. But more on that later.</p>
 <p data-characters="484" data-current-count="484" data-injectable="true"><em>Banana</em> is as basic as a game can be. In a similar vein to past click-based releases like <em>Cookie Clicker</em>, our task is simply to press the mouse button down on-screen in order to see the counter go up. Is it fun? I wouldn’t say so. Although I must admit to getting a slight dopamine rush when I realized I could alternate left and right clicks in quick succession. Whoosh! Up went those numbers, taking me to new planes of video game ecstasy I hadn’t felt for, ooh, minutes.</p>
 <p data-characters="448" data-current-count="448" data-injectable="true">Then there was the moment I received my first achievement. I can’t honestly say what exactly I did to earn it, but within a few moments of playing, Steam pinged and up it popped: Click. That’s what the achievement is called and also how it’s described. I also realized that it’s the only achievement in the whole game, so while I’m now a <em>Banana</em> completionist, that realization did bring me crashing back down to earth.</p>
 <p data-characters="274" data-current-count="274" data-injectable="false">The point being that, on the surface, <em>Banana</em> isn’t anything more than a simple game about clicking on a potassium-rich berry. But it’s not really about the game itself. There’s something else going on here that’s causing the game to blow up on Steam.</p> <h2 id="h-what-s-the-real-story" data-injectable="false">What’s the real story?</h2> <figure data-current-count="574" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via aaladin66/Steam.</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="397" data-current-count="397" data-injectable="false">Honestly, I can’t explain it. This feels like a meme that’s somehow caught the attention of gamers and everyone’s just running with it. It’s like a gag I’m not quite in on. The fact that it should not be a success of any kind might be precisely the point. All I can tell you is what I’ve seen so far, which is a game about clicking on the aforementioned banana.</p> <p data-characters="406" data-current-count="803" data-injectable="true">But it’s got something going for it. There’s a reason it keeps smashing its concurrent player record (currently on 301,064 according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2923300/charts/#1w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SteamDB</a>). In a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/06/07/what-is-banana-the-game-where-you-click-a-banana-with-136000-players-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forbes</a> feature, they offer a theory about why it’s become as popular as it has (so far). In a nutshell: <em>Banana</em> does offer more than just making numbers go up, and it has to do with custom skins made by the community. According to Forbes:</p>
 <blockquote data-current-count="242" data-injectable="false"> <p>“Apparently you can earn skins in the game every three hours, which mostly cost 3 cents. You get 1 cent by selling them, Valve and the developer get 1 cent each. But some…sell for more. I saw a report that one sold for $400.”</p> </blockquote> <p data-characters="247" data-current-count="489" data-injectable="true">The math suggests that, in theory, the developers of <em>Banana</em> could earn a profit from players selling these skins every few hours. It could well be in the thousands at this point; enough that it could draw some unwanted attention from Steam itself.</p>
 <p data-characters="434" data-current-count="434" data-injectable="true">It feels less like a game (there’s a whole academic subsection dedicated to the discussion of what it means to even “play” a “video game”) and more like an experiment. Perhaps a prank that’s now become bigger than its original intention. <em>Banana</em> is a whole community. Seriously, check out the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1225691328998936576/1236236023382544474" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Discord channel</a>. Thousands of people are part of this clique, adding their own skins for others to obtain.</p>
 <p data-characters="301" data-current-count="301" data-injectable="false">As I look now on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/directory/category/banana-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitch.tv</a> for anyone who’s currently streaming the game (just searching for “banana” feels like an exercise in futility), I can see that five channels are playing, with just one viewer each. It’s clearly, therefore, not about any potential entertainment value.</p> <p data-characters="522" data-current-count="823" data-injectable="false">I’ll admit, I did not see the appeal (ha!) in playing <em>Banana</em>. Steam clocked me at just seven minutes before I closed the application. I don’t really know what’s going on here. It could be just a quick way to make some money, or a joke that’s gone beyond control. It could be both. It could be neither of those things. I can’t even say with confidence that it’s the weirdest game out there. It’s just an anomaly. An anomaly with zero potassium benefit. But an anomaly all the same.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/lego-horizon-adventures-switch-for-everyone-no-crossplay/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Last week during the Summer Game Awards, Sony announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/lego-horizon-adventures-annonounced-release-date-pc-ps5-summer-game-fest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lego Horizon Adventures</a>, which, surprisingly, is coming to PC, PS5, and… Nintendo&nbsp; Switch. Of course, Sony has become more open to bringing their games to PC in recent years, but launching on another competing console is still very rare for PlayStation outside of the MLB The Show series where the decision was forced by MLB.</p>
<p>In the days since the announcement of Lego Horizon Adventures, more information has emerged about the game, including Guerrilla’s logic behind putting the game on the Switch. <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2024/06/lego-horizon-adventures-is-on-nintendo-switch-because-its-a-game-for-everyone" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to Guerrilla narrative director James Windeler</a>, they wanted Lego Horizon Adventures to be “for everyone” (well, besides Xbox owners I guess). Reading between the lines, it seems Sony and Guerrilla wanted to tap into Nintendo’s family-friendly audience with the game.</p>
<p><em>"When we approached this game, we wanted to make sure that it was for everyone. That philosophy] has informed every creative decision, and bringing [Lego Horizon Adventures] to Nintendo Switch is part of that. We're trying to bring as broad an audience as possible to this game and to the franchise. And the Switch has a family-friendly audience, and it's a really good fit in order to expand."</em></p>
<p>As for what Lego Horizon Adventures will actually entail, the game is being developed by Studio Gobo (a British dev that’s mostly focused on support work for games like Hogwarts Legacy and For Honor in the past) instead of TT Games, and isn’t your typical smash ‘em up stud collect-a-thon. Instead, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-horizon-adventures-isnt-your-typical-lego-game/1100-6524180/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to a preview from GameSpot</a>, the game is essentially a blocky, kid-friendly retelling of Horizon Zero Dawn, which should run around 7 to 8 hours and features 2-player co-op.</p>
<p><a href="https://tweakers.net/reviews/12200/2/lego-horizon-adventures-leukste-game-van-het-komende-najaar-raytracing-in-een-lego-game.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dutch gaming site Tweakers</a> also provides some technical info about the PS5 version of the game, which is running on Unreal Engine 5 and offers 60fps Performance and 30fps Fidelity modes. Apparently, the game will also feature some form of ray tracing. Of course, most of this won’t apply to the Switch version of the game, which will likely be largely hidden away from prying eyes until launch.</p>
<p>Per multiple sources, one thing Lego Horizon Adventures <em>won’t</em> feature is crossplay for its online co-op. This is certainly a bit disappointing given the “we’re making this for everyone” messaging, but I suspect differences between the Switch and higher-end versions of the game may be the culprit here.</p>
<p>Lego Horizon Adventures launches on PC and PS5 on this holiday season.</p>
