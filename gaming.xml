            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It's been nearly nine years since the launch of <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nier-automata-genre-bending-every-turn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NieR: Automata</a></strong>, the highly acclaimed action RPG developed by <strong>PlatinumGames</strong> and published by <strong>Square Enix</strong>. Fans have long been waiting for news of a sequel. Today, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyn1b_5bw-M" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as part of a celebration for the game's latest sales milestone</a> (<strong>it has now sold 10 million units</strong> across all platforms), they at least got a teaser.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/HBmcEC-WIAAVpfS-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<p>It sounds like the gears are finally moving. But why did it take so long? Well, it seems like Game Director <strong>Yoko Taro</strong> and Square Enix found it hard to reach an agreement. The outspoken creative first <a href="http://wccftech.com/nier-automata-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said that a NieR: Automata sequel would be something nobody would have thought about</a>; a few months later, in March 2018, Taro <a href="https://wccftech.com/yoko-taro-thinks-hell-make-failures-next/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared the belief that his next projects would not be as successful</a>, so <strong>his goal was to make as much money as he could</strong>.</p>



<p>In April 2018,  he <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/taro-if-square-enix-gives-me-money-i-will-create-anything/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">doubled down on his previous statement</a>, <strong>calling on Square Enix to give him money if they wanted a NieR: Automata sequel</strong>: </p>



<p><em>If Square-Enix gives me money, I will create anything. So I think let Square-Enix know and I think if Square-Enix wants it, I'll do it.</em></p>



<p>However, nothing really came of it. Sure, Yoko Taro worked on the now-defunct gacha mobile <strong>Nier Reincarnation</strong> and the small-scale RPG <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/voice-of-cards-the-isle-dragon-roars-ps4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Voice of Cards: The Isle Dragon Roars</a></strong>, but beyond that, he was pretty quiet these last few years. A few months ago, he finally broke the silence to <a href="https://wccftech.com/yoko-taro-has-been-working-on-multiple-projects-they-just-kept-getting-cancelled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reveal</a> that he had actually worked on several projects, but <strong>most of them never even got released</strong>. He was fine with it since he got paid, though. Perhaps now Square Enix and Yoko Taro have finally reached a financial agreement, though fans remain skeptical and wonder if the publisher is truly referring to the long-awaited NieR: Automata sequel.</p>



<p>By the way, the publisher also announced today that <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nier-replicant-ver-1-22474487139-whats-the-square-root-of-1-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>NieR Replicant ver.1.22474487139</strong></a> has sold <strong>over 2 million units to date</strong>.</p>

            <p>Ah, it's a Friday night, time to rela-</p>
<p>Wait a minute, long-time Microsoft gaming CEO Phil Spencer's retiring, his assumed replacement and Xbox president Sarah Bond has resigned, and the suit now being tapped to take over Spenny's gig currently has the following job title: president of Microsoft’s CoreAI product. Right, guess I'm writing a news.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This shakeup was first reported by the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-retiring-sarah-bond-out-matt-booty-promoted-as-microsoft-ai-exec-asha-sharma-named-new-xbox-boss-exclusive">Ian Games Network</a>. There are big, long corporate email memos and everything.</p>
<p>According to the reports, big Phillip will step down as Microsoft Gaming CEO on Monday, February 23rd. Though, he'll be staying around in "an advisory role through the summer" to help the leadership switch go smoothly. Taking his place will be Asha Sharma, the aforementioned current president of Microsoft’s CoreAI product. With Spencer gone and Bond resigned, the third member of Microsoft's main gaming leadership trio over the past few years, Matt Booty, is getting a promotion to chief content officer and will work alongside Sharma.</p><p>"Together, Asha and Matt have the right combination of consumer product leadership and gaming depth to push our platform innovation and content pipeline forward," Microsoft big boss Satya Nadella wrote in one of those big, long corporate email memos. "Last year, Phil Spencer made the decision to retire from the company, and since then we’ve been talking about succession planning. I want to thank Phil for his extraordinary leadership and partnership. Over 38 years at Microsoft, including 12 years leading Gaming, Phil helped transform what we do and how we do it."</p>
<p>"As part of this transition, Sarah Bond has decided to leave Microsoft to begin a new chapter," Spencer added in his own email. "Sarah has been instrumental during a defining period for Xbox, shaping our platform strategy, expanding Game Pass and cloud gaming, supporting new hardware launches, and guiding some of the most significant moments in our history. I’m grateful for her partnership and the impact she’s had, and I wish her the very best in what comes next...to everyone in Microsoft Gaming, I want to say 'thank you'. I’ve learned so much from this team and community, grown alongside you, and been continually inspired by the creativity, courage, and care you bring to players, creators, and to one another every day."</p>
<p>New boss Sharma's penned an email too (told you there were many), with the former chief operating officer of grocery delivery firm Instacart and vice president at Mark Zuckerberg-helmed tech/metaverse bollocks company Meta using part of it to lay out her three-pronged vision for the future. "We must have great games beloved by players before we do anything," she wrote. "Unforgettable characters, stories that make us feel, innovative game play, and creative excellence. We will empower our studios, invest in iconic franchises, and back bold new ideas. We will take risks. We will enter new categories and markets where we can add real value, grounded in what players care about most."</p>
<p>Her second goal is to bring about a multiplatform "return of Xbox". Her third point makes for the most intriguing read out of the trio. "To meet the moment, we will invent new business models and new ways to play by leaning into what we already have: iconic teams, characters, and worlds that people love," she wrote. "But we will not treat those worlds as static IP to milk and monetise. We will build a shared platform and tools that empower developers and players to create and share their own stories.</p><p>"As monetization and AI evolve and influence this future, we will not chase short-term efficiency or flood our ecosystem with soulless AI slop. Games are and always will be art, crafted by humans, and created with the most innovative technology provided by us."</p>
<p>Now, all of that's fine to say in an overly long corporate email, but actually doing it's another thing. As it's a Friday night, I don't have any advanced throughts on this corporate shakeup beyond mourning the fact I may soon never again have an excuse to whip out this image I slapped together while at VG247, dubbed 'the three faces of Philly', and found far too funny.</p>

              <p><span>After over 20 years at Xbox, Phil Spencer, the face of the brand for more than a decade, has announced </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/phil-spencer-xbox-leaving-retirement-microsoft-2000672059"><span>he’s retiring from the company</span></a><span>. Sarah Bond, the president at Xbox, is also out and Asha Sharma, the president of Microsoft’s CoreAI product, is taking over as CEO of Microsoft Gaming.</span></p> <p><span>It sounds bleak for Microsoft’s long-struggling gaming brand, though Sharma said in her initial email to employees that her goal was not to flood the Xbox ecosystem with “soulless AI slop.” Is that the truth or just something you say to placate your workers? Only time will tell, but Microsoft has been notoriously pushing for AI integration in its workflow, so do with that information what you will.</span></p>

 <p><span>Now that Spencer is out, however, the internet is looking back on his tenure at the company, speculating about whether or not he and Bond were forced out of their leadership positions, and wondering what all this means for the future of Xbox. The forecast is not great.</span></p>     <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:5rqrieckrxohygpkhnsar5nf/app.bsky.feed.post/3mfcycdzan22d" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreiggsxageu3ctmjfpdyumw76h7klcvwfw7lyloqtnf2zlxyykeetbi"> <p lang="en">The fact that the only ms/Xbox letter mentioning Sarah Bond is Phil’s, along with the fact that she didn’t release a statement, suggests that this was all actually messy as hell, and the story is going to get out faster than leadership could plan for.

</section><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="07c5092ab7dbc"><a title="Rayman 30th Anniversary Edition" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/07c5092ab7dbc/rayman-30th-anniversary-edition.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Ubisoft</em></figcaption></figure><p>Last week's PlayStation State of Play brought us the welcome news that Rayman is <em>back</em>, thanks to the Digital Eclipse-developed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rayman_30th_anniversary_edition">Rayman: 30th Anniversary Edition</a>. And for the once-iconic platforming legends, it seems this is just the beginning.</p>
<p>Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot has told <a href="https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/ubisoft-ceo-interview-yves-guillemot-layoffs-creative-house-1236667500/">Variety</a> that Rayman, who debuted back in 1995, "is a landmark franchise for Ubisoft and holds a special place in my heart".</p>
<p>The recent Anniversary Edition is apparently just "the first step in the brand’s comeback". And Guillemot says that, with this rerelease, it's "inspiring to see players continue to embrace Rayman’s unique charm and enduring appeal".</p><div><figure data-videoid="8i2vvu-qeBQ" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8i2vvu-qeBQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt8i2vvu-qeBQ" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8i2vvu-qeBQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8i2vvu-qeBQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4c3af8gruion&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>The future seems bright for the character, then, as Guillemot states that "we're always exploring how our iconic franchises can evolve and reinvent themselves" and, with Rayman in particular, "We can’t share details today, but we’re looking forward to talking more about Rayman soon."</p>
<p>So, expect <em>some</em> kind of news in the future. What that will be, we have no idea, but we're glad to see the icon return, especially after going so quiet after the numerous ports of the outstanding <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rayman_legends_definitive_edition">Rayman: Legends</a> and his appearance in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/mario_plus_rabbids_sparks_of_hope_dlc_3_rayman_in_the_phantom_show">Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope DLC</a>.</p>
<p>As for the now, Rayman: 30th Anniversary Edition is centre stage, and this digital museum includes playable versions of the PlayStation, Atari Jaguar, MS-DOS, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance releases of the original, extra levels from Rayman Designer, Rayman 60 Levels, and Rayman By His Fans, and a playable prototype of the cancelled SNES release.</p>

<p>Some early impressions haven't been too kind to the game, with reports of bugs and a "reimagined" soundtrack that fans say is inferior to the PS original. Apparently Ubisoft is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/ubisoft-reportedly-aware-of-rayman-30th-anniversary-edition-ost-requests">looking into a way of allowing players to swap between the old and new music</a>, so stay tuned.</p>
<p>The full Variety interview (linked up top and below) also covers some of the recent controversies surrounding the French video game publisher and developer, including the cancellation of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/ubisoft-cancels-6-games-in-major-organisation-restructure">six major projects</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/ubisoft-staff-push-back-against-company-restructure-with-three-day-strike">strike action across the company</a> in the wake of mass company layoffs and restructuring.</p>
<p>While the Assassin's Creed franchise <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/assassins-creed-has-overperformed-this-quarter-says-ubisoft">apparently "overperformed" last quarter</a>, Ubisoft is very much under the microscope in the industry after a tumultuous few years. Whether Rayman can weather the storm remains to be seen.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Valve is “Clearly Not” Cooperating Fairly, Says CEO Leading £656M Lawsuit Against Steam’s 30% Cut of Game Sales]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/valve-is-clearly-not-cooperating-fairly-says-ceo-leading-656m-lawsuit-against-steams-30-cut-of-game-sales/</link>
            <guid>1442314</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Last month, a <strong>UK judge</strong> ruled that <strong>Valve </strong>would have to face its day in court over a <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-operator-valve-faces-a-656m-class-action-lawsuit-over-its-excessive-30-cut-of-all-steam-sales/">£656 million class-action lawsuit</a></strong> being led by <strong>Parent Zone</strong> chief executive officer, <strong>Vicki Shotbolt</strong>, over the <strong>30% cut</strong> that the company takes from all transactions on <strong>Steam</strong>.</p>



<p>It's not a dissimilar case to what <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/epic-v-apple/"><strong>Epic Games</strong> brought against <strong>Apple</strong></a>, as Shotbolt has called Valve's 30% cut "<em>excessive</em>" and that the company "<em></em><em>is rigging the market and taking advantage of UK gamers</em>." In a new report from <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/it-needs-to-cooperate-fairly-and-its-clearly-not-why-valve-is-facing-a-656m-day-in-the-uk-courts">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>, Shotbolt further explained her case against Valve and Steam, adding that Valve is "<em>clearly not</em>" cooperating fairly in the video games market.</p>



<p>"<em>It's about how you use digital in positive ways, and how you unlock, enjoy, and embrace opportunity</em>," said Shotbolt. "<em>Games are such a vital part of that ecosystem. It's an important industry. It's important for young people who enjoy it and play in it. It's important for the adults who have spent an enormous amount of time socialising, playing games, and so on.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Games is a really important sector, and therefore it needs to operate fairly and not overcharge, fundamentally. Steam is a big and important platform for a big and important ecosystem – <strong>it needs to cooperate fairly, and it's clearly not.</strong></em>"</p>



<p>While Shotbolt hopes that a win will provide a more balanced industry for developers and players across the world, she also admits that elements like developers lowering their prices because Steam is no longer taking as big of a cut is not guaranteed. "<em>That is out of my control</em>," Shotbolt adds. "<em>You can put a stake in the ground and say developers should not be being charged that 30% - that it is too high and not a reasonable amount of money. What you'd hope would happen is that some developers will bring their prices down, and they'll pass that on to the consumer. I believe it will happen, because that's how markets look. But it can only happen if that price parity obligation also goes away."</em></p>



<p>"<em>Of course, it's possible that developers would get together and make greater profits from their games. But one would hope a market would respond by saying it's in my interest to cut my price now and pass that on to the customer</em>."</p>



<p>We can hope that prices will go down, but Shotbolt has to win her case first. And decreasing prices aren't the only outcome Shotbolt hopes for if she wins. The ultimate goal, it would seem, is to see Valve not dominate the market and to see developers have more than one viable option for where to sell their games.</p>



<p>"<em>If you want to develop a PC game, you want it on Steam. It's not like developers have ten options</em>," Shotbolt said. "<em>That's what makes the case, I think, so important, because Steam has had market dominance for a long, long time, and it shouldn't be exploiting that.</em>"</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>A new report from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-retiring-sarah-bond-out-matt-booty-promoted-as-microsoft-ai-exec-asha-sharma-named-new-xbox-boss-exclusive">IGN</a> reveals that <strong>Microsoft's</strong> gaming division and <strong>Xbox</strong> are going through a <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2026/02/20/asha-sharma-named-evp-and-ceo-microsoft-gaming/">major leadership shake-up</a>. <strong>Phil Spencer</strong> <strong>will retire this coming Monday, February 23, 2026</strong>, after first joining Microsoft all the way back in 1988 as an intern. He's not the only one departing: <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-president-says-game-exclusives-are-antiquated/">Sarah Bond</a></strong>, current president of Xbox at Microsoft, is now the <strong>former president</strong> of Xbox at Microsoft, as she will <strong>resign</strong> from her role. Lastly, Microsoft's current president of its CoreAI division, <strong>Asha Sharma</strong>, will take Spencer's place as the new chief executive officer of Microsoft Gaming.</p>



<p>Back in July 2025, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/phil-spencer-retire-following-next-gen-xbox-launch/">reported on a rumour that Phil Spencer would retire</a> with the arrival of the next-generation Xbox console. That rumour was denied by Microsoft at the time, claiming that Spencer was not going to retire <strong>"<em>anytime soon</em>."</strong> At the same time, we still pointed out that Spencer was 57 at the time of the report, and that he had been with Microsoft for nearly 40 years. To say Spencer was due to retire soon was not the most prescient call to make at the time, and it seems that was indeed the case. </p>



<p>"<em>I want to thank Phil for his extraordinary leadership and partnership,</em>" said Microsoft's chief executive officer, <strong>Satya Nadella</strong>. "<em>Over 38 years at Microsoft, including 12 years leading Gaming, Phil helped transform what we do and how we do it.</em>"</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It’s rare in life to know when a chapter is closing, but after 38&nbsp;years at Microsoft, that moment has arrived for me. I’ve made the decision to retire and begin the next chapter of my life. It’s a milestone that’s given me a chance to reflect on the incredible journey I’ve been…</p>— Phil Spencer (@XboxP3) <a href="https://twitter.com/XboxP3/status/2024951211129254314?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 20, 2026</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Spencer, for his part, added that, "<em>Last fall, I shared with Satya that I was thinking about stepping back and starting the next chapter of my life. From that moment, we aligned on approaching this transition with intention, ensuring stability, and strengthening the foundation we've built. Xbox has always been more than a business. It's a vibrant community of players, creators, and teams who care deeply about what we build and how we build it. And it deserves a thoughtful, deliberate plan for the road ahead</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>Today marks an exciting new chapter for Microsoft Gaming as Asha Sharma steps into the role of CEO, and I want to be the first to welcome her to this incredible team. Working with her over the past several months has given me tremendous confidence. She brings genuine curiosity, clarity and a deep commitment to understanding players, creators, and the decisions that shape our future. We know this is an important moment for our fans, partners, and team, and we're committed to getting it right. I'll remain in an advisory role through the summer to support a smooth handoff.</em>"</p>



<p>Also part of this shake-up is <strong>Matt Booty</strong>, who will take over from Asha Sharma as the new chief executive officer of CoreAI at Microsoft. "<em>Looking forward, I'm excited to partner with Asha as our next CEO,</em>" said Booty. "<em>Our first conversations centred on her commitment to making great games and the role that plays in our overall success</em>."</p>



<p>Sharma, for her part, began her address to Microsoft's gaming staff by saying she feels "<em>two things at once: humility and urgency</em>." </p>



<p>"<em>Humility because this team has built something extraordinary over decades. Urgency because gaming is in a period of rapid change, and we need to move with clarity and conviction. I am stepping into work shaped by generations of artists, engineers, designers, writers, musicians, operators and more who create worlds that have brought joy and deep personal meaning to hundreds of millions of players. The level of craft here is exceptional, and it is amplified by Xbox, which was founded in the belief that the power of games connect people and push the industry forward. Thank you to Phil for his leadership, and to every studio, platform, and operations team that built this foundation. We are stewards of some of the most loved stories and characters in entertainment and bring players and creators together around the fun and community of gaming in entirely new ways.</em>"</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Sharma added that her first job is to "<em>understand what makes this work and protect it</em>," which doesn't exactly inspire a whole lot of confidence, and speaks to her lack of experience within the video game industry. Before she joined Microsoft in 2024, she was a vice president of product and engineering at <strong>Meta</strong>.</p>



<p>That said, her next statement was that her understanding begins with three commitments, the first of which is: "<em><strong>great games</strong></em><strong>."</strong></p>



<p>"<em>Everything begins here,</em>" she adds. "<em><strong>We must have great games beloved by players before we do anything.</strong></em><strong>"</strong> It's exactly what players want to hear, and is exactly the opposite of what players once heard from Spencer in a now-infamous quote.</p>



<p>Sharma continues to say her second commitment is "<em>the return of Xbox</em>," and that the company will "<em>recommit to our core Xbox fans and players, those players who have invested with us for the past 25 years, and to the developers who build the expansive universes and experiences that are embraced by players across the world</em>."</p>



<p>This may sound like Xbox could pivot away from its current trajectory of centring its services over its hardware, <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-will-reportedly-be-best-of-both-worlds-between-pc-and-console/">but with how far along that plan is, </a>it feels unlikely for the next Xbox console to usher in the platform's return to households. </p>



<p>Lastly, her third commitment is "<em>future of play</em>," which, unsurprisingly, is where Sharma mentions how <strong>AI</strong> and monetization are continuing to evolve, but she does claim that "<em>we will not chase <strong>short-term efficiency or flood our ecosystem with soulless AI slop</strong></em><strong>."</strong> Strong words that players will be sure to remember, and remind Sharma of, if we ever see something from Microsoft stray from that commitment.</p>



<p>Ultimately, this is the end of an era for Xbox. There's a lot that players will remember Spencer and Bond for, not all of it positive, and we're entering a new chapter for the Xbox platform and Microsoft's time in the video game industry.</p>



<p>Interestingly, the only one we haven't heard from yet is Sarah Bond, who does not have a statement included in the report, nor has she made a statement on her social media accounts.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The longest-serving head of Xbox <a href="https://kotaku.com/phil-spencer-xbox-leaving-retirement-microsoft-2000672059">is retiring ahead of the brand’s 25th anniversary</a>. Phil Spencer joined Microsoft as an intern and rose to be the CEO of one of its most popular divisions. Maybe its <em>only</em> popular division.</p> <p>Announcing his retirement the same year <em>Halo</em> is set to make its <a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-1-remake-combat-evolved-trailer-hwc-teaser-xbox-ps5-2000638911">debut on PlayStation</a> as part of Microsoft’s new multiplatform publishing strategy, Spencer briefly reflected on his time at the company, what comes next for Xbox, and his gratitude for those who helped it get to where it currently is. Here’s the <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/2024944789872050298">memo he sent to staff today</a> amid an executive shuffle that will have huge repercussions for the biggest gaming publisher in the country:</p> <blockquote><p>When I walked through Microsoft’s doors as an intern in June of 1988, I could never have imagined the products I’d help build, the players and customers we’d serve, or the extraordinary teams I’d be lucky enough to join. It’s been an epic ride and truly the privilege of a lifetime.</p> <p>Last fall, I shared with Satya that I was thinking about stepping back and starting the next chapter of my life. From that moment, we aligned on approaching this transition with intention, ensuring stability, and strengthening the foundation we’ve built. Xbox has always been more than a business. It’s a vibrant community of players, creators, and teams who care deeply about what we build and how we build it. And it deserves a thoughtful, deliberate plan for the road ahead.</p> <p>Today marks an exciting new chapter for Microsoft Gaming as Asha Sharma steps into the role of CEO, and I want to be the first to welcome her to this incredible team. Working with her over the past several months has given me tremendous confidence. She brings genuine curiosity, clarity and a deep commitment to understanding players, creators, and the decisions that shape our future. We know this is an important moment for our fans, partners, and team, and we’re committed to getting it right. I’ll remain in an advisory role through the summer to support a smooth handoff.</p> <p>I’m also grateful for the strength of our studios organization. Matt Booty and our studios teams continue to build an incredible portfolio, and I have full confidence in the leadership and creative momentum across our global studios. I want to congratulate Matt on his promotion to EVP and Chief Content Officer.</p> <p>As part of this transition, Sarah Bond has decided to leave Microsoft to begin a new chapter. Sarah has been instrumental during a defining period for Xbox, shaping our platform strategy, expanding Game Pass and cloud gaming, supporting new hardware launches, and guiding some of the most significant moments in our history. I’m grateful for her partnership and the impact she’s had, and I wish her the very best in what comes next.</p> <p>Most of all, to everyone in Microsoft Gaming, I want to say “thank you”. I’ve learned so much from this team and community, grown alongside you, and been continually inspired by the creativity, courage, and care you bring to players, creators, and to one another every day.</p> <p>I’m incredibly proud of what we’ve built together over the last 25 years, and I have complete confidence in all of you and in the opportunities ahead. I’ll be cheering you on in this next chapter as Xbox’s proudest fan and player.</p> <p>Phil</p> <p>XBL: P3</p> </blockquote> <p>Spencer worked tirelessly to salvage Xbox’s reputation after a disastrous launch rollout for the Xbox One. The strategy included trying to nab big exclusives and eventually going on the biggest studio acquisition spree the industry has ever seen. The result was an Xbox Series X/S platform that had great features and, eventually, great games, but which struggled to keep pace with rival console platforms. The end of Spencer’s tenure saw the Xbox division acquire Activision Blizzard and continue to grow Game Pass into a defining service for the ecosystem and beyond it on PC.</p>

 <p>What happens to Xbox next is anyone’s guess. Spencer’s legacy as the longest steward of the brand will take time to settle into place. Many considered him the last bulwark against Microsoft’s AI-fueled upending of the brand. Things were never going to stay the same, but they might start changing even faster than anyone dared expect.</p>

<p>In an internal memo, Matt Booty, now Microsoft’s chief content officer and EVP of Microsoft Gaming, noted that his primary focus is on supporting the staff in place and helping them achieve their best work. He also reassured that there are no planned restructurings at this time.</p>



<p>“My focus is on supporting the teams and leaders we have in place and creating the conditions for them to do their best work.

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/882326/read-microsoft-gaming-ceo-asha-sharma-first-memo</link>
            <guid>1442278</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microsoft gaming boss Phil Spencer has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/882241/microsoft-phil-spencer-xbox-leaving-retirement">just announced he’s leaving the company</a> after 12 years leading Xbox and nearly 40 at Microsoft in total. His replacement: Asha Sharma, formerly <a href="https://ignite.microsoft.com/en-US/speakers/5e943e22-f2b6-4443-b8b0-55749176a169">head of development for Microsoft’s AI enterprise teams</a>. Before that, she was COO of Instacart for three years, and spent four at Meta in charge of the company’s messaging apps.</p></div><p>What will Sharma do with Xbox? Read for yourself in her first internal memo, which we’ve printed in full below.</p><p>Sharma says she is committed to “the return of Xbox,” games in “new categories and markets where we can add real value, grounded in what players care about most,” and that games will “always will be art, crafted by humans” while promising not to “flood our ecosystem with soulless AI slop.”</p><p>However, she also says that “monetization and AI will evolve and influence this future,” and it sounds like Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24073286/xbox-console-exclusivity-hardware-update-game-pass">will still pursue Xbox Everywhere</a> — she isn’t returning to the definition of Xbox as a physical box alone. While she does promise “a renewed commitment to Xbox starting with console,” she writes that Xbox will “expand across PC, mobile, and cloud” as well.</p><div><blockquote><p>Dear team,</p><p>Today I begin my role as CEO of Microsoft Gaming.</p><p>I feel two things at once: humility and urgency.</p><p>Humility because this team has built something extraordinary over decades. Urgency because gaming is in a period of rapid change, and we need to move with clarity and conviction.</p><p>I am stepping into work shaped by generations of artists, engineers, designers, writers, musicians, operators and more who create worlds that have brought joy and deep personal meaning to hundreds of millions of players. The level of craft here is exceptional, and it is amplified by Xbox, which was founded in the belief that the power of games connect people and push the industry forward.</p><p>Thank you to Phil for his leadership, and to every studio, platform, and operations team that built this foundation. We are stewards of some of the most loved stories and characters in entertainment and bring players and creators together around the fun and community of gaming in entirely new ways.<br>My first job is simple: understand what makes this work and protect it.</p><p>That starts with three commitments.</p><p>First, great games.</p><p>Everything begins here. We must have great games beloved by players before we do anything. Unforgettable characters, stories that make us feel, innovative game play, and creative excellence. We will empower our studios, invest in iconic franchises, and back bold new ideas. We will take risks. We will enter new categories and markets where we can add real value, grounded in what players care about most.<br>I promoted Matt Booty in honor of this commitment. He understands the craft and the challenges of building great games, has led teams that deliver award-winning work, and has earned the trust of game developers across the industry.</p><p>Second, the return of Xbox.</p><p>We will recommit to our core Xbox fans and players, those who have invested with us for the past 25 years, and to the developers who build the expansive universes and experiences that are embraced by players across the world.</p><p>We will celebrate our roots with a renewed commitment to Xbox starting with console which has shaped who we are. It connects us to the players and fans who invest in Xbox, and to the developers who build ambitious experiences for it.</p><p>Gaming now lives across devices, not within the limits of any single piece of hardware. As we expand across PC, mobile, and cloud, Xbox should feel seamless, instant, and worthy of the communities we serve. We will break down barriers so developers can build once and reach players everywhere without compromise.</p><p>Third, future of play.</p><p>We are witnessing the reinvention of play.</p><p>To meet the moment, we will invent new business models and new ways to play by leaning into what we already have: iconic teams, characters, and worlds that people love. But we will not treat those worlds as static IP to milk and monetize. We will build a shared platform and tools that empower developers and players to create and share their own stories.</p><p>As monetization and AI evolve and influence this future, we will not chase short-term efficiency or flood our ecosystem with soulless AI slop. Games are and always will be art, crafted by humans, and created with the most innovative technology provided by us.</p><p>The next 25 years belong to the teams who dare to build something surprising, something no one else is willing to try, and have the patience to see it through. We have done this before, and I am here to help us do it again. I want to return to the renegade spirit that built Xbox in the first place. It will require us to relentlessly question everything, revisit processes, protect what works, and be brave enough to change what does not.</p><p>Thank you for welcoming me into this journey.</p><p>Asha</p></blockquote></div><p>And here’s the full memo from Matt Booty, who is now Microsoft’s chief content officer and EVP of Microsoft Gaming:</p><div><blockquote><p>I read Phil’s note with much gratitude. He has been a steady champion for game creators and our studio teams, and I’ve learned so much from his leadership over the years. All our games have benefited from his foundational support. I’m also grateful to Satya for his ongoing commitment to gaming and holding a vision of how it can connect back to the larger company.</p><p>Looking forward, I’m excited to partner with Asha as our next CEO. Our first conversations centered on her commitment to making great games and the role that plays in our overall success. She asks questions, pushes for clarity, and wants our choices grounded in player and developer needs. That mindset matters as the industry around us is changing quickly: how players engage, how games are made, and how business models and platforms evolve.</p><p>We have good reasons to believe in what’s ahead. This organization and its franchises have navigated change for decades, and our strength comes from teams who know how to adapt and keep delivering. That confidence is grounded in a strong pipeline of established franchises, new bets we believe in, and clear player demand for what we are building.</p><p>My focus is on supporting the teams and leaders we have in place and creating the conditions for them to do their best work. To be clear, there are no organizational changes underway for our studios.</p><p>Thanks for everything you do for players and for each other.</p><p>-Matt</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/882326/read-microsoft-gaming-ceo-asha-sharma-first-memo]]></content:encoded>

Asha Sharma, currently the president of CoreAI product at Microsoft, is stepping into the Microsoft Gaming CEO role, reporting directly to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella.</p><p>Here’s Phil Spencer’s full memo on his retirement:</p><div><blockquote><p>When I walked through Microsoft’s doors as an intern in June of 1988, I could never have imagined the products I’d help build, the players and customers we’d serve, or the extraordinary teams I’d be lucky enough to join. It’s been an epic ride and truly the privilege of a lifetime.</p><p>Last fall, I shared with Satya that I was thinking about stepping back and starting the next chapter of my life. From that moment, we aligned on approaching this transition with intention, ensuring stability, and strengthening the foundation we’ve built. Xbox has always been more than a business.

And it deserves a thoughtful, deliberate plan for the road ahead.</p><p>Today marks an exciting new chapter for Microsoft Gaming as Asha Sharma steps into the role of CEO, and I want to be the first to welcome her to this incredible team.Working with her over the past several months has given me tremendous confidence. She brings genuine curiosity, clarity and a deep commitment to understanding players, creators, and the decisions that shape our future. We know this is an important moment for our fans, partners, and team, and we’re committed to getting it right. I’ll remain in an advisory role through the summer to support a smooth handoff.</p><p>I’m also grateful for the strength of our studios organization. Matt Booty and our studios teams continue to build an incredible portfolio, and I have full confidence in the leadership and creative momentum across our global studios. I want to congratulate Matt on his promotion to EVP and Chief Content Officer.</p><p>As part of this transition, Sarah Bond has decided to leave Microsoft to begin a new chapter. Sarah has been instrumental during a defining period for Xbox, shaping our platform strategy, expanding Game Pass and cloud gaming, supporting new hardware launches, and guiding some of the most significant moments in our history. I’m grateful for her partnership and the impact she’s had, and I wish her the very best in what comes next.</p><p>Most of all, to everyone in Microsoft Gaming, I want to say “thank you”. I’ve learned so much from this team and community, grown alongside you, and been continually inspired by the creativity, courage, and care you bring to players, creators, and to one another every day.</p><p>I’m incredibly proud of what we’ve built together over the last 25 years, and I have complete confidence in all of you and in the opportunities ahead. I’ll be cheering you on in this next chapter as Xbox’s proudest fan and player.</p><p>Phil</p><p>XBL: P3</p></blockquote></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/882340/xbox-phil-spencer-microsoft-retirement-memo]]></content:encoded>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/phil-spencer-xbox-leaving-retirement-microsoft-2000672059">Xbox boss Phil Spencer is retiring after 12 years</a> leading Microsoft’s gaming division. His replacement is Asha Sharma, the president of Microsoft’s CoreAI Product division. And in the new Xbox head’s first memo, she promises to avoid AI slop, but makes it clear that AI will be a part of the brand’s future.</p> <p>On February 20, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-retiring-sarah-bond-out-matt-booty-promoted-as-microsoft-ai-exec-asha-sharma-named-new-xbox-boss-exclusive?utm_source=bluesky,threads,twitter">as reported by <em>IGN</em></a>, Spencer is stepping down from his role as CEO of Microsoft Gaming after over a decade leading Xbox. While many assumed his replacement would be Sarah Bond, the president of Xbox, that wasn’t the case. Bond is also leaving Xbox alongside Spencer. Instead, <a href="https://ignite.microsoft.com/en-US/speakers/5e943e22-f2b6-4443-b8b0-55749176a169">Sharma</a> has been chosen to lead the Xbox division, and in her first memo to the company, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/882326/read-microsoft-gaming-ceo-asha-sharma-first-memo">obtained by </a><em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/882326/read-microsoft-gaming-ceo-asha-sharma-first-memo">The Verge</a> </em>and <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2026/02/20/asha-sharma-named-evp-and-ceo-microsoft-gaming/">later shared by Xbox</a><em>,</em> the former head of AI at Microsoft promised “the return of Xbox” and claimed she would avoid flooding Xbox with AI slop, <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-ai-copilot-minecraft-overwatch-insider-microsoft-1851769746">but that it would “evolve” and be a part of Xbox’s “future.</a>”</p>

 <p>“As monetization and AI evolve and influence this future, we will not chase short-term efficiency or flood our ecosystem with soulless AI slop,” said Sharma. “Games are and always will be art, crafted by humans, and created with the most innovative technology provided by us.”</p> <p>The new Xbox boss also promised that more great games were coming.</p> <p>“We must have great games beloved by players before we do anything,” said Sharma. “Unforgettable characters, stories that make us feel, innovative gameplay, and creative excellence. We will empower our studios, invest in iconic franchises, and back bold new ideas. We will take risks. We will enter new categories and markets where we can add real value, grounded in what players care about most.”</p>

 <h2>New Xbox boss committed to the console side of the business, but…</h2> <p>As for future consoles, something Xbox has previously confirmed and teased, Sharma says the company will “celebrate” its fans and history with a “renewed commitment to Xbox starting with console.” The new boss made it clear, however, that Xbox isn’t going back to being simply a console and the brand will continue to expand to more platforms, like mobile and streaming.</p>

 <p>“Gaming now lives across devices, not within the limits of any single piece of hardware,” said Sharma. “As we expand across PC, mobile, and cloud, Xbox should feel seamless, instant, and worthy of the communities we serve. We will break down barriers so developers can build once and reach players everywhere without compromise.”</p> <p>Sharma’s memo walks a tightrope. She is trying to convince the hardcore Xbox gamers out there that she can be trusted to avoid AI slop, despite her history of working with AI, and that she’s committed to bringing the brand back to its Xbox 360 glory days while <em>also</em> signaling to executives and investors that AI will be part of Xbox’s growing future across non-Xbox devices. Tricky rope to walk, and while I think her memo is solid, the key will be what actually happens over the next few months and years.</p>

 <p>Is this a new era for Xbox, or are we seeing the first signs that Xbox is truly dead and about to be consumed by Microsoft?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In major breaking news on Friday, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has announced that Micorosft Gaming CEO and head of Xbox Phil Spencer is retiring from the company. </p>



<p>In addition, Xbox President Sarah Bond has resigned.</p>







<p>First reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-retiring-sarah-bond-out-matt-booty-promoted-as-microsoft-ai-exec-asha-sharma-named-new-xbox-boss-exclusive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Spencer’s retirement will be effective as of Monday, February 23.  He leaves after spending 38 years with the company.</p>



<p><strong>“I want to thank Phil for his extraordinary leadership and partnership,”</strong> Nadella said via email to Microsoft and Xbox staff. <strong>“Over 38 years at Microsoft, including 12 years leading Gaming, Phil helped transform what we do and how we do it. He expanded our reach across PC, mobile, and cloud; nearly tripled the size of the business; helped shape our strategy through the acquisitions of Activision Blizzard, ZeniMax, and Minecraft; and strengthened our culture across our studios and platforms.”</strong></p>







<p>Spencer, in his memo to staff, <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/phil-spencer-retiring-from-xbox-microsoft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said that he made</a> it known last year that he was <strong>“thinking about stepping back and starting the next chapter of my life.”</strong></p>



<p><strong>“From that moment, we aligned on approaching this transition with intention, ensuring stability, and strengthening the foundation we’ve built,”</strong> he said. <strong>“Xbox has always been more than a business. It’s a vibrant community of players, creators, and teams who care deeply about what we build and how we build it. And it deserves a thoughtful, deliberate plan for the road ahead.”</strong></p>



<p>Taking over as head of gaming for Microsoft is Asha Sharma. Sharma had previously been the head of CoreAI at Microsoft after joining the company in 2024. Matt Booty, who will remain with Xbox, is moving up to chief content officer.</p>



<p>In his first message to Xbox staff, Sharma said that they won’t flood the market with “soulless AI slop”.</p>



<p><strong>“To meet the moment, we will invent new business models and new ways to play by leaning into what we already have: iconic teams, characters, and worlds that people love,” </strong>he wrote. <strong>“But we will not treat those worlds as static IP to milk and monetize. We will build a shared platform and tools that empower developers and players to create and share their own stories.</strong></p>



<p><strong>“As monetization and AI evolve and influence this future, we will not chase short-term efficiency or flood our ecosystem with soulless AI slop. Games are and always will be art, crafted by humans, and created with the most innovative technology provided by us.”</strong></p>

            <guid>1442251</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Roy Lee, the producer of the upcoming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/bioshock/" id="1100">BioShock </a>movie, has provided an update on the forthcoming Netflix film and hopes that it will tie into an upcoming game release.</p>



<p>The announcement of Netflix taking on a BioShock adaptation first came in 2022. 4 years later, there is an explanation for why the project has been dormant and when things could actually start progressing toward production.</p>







<h2 id="h-other-projects-took-precedence-over-bioshock">Other Projects Took Precedence Over BioShock</h2>



<p><a href="https://collider.com/bioshock-movie-production-update-netflix-roy-lee-francis-lawrence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">In an interview with Collider’s</a> Steve Weintraub, Lee stated that production would have begun sooner, but other projects, including The Long Walk and a Hunger Games prequel, got in the way. However, he says the project could tentatively be next up for him, and that both Netflix and Take-Two are hopeful the movie will come out and tie into a future game release.</p>



<p>“I know that Netflix and Take-Two are very anxious to see the movie come out because they want to have the release coincide with some of the potential new incarnations of the game.”</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/bioshock-4/" id="702">fourth BioShock game</a> was announced in 2019. Last year, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick promised the game would release.</p>



<p>Lee didn’t want to fully commit to a date for when production could begin. Still, he says he’s hopeful things will get started in 2027.</p>



<p>“I know that the intent is to hopefully get in production next year,” he said.</p>







<h2>Video Game Adaptations Are Plentiful on Streaming Platforms</h2>



<p>Netflix saw success with video game series related to Sonic the Hedgehog, Tomb Raider, Castlevania, Devil May Cry, and more. Over on Amazon Prime Video, the Fallout television series has been successful. They are currently working on a God of War series, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ryan-hurst-comments-on-playing-kratos-in-prime-videos-god-of-war/" id="170361">with Ryan Hurst tapped to play Kratos.</a></p>



<p>Netflix is also the exclusive streaming partner of the upcoming Legend of Zelda film, following its theatrical release next year. Learn more about that at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/legend-of-zelda-live-action-movie-will-stream-exclusively-on-netflix-after-theatrical-release/" id="170419">this link.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer will retire effective February 23, and <a title="Platforms > Xbox [27,547 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox">Xbox</a> president and chief operating officer Sarah Bond has resigned, according to emails sent to Microsoft staff today (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-retiring-sarah-bond-out-matt-booty-promoted-as-microsoft-ai-exec-asha-sharma-named-new-xbox-boss-exclusive" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IGN</a>). Asha Sharma, currently president of Microsoft’s CoreAI product, will take over as Microsoft Gaming CEO, and current <a title="Companies > Xbox Game Studios [964 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/xbox-game-studios">Xbox Game Studios</a> head Matt Booty will be promoted to executive vice president and chief content officer. <span id="more-1028287"></span></p><p>“I want to thank Phil for his extraordinary leadership and partnership,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in an email sent to Microsoft staff. “Over 38 years at Microsoft, including 12 years leading Gaming, Phil helped transform what we do and how we do it.”</p><div><p><strong>Satya Nadella, Microsoft CEO</strong></p><p>Gaming has been part of Microsoft from the start. Flight Simulator shipped before Windows, and you can practically ray‑trace a line from DirectX in the ’90s to the accelerated‑compute era we’re in today.</p><p>As we celebrate Xbox’s 25th year, the opportunity and innovation agenda in front of us is expansive. Today we reach over 500 million monthly active users, are a top publisher across all platforms, and continue to innovate across gaming hardware, content and community, in service of creators and players everywhere.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>I am long on gaming and its role at the center of our consumer ambition, and as we look ahead, I’m excited to share that Asha Sharma will become Executive Vice President and CEO, Microsoft Gaming, reporting to me. Over the last two years at Microsoft, and previously as Chief Operating Officer at Instacart and a Vice President at <a title="Platforms > Meta [166 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/meta">Meta</a>, Asha has helped build and scale services that reach billions of people and support thriving consumer and developer ecosystems. She brings deep experience building and growing platforms, aligning business models to long-term value, and operating at global scale, which will be critical in leading our gaming business into its next era of growth.</p><p>Matt Booty will become Executive Vice President and Chief Content Officer, reporting to Asha. Matt’s career reflects a lifelong commitment to games and to the people who make them. Under his leadership, Microsoft Gaming has grown to span nearly 40 studios across Xbox, Bethesda, <a title="Companies > Activision [73 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/activision">Activision</a> <a title="Companies > Blizzard Entertainment [156 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/blizzard-entertainment">Blizzard</a>, and King, which are home to beloved franchises including <em>Halo</em>, <em>The Elder Scrolls</em>, <em>Call of Duty</em>, <em>World of Warcraft</em>, <em>Diablo</em>, <em>Candy Crush</em>, and <em>Fallout</em>.</p><p>Together, Asha and Matt have the right combination of consumer product leadership and gaming depth to push our platform innovation and content pipeline forward. Last year, Phil Spencer made the decision to retire from the company, and since then we’ve been talking about succession planning. I want to thank Phil for his extraordinary leadership and partnership. Over 38 years at Microsoft, including 12 years leading Gaming, Phil helped transform what we do and how we do it. He expanded our reach across <a title="Platforms > PC [25,570 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a>, mobile, and cloud; nearly tripled the size of the business; helped shape our strategy through the acquisitions of Activision Blizzard, ZeniMax, and <em>Minecraft</em>; and strengthened our culture across our studios and platforms. I’ve long admired Phil’s unwavering commitment to players, creators, and his team, and I am personally grateful for his leadership and counsel. He will continue working closely with Asha to ensure a smooth transition.</p><p>We have extraordinary creative talent across our studios and a global platform that is second to none. I’m excited for how we will capture the opportunity ahead and define what comes next, while staying grounded in what players and creators value.</p><p>Please join me in congratulating Asha and Matt on their new roles, and in thanking Phil for everything he has done for Microsoft and for our industry.</p><p><strong>Phil Spencer, Retiring Microsoft Gaming CEO</strong></p><p>Subject: A New Chapter for Microsoft Gaming</p><p>When I walked through Microsoft’s doors as an intern in June of 1988, I could never have imagined the products I’d help build, the players and customers we’d serve, or the extraordinary teams I’d be lucky enough to join. It’s been an epic ride and truly the privilege of a lifetime.</p><p>Last fall, I shared with Satya that I was thinking about stepping back and starting the next chapter of my life. From that moment, we aligned on approaching this transition with intention, ensuring stability, and strengthening the foundation we’ve built. Xbox has always been more than a business. It’s a vibrant community of players, creators, and teams who care deeply about what we build and how we build it. And it deserves a thoughtful, deliberate plan for the road ahead.</p><p>Today marks an exciting new chapter for Microsoft Gaming as Asha Sharma steps into the role of CEO, and I want to be the first to welcome her to this incredible team. Working with her over the past several months has given me tremendous confidence. She brings genuine curiosity, clarity and a deep commitment to understanding players, creators, and the decisions that shape our future. We know this is an important moment for our fans, partners, and team, and we’re committed to getting it right. I’ll remain in an advisory role through the summer to support a smooth handoff.</p><p>I’m also grateful for the strength of our studios organization. Matt Booty and our studios teams continue to build an incredible portfolio, and I have full confidence in the leadership and creative momentum across our global studios. I want to congratulate Matt on his promotion to EVP and Chief Content Officer.</p><p>As part of this transition, Sarah Bond has decided to leave Microsoft to begin a new chapter. Sarah has been instrumental during a defining period for Xbox, shaping our platform strategy, expanding Game Pass and cloud gaming, supporting new hardware launches, and guiding some of the most significant moments in our history. I’m grateful for her partnership and the impact she’s had, and I wish her the very best in what comes next.</p><p>Most of all, to everyone in Microsoft Gaming, I want to say “thank you”. I’ve learned so much from this team and community, grown alongside you, and been continually inspired by the creativity, courage, and care you bring to players, creators, and to one another every day.</p><p>I’m incredibly proud of what we’ve built together over the last 25 years, and I have complete confidence in all of you and in the opportunities ahead. I’ll be cheering you on in this next chapter as Xbox’s proudest fan and player.</p><p>—Phil</p><p>XBL: P3</p><p><strong>Asha Sharma, New Microsoft Gaming CEO</strong></p><p>Dear team,</p><p>Today I begin my role as CEO of Microsoft Gaming.</p><p>I feel two things at once: humility and urgency.</p><p>Humility because this team has built something extraordinary over decades. Urgency because gaming is in a period of rapid change, and we need to move with clarity and conviction.</p><p>I am stepping into work shaped by generations of artists, engineers, designers, writers, musicians, operators and more who create worlds that have brought joy and deep personal meaning to hundreds of millions of players. The level of craft here is exceptional, and it is amplified by Xbox, which was founded in the belief that the power of games connect people and push the industry forward.</p><p>Thank you to Phil for his leadership, and to every studio, platform, and operations team that built this foundation. We are stewards of some of the most loved stories and characters in entertainment and bring players and creators together around the fun and community of gaming in entirely new ways.</p><p>My first job is simple: understand what makes this work and protect it.</p><p>That starts with three commitments.</p><p>First, great games.</p><p>Everything begins here. We must have great games beloved by players before we do anything. Unforgettable characters, stories that make us feel, innovative game play, and creative excellence. We will empower our studios, invest in iconic franchises, and back bold new ideas. We will take risks. We will enter new categories and markets where we can add real value, grounded in what players care about most.</p><p>I promoted Matt Booty in honor of this commitment. He understands the craft and the challenges of building great games, has led teams that deliver award-winning work, and has earned the trust of game developers across the industry.</p><p>Second, the return of Xbox.</p><p>We will recommit to our core Xbox fans and players, those who have invested with us for the past 25 years, and to the developers who build the expansive universes and experiences that are embraced by players across the world.</p><p>We will celebrate our roots with a renewed commitment to Xbox starting with console which has shaped who we are. It connects us to the players and fans who invest in Xbox, and to the developers who build ambitious experiences for it.</p><p>Gaming now lives across devices, not within the limits of any single piece of hardware. As we expand across PC, mobile, and cloud, Xbox should feel seamless, instant, and worthy of the communities we serve. We will break down barriers so developers can build once and reach players everywhere without compromise.</p><p>Third, future of play.</p><p>We are witnessing the reinvention of play.</p><p>To meet the moment, we will invent new business models and new ways to play by leaning into what we already have: iconic teams, characters, and worlds that people love. But we will not treat those worlds as static IP to milk and monetize. We will build a shared platform and tools that empower developers and players to create and share their own stories.</p><p>As monetization and AI evolve and influence this future, we will not chase short-term efficiency or flood our ecosystem with soulless AI slop. Games are and always will be art, crafted by humans, and created with the most innovative technology provided by us.</p><p>The next 25 years belong to the teams who dare to build something surprising, something no one else is willing to try, and have the patience to see it through. We have done this before, and I am here to help us do it again. I want to return to the renegade spirit that built Xbox in the first place. It will require us to relentlessly question everything, revisit processes, protect what works, and be brave enough to change what does not.</p><p>Thank you for welcoming me into this journey.</p><p>—Asha</p><p><strong>Matt Booty, Xbox Chief Content Officer</strong></p><p>I read Phil’s note with much gratitude. He has been a steady champion for game creators and our studio teams, and I’ve learned so much from his leadership over the years. All our games have benefited from his foundational support. I’m also grateful to Satya for his ongoing commitment to gaming and holding a vision of how it can connect back to the larger company.</p><p>Looking forward, I’m excited to partner with Asha as our next CEO. Our first conversations centered on her commitment to making great games and the role that plays in our overall success. She asks questions, pushes for clarity, and wants our choices grounded in player and developer needs. That mindset matters as the industry around us is changing quickly: how players engage, how games are made, and how business models and platforms evolve.</p><p>We have good reasons to believe in what’s ahead. This organization and its franchises have navigated change for decades, and our strength comes from teams who know how to adapt and keep delivering. That confidence is grounded in a strong pipeline of established franchises, new bets we believe in, and clear player demand for what we are building.</p><p>My focus is on supporting the teams and leaders we have in place and creating the conditions for them to do their best work. To be clear, there are no organizational changes underway for our studios.</p><p>Thanks for everything you do for players and for each other.</p><p>—Matt</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/02/microsoft-gaming-ceo-phil-spencer-retires-xbox-president-sarah-bond-resigns]]></content:encoded>

As part of this massive shake-up, Xbox Game Studios head Matt Booty has been promoted to Chief Content Officer and will work closely with Sharma within Microsoft Gaming.&nbsp;</p><p>Sharma joined Microsoft in 2024 as part of the company's AI development, and worked as Chief Operating Officer of Instacart and Vice President of Product at Meta prior to that. As the new Microsoft Gaming CEO, Sharma will oversee a vast array of studios and games ranging from Activision's <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/good-luck-have-fun">Call of Duty</a> umbrella, Blizzard Entertainment's <a href="https://gameinformer.com/preview/2026/02/04/overwatch-2-is-just-overwatch-again-and-five-new-heroes-arrive-next-week">Overwatch</a> and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2026/02/11/blizzard-is-bringing-the-warlock-class-to-diablo-iv-lord-of-hatred-diablo-ii-and-diablo">Diablo</a> teams, King's mobile Candy Crush empire, Mojang and that team's ongoing work on Minecraft, and of course, the core Xbox Game Studios, which includes <a href="https://gameinformer.com/xbox-developer-direct/2026/01/22/the-new-fable-is-finally-arriving-in-autumn-of-this-year">Fable</a> and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/xbox-developer-direct/2026/01/22/forza-horizon-6-gets-first-gameplay-details-and-may-launch-date">Forza Horizon</a> developer Playground Games, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/10/24/halo-campaign-evolved-coming-to-ps5-xbox-and-pc-remakes-halo-1s-story-with-new-content">Halo: Campaign Evolved's</a> Halo Studios, and more.&nbsp;</p><p>Spencer's departure comes after serving as the Head of Xbox (and later Microsoft Gaming CEO) for more than a decade, joining the team in 2014, though he had worked at Microsoft since 1988, beginning his career there as an intern. Spencer joined at a tense time for Xbox in 2014, roughly five months after Microsoft released the Xbox One, which by all accounts, roughed in a rough state due to <a href="https://gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2014/05/29/10-ways-the-kinect-failed-out-of-our-living-rooms.aspx">the non-optional inclusion of a refreshed Kinect</a>, an emphasis on home and TV entertainment (over gaming, in some instances), and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2013/06/06/microsoft-outlines-xbox-ones-always-on-perameters.aspx">DRM-related controversies</a> before the console's release; <a href="https://gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2013/06/19/report-microsoft-to-drop-used-game-restrictions-online-requirements.aspx">Xbox reversed course on its DRM requirements</a> prior to the launch of the Xbox One.&nbsp;</p><p>As Head of Xbox, Spencer quickly got to work garnering good will for the once-favorite console of many gamers with moves like backward compatibility, an emphasis on Xbox Game Pass with its steady stream of day one releases, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/e3-2019/2019/06/09/new-cyberpunk-2077-trailer-showcases-keanu-reeves-launches-in-april">explosive E3 conferences that featured the likes of Keanu Reeves</a>, various acquisitions such as <a href="https://gameinformer.com/news/2023/10/13/microsoft-has-officially-acquired-activision-blizzard-for-69-billion">Microsoft's $69 billion purchase of Activision Blizzard</a> and the company's <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2020/09/21/microsoft-acquires-bethesda-the-studio-behind-fallout-the-elder-scrolls-doom-and-more">acquisition of Fallout and Elder Scrolls maker Bethesda for $7.5 billion</a>, amongst others (though arguably, these acquisitions didn't exactly provide good will for the brand), and the Xbox Play Anywhere initiative as part of its <a href="https://gameinformer.com/xbox-series-x-review-series-s">Xbox Series X/S console generation</a>, which <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2018/10/24/microsoft-announces-plans-to-expand-game-pass-to-pc">integrated Microsoft's gaming business more closely with PC</a>. Under Spencer's leadership as Microsoft Gaming CEO, we also saw Xbox-exclusive titles launch on PlayStation 5, like <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2024/02/21/sea-of-thieves-sets-sail-for-playstation-5-this-april">Sea of Thieves</a>, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and The Great Circle</a>, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/forza-horizon-5">Forza Horizon 5</a>, and even the upcoming <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/10/24/halo-campaign-evolved-coming-to-ps5-xbox-and-pc-remakes-halo-1s-story-with-new-content">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Bond, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/news/2023/10/26/microsoft-reorganization-includes-a-new-xbox-president-and-studios-leader">who was promoted to President of Xbox in 2022 alongside Spencer's promotion to Microsoft Gaming CEO</a>, has worked in Xbox since 2017. She began her career at Xbox as the corporate vice president of business development and partnerships, was then promoted to corporate vice president of game creator experience and ecosystem, and finally, became President of Xbox. &nbsp;</p><p>In 2022, when Bond was promoted to President of Xbox and Spencer to Microsoft Gaming CEO, Booty was named President of Game Content and Studios, a position that put him in close communication with the more than 40 studios under the Xbox Game Studios umbrella. That's likely the reason his new position as Chief Content Officer will reportedly have him working closely with Sharma, who likely does not have as wide-ranging or as informed an approach to Xbox's stable of studios and games comparatively.&nbsp;</p><p>Xbox has had a busy 2026 so far, even outside of this leadership shake-up. The company held a Developer Direct showcase last month, where it revealed release dates and gameplay for upcoming first-party titles like <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/fable">Fable</a> and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/forza-horizon-6">Forza Horizon 6</a>, along with <a href="https://gameinformer.com/xbox-developer-direct/2026/01/22/double-fine-announces-online-multiplayer-pottery-brawler-kiln">the debut of Double Fine Productions' Kiln</a> and the launch window for <a href="https://gameinformer.com/xbox-developer-direct/2026/01/22/pokemon-developers-beast-of-reincarnation-a-post-apocalyptic">Game Freak's Beast of Reincarnation</a>. Earlier this week, on February 17, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/09/avowed-xboxs-first-person-fantasy-rpg-is-coming-to-playstation-5-next-month">Xbox's first-person fantasy RPG Avowed launched on PS5</a> after roughly a year of Xbox and PC exclusivity. Looking ahead to the rest of 2026, Xbox is launching Forza Horizon on Xbox Series X/S and PC on May 19 (and PS5 later this year), Kiln this Spring, its highly anticipated Fable reboot in Autumn, and Halo: Campaign Evolved sometime this year. Plus, Xbox, like PlayStation 5 and PC, will act as a third-party console for massive releases like <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/11/06/grand-theft-auto-vi-release-date-delayed-to-november-2026">Grand Theft Auto VI in November</a> and more.&nbsp;</p><p>Notably, Microsoft is celebrating 25 years of Xbox; this shake-up is an interesting wrinkle in what was supposed to be a banner year for the company.&nbsp;</p><p>Transcriptions of the emails Spencer, Booty, Sharma, and Nadella sent to staff can be read below, courtesy of <em>IGN's </em>report.&nbsp;</p><h3>Phil Spencer's Email To Microsoft Staff</h3><p><em>When I walked through Microsoft’s doors as an intern in June of 1988, I could never have imagined the products I’d help build, the players and customers we’d serve, or the extraordinary teams I’d be lucky enough to join. It’s been an epic ride and truly the privilege of a lifetime.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Last fall, I shared with Satya that I was thinking about stepping back and starting the next chapter of my life. From that moment, we aligned on approaching this transition with intention, ensuring stability, and strengthening the foundation we’ve built. Xbox has always been more than a business. It’s a vibrant community of players, creators, and teams who care deeply about what we build and how we build it. And it deserves a thoughtful, deliberate plan for the road ahead.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Today marks an exciting new chapter for Microsoft Gaming as Asha Sharma steps into the role of CEO, and I want to be the first to welcome her to this incredible team. Working with her over the past several months has given me tremendous confidence. She brings genuine curiosity, clarity and a deep commitment to understanding players, creators, and the decisions that shape our future. We know this is an important moment for our fans, partners, and team, and we’re committed to getting it right. I’ll remain in an advisory role through the summer to support a smooth handoff.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>I’m also grateful for the strength of our studios organization. Matt Booty and our studios teams continue to build an incredible portfolio, and I have full confidence in the leadership and creative momentum across our global studios. I want to congratulate Matt on his promotion to EVP and Chief Content Officer.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>As part of this transition, Sarah Bond has decided to leave Microsoft to begin a new chapter. Sarah has been instrumental during a defining period for Xbox, shaping our platform strategy, expanding Game Pass and cloud gaming, supporting new hardware launches, and guiding some of the most significant moments in our history. I’m grateful for her partnership and the impact she’s had, and I wish her the very best in what comes next.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Most of all, to everyone in Microsoft Gaming, I want to say “thank you”. I’ve learned so much from this team and community, grown alongside you, and been continually inspired by the creativity, courage, and care you bring to players, creators, and to one another every day.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>I’m incredibly proud of what we’ve built together over the last 25 years, and I have complete confidence in all of you and in the opportunities ahead. I’ll be cheering you on in this next chapter as Xbox’s proudest fan and player.</em></p><h3>Matt Booty's Email To Microsoft Staff</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>I read Phil’s note with much gratitude. He has been a steady champion for game creators and our studio teams, and I’ve learned so much from his leadership over the years. All our games have benefited from his foundational support. I’m also grateful to Satya for his ongoing commitment to gaming and holding a vision of how it can connect back to the larger company.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Looking forward, I’m excited to partner with Asha as our next CEO. Our first conversations centered on her commitment to making great games and the role that plays in our overall success. She asks questions, pushes for clarity, and wants our choices grounded in player and developer needs. That mindset matters as the industry around us is changing quickly: how players engage, how games are made, and how business models and platforms evolve.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>We have good reasons to believe in what’s ahead. This organization and its franchises have navigated change for decades, and our strength comes from teams who know how to adapt and keep delivering. That confidence is grounded in a strong pipeline of established franchises, new bets we believe in, and clear player demand for what we are building.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>My focus is on supporting the teams and leaders we have in place and creating the conditions for them to do their best work. To be clear, there are no organizational changes underway for our studios.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Thanks for everything you do for players and for each other.</em></p><h3>Asha Sharma's Email To Microsoft Staff</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Today I begin my role as CEO of Microsoft Gaming.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>I feel two things at once: humility and urgency. Humility because this team has built something extraordinary over decades. Urgency because gaming is in a period of rapid change, and we need to move with clarity and conviction.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>I am stepping into work shaped by generations of artists, engineers, designers, writers, musicians, operators and more who create worlds that have brought joy and deep personal meaning to hundreds of millions of players. The level of craft here is exceptional, and it is amplified by Xbox, which was founded in the belief that the power of games connect people and push the industry forward.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Thank you to Phil for his leadership, and to every studio, platform, and operations team that built this foundation. We are stewards of some of the most loved stories and characters in entertainment and bring players and creators together around the fun and community of gaming in entirely new ways.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>My first job is simple: understand what makes this work and protect it. That starts with three commitments.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>First, great games.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Everything begins here. We must have great games beloved by players before we do anything. Unforgettable characters, stories that make us feel, innovative game play, and creative excellence. We will empower our studios, invest in iconic franchises, and back bold new ideas. We will take risks. We will enter new categories and markets where we can add real value, grounded in what players care about most. I promoted Matt Booty in honor of this commitment. He understands the craft and the challenges of building great games, has led teams that deliver award-winning work, and has earned the trust of game developers across the industry.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Second, the return of Xbox.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>We will recommit to our core Xbox fans and players, those who have invested with us for the past 25 years, and to the developers who build the expansive universes and experiences that are embraced by players across the world. We will celebrate our roots with a renewed commitment to Xbox starting with console which has shaped who we are. It connects us to the players and fans who invest in Xbox, and to the developers who build ambitious experiences for it. Gaming now lives across devices, not within the limits of any single piece of hardware. As we expand across PC, mobile, and cloud, Xbox should feel seamless, instant, and worthy of the communities we serve. We will break down barriers so developers can build once and reach players everywhere without compromise.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Third, future of play.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>We are witnessing the reinvention of play. To meet the moment, we will invent new business models and new ways to play by leaning into what we already have: iconic teams, characters, and worlds that people love. But we will not treat those worlds as static IP to milk and monetize. We will build a shared platform and tools that empower developers and players to create and share their own stories. As monetization and AI evolve and influence this future, we will not chase short-term efficiency or flood our ecosystem with soulless AI slop. Games are and always will be art, crafted by humans, and created with the most innovative technology provided by us.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>The next 25 years belong to the teams who dare to build something surprising, something no one else is willing to try, and have the patience to see it through. We have done this before, and I am here to help us do it again. I want to return to the renegade spirit that built Xbox in the first place. It will require us to relentlessly question everything, revisit processes, protect what works, and be brave enough to change what does not.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Thank you for welcoming me into this journey.</em></p><h3>Satya Nadella's Email To Microsoft Staff</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Gaming has been part of Microsoft from the start. Flight Simulator shipped before Windows, and you can practically ray‑trace a line from DirectX in the ’90s to the accelerated‑compute era we’re in today.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>As we celebrate Xbox’s 25th year, the opportunity and innovation agenda in front of us is expansive. Today we reach over 500 million monthly active users, are a top publisher across all platforms, and continue to innovate across gaming hardware, content and community, in service of creators and players everywhere.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>I am long on gaming and its role at the center of our consumer ambition, and as we look ahead, I’m excited to share that Asha Sharma will become Executive Vice President and CEO, Microsoft Gaming, reporting to me. Over the last two years at Microsoft, and previously as Chief Operating Officer at Instacart and a Vice President at Meta, Asha has helped build and scale services that reach billions of people and support thriving consumer and developer ecosystems. She brings deep experience building and growing platforms, aligning business models to long-term value, and operating at global scale, which will be critical in leading our gaming business into its next era of growth.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Booty will become Executive Vice President and Chief Content Officer, reporting to Asha. Matt’s career reflects a lifelong commitment to games and to the people who make them. Under his leadership, Microsoft Gaming has grown to span nearly 40 studios across Xbox, Bethesda, Activision Blizzard, and King, which are home to beloved franchises including Halo, The Elder Scrolls, Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, Diablo, Candy Crush, and Fallout.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Together, Asha and Matt have the right combination of consumer product leadership and gaming depth to push our platform innovation and content pipeline forward. Last year, Phil Spencer made the decision to retire from the company, and since then we’ve been talking about succession planning. I want to thank Phil for his extraordinary leadership and partnership. Over 38 years at Microsoft, including 12 years leading Gaming, Phil helped transform what we do and how we do it. He expanded our reach across PC, mobile, and cloud; nearly tripled the size of the business; helped shape our strategy through the acquisitions of Activision Blizzard, ZeniMax, and Minecraft; and strengthened our culture across our studios and platforms. I’ve long admired Phil’s unwavering commitment to players, creators, and his team, and I am personally grateful for his leadership and counsel. He will continue working closely with Asha to ensure a smooth transition.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>We have extraordinary creative talent across our studios and a global platform that is second to none. I’m excited for how we will capture the opportunity ahead and define what comes next, while staying grounded in what players and creators value.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Please join me in congratulating Asha and Matt on their new roles, and in thanking Phil for everything he has done for Microsoft and for our industry.</em></p><hr><p><em>This story is in development...</em></p><p><em><strong>[Source: </strong></em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-retiring-sarah-bond-out-matt-booty-promoted-as-microsoft-ai-exec-asha-sharma-named-new-xbox-boss-exclusive"><em><strong>IGN</strong></em></a><em><strong>]</strong></em></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2026/02/20/phil-spencer-is-retiring-xbox-president-sarah-bond-is-leaving-and-microsofts-ai-head-is]]></content:encoded>

              <p><span>After more than a decade in charge of Xbox, Phil Spencer is retiring from his position at the top of Microsoft’s Gaming Division, as laid out in a story from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-retiring-sarah-bond-out-matt-booty-promoted-as-microsoft-ai-exec-asha-sharma-named-new-xbox-boss-exclusive?utm_source=bluesky,threads,twitter"><em>IGN</em></a>. Sarah Bond, the president of Xbox, is also leaving the company. </span></p> <p>Asha Sharma previously president of Microsoft’s CoreAI product, has been promoted to CEO of Microsoft Gaming. Xbox Game Studios head Matt Booty is being promoted to chief content officer. Spencer will remain at Xbox through the summer in an advisory role.</p> <p data-cy="paragraph">“Last fall, I shared with Satya [Nadella, Microsoft CEO] that I was thinking about stepping back and starting the next chapter of my life,” Spencer said in an email to employees. “From that moment, we aligned on approaching this transition with intention, ensuring stability, and strengthening the foundation we’ve built.

And it deserves a thoughtful, deliberate plan for the road ahead.</p> <p data-cy="paragraph">“Today marks an exciting new chapter for Microsoft Gaming as Asha Sharma steps into the role of CEO, and I want to be the first to welcome her to this incredible team.

We know this is an important moment for our fans, partners, and team, and we’re committed to getting it right. I’ll remain in an advisory role through the summer to support a smooth handoff.”</p> <p data-cy="paragraph">Sharma laid out her hopes for the future of Xbox in her own email, in which she said she wants to spearhead the “return of Xbox,” and also said that she wants to commit to human-made work and reject “soulless AI slop.” The email read as follows:</p>

 <blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">My first job is simple: understand what makes this work and protect it. That starts with three commitments. First, great games. Everything begins here. We must have great games beloved by players before we do anything. Unforgettable characters, stories that make us feel, innovative game play, and creative excellence.

That confidence is grounded in a strong pipeline of established franchises, new bets we believe in, and clear player demand for what we are building.”</p> <p><span>Spencer has been with Microsoft since 1988 and has been with the Xbox brand since 2001, helping to launch the original console against the PS2 and GameCube 25 years ago. He was promoted to the head of Xbox in 2014 shortly after the launch of the Xbox One, and has remained a face of the brand for 12 years, operating as the CEO of Microsoft Gaming since 2022.</span></p>

 <p><span>The departure comes after a long struggle to put Xbox back on top of the console gaming ecosystem. Alongside milestones like Game Pass and acquiring Activision Blizzard there have also been plenty of game delays, cancelations, layoffs, and studio closures. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-earnings-q2-game-pass-hardware-next-gen-pc-2000663911"><span>Soft sales of the Xbox Series X/S</span></a><span> compared to the PlayStation 5 and Switch in the most recent generation pushed Microsoft to take many once-exclusive games multiplatform, doing what was once unthinkable and bringing <em>Halo</em> to Sony’s rival gaming platform.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The Xbox division has reportedly been under significant pressure from Microsoft to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-microsoft-price-hike-game-pass-layoffs-new-console-2000638546"><span>reach abnormally high profit margins</span></a><span>, which some speculate has played a part in the rise of prices for Xbox consoles and subscription services in recent years.</span></p> <p><strong>Update: 2/20/26, 4:00 p.m. ET:&nbsp;</strong>Spencer posted a public statement <a href="https://x.com/XboxP3/status/2024951211129254314?s=20">on his X account</a></p> <div> <blockquote> <p><span>It’s rare in life to know when a chapter is closing, but after 38&nbsp;years at Microsoft, that moment has arrived for me. I’ve made the decision to retire and begin the next chapter of my life. It’s a milestone that’s given me a chance to reflect on the incredible journey I’ve been fortunate enough to share with so many of you.</span></p> </blockquote> </div> <blockquote><p>I’m excited for @asha_shar as she steps into the CEO role. She’s joining an incredible group of people; teams full of talent, heart, and a deep commitment to the players they serve. Watching her lean in with curiosity and a real desire to strengthen the foundation we’ve built gives me confidence that our Xbox communities will be well supported in the years ahead.</p> <p>Thinking back to my start as an intern in 1988, I never could have imagined the path ahead. I’ve been lucky to work with so many passionate creators, partners, colleagues, and players across the industry; people who challenged me, taught me, and made this work full of joy and wonder.</p> <p>Thank you to everyone who’s been part of this chapter. This community has meant more to me than I can say.</p> <p>From here, I’ll keep doing what’s always mattered so much to me: cheering on the teams pushing this industry forward and playing alongside this incredible community. I’ll see you online.</p></blockquote>

The post includes a celebratory piece of Nier: Automata art:</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— NieR公式PRアカウント (@NieR_JPN) <a href="https://twitter.com/NieR_JPN/status/2024798275728212166?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 20, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">In a press release, Square Enix confirmed that in addition to this milestone for Automata, Nier Replicant ver.1.22474487139, the remake of Nier released in 2021, has sold two million copies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The six-minute-long YouTube video provides a recap of everything Nier: Automata-related from the last decade, and unless you're a superfan, the sheer volume is probably a lot higher than you'd expect. There's the game itself and its various re-releases and ports, plus multiple concerts, stage presentations, written works, animation, and more. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It ends on a teasing note, with text reading: "Nier: Automata to be continued..."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tantalyzing as it sounds that this may mean another game is in the works, Nier fans have been here before. A number of the Nier works shown in that video have <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yoko-taro-reportedly-teased-nier-3-with-repent-concert-message">seemingly teased more Nier to come</a>, but it's never quite been the AAA video game rendition fans wanted. The story has been told and sequelized through many different mediums at this point, including a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nier-mobile-game-shuts-down-in-april">no-longer-available mobile game</a> that's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nier-3-has-been-in-front-of-us-all-along-per-series-creators-tease">effectively a direct sequel</a>, but no full-blown PC/console game has emerged in the last nine years. Maybe other fans feel differently, but it's left me a bit jaded at the idea. Even Yoko Taro sounded a bit weary when he was last asked about it, saying that he was trying to make new projects, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nier-creator-yoko-taro-is-still-working-on-games-they-just-keep-getting-canceled">but they kept getting canceled on him</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Which is a shame, because Nier: Automata rules. We <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/06/nier-automata-review">gave it an 8.9/10 when we reviewed it in 2017</a>, saying it's "a crazy, beautiful, and highly entertaining journey full of nutty ideas and awesome gameplay. It may not include the most sensical story or compelling characters, but its frenzied combat -- coupled with beautiful visuals and a stunning soundtrack – make it too much fun to pass up."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

According to IGN, one such advertisement was a modified version of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Usual June</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s key promotional art (seen below).</span></p><p>Image via Finji</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The AI-modified image apparently extends the image to show the lower part of player character June's body, displaying her in a more sexualized fashion while wearing a bikini bottom and thigh-high boots, evoking a racist stereotype of Black women. This does not match any other art or screenshots for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Usual June</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which depict the character in shorts and sneakers (IGN did not reproduce any copies of the altered images).</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/marketing/call-of-duty-advert-banned-in-the-uk-for-trivialising-sexual-violence-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Call of Duty ad banned in the UK for trivializing sexual violence</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Even though these images appear on the company's account, Saltsman told IGN she was not able to view or identify them herself.
