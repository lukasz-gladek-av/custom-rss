			<p>Battlefield 6 is now only three weeks away from its October 10 launch date. Fans are counting down days following the successful beta, and the developers share more info through interviews. Yesterday, Technical Director Christian Buhl <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-s-limitations-battlefield-6-better-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that having to optimize for a lower spec hardware like the Xbox Series S actually benefited the more powerful platforms, too.</p>



<p>Now, in an interview <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/secretly-console-first-ripple-effect-talks-building-battlefield-6-and-lessons-learned-from-battlefield-2042" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with IGN</a>, Buhl and Senior Console Combat Designer Matthew Nickerson have discussed the importance of delivering a great console experience in Battlefield 6, to the extent that Nickerson joked it was like the game was 'secretly console first'.  </p>



<p><em><strong>Christian Buhl:</strong> I could say we've been thinking about console and the console experience from the start of Battlefield 6. It has been a top-of-the-line thing. We have to build this game as if it was made primarily for console players. Obviously, we're still also thinking about PC players, but in the past, frankly, Battlefield was built as a PC game and then ported to console, and it probably felt like that. That is not how this game was built. We built this from the beginning with the idea in mind that this is going to be on both console and PC. It has to feel and play like it is a console game that was built to be a console game.</em></p>



<p><em><strong>Matthew Nickerson:</strong> We have a saying here in the office, in Ripple Effect when I joined the team, that I created, called 'Secretly Console First.’ It's a little moniker that kind of pokes fun. We don't want to, obviously, tear down or destroy any of the legacy that Battlefield has, which is, first, a PC game, but we really have to care about console at the end of the day. We've been putting in the reps, putting in the work, just like Christian said. Console has been at the forefront of Battlefield 6 development since day one, and really, we're honed and we are well-crafted in providing this product at the highest quality possible.</em></p>



<p>In the interview, the two also shared that Battlefield 6 will offer console players the option to turn off cross-play with the PC version (which they may want to do in case of cheating issues) while maintaining cross-play between Xbox Series S|X and PlayStation 5 consoles. When cross-play with PC is enabled, the matchmaking system will still look for console players first if you're playing on Xbox or PlayStation, only expanding the search to include PC if the lobby requires more players. Moreover, the developers have revamped aim assist compared to Battlefield 2042 to ensure cross-play is fair for all players.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-mode-details-testing-starts-this-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">testing of the Battle Royale mode is ongoing on the Battlefield Labs platform</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Nintendo often makes fans wait a spell for DLC or expansions for their favorite games, so it came as somewhat of a surprise when the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-direct-announced-friday-september-12/">most recent Nintendo Direct</a> announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/donkey-kong-bananza/">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, released only two months ago, was getting DLC the same day as the presentation. The DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush DLC adds a new stage based on DK’s tropical home featured in Rare and Retro Studios’ games, as well as a new fast-paced roguelite mode.</p>



<p>Is the DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush DLC a gem or are its flaws all too apparent? Swing on down for my full impressions...</p>



<p><em>Note: This is an opinion piece and, thus, not as detailed as a full scored review would be.</em></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As the title of the DLC implies, the centerpiece of Donkey Kong Bananza: DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush is a new HD recreation of the big ape’s island home from the Donkey Kong Country games. Nintendo has really gone all out rendering DK Island in all its glory, packing it with familiar characters, landmarks, and plenty of Easter eggs. It’s a welcome addition to a game that’s really a celebration of the Donkey Kong franchise as a whole, although it is hard to overlook the fact that Super Mario Odyssey included something similar – a stage based on the classic Mushroom Kingdom – as an in-game unlockable, while DK Island is stuck behind a $20 price tag.</p>



<p>Super Mario Odyssey’s Mushroom Kingdom was also fully integrated into the core game, offering fresh challenges to tackle and Power Moons to collect. The same can’t be said of DK Island. While the tropical locale looks nice and will give you fuzzy nostalgic feelings, it strangely sits apart from the main game. There are no new Banandium Gems or fossils to collect here, making the whole experience feel a bit too much like a superficial theme park attraction.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>At least that’s true until you jump into Emerald Rush mode, which DK Island was clearly designed around. Emerald Rush is essentially an accelerated take on the roguelite genre, with all the gold in the game turned into glittering green gems. Over a series of quick 99-second rounds, you’re challenged to collect a specific quantity of green goodness by smashing ore deposits, defeating enemies, and finding green bananas (again, bananas can only be found on DK Island in Emerald Rush mode). The number of rounds you have to survive depends on the difficulty you’ve chosen, but thankfully, finding emerald fossils will grant you stackable upgrades that will help you as the rounds get tougher.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Emerald Rush is fun enough, in a simple, smashy-smashy sort of way, although it condenses the roguelite experience to such a degree that it all starts to feel a bit meaningless. You'll be picking up a <em>lot</em> of fossils, requiring you to choose upgrades almost constantly. While I'm absolutely sure some folks will get <em>really</em> into strategizing and finding synergies between upgrades, I found myself succumbing to information overload fairly quickly.</p>



<p>In addition to DK Island, you can unlock the ability to play Emerald Rush on the majority of DK Bananza’s layers, and it will likely take a solid half-dozen hours or more to unlock all the DLC’s new content. Even then, you can pump up the difficulty on each layer for a new challenge. That said, I'm not sure how long the average player is going to stick with the mode. Emerald Rush reminds me a lot of the Balloon World DLC for Mario Odyssey, in that it's something I think <em>some</em> players will really get into, but will be largely ignored by most.</p>

</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-not-a-knockout-follow-up-punch"><strong>Not a Knockout Follow-up Punch</strong></h2>



<p>Donkey Kong Bananza: DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush isn't without its charms, but the titular island's lack of integration into the main game, Emerald Rush mode's relatively simple gameplay loop, and a substantial $20 price tag means this DLC will likely only appeal to a relatively small subset of Bananza owners. If you've read through these impressions and are still interested, by all means, dig in, but given how substantial the core Donkey Kong Bananza experience is, others may prefer to keep mining for fun there.</p>



<p>Donkey Kong Bananza: DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush is available now on Switch 2 for $20.</p>

            <p>
KPop Demon Hunters is headed to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, according to the latest leaks.
</p>
<p>
If you're somehow unaware, KPop Demon Hunters is an animated film from Sony Pictures depicting a fantastical take on the South Korean pop industry. Not only have the songs (sung by prominent KPop artists) dominated music charts, the film itself is the most watched original title in Netflix history.
</p>
<p>
It's no wonder, then, a crossover with Fortnite is on the way, as spotted by Fortnite leakers <a href="https://x.com/SpushFNBR/status/1967649620449968264">SpushFNBR</a> and <a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD/status/1967649617547497872">Loolo</a>. It's gonna be golden for sure.
</p>

<p>
But what might the crossover include? The most obvious would be dance emotes based on songs from the film, which each have their own dance routines. I can't wait to see Metal Gear Solid's Solid Snake dancing along to Soda Pop.
</p>
<p>
Skins based on the three Huntr/x singers would also work, considering they're also fighters alongside being in a pop band.
</p>
<p>
Just as KPop is taking over the music charts, games from South Korea are proving extremely popular too - as proven recently by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blades-runaway-success-on-pc-proves-south-korea-is-positioning-itself-to-become-a-major-force-in-global-gaming-and-experts-agree">the huge success of Stellar Blade on PC</a>.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/palworld">Palworld</a> is set to finally emerge from early access in 2026, developers Pocketpair have announced. There's a lot of work the game about not-Pokémon, guns, and maunfacturing will need prior to that point, say the studio who've been busy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/here-are-the-patents-nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-are-suing-palworld-about-according-to-pocketpair">staring down Lionel Hutzes who probably know the DK rap off by heart.</a> They've also teased that a bunch of new additions are in the works for the 1.0 update. </p>

<p>"While we have a lot of ideas for where we want to take Palworld, we also need to start thinking about Palworld 1.0," Pocketpair communications director and publishing manager John ‘Bucky’ Buckley said in the above video announcement. "Beyond just adding new content there’s a lot of cleanup that needs to be done before Palworld can exit early access.</p>
<p>"It’s no secret that Palworld has a lot of quirks and jank, and we want to take the time to properly address those before releasing the game. With that in mind, we plan to start that cleanup this year. Our goal is to ultimately release Palworld next year, in 2026, and we think taking the time now to fix those problems will ultimately lead to a better game."</p><p>As a result, the studio plans to be "a little quiet" for the rest of 2025, with the survival game's winter update not set to be as chunky as the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1623730/view/518574472406499342">Feybreak or v0.4 update</a> it got last December. That said, Buckley did still indicate "a few surprises" are planned for that winter update.</p>
<p>The big tease-a-thon continued, with the community manager declaring that a "truly massive amount of content" is in the works for the 1.0 update that'll bring Palworld out of the early access cocoon it's occupied since January last year. "We plan to share some sneak peeks about Palworld 1.0 in the very near future," he concluded.</p>
<p>Amid releasing updates including the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-palworld-update-adds-crossplay-photo-mode-new-drafting-table-feature-and-cosmetic-armour">crossplay</a> and a Terarria <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/with-palworlds-terraria-collab-now-out-in-the-wild-terraria-will-be-getting-its-own-palworld-crossover-eventually">collab</a> so far this year, Pocketpair have been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworlds-creators-are-paying-the-kenzera-devs-to-make-a-horror-game-about-the-entertainment-industry">getting a publishing arm up and running</a>. Horror game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3352690/Dead_Take/">Dead Take</a> from Tales Of Kenzera: ZAU devs Surgent Studios and retro-handheld-inspired angler <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2611240/Normal_Fishing/">Normal Fishing</a> are among the titles the studio have helped release or signed up so far.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> has sold 3.2m copies on Steam alone since its release, according to analyst estimations.
</p>
<p>
Ahead of its release, Silksong was the most wishlisted game on the platform with 4.8m wishlists. It seems the majority of these have converted into full sales. That's all led to large numbers of concurrent players - Silksong reached a concurrent player peak of over 587k two days after release, making it the 17th most played game on Steam.
</p>
<p>
These sales are according to analysis from <a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/5-things-you-didnt-know-about-hollow">GameDiscover</a> in its latest newsletter, which adds Silksong has sold around 500k copies each on PlayStation and Switch (both consoles), as well as reaching 1.5m downloads on Xbox Game Pass.

<p>
Of course, part of that success is down to the popularity of the original <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a>. According to GameDiscover's data, there's a 78.78 percent overlap in audience between the two games, with 22 percent of all Hollow Knight players on Steam buying the sequel.
</p>
<p>
The original game sold 15m copies, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-silksong-hasnt-been-in-development-hell-hype-skyrocketed-sales-of-the-original-game-to-give-team-cherry-financial-freedom">sales skyrocketing due to extended hype around Silksong</a>.
</p>
<p>
Another part of that success is the game's price - it came in cheaper than many expected, causing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-hollow-knight-silksongs-cheap-price-a-problem-for-other-indie-games-devs-and-publishers-weigh-up-its-impact">debate across the industry around the appropriate cost of indie games</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The ever delightful Gearbox CEO, Randy Pitchford, has reminded PC players in his own unique style that<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/borderlands-4/"> Borderlands 4</a> has minimum spec requirements and it’s not going to work very well on older PCs.</p>
<p>His comments follow PC gamers complaining of performance issues and suggested that players need to “learn how their PC’s work at the high end for this specific game”.</p>


<p>“The minimum and recommended specs are published. The most common hardware is a four year old cell phone. Borderlands 4 is a premium game made for premium gamers. Just as Borderlands 4 cannot run on a PlayStation 4, it cannot be expected to run on too-old PC hardware”, he<a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1966958001216253985"> tweeted</a>.</p>
<p>“Unlike on PlayStation and Xbox, we cannot prevent a PC player with sub optimal hardware for the game try to play it. So some try and get mad. And some have actual issues we need to fix. And some need to learn how their PC’s work at the high end for this specific game in 2025 and use the tools available to them to find the right balance between frame rate, resolution, and graphics features. This is not a game made to run on 10 year old PC’s – this game uses the full capabilities of modern bus, CPU, and GPU.”</p>
<p>“If you’re trying to drive a monster truck with a leaf blower’s motor, you’re going to be disappointed. If you discover your system can’t run the game well by accident or wishful thinking and/or don’t want to try to mess with settings to make things good enough for you, please use the refund feature on Steam rather than have a subpar experience.”</p>

</section></header><div><section>

<p>There's been some fairly heated debate since the announcement of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</a>, over the remastered collection's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/super-mario-galaxy-1-plus-2-prices-are-live-and-its-sticker-shock-time">hefty price tag</a>. It's quite a lot of money for a pair of Wii games, as absolutely phenomenal as they are, there's no getting around it.</p>
<p>However, we do already know that the games present at 4K/1080p on Switch 2 (1080p docked on Switch 1), and that they offer up a sprinkling of new features such as a new Assist Mode, a new chapter of Rosalina's storybook, amiibo support, and what's described as "visual enhancements". How very vague of you, Nintendo.</p>
<p>Of course, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_mario_galaxy">Mario Galaxy</a> has already been re-released not so long ago as part of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_3d_all-stars">Super Mario 3D All-Stars</a> collection on Switch, and it's this version that those fine folk over at <a href="https://youtu.be/wOF6b0HgxCA?si=v1yUJir69RRo0CpC">GVG</a> have been checking out in a comparison video that gives us hope that we'll get a little more for our money than Nintendo was being clear about.</p>
<p>You can check out the full video above, which includes a playthrough comparison of the five minutes of Super Mario Galaxy's latest port (on Switch) as posted on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/Super-Mario-Galaxy-Super-Mario-Galaxy-2-2915270.html">Nintendo UK's website</a> versus the one we got with Super Mario 3D All-Stars, giving better examples of texture work that's been done than "visual enhancements" really gets across. Just check out the cobblestones in the area shown below as Mario lands; there's a big difference in the detail.</p>

<p>Cutscenes have also been properly re-rendered this time out, rather than upscaled, which introduced some banding issues in the 3D All-Stars collection - they're now gone, according to GVG. Oh, and the aspect ratio has also been changed to fill the screen. Nice.</p>
<p>Another interesting point to note here is that all the footage on Nintendo's site, it seems, is from the Switch versions of the games, so we've yet to actually get a look at just how they'll appear with the full Switch 2 treatment. Fingers crossed we're in for more of a surprise from these re-releases than first appeared.</p>

Nintendo has been busy obtaining patents — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-should-never-have-received-controversial-summon-character-and-let-it-fight-pokmon-patent-ip-lawyers-say">some of which IP lawyers said should never have been granted</a> — as it develops its case. Meanwhile, Pocketpair has vowed to defend itself in court, and continue to update Palworld along the way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The case involves <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/20241108" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>three patents</u></a> granted by the Japan Patent Office: two related to monster capture and release, and one related to riding characters. All three patents were filed in 2024, after Palworld came out. However, they are actually derived from earlier Nintendo patents dating from 2021. In other words, it seems that once Palworld came on the scene, Nintendo filed divisional patents that were geared to fight specifically against Palworld’s alleged infringement of the original patents.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since then, Pocketpair <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/20250508" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>has made changes</u></a> to Palworld’s disputed mechanics. The November 2024 patch removed the ability to summon Pals by throwing Pokéball-like Pal Spheres (now Pals just materialize next to you when summoned). In May this year, another Palworld update changed how you can glide in the game — instead of directly grabbing onto Glider Pals, now you just simply use Pal-buffed Glider equipment. Then, in July, Nintendo and The Pokémon Company <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-rewrites-patent-mid-case-in-ongoing-lawsuit-against-palworld-dev-pocketpair-but-why"><u>reworded one of the patents in the case</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At GDC in March, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-communications-director-speaks-on-generative-ai-controversy-online-struggles-and-why-palworld-is-misunderstood"><u>IGN sat down for an extended conversation with Bucky</u></a> following his talk at the conference, 'Community Management Summit: A Palworld Roller Coaster: Surviving the Drop.' During that talk, Buckley went into candid detail about a number of Palworld’s struggles, especially the accusations of it using generative AI (which Pocketpair has since debunked pretty soundly) and stealing Pokemon’s models for its own Pals. He <a href="https://www.vg247.com/palworld-nintendo-lawsuit-shock-to-pocketpair-no-one-considered-patent-infringement" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>even commented</u></a> a bit on Nintendo’s patent infringement lawsuit against the studio, saying it “came as a shock” to the studio and was “something that no one even considered.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <p>One technical issue the console version of Borderlands 4 is facing is a lack of a customisable field of vision slider, as the game has on PC. Currently the console FOV is low and the zoomed-in perspective is making some players feel sick.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-is-pretty-damn-optimal-randy-pitchford-responds-to-borderlands-4-pc-performance-complaints">Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford polled console players recently</a> about how strongly they felt about changing this, and three quarters of respondents felt very strongly about it. So, Gearbox appears to be doing something about it.</p>
<p>"We have heard your feedback on FOV (Field of View) sliders on console," <a href="https://x.com/Borderlands/status/1967001003422871921">Gearbox announced on the Borderlands 4 X account.</a> "The team is currently exploring how to bring these sliders to both Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5 versions. We will continue to read your feedback &amp; prioritise game updates with your experience in mind."</p>
<p>Borderlands 4 had a popular opening weekend but is facing some backlash on PC for its technical performance there. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gearbox-is-exploring-getting-borderlands-4-fov-sliders-on-console">Randy Pitchford took to X over the weekend</a> to tell players they needed to make some graphical trade-offs if they wanted high frame-rates, and suggested high frame-rates weren't, in a campaign-based looter shooter like this, the studio's top priority. "It's not a competitive FPS," he said.</p>
<p>Our Borderlands 4 review is currently in the works.</p>

            <p>
Sales of physical software accounted for just three percent of PlayStation sales last year, according to Sony's <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/corporatereport/CorporateReport2025_E.pdf">latest corporate report</a>.
</p>
<p>
Considering the company's <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/24q4_sonypre.pdf">total gaming division sales in 2024</a> were 4,670bn yen (around $31.77bn by today's conversion), Sony still made around $953m in physical software sales (as a rough estimate). 
</p>
<p>
However, that number has dropped from six percent of sales <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/corporatereport/CorporateReport2020_E.pdf">back in 2020</a>. It's no wonder Sony's PS5 consoles are primarily digital-only when fewer consumers are buying physical games, even with the option of a disc drive. Or has there been a decline in physical games <em>because</em> of the digital-only consoles? And with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-playstation-6-is-planned-to-have-a-detachable-disc-drive-on-launch/">reports</a> the PS6 will also be digital-only with an optional disc drive, it's a trend that's only set to continue.

<p>
By comparison, hardware makes up 24 percent of sales, though that's a given considering the high cost of consoles - a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-raises-ps5-price-yet-again-in-uk-and-mainland-europe">price that keeps getting higher</a>. That's increased from 19 percent in 2020.
</p>
<p>
Digital software sales, meanwhile, account for 20 percent of revenue - a huge margin compared with physical sales. 
</p>
<p>
Add-on content (DLC, effectively), accounts for 29 percent of sales, the biggest revenue driver of all. It's no wonder, then, Sony is so keen to push live-service games - its report highlights the success of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>, Gran Turismo and MLB The Show, as well as noting the "eagerly awaited Marathon".
</p><p>Interestingly, the proportion of network services sales has dropped since 2020 from 17 to 14 percent (perhaps due to the rise in hardware sales). However, since 2022, monthly active users have increased 14 percent to 124 million accounts in 2024.</p>

<p>
Another reason for the lower physical software sales last year could be the limited number of first-party games released, which tend to be bought more as physical editions. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a> was the company's biggest release last year, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5-console-sales-top-65m-as-astro-bot-sells-15m-copies-in-first-month">sold 1.5m in its first month</a>, but it was otherwise a quiet year.
</p><p>
PlayStation's decline in physical game sales parallels Nintendo's struggles with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>. As game sizes have increased, it's become more difficult to squeeze them onto physical media - that's why Switch 2 uses game key cards that act as a key for a download. But with digital storage at a premium, it means massive <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-on-switch-2-is-a-game-key-card-thatll-fill-a-third-of-your-consoles-storage-space">games like Final Fantasy 7 Remake will take up huge amounts of capacity</a>.

<p>As we <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fan-made-the-crew-revival-gets-a-release-date-a-year-and-a-bit-on-from-the-ubisoft-racers-controversial-shutdown">reported earlier this month</a>, The Crew Unlimited's devs started working on it not long after Ubisoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/motoring-mmo-the-crew-is-going-offline-in-march-making-it-impossible-to-play"> pulled the racer's official servers offline</a> in March 2024, rendering it unplayable. Cue a group of fans deciding to set up a server emulator that'd allow them to get it up and running again for players who still had the game files installed.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Upon opening up its gullwing doors yesterday, the project quickly ran into some teething issues. In <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1080974618082431018/1107329778396172348/1417303193984962570">an announcement on Discord</a> early this morning, project lead whammy4 revealed that the team have performed "over 10 hours of non-stop tech support" out of the gate, and it looks like the majority of the issues have affected folks who didn't already legitmately own The Crew's game files via Steam prior to grabbing The Crew Unlimited.</p>
<p>"It has come to my attention that a lot of you have acquired (by whichever shady methods...) broken/corrupted game files," the developer wrote. "If you have acquired the game files from shady sources then we are not responsible for whether your game works or not. Players with legit Steam copies have had by far the least issues, no wonder. Also, to those who expect swift 24/7 around-the-clock support for them and them personally - I don't want to say rude things in announcements."</p><p>Prior to the project's release, its developers had acknowledged via their <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1080974618082431018/1246439486641143960/1246479173502107678">Discord FAQ page</a> that while they wouldn't be distributing any of The Crew's game files, "as long as you manage to run the game files, we have absolutely no way to tell a legit copy from a non-legit one, so we just have to let you in."</p>
<p>Around that announcement, the team have put out a number of fixes. The first, a launcher update called <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1080974618082431018/1227040919836954705/1417254654672113735">version 1.1.0.0</a>, fixed the default save "disappearing and preventing the game from logging you in", as well as some DateTime string errors. It also added an 'Apply' button to the cheats section in the hopes of averting some "interface confusion".</p>
<p>That update's been followed by two hotfixes. <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1080974618082431018/1227040919836954705/1417310879262965870">Version 1.1.1.0</a> stopes a default 'TCUPlayer' profile being automatically created and save game names being left blank, while <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1080974618082431018/1227040919836954705/1417332986105430066">version 1.1.2.0</a> rectifies the player being automatically given the username, er, "UserName" instead of the default 'TCUPlayer' due to "a logic error in the launcher" if you clicked play straight away.</p>
<p>I can't remember if I've mentioned this before, but my defining memory of The Crew is not being able to get the Artic Monkeys' 'Do I Wanna Know?' out of my head, no matter what I tried. I'm not sure I wanna know if it's as overplayed in this fan revival.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/overseas-publishers-like-microsoft-want-games-done-as-quickly-as-possible-says-kamiya-who-still-can%E2%80%99t-let-scalebound-go.1298853/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It may be over eight and a half years since Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/action-rpg-scalebound-cancelled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancelled Scale</a>bound, the action game it would publish as a PC and Xbox exclusive from developer PlatinumGames, but Game Director Hideki Kamiya still hasn't let this go.</p>



<p>In the following years, the veteran game designer and director, whose works include Resident Evil 2, Devil May Cry, Viewtiful Joe, Ōkami, Bayonetta, and The Wonderful 101 among others, often remarked on how disappointed he was in what happened with that project. Earlier this year, he even <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideki-kamiya-would-love-to-make-scalebound-again-someday/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> he'd love to resurrect Scalebound someday.</p>



<p>In a fresh interview <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/clovers-interview-kamiya-and-koyama-talk-okami-2-industry-layoffs-and-a-potential-future-with-capcom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with VideoGamesChronicle</a>, he returned to the subject from another perspective: discussing the differences between Japanese and Western publishers.</p>



<p><em>What it feels like when working with Japanese publishers is that the development culture feels closer to mind, and they tend to be more understanding toward creators. On the Japanese side, my impression is that they see you’re trying to make a new invention. They understand the struggle of trying to give birth to something new, and they watch over the process with patience. That’s where I see there’s a difference with publishers.</em></p>



<p>When asked if Scalebound could have made it with a Japanese publisher, Kamiya answered that overseas publishers (like Microsoft in this case) tend to want a game done as quickly as possible. In contrast, Japanese ones might have been more understanding of the difficulties.</p>



<p><em>I do think it would’ve been different. I don’t mean that if it had been a Japanese publisher, the game would necessarily have been completed and released, but I imagine the process itself would have played out differently. Japanese companies tend to be more open to new challenges, and I think the conversations would have been more positive, like, “Okay, so how should we approach this together? For me personally, overseas publishers seem to have a much stronger desire to see a finished product as quickly as possible. If it had been a Japanese publisher, I feel they might have given us more leeway</em></p>



<p>As Kamiya had mentioned before, PlatinumGames did not have a frame of reference for a game where players controlled a dragon and a human character at the same time, which caused problems. Still, having said that, the game director maintains that the ultimate responsibility was his, and with Scalebound's experience, he might work better with a Western publisher in the future.</p>



<p>Kamiya is now working at Clovers, a new studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/okami-sequel-hideki-kamiya/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">developing an Ōkami sequel for CAPCOM</a>.</p>

			<p>The recent release of Chibi-Robo on the Switch 2 Online service was welcome news as the Gamecube title is one of my favourite games of all time. The adventures of a tiny robot whose purpose is to clean may not have sounded like the most exciting premise for a game, but the charm and design elevated it to a true classic. Misc. A Tiny Tale is very clearly inspired by the earlier game and offers a more linear and focused take on the gameplay elements while retaining the charm and humour in spades.</p>
<p><iframe title="Misc. A Tiny Tale - Official Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SlRa1fpf_d4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Whilst Chibi-Robo has a lot of interactions between Chibi and the humans in the house, Misc takes place in a posthuman world where all that is left is the remains of civilisation and a new world is being built by tiny robots. This seemingly grim future is not a depressing setting per se, and instead serves to provide an empty playground for the robots to take centre stage. There is the subtle suggestion that humanity has brought about its own downfall, but this is more of a context than a narrative point. The end result, however, is that a story devoid of humans is paradoxically filled with humanity.</p>


<p>You play as Buddy, a cute little robot with a basic range of platforming abilities and a seemingly bottomless capacity for trash (a trait I can certainly identify with). You can jump, both single and double, hover to reach distant platforms, and move and carry objects. Nothing revolutionary by any means but the tools at your disposal are well used to make each level feel developed and interesting. The biggest nod to Chibi Robo (aside from picking up rubbish) is the little brush you use to clean up stains and spills. This tiny mechanic feels far more satisfying than it should – especially when you’re sat in a messy room trying to avoid actual housework.</p>


<p>The world of Misc is wonderfully detailed and full of character. While it plays out in distinct levels rather than an integrated map this does help to give each area a feel of its own. You’ll travel through various different villages, desolate areas, a junkyard, and even an abandoned human-scale house. Along the way you’ll help a varied cast of other tiny robots and get to know more about your protagonist and his best friend Bag Boy. The latter is distinguished by wearing a paper bag for reasons that only become apparent in the later levels of the game. He is also constantly accompanied by a grumpy and eternally hungry robot cat – which is always a plus point.</p>
<p>The immediate backstory for Misc involves a mysterious explosion that is the catalyst for Buddy’s big adventure. The explosion leaves strange golden cogs scattered around the world – cogs that are needed to activate the doors at the end of each level. While there are ten to find in each stage, only eight are required to progress, whilst there are also incentives to clean all the stains and pick up every piece of rubbish. The levels are easily replayed through the map screen and it is clear what you still have to do in each – although there are times when you’ll need to scour the map to find the last piece of rubbish or spillage. Fortunately you can buy a radar tracker once you’ve found all the golden cogs on a level to help you track down any missed objects.</p>

<p>Some golden cogs are located in difficult to reach areas and require accurate platforming skills whilst others are rewards for helping out other bots. Requests range from watering all the plants in a garden to finding an accessory to make a staple remover hydra feel less intimidating. The main connecting tissue is Buddy, an endlessly optimistic (despite being voiceless) presence who is driven by a pure curiosity and desire to help.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Misc. A Tiny Tale is a real hidden gem. The quality of the level design, the amount of emotional heft in the narrative, and the sheer joy of exploration in the game make it feel like a true successor to Chibi-Robo. Even if it doesn’t quite have the scope of Nintendo’s title, it's a pleasure from beginning to end.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, PocketPair <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEVIBHP37eM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> in a video message that it aims to release Palworld 1.0 next year. To achieve that goal, they will focus on polishing, which means the rest of 2025 won't feature truly big updates to the early access version. Communications Director and Publishing Manager 'Bucky' explained:</p>



<p><em>We've reached a crossroads and need to decide what comes next. While we have a lot of ideas for where we want to take Palworld, we also need to start thinking about 1.0. Beyond just adding new content, there's a lot of cleanup that needs to be done before Palworld can exit early access. It's no secret that it has a lot of quirks and jank, and we want to take the time to properly address those before releasing the game. With that in mind, we plan to start that cleanup this year. Our goal is to ultimately release Palworld next year in 2026. And we think taking the time now to fix those problems will ultimately lead to a better game. So, what does this mean? It means that things will be a little quiet from us for the rest of this year. It also means our winter update won't be as big as Feybreak was. We hope our players understand that we're taking this extra time to improve the game overall. Now, that said, it doesn't mean there will be no updates. We still do have a few surprises planned for our winter update this year. We just want to be transparent about where we're headed and the development of Palworld going forward. It is not slowing down or scaling back; quite the opposite. Version 1.0 will be a major milestone for us, and we have a truly massive amount of content planned for the 1.0 update. Rather than rushing it, we believe that laying the right foundation now will lead to a better game in the end.</em></p>



<p>Bucky also said that PocketPair is also doing other things, such as supporting other small developers through a publishing division and even starting to research other game ideas for future projects. Of course, Palworld is still what most of the company is concentrating on, and it couldn't be any different given the incredible success achieved when the game launched in early 2024, breaking <a href="https://wccftech.com/palworld-sold-3-million-units-in-40-hours-broke-1-million-concurrent-users-on-steam-surpassing-elden-ring/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">record after record</a> for the first few weeks. To this day, PocketPair's survival action monster taming game is third on Steam's all-time concurrent player chart with 2.1 million players. Only Black Myth: Wukong and PUBG have done better. Overall, Palworld has surpassed 32 million players across all platforms earlier this year.</p>



<p>However, the Japanese developer also has to deal with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-is-officially-suing-pocketpair-creators-of-palworld/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo lawsuit</a>, which was filed nearly a year ago for alleged patent infringement. PocketPair is fighting the lawsuit in court, but in the meantime, they were <a href="https://wccftech.com/palworld-developer-outlines-game-changes-caused-by-the-nintendo-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">forced to introduce some changes to the game</a>.</p>

<p>"Segaaah!"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Sega has released a new trailer for the upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/sonic_racing_crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a>, and with it has reignited its rivalry with Nintendo (albeit in a cute, harmless sort of way).</p>
<p>In an effort to pay homage to its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPJw4CfkhMU">Sega Genesis vs. SNES advertisement</a> from the early '90s, the new trailer highlights CrossWorlds' high-speed action, broad customisation, and cross-platform compatibility, all the while throwing <em>slight</em> shade at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>
<p>The trailer starts off with a heavily pixelated look at Mario Kart World (because no one wants to entice the wrath of Nintendo) while stating "We all know <em>that</em> kart racing game, it's great, we don't need to show it to you". A slightly positive note, you might think.</p>
<p>After showcasing Sonic Racing: Crossworlds, however, the trailer then goes back to Mario Kart World, which is represented by a grubby, struggling RV, all the while sarcastically exclaiming:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Oh, uhh, what if you wanna roam around the open world..?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like we said, it's cute, it's harmless, but it's nevertheless a fun way to look back upon Sega's heritage and reference that, yes, both Sega and Nintendo have major racing games launching in 2025.</p>
<p>A demo for Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds will be launching on Switch this week, so be sure to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/sonic-racing-crossworlds-demo-races-onto-switch-next-week">check out all of the details</a> if you're interested. The game itself will land on Switch on <strong>25th September 2025</strong>, while the Switch 2 version is scheduled for later this year.</p>

<p>Which will you pick up?</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Infograph 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/51611eee1fa26/nintendo-infograph-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Following the recent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-september-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">Nintendo Direct</a>, the company has released a handy new infographic showcasing every major game that cropped up during the hour-long broadcast.</p>
<p>Say what you want about the Direct itself, seeing all of these games on one page highlights just how impressive the upcoming line-up of games really is. We've got the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fire-emblem-fortunes-weave">Fire Emblem: Fortune's Weave</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, and more. It's a lot.</p>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Infograph 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/38bcf2407ad39/nintendo-infograph-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://x.com/NintendoUK/status/1967619424455704975">Nintendo</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Of course, questions <em>do</em> still remain, including why on earth Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/icymi-if-you-want-to-play-virtual-boy-classics-youll-need-to-buy-one-of-nintendos-accessories">isn't offering a way to play Virutal Boy games without the use of the headset</a> (or cardboard equivalent), and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/super-mario-galaxy-1-plus-2-prices-are-live-and-its-sticker-shock-time">why the Mario galaxy games are so darn expensive</a> on the Switch. And let's be honest, neither of these will likely be answered.</p>
<p>But if you're wondering <em>"crikey, does the Switch 2 even have games?"</em>, we think the answer is yes, it definitely does. Not all of them will be to your taste, but we feel quite satisfied with the cadence in which new experiences are being released.</p><div><figure data-videoid="4gZSQE4poJM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed402431wnogvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gZSQE4poJM" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>
