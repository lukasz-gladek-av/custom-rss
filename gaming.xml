There are 23 games on offer, ranging from the Dark Souls-inspired roguelike Tyrant's Realm to AAA shooters like Wolfenstein: The New Order and its sequel, Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus. Fans of lo-fi indie horror games will also want to check out Faith, whil anyone who misses bygone gaming eras will want to check out the retro-inspired RPG 8-Bit Adventures 2--which evokes console-style RPGs of the NES, SNES, and PS1--and the adventure-platformer Lunark, which takes inspiration from classics like Out of this World and Flashback. Check out the full list of options below.</p><p>Like other Build-you-own bundle deal at Fanatical, this deal offers a sliding payscale, with the price per game dropping as you add more to your cart. The deal starts at three games for $9 ($3 per game). At five or more games, you'll pay just $2.80 for each game, and at seven or more, it's just $2.60 per key. You can add all 23 games to your bundle if you like, which will cost $59.80 (a $399.67 value).</p><ul><li>100% Orange Juice - Game of the Year Every Year Edition</li><li>8-Bit Adventures 2</li><li>Aura of Worlds</li><li>Beyond Galaxyland</li><li>Bore Blasters</li><li>Discopup</li><li>Faith</li><li>Heavy Rain &amp; Beyond: 2 Souls Collection</li><li>Kamikaze Lassplanes</li><li>Lunark</li><li>Maze Mice</li><li>Mr. Sun's Hatbox</li><li>Pinball Spire</li><li>Snowman Storm</li><li>Soda Crisis</li><li>South of the Circle</li><li>Sunrise's Order</li><li>Takara Cards</li><li>Tiny Life</li><li>Trackline Express</li><li>Tyrant's Realm</li><li>Wolfenstein: The New Order</li><li>Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus</li></ul><hr><h2>Killer Bundle (Winter 2025)</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4615502-03e75a35-056a-4ae6-8339-22bf120ab1db.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4615502" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4615502-03e75a35-056a-4ae6-8339-22bf120ab1db.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4615502"></a><figcaption>Killer Bundle (Winter 2025 Edition)</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4615502-03e75a35-056a-4ae6-8339-22bf120ab1db.jpeg"></figure><p>This new <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Get+23+Steam+Deck-Ready+PC+Games+With+This+Fanatical+Deal&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-12-02+16%3A21%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-12-02+17%3A12%3A56&amp;fnarticle_id=6536656&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tkqlhce.com%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fpick-and-mix%2Fbuild-your-own-killer-bundle&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Ffanatical-bundlefest-dec-2025%2F1100-6536656%2F%3Futm_source%3Dflipboard%26utm_medium%3Dactivitypub&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Killer Bundle Winter 2025 edition</a> marks Fanatical's 1,500th PC game bundle deal, so appropriately enough, it has a long list of game from a variety of genres to choose from.

Pricing for this bundle starts at five games for $5.75 ($1.15 per game), and the price per key drops as you add more games. Pick 10 or more games and you pay just $1 per key, and at 20 or more games you'll pay just $0.95 for each. There's no limit to how many games you can pick, and if you add all 28 possible titles to your bundle, you'll pay just $26.59--that's a huge markdown from the bundle's full $682.79 value.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/nightreign-forsaken-hollows-dlc-map-swamp-field-bosses-2000649718</link>
            <guid>1371088</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I’m one of the many <a href="https://kotaku.com/nightreigns-bell-bearing-carion-draconic-tree-sentinel-2000649218"><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em> players</a> who’s been begging for DLC for months.<a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-dlc-forsaken-hollows-artorias-dark-souls-2000643101"> Once it was finally revealed</a>, I was a bit disappointed at how small it seemed. Fortunately, three new pieces of information have convinced me that I have been underestimating FromSoftware’s upcoming <em>The Forsaken Hollows</em> DLC. According to a new interview, it’ll be harder than the main game, feature a bigger reworking of the map than previously thought, and include the introduction of the <em>Dark Souls</em> studio’s signature poison swamps.</p> <p>Since the summer, it’s felt like the only way to really revitalize <em>Nightreign</em> was by <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-endless-mode-datamine-depths-relics-2000616334">giving players a new map</a>. When <em>The Forsaken Hollows</em> was finally announced, publisher Bandai Namco’s description suggested the Limveld sandbox everyone had become accustomed to would be tweaked but left pretty much intact by the new content. According to a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-forsaken-hollows-dlc-has-reignited-my-interest/1100-6536543/">preview at <em>GameSpot</em></a>, Bandai Namco actually undersold their new content. The new Scholar and Undertaker classes aren’t the only big additions. There’s also the Great Hollows, which is technically still a Shifting Earth event, but is also a much more expansive one than players have previously encountered.</p>

 <p>Players will glide into a separate section of the map with its own fields, city ruins, and sprawling mines. There will even be side-quests where players have to visit side-objectives to alleviate a special new curse. The Great Hollows will apparently be much more vertically focused as well, with caves and tunnels and also points higher up that require light platforming. It definitely sounds like a bigger deal than any of the existing Shifting Earth events players usually just spend the last five minutes of a run zooming through.</p>

 <h2>No new map, but the next best thing</h2> <p>Also, there are swamps now. Not just in the Great Hollows, but the whole of Limveld. These new areas will slow movement and build up poison, scarlet rot, frenzy, and other ailments if you stay in them too long. It sounds simple, but <em>Nightreign</em> is all about navigation, time management, and risk assessment. I can already see many runs succeeding or failing based on players getting too greedy or overly cautious when it comes to traversing these new hazards.</p>

 <p>Director Junya Ishizaki told <em>GameSpot</em> he’s aware of the poison swamp meme, and while there’s no strict rule about every FromSoftware game needing a swamp, it just “always seems to be [that before you realize] someone’s come up with the idea, it’s already sort of in there, and it’s just sort of taken a life of its own.”</p>

 <p>All of these new elements, including new field bosses and some re-worked points of interest, seem aimed at giving seasoned Nightfarers the feeling of playing the game for the first time again, back when they were utterly confused by its mechanics and constantly getting punished for it. This is exactly what fans have been waiting for.</p>

 <h2>Hard enough to feel like you’re playing <em>Nightreign</em> for the first time again</h2> <p>“Obviously, we don’t want it to be so hard that new players can’t get into it, but I think the original idea is that when the game initially had come out, there were even players who are veterans of some of the other games trying to figure out the new systems, trying to figure out how the game works,” Ishizaki said. “I think [we want our] ideas when we’re working on the DLC content to be a reflection of that.”</p>

 <p>He continued, “So whenever people who have played the main game extensively go into the DLC content, they’ll be able to have a bit of that feeling like they had when they first played <em>Nightreign</em>, where there’s still a bit that they’re trying to figure out. [The Forsaken Hollows is] definitely a little bit harder, but it’s not ridiculous or anything like that, but that’s still within what we would consider to be a fair challenge.”</p> <p>I hope he’s lying and players get absolutely wrecked.

<p>Escape from Tarkov is the most popular extraction shooter in the world, boasting hundreds of thousands of active players. It’s a game centered around <strong>loot</strong>, and sometimes, you might need help securing that loot. That’s where Battlestate Games comes in, regularly publishing Escape from Tarkov codes that you can use to get free items.</p>

<p>Battlestate Games has a habit of publishing Escape from Tarkov codes that expire quite quickly, with some only being available for 24 hours.

Planned as the beginning chapter for a story that spans multiple updates, this quest works as an introduction to characters that you’ll end up spending more time with down the line.</p><p>With a new questline for you to complete, two new public events, the introduction of Bounty Hunting, plus a load of additional content (including new fish and a local legend to catch), Burning Springs is our largest update since Wastelanders back in 2020.</p><h3>Welcome to Ohio</h3><p>Burning Springs, a region of southeastern Ohio rocked not only by the nuclear destruction of the bombs dropping, but also the environmental poisoning from the local Abraxodyne Chemical plant. The area is now a desolate and barren wasteland with poisonous water, and a dust storm coating everything in a toxin known as Rust.</p><p>Who would ever want to call this land home? The Rust King is who would.</p><p>A Super Mutant with just as much brains as brawn, The Rust king is the unrelenting and unforgiving ruler of Burning Springs. He has twisted the land into his cruel kingdom, where the only rule is "might makes right."</p><p>Players will cross paths with this monstrous monarch during the new questline. He will task the player with proving their worth and braving the wilds of his wasteland.</p><p>While barren, Burning Springs still holds pockets of life. Highway Town serves as a pit stop for the last of humanity. Built on a section of elevated highway, players will be able to rest and resupply here.</p><p>Highway Town serves as the region's new social hub and a last resort for survivors-- speaking of which, The Last Resort saloon at the end of town also serves up Bounty Hunt contracts.</p><p>Once you unlock the location, you'll be able to fast travel directly to the saloon for maximum Bounty Hunt efficiency!</p><p>You can wander into Burning Springs by crossing the bridge in Point Pleasant. The questline can be started by tuning into the Ohio Distress Signal once they've reached level 30."</p><h3>Bounty Hunting</h3><p>Mosey down to the Last Resort saloon in Highway Town if you're looking to put your gun to work. The Ghoul has set up shop there, providing piles of bounties to plunder.</p><p>To start a Grunt Hunt, just pick up one of the posters off the table. There's plenty to go around, so you can repeat this activity to your heart's content.</p><p>Each time you start a Grunt Hunt, a random location in Burning Springs will be chosen, and a mutation will be applied to your target. Watch out, though, because these mutations are contagious: enemies near your target will also benefit from the effects of the mutation!</p><p>Plan accordingly to take out your target without getting overwhelmed. Adjust your build to counteract their mutation or just go for the classic stealth approach.</p><p>If you're lucky, a Grunt Hunt target might drop a premium Bounty Poster. These will allow you to start a Head Hunt-- an extra challenging bounty hunt in the form of a public event! (Note: these are granted through the Quest Rewards and not found on the body itself.)</p><p>Just place your poster on the bounty board outside of the saloon to send the word wide. All players on the server will be alerted to show up to your aid when you do. Only one Head Hunt can be active at a time, though, so be sure to join in any actives ones before trying to start your own.</p><p>There's dozens of unique Head Hunt targets across a handful of locations. Each has a unique loadout and posse protecting them-- some with pretty wild and weird skills, too!</p><p>If you've got an itchy trigger finger, and caps to spare, The Ghoul would be more than happy to part with a premium poster… for the right price.</p><p>Players will be able to track which Head Hunts they've completed from their Challenges and earn a variety of unique rewards for doing so.</p><p>Speaking of loot, Bounty Hunting is primed to be the premiere path for Legendary Item hunters. Grunt Hunt targets will initially appear as 1-star Legendary enemies. As you complete more, they will eventually make their way toward 2 and 3-star!</p><p>Head Hunt targets will always appear as 3-star legendaries and are flanked by a pair of 2-star posse members.</p><p>But, most importantly, Head Hunts have a chance to drop items with NEW 1-, 2-, and 3-star Legendary effects. Some of these will offer special bonuses for Ghoul or human players…</p><h4>New Legendary Mods</h4><p>As mentioned above, you’ll be able to earn items containing new and exclusive-to-Bounty-Hunting Legendary Mods.</p><ul><li>New 1-Star * Mods</li><li>Feral (Melee Weapon) - Kills make you more feral.</li><li>Sniper's (Ranged Weapon) – Gain 120% bonus damage to weak-points while aiming down sights.</li><li>Adrenal (Weapon) - +10% Damage per kill while on a kill streak.</li><li>Adrenal (Armor) - +10% Damage resistance while on a kill streak.</li><li>Lucid (Weapon) - Increase damage up to 40% based on how full your feral sanity meter is.</li><li>Lucid (Armor ) - Increase damage up to 6% resistance based on how full your feral sanity meter is.</li><li>New 2-Star** Mods</li><li>Pick Pocketer's (Melee Weapon) - Kills have a 50% chance to award a small amount of caps.</li><li>Pain Killer (Armor) - Gain HP Regen based on your kill streak (up to 3 HP per second)</li><li>Rushing (Armor) - Gain AP Regen based on your kill streak (up to 3 AP per second)</li><li>Elementalist's (Armor) - +5 All Resistances (up to +25)</li><li>Fierce (Armor only, not Power Armor) - Fortify limb resistance while on a skill streak (up to 10%, max 50%)</li><li>New 3-Star*** Mods</li><li>Glowing (Weapon) - Kills grant a small amount of Rads.</li><li>Healthy (Armor) - Max HP increased by 20 (up to 100)</li><li>Reflex (Armor) - 2% Evade (up to 10)</li><li>Active (Armor) - Max AP is increased by +20 (up to 100)</li><li>Barbarian (Melee) - +1 STR per kill while on a kill streak.</li></ul><h3>New Public Events</h3><p>Gearin’ Up</p><p>Have you ever wanted to help a Deathclaw prepare for its debut in an Arena deathmatch? Now’s your chance!</p><p>The Rust King requires a new combatant. Your job is to head over to the Junkyard and help The Beastmaster gather the scrap metal needed to armor up her latest tamed Deathclaw.</p><p>During this public event, you'll fight alongside your Deathclaw-in-training against the wastelands wildest foes. Just be sure to keep the beast alive! It can't die a glorious death in the arena if doesn't survive the junkyard first…</p><p>Remember: you can heal friendly NPCs using the Medic's Legendary Mod. Don't have one? Well luckily a new unique named weapon, the Stimpike, comes with this pre-installed! You'll have a chance to earn it-- alongside many other rewards-- by completing this event.</p><p>Sinkhole Solutions</p><p>Fires rage beneath the surface of Burning Springs and natural gas deposits occasionally breach the surface near places where the ground has broken.</p><p>Willow, a resident of Highway Town, needs your help culling Radscorpions and Stingwings that have gathered around a highly volatile sinkhole. These creatures are causing issues for the residents of Highway Town so you’ll need to head over to the aptly named Scorpion Lake to activate a “stomper” device to draw them out of their dens.</p><p>Your objective will be to destroy their dens, all while dodging pillars of fire and navigating a blinding sandstorm.</p><p>Also, stick around to the end to learn why Radscorpions aren't an apex predator…</p><h3>Additional Content</h3><p>More Fish</p><p>Assuming you can even find them, the watering holes around Burning Springs are poisonous and irradiated, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t new fish to catch. Explore this new zone and find new fish (including a Local Legend) to add to your collections.</p><p>Side Quest: Dirty Laundry</p><p>Keep a sharp eye out for mysterious Abraxodyne intel briefcases hidden all over Burning Springs. Return them to Bodhi in the city of Athens to take part in the Dirty Laundry side quest.</p><p>Unlike other collectibles, these brief cases appear in specific locations, once per player. You'll have to search every nook and cranny to find all 150.</p><p>(Schoolyard rumors say there's a 151st one hidden under a red truck, but we're pretty sure that's made-up.)</p><p>As you turn these cases in, you'll help Bodhi unravel the mystery of his missing daughter-- and earn unique Abraxodyne-themed rewards along the way.</p><p>You'll earn a unique Legendary weapon for completing the quest-- which only requires finding about half of the total cases-- but you'll get an even more powered-up version if you find every last one.</p><h3>Season 23: Blood X Rust</h3><p>Season 23: Blood X Rust is here to inspire you to unleash your inner raider spirit.</p><h3>Closing Milepost Zero</h3><p>The bandits roaming Skyline Valley looking for caravans to rob have proved themselves to be dastardly threats to the Blue Ridge Caravan Company. Scaring poor brahmin into going off track, leaving deliveries incomplete.</p><p>For now, Milepost Zero will be closing shop and moving their wares to other vendors across Highway Town. Awaiting a time in the future when things might be a bit safer for their operations.</p><p>The rewards from Milepost Zero are now spread across the Wasteland:</p><ul><li>Plans for the V63 Laser Carbin and mods have been moved to the Weapon Vendor Splint in Highway Town.</li><li>Mac in Highway Town will sell the following items:</li><li>Rolled Persian Rug</li><li>Persian Wall Rug</li><li>Makeshift Wine Rack</li><li>Noren Curtains</li><li>Park Ranger Supply Box</li><li>Persian Rug</li><li>Stargazer’s Telescope</li><li>Lightning Battery Lamp</li><li>Noren Awing</li><li>Snow Globes from the Milepost Zero vendors will now be sold by Windy in Highway Town (she is a Gold Bullion vendor).</li><li>Spooky Scorched will reward the Lederhosen Outfit &amp; Hat, Redcoat Outfit *Hat, and the Vault Girl/Vault Boy backpacks.</li><li>Holiday Scorched will reward all the Skyline Valley specific Snow Globes.</li></ul><p>All characters who completed the “A Bump In the Road” Caravan intro quest will receive the title “Caravan Investor” (immediately upon logging in).</p><p>We will also be granting a pennant that can be used account wide (any character on the account will have access to this pennant) and characters that have completed the quest will also receive 2K Gold Bullion. The Pennant will be granted during the first week of Burning Spring’s release while players should expect to see the 2K Gold Bullion upon logging into characters who have completed then quest.</p><p>We believe that Bounty Hunting delivers on the same promise of on-demand content, with Legendary enemies, and great rewards in a more succinct and satisfying way. We love the Skyline Valley region and have some fun things planned.</p><h3>New C.A.M.P. Pet - Radhog</h3><p>One of the new creatures you’ll find in Burning Springs is the Radhog. They’re tough and fiercely protective of their young, so if you get too close expect to be attacked.</p><p>What would happen if you brought one to your C.A.M.P.? You would probably have the most adorably disgusting pet this side of the Ohio River!</p><p>After purchasing the Radhog C.A.M.P. Pet from the Atomic Shop, the radhog bed item can be found in the “Dwellers” section of the Workshop menu and its Nose Ring is in the “Pet Clothing” section of the Armor Workbench.</p><h3>New Seasonal Weapon – Dom Pedro</h3><p>A new weapon is entering the fray.</p><p>The Dom Pedro is a Hand Cannon that can fire .50 rounds or be swapped to .308. It has an explosive effect and can pierce enemies too. Really sending a message to anyone foolish enough to stand in your way.</p><h3>Emote Wheel</h3><p>Whether you’re hitting your favorite emote at the wandering traveler passing by in the hulking Power Armor skin or trying to convince a level 30 Vault Dweller to pick up the loot you just dropped for them, emoting is core to the Appalachian way of living.</p><p>In the Burning Springs update we’re reorganizing emotes so that more emotes can be equipped at once.</p><p>We’re doing this by:</p><ul><li>introducing 2 new categories, “Social” and “Performance”</li><li>removing the “Follow Me” and “Team Up” categories and placing most of their emotes into “Help” and “Social”</li><li>reorganizing the emotes in the “Misc” so that more of them live in more appropriate categories like “Performance” and “Taunt”.</li></ul><p>With the work done here, you can now equip all your favorite emotes at once with little to no need to go into the Atomic Shop to swap them in and out.</p><h3>Gleaming Depths</h3><p>Almost a year after its introduction, Gleaming Depths has proved to be an excellent place for players looking for an endgame challenge to push themselves and their builds to the limit.</p><p>We’re introducing a new weekly challenge for Gleaming Depths that can be completed by working through all stages of the raid. Your reward for doing so will be a 4-Star Legendary cache that contains a 4-Star Armor, Power Armor, Melee Weapon, and a Ranged Weapon.</p><p>To go along with this new weekly challenge, we’re also redistributing the raid rewards so that the farther you progress in Gleaming Depths the more enticing the rewards will be. We know this may cause some disruption to your local EN06 farming group (and you can still farm him for XP), but it was never our intention to have one phase of the raiding experience be the source of some of the most coveted rewards in the game.</p><p>In this update we’re also fixing numerous bugs and introducing quality-of-life improvements to make the raiding experience smoother for everyone.</p><hr><h3>Combat</h3><p>Combat in Appalachia has experienced a lot of changes since the Skyline Valley update was released last year. For Burning Springs we’re slowing things down to see how it all settles.</p><p>We are making a few more adjustments to V.A.T.S. to address the feedback we’ve received after the Fallout 76: C.A.M.P. Revamp update. All in all, you should experience far less instance of V.A.T.S. chance to hit fluctuations and targeting issues.</p><ul><li>Fixed cryo slow being applied to players who aren't in PvP.</li><li>Fixed an issue where Hack and Slash could damage players outside of PvP.</li></ul><h3>C.A.M.P.</h3><ul><li>All items from the Mischief Night rewards now appear in the Build menu.</li><li>Build budgets of various items have been adjusted.</li><li>Fixed an issue which could cause the Store/Scrap button to not work when pressed by the player.</li><li>Straw Goat decoration plans are now known by default for all players.</li><li>Fixed issue where C.A.M.P.

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/skate-4-reboot-ea-no-offline-mode-always-online-2025-1851777885">EA’s live-service reboot of <em>Skate</em>,</a> which launched back in September, is continuing to expand and improve. The skateboarding game’s second season is out now, and fans mostly appreciate the new content and changes. But a lot of players aren’t happy about their in-game characters suddenly looking sick and tired after season two went live, with some jokingly referring to them as drug addicts or stoners.</p> <p>On December 2, <a href="https://kotaku.com/skate-4-reboot-ea-launch-date-september-xbox-ps5-pc-trailer-2000620375"><em>Skate</em> season two went live on all platforms.</a> The update adds cosmetic items, fresh areas to skate, a new trick (the Impossible), and a host of quality-of-life tweaks and visual changes. That’s all good and nice, and overall, fans are happy about the update, even if there are some odd lag issues at the moment. But many players were surprised to find their characters looking different, a bit more tired perhaps, when logging on Tuesday to play <em>Skate</em>. As part of EA and developer Full Circle’s commitment to improving <em>Skate’s</em> visuals, a lot of characters now have dark bags under their eyes and darker complexions.</p>

 <p>“Why the faces look so tired and weird?” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SkateEA/comments/1pcibc1/why_the_faces_looks_so_tired_and_weird/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">asked one Redditor</a> on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SkateEA/comments/1pciob3/season_2_comparison/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><em>Skate</em> subreddit.</a> Someone else joked that the new update had <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SkateEA/comments/1pchvpk/update_ghould_my_character/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">“Ghoul’d” their character.</a> On Twitter, some replies to EA’s tweet announcing the new <em>Skate</em> update included more screenshots of characters that now look a lot more tired than before. One user shouted at EA: “Look what you did to MY FACE! Look at my face! Look at it!” <a href="https://x.com/Koreyzzz/status/1995931933600350654">Another player shared an image of their character </a>with darker eyes and mentioned that the <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/skate/news/the-grind-vol-six#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIt%E2%80%99s%20important%20to,our%20future%20updates.%E2%80%9D">devs had previously promised to make characters look better</a> and didn’t think that this update accomplished that.</p>

Hopefully, next time everyone won’t look so tired.</p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/horses-steam-epic-games-store-banned/</link>
            <guid>1371040</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Santa Ragione's <em>Horses</em>, the unsettling horror game in which horses are naked human slaves wearing horse masks, won't be released on the Epic Games Store after all. <em>Horses </em>was previously <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/santa-ragione-co-founder-pietro-righi-riva-on-horses-steam-and-possible-closure-of-the-studio?ref=aftermath.site"><u>banned from release on Valve Software's Steam platform</u></a>, too. Publisher Santa Ragione, which released survival horror game <em>Saturnalia</em> in 2022, announced on Monday that Epic Games alerted the company just 24 hours ahead of its release that the game wouldn't be published on Tuesday.</p><p>Epic Games told Santa Ragione that <em>Horses</em> violates its content guidelines—"specifically the ‘Inappropriate Content’ and ‘Hateful or Abusive Content’ policies," <a href="https://www.horses.wtf/BannedFromSteam/index.html?ref=aftermath.site"><u>according to a reprint of the message published on the <em>Horses</em> website</u></a>. Epic Games communications director Jake Jones confirmed that the platform "found violations of those guidelines during our extensive review," and pointed Aftermath towards the correspondence published on the <em>Horses</em> website. Santa Ragione "immediately" appealed the decision, it said, but that appeal was rejected.</p><p>Epic Games specifically said it prohibits content that “contains explicit or frequent depictions of sexual behavior or not appropriately labeled, rated, or age-gated" and "promotes abuse and animal abuse." Santa Ragione denies that <em>Horses</em> includes these things.</p><p><em>Horses </em>is described on its GOG storefront as a "first-person game with live-action sequences." It takes place over the span of fourteen days in-game and will test a player's "obedience, complicity, and restraint" as they play as a college student working on a weird-as-fuck farm. <em>Horses</em>&nbsp;is currently listed on GOG's recent best-selling games page, after only&nbsp;<em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Prypiat</em>'s enhanced edition. </p><p><em>Horses </em>has a pretty lengthy content warning, which certainly provides a better understanding of the sort of imagery in the game:</p><p><em>"This game contains scenes of physical violence, psychological abuse, gory imagery (mutilation, blood), depictions of slavery, physical and psychological torture, domestic abuse, sexual assault, suicide, and misogyny. The inclusion of these elements is intended to depict and characterize a fictional world and its fictional inhabitants. The presence of these elements is not an endorsement of them, nor do they reflect the beliefs or values of the creators. Some scenes also feature unsettling sounds, such as chewing and swallowing, which may be disturbing for players with sound sensitivities or related phobias. Character dialogue also includes references to psychological trauma that may be upsetting, especially for those who may have had similar experiences in their pasts. Player discretion is advised. If you feel uncomfortable or upset while playing, please consider stepping away and reaching out to someone you trust."</em></p><p>The game <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/horses-004d87?ref=aftermath.site"><u>does still have an Epic Game Store page</u></a>; several critics reportedly reviewed the game ahead of launch on the platform, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horses-review?ref=aftermath.site"><u>including IGN</u></a>.</p><p>Epic Games claimed in its email to Santa Ragione that the game received an Adult's Only (AO) rating from the International Age Rating Coalition. Santa Ragione said that when <em>it</em> filled out the IARC questionnaire, it received a PEGI 18 or ESRB M rating. AO rated games aren't allowed on the Epic Games Store—except games that received that rating for the inclusion of NFTs or blockchain—but mature or 18+ games are. Aftermath has reached out to IARC for clarification on <em>Horses</em>' rating. Santa Ragione said it submitted its certification of its rating to the Epic Games Store ahead of its release.</p><p>Epic Games wasn't specific about <em>what</em> caused the ban, and neither was Valve when it originally rejected the game from being published on its platform in 2023. Santa Ragione said in late November that the game was banned in 2023 after the company had to upload an early build of the game—a requirement to getting a Steam storefront page up and running. Valve rejected the build without comment, and Santa Ragione said on its website it was likely due to a scene in which a "young girl" rides on the shoulders of a naked adult woman with a horse head. Santa Ragione said it has since changed all characters in the game to be in their 20s or older.</p><p>"Regardless of a developer’s intentions with their product, we will not distribute content that appears, in our judgment, to depict sexual conduct involving a minor," Valve wrote in an automated review sent to the studio, according to the FAQ on the <em>Horses</em> website.</p><p>Santa Ragione said in its FAQ that the Steam ban isn't related to the recent restrictions on adult content that caused <a href="https://aftermath.site/itch-io-nsfw-adult-content-remove-payment-processors-collective-shout/"><u>a major "deindexing" of NSFW games</u></a> on Itch.io and the outright removal of others there and on Steam. That's because Valve's rejection of the game happened in 2023, before conservative activist group Collective Shout's campaign to harass game platforms into removing anything it deemed objectionable. The group went after game platforms by harnessing the power of payment processors—<a href="https://aftermath.site/podcasts/aftermath-hours-podcast-steam-itch-porn-payment-processors/"><u>with payment processors determining what's acceptable sexual content and what's not</u></a>, platforms like itch.io and Steam complied or risked having access to the processors removed.</p><p>This sort of censorship-by-payment-processor can have a chilling impact on the industry; in an effort to protect children, these restrictions can end up restricting free expression of even mildly-uncomfortable ideas. <em>Horses</em> certainly seems to push up against these restrictions, but its developers said it doesn't cross them: the game is supposed to be "challenging, adult storytelling," the publisher said on its website.</p><p>Guidelines for platforms like Steam and the Epic Games Store are often written in such a way that leaves some grey area for certain content—platforms then can apply these restrictions however they'd like, and in ways that often feel confusing to players. Both Epic Games Store and Steam sell sex games and games with graphic violence. For instance, there are a lot of "anime boob games," <a href="https://kotaku.com/it-s-not-easy-putting-a-gay-sex-game-on-steam-1782457390?ref=aftermath.site"><u>as Nathan put it in 2016</u></a>, but not many gay sex games. He spoke to game developer Robert Yang about getting his games on the platform: Dicks can be used for "exploitation or titillation," but not in the context of sex.</p><p>"We respect players enough to present the game as intended and to let adults choose what to play; lawful works should not be made unreachable by a monopolistic storefront’s opaque decisions," Santa Ragione said. "Steam publicly downplays human curation in favor of algorithmic sales optimization, yet intervenes with censorship when a game’s artistic vision does not align with what the platform owners considers acceptable art. Steam’s behavior passively shapes which titles developers feel safe creating, pushing preemptive censorship."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Use these Roblox Merge And Fight monthly redeem codes for December 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Seeds, Buckets, Potions and much more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Merge And Fight is a fusion of Plants Vs Brainrots and the iconic Plants vs. Zombies title. Players must increase their total output and total DPS to build the best garden filled with the finest plants. Furthermore, one must defeat the most profitable high-HP brainrots to increase their revenue contribution. This is when the active Merge And Fight codes come into play. Redeem these <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-survive-wave-z-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> codes to have your inventory overflowing with various Potions and Gears. New players using the codes will quickly secure the finest early-game brainrots and build the most damage-inflicting plants without grinding.&nbsp;</p>







<h2 id="h-active-merge-and-fight-codes">Active Merge And Fight Codes</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>update1</strong>&nbsp; – x2 Jalapeno Seed, x3 Iron Bucket, and Damage Potion (New)</li>



<li><strong>cactus</strong> – x2 Cactus Seed, x3 Golden Bucket, x2 Plant Attack Potion, and x5 Freeze Grenade&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>pea</strong> – 2x Damage Potion, 2x Seed Potion, Speed Potion, and 3x Buckets of Water&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>plantsmerge</strong> – x1 Brainrot Potion, x1 Gloves, and x1 Cactus Seed</li>



<li><strong>welcome</strong> – Damage Potion, x2 Buckets of Water and x1 Shuriken&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-inactive-merge-and-fight-codes">Inactive Merge And Fight Codes</h2>



<p>There are no expired codes as of the writing of this article. You can expect new codes to be released during milestones and major in-game updates.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-redeem-merge-and-fight-codes">How To Redeem Merge And Fight Codes?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Merge And Fight Code Redemption Page | Image By Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Follow the steps below to redeem all the active codes:&nbsp;</p>



<ol>
<li>Launch Merge And Fight and spawn on the map.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Hit the “Store” button.</li>



<li>Scroll down to the last or press the “Redeem Code” key to see the code box.</li>



<li>Enter any code into the “Enter Code” text box.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Press the “Redeem” button to activate the code.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-more-about-merge-and-fight-codes">More About Merge And Fight Codes</h2>



<p>Gears claimed from the active codes have the following use:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>Wooden Bucket – Reduce plant growth time by 30 seconds.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Freeze Grenade – Throws to freeze brainrots for a while.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Shuriken – Throw to deal 120 damage and bounce 2 additional times.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Gloves – Click to deal 600 damage to brainrots.</li>



<li>Iron Bucket – Reduce plant growth time by 3 minutes.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Golden Bucket – Reduce plant growth time by 10 minutes.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Damage Potion – All plants ATK +50%, lasts 30 minutes.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Brainrot Potion – Legendary+ brainrot spawn chance +100%, lasts 30 minutes.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>







<p>Use the free Potions when you see boss brainrots walking down the Brainrot Portal. Freeze Grenades are useful because they can stun high HP brainrots and bring them down slowly. When you place rare plants, they’ll take quite some time to grow. This is when you must use the Bucket gears. They will help you ignore the annoying waiting time and quickly set up a sturdy defence in your garden.&nbsp;</p>

            <guid>1370995</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/ken-levine-judas-ghost-story-games-art-no-release-date-update/">Three months after its first developer blog</a>, Ghost Story Games and Ken Levine are back to remind everyone that Judas is still around, that the studio is still working on it, and that it is still planning to be released, eventually. On that last point, no, the blog does not include a release date or an indication as to when it'll be out. In fairness, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-nominees-full-list/">a trailer at The Game Awards</a> could give players all the answers they want that are not included in this blog, but we could also just as easily go another year wondering how the spiritual successor to BioShock is coming along.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.judasthegame.com/news/dev-log-2">As far as what the blog does include,</a> we get a new piece of concept art of the game's titular character, Judas. We also hear from several members of the development team, instead of just hearing from Ken Levine, with lead narrative designer Drew Mitchell, lead artist Karen Segars, and studio art director Nathan Phail-Liff all contributing comments on the creative process behind Judas, and more specifically, the development of its main character.</p>



<p>"<em></em><em>The project began with us wanting to tell stories that are less linear, that react to the player and unfold in ways that no one’s ever seen in one of Ken’s games</em>," said Mitchell. "<em>That told us a lot up front about what we’d need: namely, characters with strong, competing objectives, who each had a stake in everything the player did. Starting with that framework, we spent a lot of time thinking about those characters, their conflicts, the right setting to force them all together, and the systems underpinning it all. For a long time, there wasn’t even a set protagonist — just sort of a cipher, a blank slate.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Eventually, the story and world started to coalesce into something specific, and we needed to figure out who the player character should be. As a rule, you want to put your heroes in the last place they ever want to find themselves. So, what kind of person would really struggle to deal with all these relationships and warring interests? And I remember that was the point where Ken came up with this monologue that kicked everything off.</em>"</p>



<p>Studio art director Nathan Phail-Liff also added comments on how the game's setting evolved in its creation, and how it grew from a more practical location to what it is now. "<em></em><em>At the beginning of its journey, it was a more practical, conventional, modular starship. But over the course of its mission, due to conflict between factions of people and ideals, it's changed into what you see now. And we're working on communicating this through the environment.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em></em><em>Like with any city with significant history, if you start digging up the street, you would find layers of the city's past.  Older eras of street long buried, forgotten, and built over by the roads upon which you now walk.  With the Mayflower as a generational starship, we want to imbue this world with the same sense of time, history, and credibility; this is a civilization that went through eras of conflict and rebirth. And having the characters and the architecture of the world reflect those layers of the onion is a powerful mechanism for visual storytelling. This allows players to act as a sort of historian and architect as they explore the Mayflower. Through uncovering more, you’ll make increasingly informed decisions with the story and characters on your journey.</em>"</p>



<p>All of this is, ultimately, wonderful insight to how Judas has been created in the years since development began, and it's good to see Ghost Story Games communicating to players with a little more frequency than we've seen previously.</p>



<p>Hopefully, this continues, and we'll get an even better look into the game and perhaps even some gameplay soon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>After a week of viral clips and outrage from anime fans and AI-haters alike, Amazon has taken down the AI-generated English dub for </span><i><span>Banana Fish</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>The embarrassingly bad dub of the action-packed yaoi was a first for Amazon and was labeled as an “AI Beta” in the series’ language options. Instead of hiring voice actors with all of Jeff Bezos’ fuck you money, Amazon uploaded an AI voice track that is monotone, weirdly mixed, and makes even the most exciting scenes sound like a boring text-to-speech demonstration. Anime is known for its dynamic voice performances, and this shit sounds like it barely gets above a whisper. Here’s a clip, and sorry for putting it somewhere you can hear it:</span></p> <div><blockquote cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@animedomainx/video/7577995965458648328" data-video-id="7577995965458648328" data-embed-from="oembed"> <section> <a target="_blank" title="@animedomainx" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@animedomainx?refer=embed">@animedomainx</a>  <p>This is Back ngl 🥀 Amazon has started using Al to dub shows, and the first anime to receive an English Al dub is Banana Fish. Many voice actors are speaking out against Amazon’s decision, criticizing the use of Al and the fact that human voice actors were not compensated. Banana Fish is an action-packed crime thriller that follows a young, intelligent gang leader named Ash Lynx as he investigates a mysterious d_rug called “Banana Fish” while trying to protect a pure-hearted Japanese boy, Eiji Okumura, in the dangerous underworld of 1980s New York City Follow For Daily Anime News <a title="bananafish" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/bananafish?refer=embed">#BananaFish</a></p> <p> <a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - Anime DomainX | Anime News" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7577996058077301511?refer=embed">♬ original sound – Anime DomainX | Anime News</a> </p></section> </blockquote></div>  <p><span>After days of ridicule, Amazon has </span><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/anime-shows/after-widespread-criticism-for-the-use-of-ai-voice-actors-amazon-removes-ai-dub-from-anime-series-banana-fish/"><span>removed the fake English dub</span></a><span> from its streaming services. Bullying works. Hire actors. Bezos has </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/real-time-billionaires/"><span>billions of dollars</span></a><span>, and you’re telling me that man can’t afford to put someone in a booth?&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>As of this writing, the Spanish AI-generated dub is still available, but we’ll see if that lasts. The next question is, will Amazon continue to roll back this decision by releasing a proper English dub with real actors? God knows the company has the money to do it.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Anime isn’t the only industry that has started relying on generative AI to add voices to creative works. Video games like </span><i><span>Arc Raiders </span></i><span>have AI-generated voices, and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-gen-ai-arc-raiders-brendan-green-2000644914"><span>rich people are lining up to tell you</span></a><span> that replacing real voice actors with soulless droning machines is good, actually. A lot of AI apologia relies on the false notion that AI-generated content is good enough to replace human-made work, and if this is the best it has to offer, everyone will continue to rally against it.</span></p>

<p>Eidos-Montreal, the studio known for developing Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy and supporting games like Tomb Raider and others, has had more layoffs.</p>



<p>Over the last week, a number of now former employees took to LinkedIn to announce that they were no longer with the company.</p>







<p><strong>“Hey there!”</strong> gameplay director <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7398821593012989953/?originTrackingId=HOT3SE08iXRoDN1N9LEmuQ%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Samuel Daher wrote</a>. <strong>“Was working at Eidos, loved it and would have stayed, but times are difficult.”</strong></p>



<p>In total, at least a dozen or more people are now looking for work. This is the second known wave of job cuts at the studio <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/eidos-montreal-another-embracer-studio-suffers-large-scale-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">after 75 people were let go</a> back in March. At the time, it was said that the layoffs were done due to “mandates coming to an end”.</p>



<p>And while one would hope that the latest layoffs are the end, that doesn’t appear to be the case. In recent days, multiple sources have explained to Insider Gaming most projects at the studio have been cancelled. The focus for Eidos-Montreal right now, they say, is on the work it’s doing with Microsoft and Xbox on games like Grounded 2 and Fable. There’s also another internal project that started development in 2019 which, sources say, has no way of recouping its current costs. </p>



<p>After those projects wrap, however, <strong>“additional staff reductions are already forecasted.”</strong></p>







<p>Insider Gaming has attempted to reach out to both Eidos-Montreal and its parent company Embracer for comment. As of writing, no responses have been received. In the past, Embracer has often declined to give an official comment on subjects such as layoffs and internal development projects. </p>

Tribute Games, Marvel Cosmic Invasion sees Earth’s Mightiest Mortals team up to take on Annihilus and his Annihilation Wave. Designed to look like an old-school SNES action game with its pixel-art graphics, the game features a roster of 15 heroes. The lineup includes popular characters like Captain America, Storm, and Spider-Man, alongside more obscure heroes like Beta Ray Bill and Quasar, all rendered in a style that evokes classic ’90s video games.</p><hr><p><strong>Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter:</strong></p><hr><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-game-amiibo-preorder-buying-guide-nintendo-switch-2/1100-6530754/">Metroid Prime 4 Buying Guide - Amiibo Restock, Deals On Switch 2 Gear, And More</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/upgrade-nintendo-switch-2-storage-with-steeply-discounted-samsung-512gb-microsd-express/1100-6530578/">Last Chance To Get Cyber Monday Deals On MicroSD Express Cards For Switch 2</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dualsense-limited-edition-ps5-controllers-on-sale-for-black-friday/1100-6536412/">DualSense Limited Edition PS5 Controllers On Sale For Black Friday</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-and-switch-2-black-friday-game-deals-available-now/1100-6535728/">Check Out Over 200 Nintendo Switch Game Deals For Black Friday</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-black-friday-sale-switch-exclusive-game-deals/1100-6536453/">Eight Nintendo Switch Exclusives Are 50% Off In Walmart's Black Friday Sale</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-first-ps5-pro-deal-in-six-months-is-up-for-grabs-for-a-limited-time/1100-6526406/">The First PS5 Pro Deal In Six Months Is Up For Grabs For A Limited Time</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-ps5-slim-bundles-and-collectors-edition-get-huge-discounts/1100-6534326/">Ghost Of Yotei PS5 Slim Bundles And Collector's Edition Get Huge Discounts</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdo-ultimate-2-switch-2-pc-controller-review-best-deals-at-amazon/1100-6529695/">Save Big On 8BitDo's Stellar Ultimate 2 Controllers In Amazon's Black Friday Sale</a></li>   </ul> </div>

The developers said Tuesday they’ve managed to cut down the PC file size for <em>Helldivers 2</em> by about 85 percent, freeing up enough space for at least one or two more large games.</p><p>In a <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F553850%2Fview%2F491583942944621371" rel="sponsored">post on the game’s Steam page</a>, the developers explained that they’ve been working on slimming down the game while also adding new content:</p><div><blockquote><p>“The longer term goal has always been to bring the PC installation size much closer in line with the console versions. We are happy to report that, thanks to our partners at Nixxes, we have reached that goal much sooner than expected.

The original file size was significantly larger because the developers were duplicating game asset data to improve load times on mechanical HDDs, which they estimate about 11 percent of <em>Helldivers 2</em> players are currently using.</p><p>However, as the post on the update explains, the developers now know that load times in <em>Helldivers 2</em> are mainly due to level generation, not loading game assets, so duplicating asset data was offering minimal benefit and impacting a small percentage of players (while making the file size larger for everyone).</p><p>Anyone with the PC version of <em>Helldivers 2</em> can opt in for the technical public beta on Steam to get the “slim” version of the game, which will eventually become the default version after the developers iron out any remaining issues that come up in beta testing.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6ODAzMzIw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Stevie Bonifield</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/836948/helldivers-2-file-size-decrease]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new leak on social media for Fortnite hints at a huge collaboration with South Park. The event, if true, would have several big elements like a Rift Anomaly and multiple mech skins.</p>



<p>Chapter 7 of Fortnite has been off to a great start for fans. Not only did players get&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-leaks-kill-bill-hollywood/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a Kill Bill collaboration</a>, but skins for Back to the Future and a new map. With the live-service title collabing with basically every IP out there, there’s one vulgar one that would feel right at home: South Park. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-south-park-collab-coming-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rumors of a collab</a> have been here and there, but one reliable Twitter user dropped a huge leak as to what South Park will be like in Fortnite.</p>











<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>SOUTH PARK x FORTNITE IS A BIG COLLAB</p><p>• MULTIPLE SKINS AS MECHS<br>• Rift Anomaly: "Everyone Kills Kenny"  <br>• At least 1 Boss on the map<br>• Stick of Truth Mythic<br>• Respawn Token/Medallion<br>• Unknown Consumable<br>&amp; more.. <a href="https://t.co/veNGth1U9k">pic.twitter.com/veNGth1U9k</a></p></div>— HYPEX (@HYPEX) <a href="https://twitter.com/HYPEX/status/1995938479830929447?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>The leak in question comes from <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1995938479830929447" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">HYPEX</a>, a well-known leaker in the Fortnite community. They’ve gotten many details from past seasons correct and are generally accurate. This time, the leak pertains to South Park, as it is seemingly making its way into Fortnite. While no date was given as to when, information regarding the collab has dropped.</p>



<p>As it seems, the Fortnite x South Park collab will feature skins for the mechs and a few collectibles. However, the biggest ones are that a Boss will spawn on the map relating to the adult-animated series. Furthermore, a Rift Anomaly, aptly titled “Everyone Kills Kenny,” will be part of it, though no details on how it will play out were stated.</p>



<p>Given the recent popularity of South Park, it’s no surprise to see it collaborate with Fortnite. It wouldn’t be South Park’s first foray into gaming, as the show has garnered two RPGs and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/south-park-snow-day-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other tie-in games</a>. In fact, South Park: The Stick of Truth was a hit with critics and fans, being a near-ideal translation from its TV counterpart. While Fortnite’s version may be toned down for the player base, it’s sure to hit the same marks it did in 1997.</p>







<p>What do you think of the South Park x Fortnite leak? Excited to see more? Which characters do you want to see in the game? Want South Park to get The Simpsons treatment in Chapter 6?

<p>This new patch brings all of the tweaks and additions made to other versions of the game (which we reckon is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-nintendo-switch-2-edition">really very good</a>, actually) to Switch 1 and 2, so there's total parity across all versions.</p>
<p>That means the Switch releases have received the CPU Ranked Match mode, the new "Advance Win" feature — which allows you to call time on matches with huge leads (as well as some anti-cheat measures for online) — and a bunch of other tweaks and fixes to boot.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067utwjzh&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>

<p>The game's executive producer (and Level-5 CEO, lest we forget), Akihiro Hino, dropped the full deets <a href="https://x.com/AkihiroHino/status/1995815684304150948?s=20">on social media</a>, although we are still awaiting some more detailed patch notes. Here's the tweet, plus the machine translation below:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The latest version of Inazuma Eleven: Heroes' Victory Road has been updated. The versions are 1.4.0 and 1.4.1. Distribution will begin on each platform at various times. It will be after 9 PM for all platforms. The time may be subject to change.<br>
・Advance Win, Advance Time<br>
・First-time route unlock battle: Kizuna Star x5<br>
・AI ranked match<br>
And so on, including bug fixes, many new features will be implemented across platforms including Switch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With this latest update, alongside 1.3's added ranked level cap and bug fixes, Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road is certainly in good shape, and looking and playing every bit the soccer star that it is!</p>
<p>The game launched back in the middle of November, and Ethan called it "the franchise’s most premium experience yet" in our recent review:</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Ghost Story Games, the studio founded by BioShock creator Ken Levine, has released a new short teaser for its upcoming FPS Judas. This little teaser shows different environments of The Mayflower, the colony ship that Judas, the main character, lives on. The Mayflower is an environment filled with decades of changes, which Judas has to navigate along with the different relationships which she finds difficult to do.</p>
<p><iframe title="Judas Environment Themes" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2O-29-fOEE4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In the new Judas dev log, the team said, <em>“We put her in a science fiction world, a colony ship filled with robots — a futuristic setting that makes someone like her extremely powerful. But it’s also a world where personal success hinges on how well you can conform to the rules, because dissent would lead to the failure of the mission. That makes her an outlaw, a pariah — a Judas. That tension at the heart of the character came to inform everything about the game, which we stopped thinking of as an FPS and started calling a “Judas Simulator.” Everything comes back to that core idea of you interacting with the world as Judas.”</em></p>
<p>The Mayflower is split into different sections from VIP Pilgrim Quarters, Regular Pilgrim Dorms, and Violator Quarters with each having its own distinct style. These styles show the divides within a society where the citizens have devolved into a bitter battle of constantly spying on one another and dobbing one another in for even the slightest offences. It’s machines, not people who are in control of business, art, government, and they’re trying to turn the humans into robotic model citizens.</p>

<p>Judas does not have a release date yet, but it is expected for PC, Xbox Series XS, and PS5.</p>
