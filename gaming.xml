            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/latest-magic-gathering-commander-ban-list-update-enrages-fanbase<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Recently, Wizards of the Coast quietly updated their <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> Commander ban list. Unlike the recent update to their <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-ban-list-update-bans-nadu-from-modern" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Modern ban</a> list, this change has lead to passionate outrage within the Magic: The Gathering community due to depleting cards of hundreds of dollars in value.</p>

<p>The <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> Commander Ban List update was made public via <a href="https://x.com/JoshLeeKwai/status/1838294523925139738">social media post</a> on X (formerly Twitter) by The Command Cast's director, Josh Lee Kwai.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-commander-ban-list-jeweled-lotus-card-artwork.jpg?itok=aHxaIWNa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-commander-ban-list-jeweled-lotus-card-artwork.jpg?itok=bZoKYeP6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The post stated that the Commander Rules Committee banned <em>Mana Crypt</em>, <em>Jeweled Lotus</em>, <em>Dockside Extortionist</em>, and <em>Nadu</em>, <em>Winged Wisdom</em> from Commander format. The post ends with a poll on whether or not this was a good thing.</p>
<p>This is important because the cards mentioned don't just see heavy use in competitive Commander format; they are pricey as well. TCGPlayer's own Cassie LaBelle <a href="https://infinite.tcgplayer.com/article/Cassie-Calls-Did-You-Just-Lose-$400/3bd25f7b-c617-4a79-8711-859dffd780c2" rel="nofollow">illustrates the drop</a> in value. One example is <em>Dockside Extortionist</em>, worth as much as $160, potentially losing up to 90% of its value due to not seeing much play outside of Commander.</p>
<p>The result of this <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> Commander ban list update has been passionate outrage by the community. Several change.org petitions have been circulating requesting a reversal of the ban (at 4,676 signatures), and firing the Commander Rules Committee (1,144 signatures).</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-commander-ban-list-foil-nadu-card-artwork.jpg?itok=nEwvS4R- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-commander-ban-list-foil-nadu-card-artwork.jpg?itok=M3ISCaWG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In response to this outrage, the Commander Rules Committee posted an <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tOQ9zb6tR7gfFueqY9bjoXz6sOvv34wIZXpl4u8DcDw/edit">FAQ document</a> in a gesture of transparency. In the document, the committee strikes down accusations of insider trading, stating it holds a zero-tolerance policy of abusing knowledge of potential game changes.</p>
<p>They also reiterate the ban had more to do with the cards' functions in the current meta than their financial worth.</p>
<p>The committee also committed to the ban list change. Stating if they backpedaled now, it would only exacerbate the financial concerns. In addition, they believe the update will be better for <em>Magic's</em> competitive scene in the long-term.</p>
<p>Lastly, the committee admits that such a drastic change with no forewarning was a mistake. As of right now, they are discussing "warming up" the community to potential bans in the future.</p>

The Simpsons: Tapped Out will be removed from app stores on October 31, 2024, and while it'll continue to be playable for the rest of the year, servers will be shut down on January 24, 2025. In-app purchases have already been disabled. </p><p>"The decision to end our twelve-year journey is an emotional one," EA wrote in its Facebook post today. "Together with our partners at The Simpsons™ and The Walt Disney company, we have delighted in bringing this game to you, the fans, and seeing how you’ve each built your own beloved versions of Springfield. It has been a remarkable journey, and we are grateful that we’ve been able to deliver 308 updates, 831 characters and including today’s final farewell 1,463 questlines."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/26/tapped-out-1727378918614.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The Simpsons: Tapped Out will officially be sunset in January. </figcaption></figure></output><p>The Simpsons: Tapped Out launched for iOS in 2012, followed by Android in 2013, and allowed players to build their own version of Springfield. It proved wildly popular at certain points, and EA <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/1974861-electronic-arts-management-discusses-q3-2014-results-earnings-call-transcript" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said in 2014</a> that it had generated more than $130 million life-to-date in digital net revenue. Its seasonal and holiday-themed updates proved especially beloved by fans.</p><p>Tapped Out also, however, received blowback as part of larger criticism surrounding the freemium game model. It was seemingly lampooned in a 2014 episode of South Park titled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemium_Isn%27t_Free" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Freemium Isn't Free,"</a> which found several characters hooked on an app that looked a lot like The Simpsons: Tapped Out.</p><p>The news also highlights something of a dearth of Simpsons video games over the past decade. Tapped Out was the most recent, preceeded by The Simpsons Game in 2007 and Hit &amp; Run in 2003. The developers of the latter <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-simpsons-hit-runs-developers-sequel">commented last year</a> on why that beloved game never got a sequel, despite fan demand. </p><p><em>Alex Stedman is a Senior News Editor with IGN, overseeing entertainment reporting.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/26/24255343/sony-horizon-zero-dawn-remaster-price-double-psn<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you thought you’d buy a new copy of <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> on Sony’s digital storefront for a smooth $20 and just pay an extra $10 for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/24/24253184/horizon-zero-dawn-remaster-ps5-pro-trailer">the new remastered version</a> when it arrives on October 31st, think again. Sony has quietly doubled the price of <em>Horizon Zero Dawn: Complete Edition</em> on the PlayStation Store. </p><p>While Sony has long sold the game for $20 online — as far back as 2018, it seems — <a href="https://psprices.com/region-us/game/1838981/horizon-zero-dawn-complete-edition">it upped that price to $40</a> on September 25th, just one day after announcing the new remastered game. The changes were spotted <a href="https://x.com/GamePittReviews/status/1839018836357476399">by @GamePittReviews</a>. </p><p>While those of us with an<em> </em>existing copy can upgrade for $10 — regardless of whether your copy is disc or digital, PlayStation or PC — new players will have to pay a full $50 for the remastered version if they want it digitally. Sony isn’t exactly trying to hide that: “For new fans, the game can be purchased for $49.99&nbsp;on PlayStation Store, Steam, or Epic Game Store,” its <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/24/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-is-coming-to-ps5-pc-october-31-2024/">original blog post</a> reads.</p><p>You can still pay quite a lot less, of course, by tracking down an old disc copy of the game or perhaps a PC key. Sony explicitly states that even the original PS4 disc copy of <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> will work as you leave it in the drive while you’re playing — assuming you’ve got <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/10/24240906/sony-ps5-pro-disc-drive-separate-price">a PlayStation with a disc drive</a>, that is. </p><p>The new remaster promises “stunning new visuals and enhanced features,” and you can see more in the announcement trailer below.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Do I like citybuilders such as Cities: Skylines and SimCity 4, or do I simply like roadbuilders? I spend most of my time in both those games tweaking the network of roads and junctions that form the veins of my cities, after all, and attempting to solve traffic jams via public transport and simulation-expanding mods.
</p>
<p>Enter Junxions, a traffic engineering game which focuses entirely on the simulation and construction of roads, railways, and pedestrian walkways, right down to the coding of the traffic lights. It's aiming for a 2025 release and you'll find its trailer below.

<p>Junxions' main mode takes you through a series of handcrafted maps where you have to use the tools available to fix traffic problems around the limitations of pre-existing structures. You'll need to account for traffic laws, as well as complications (and benefits) such as bus lanes, bike lanes, tram tracks, and all manner of pedestrian crossings.
</p>
<p>There's also a sandbox mode, for freeform experimentation, and perhaps most interestingly the ability to enter real world coordinates and generate a map based on a real world location. If you want to generate a map based on your hometown, and fix that forever-clogged junction on your commute to work, you can do so.
</p>
<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1447250/Junxions/">Steam page</a> also says the game is built with "full support for modding", including sharing maps, traffic solutions and importing custom models.
</p>
<p>I am genuinely thrilled this exists. People forget that Colossal Order, before making Cities: Skylines, cut their teeth on a similarly focused traffic sim, Cities In Motion. Also I'm from the roundabout-obsessed UK. We fear <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete_Island">they may ensnare us forever</a>, and we celebrate them, as the UK Roundabout Of The Year award <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cdx9nlgk97eo">was named just today</a>. I look forward to finding out whether Junxions is one to die for or celebrate when it releases in 2025.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The developer, who also shipped <em>Super Meat Boy</em>, clarified that he still owns the rights to the image and would be “100% fine” with Twitch renewing them, seemingly at little or no cost. </p><p>For anyone who hasn’t spent much time in Twitch chats, the BibleThump emote has become so  second-nature and ubiquitous over the years that it feels as inseparable from the streaming platform as anything else. The sobbing mug of Isaac, a small dough-like child that fights horrors in<em> Zelda</em>-inspired dungeons beneath his home, can be found clogging up chats every time a video game showcase disappoints, like when <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong </em>goes another Nintendo direct without a release date. </p><p>So why is Twitch getting rid of the iconic symbol? Some critics have blamed it on the company being cheap amid reports of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-23/twitch-youtube-are-slowing-big-money-deals-for-gaming-talent&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-23/twitch-youtube-are-slowing-big-money-deals-for-gaming-talent" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">declining revenues</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://aftermath.site/twitch-ceo-dan-clancy-profitable-layoffs-interview-report&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://aftermath.site/twitch-ceo-dan-clancy-profitable-layoffs-interview-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a lack of clear direction</a></span>. But Twitch also has a policy against emotes that “include unauthorized uses of another person’s content, brand, image, or other rights.” It could be that the company is looking to purge its repository of anything it doesn’t own the rights to itself, or doesn’t fit into its future brand deals and marketing plans. </p><p>Whatever the reason, it sucks and seems easily avoidable. Twitch’s announcement of the BibleThump emote apocalypse now has a community note. “Edmund McMillen, creator and current rights holder of <em>The Binding of Isaac</em> (the property the emote originates from) has said publicly he is open to renewing the rights and/or working out a deal. It is Twitch’s choice not to do so,” it reads. </p><p>The company has until the end of the month to save crying baby Isaac.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Movies often portray robots as the harbingers of something bad, whether they’re evil and want to take over the world (<em>Terminator</em>,<em> I, Robot</em>, <em>The Matrix</em>, etc.) or are being exploited by humans (<em>Blade Runner</em>, <em>Ex Machina</em>, <em>A.I. Artificial Intelligence</em>, etc.). But robots aren’t all bad—they can be fun, cute, and family-friendly, too.<br></p><p>Children (and adults) love assembling robot toys and figuring out how different components interact and fit together. Robots have been a big part of kids’ movies for years, especially before the millennium, with films like <em>Bicentennial Man</em> and <em>Inspector Gadget </em>arriving in the late ‘90s. While they may not be the greatest, they capture the inventiveness that makes robots exciting for kids. </p><p><em>The Wild Robot</em>, which tells the story of a robot who learns to live in the forest and befriends an adorable little gosling, hits theaters on <em>September 27</em>. It stars Pedro Pascal, Stephanie Hsu, and Mark Hamill, and will join the lexicon of children’s movies about robotic friends.</p><p>We gathered all of these movies and tried to rank them based on their quality, considering whether they are just juvenile fluff or something more meaningful that adults can enjoy, too. Let’s get into it.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4cb3a43254200837d1fe32b61dab9354" data-recommend-id="image://4cb3a43254200837d1fe32b61dab9354" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Inspector Gadget flies over Manhattan.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Based on the beloved children’s cartoon, <em>Inspector Gadget</em> is one of those movies that really only appeals to kids. It’s a lot like candy: it’s vivid, brightly colored, and sends you into a frenzy, yet it lacks in substance. The movie was heavily criticized, but it’s a childhood favorite for many who were kids at the time of its release. Matthew Broderick is at his goofiest as a security guard who is transformed into a part-robot equipped with a nearly endless supply of quirky gadgets and whirligigs—perfect for thwarting the evil Claw, a business tycoon who just wants to cause chaos in Riverton and steal other scientists’ work.<br></p><p><em>Inspector Gadget</em> is jam-packed with over-the-top, zany violence ranging from punches to explosions and chaotic traffic pile-ups—and even boasts a surprising amount of sexual innuendo, such as a rocket that shoots from Gadget’s hat when a woman gets close to him. Much of this juvenile humor and wacky antics, shot in a frenetic style, can feel cringey and headache-inducing—especially for older viewers. Younger audiences, however, are sure to get a kick out of it.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b2b797b5c89d7b6988e7fc1a388f6bc4" data-recommend-id="image://b2b797b5c89d7b6988e7fc1a388f6bc4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Andrew the robot looks off-camera.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Bicentennial Man</em> can be a frustrating watch because it jumps back and forth between playful humor and weepy melodrama. A family in the future hires a robot to help with household tasks, from cooking dinner to entertaining the children. The robot, Andrew, has a shiny metallic exterior that’s very smooth and polished, and the design of his face closely resembles that of late, great actor Robin Williams, which is charming but a little bit creepy. Andrew develops a close bond with the family through his snappy dialogue, witty observations, and flair for the theatrical—all Robin Williams’ trademarks.<br></p><p>The family realizes their robot is very special and not just a mindless machine. Like many tales of artificial figures dating back to 1940’s <em>Pinocchio</em>, <em>Bicentennial Man</em> revolves around Andrew’s desire to become an ordinary man. His character explores what it means to be human through creative pursuits like playing the piano and falling in love. Even though it suffers from genre confusion and oversentimentality, in some ways <em>Bicentennial Man </em>was ahead of its time. It raises interesting questions about how smart artificial intelligence can really get, while also reminding us of humanity’s beauty and complexity. Plus, it includes enough silliness to keep younger audiences entertained.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4505bdafe8f05a3ee3e13d1d2db0fdf9" data-recommend-id="image://4505bdafe8f05a3ee3e13d1d2db0fdf9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Two robots stand side-by-side.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Robots </em>is a visual spectacle that not only features tons of unique robot characters but also a metallic metropolis. The buildings look like machine switches and are made of circular gears, resembling the inside of a giant clock. The movie’s cast is stacked with stars including Ewan McGregor, Halle Berry, Greg Kinnear, Amanda Bynes, and Drew Carey, along with comedy legends Mel Brooks and Robin Williams. While some of the kid-friendly humor, like Aunt Fanny’s giant robot bottom and an elaborate dance scene set to James Brown’s “Get Up Offa That Thing,” can feel a bit cheesy, much of the script is filled with clever humor that everyone can enjoy.<br></p><p>The anti-corporate story centers on a company that would rather make shiny new robots and leave the clunky, rusted ones broken and obsolete. Kids will enjoy the vibrant futuristic designs and the level of detail and diversity put into all these different robot creations, all topped off with a heartwarming message: “You can shine no matter what you’re made of.”</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="414314bc9dcf9964dbd52be22e06770f" data-recommend-id="image://414314bc9dcf9964dbd52be22e06770f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Optimus Prime and Megatron stand together.

Based on the beloved 1980s toys, the series features an alien race of robots transported to Earth who can turn into everyday vehicles and machines. While this premise still excites young kids who love the toys’ adjustable transformations, most films in the franchise since Michael Bay’s 2007 adaptation have been bloated and confusing messes. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/transformers-one-review-prequel-optimus-prime-megatron-1851646612?_gl=1*1jtgjt*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNzM2NDEzMC4xODQuMS4xNzI3Mzc3NDk1LjYwLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/transformers-one-review-prequel-optimus-prime-megatron-1851646612?_gl=1*1jtgjt*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNzM2NDEzMC4xODQuMS4xNzI3Mzc3NDk1LjYwLjAuMA.."><em>Transformers One</em></a></span> is an unexpected surprise, a sweet animated story about the brotherly love Optimus Prime (Chris Hemsworth) and Megatron (Brian Tyree Henry) shared before they became enemies.

Hiro Hamada is a robotics whiz kid (and a bit of a rebel because he hosts illegal robot fights) who inspires younger audiences to pursue their passions. He lives with Baymax, a puffy white robot with a gentle expression that looks like a giant marshmallow, who was a caregiver for Hiro’s deceased brother, Tadashi Hamada. <em>Big Hero 6</em> is an action-packed and exciting blend of superhero adventures and robotic technology. Hiro uses his innovative inventions to transform Baymax and his colorful group of friends into tech-powered heroes. At its core, however, is a touching story of grief.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="681d570501bca369c03005c5f6b2c1e6" data-recommend-id="image://681d570501bca369c03005c5f6b2c1e6" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Eve lights a light bulb while WALL-E looks on.

WALL-E is the cutest little robot you’ve ever seen—short and shaped like a box, with gigantic, binocular-like eyes. He’s dingy and beat-up, spending his days sorting through and picking up trash on a garbage-ridden Earth. Meanwhile, humans live on spaceships, glued to their Hoverchairs while gorging on television and snacks.<br></p><p>EVE, WALL-E’s love interest, looks like an Apple product with a chic, high-gloss body and state-of-the-art technology. Their romance is as sweeping as the Golden Age Hollywood musicals WALL-E loves to watch. The adventures they share across the galaxy are funny, action-packed, and emotional. It’s fascinating and touching to observe these wordless robots interact with each other; although they are machines, they have so much heart and soul.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6e08d9d15b42fef1f5f80d5cc76aa3dc" data-recommend-id="image://6e08d9d15b42fef1f5f80d5cc76aa3dc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Iron Giant holds Hogarth in his hand." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Iron Giant holds Hogarth in his hand." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.

The main character, Hogarth Hughes, is a lonely boy with a working-class mom who discovers a towering robot in the woods. Hogarth quickly forms a deep friendship with the gigantic creature, whose glowing round eyes and lined mouth communicate a kind smile. They race through the chilly Maine wilderness, with the Giant even cannonballing into a lake to create a tidal wave, while Hogarth desperately tries to stop him from munching on every car he encounters.<br></p><p><em>The Iron Giant </em>evokes another childhood classic, <em>E.T</em>.,  with its plot point of government agents investigating the reports of this “monster” who may possibly be a Russian creation. These tensions and Cold War anxieties culminate in one of the most moving finales in animation. Even in the few lines he delivers, voice actor Vin Diesel brings such emotional depth to the Giant and how much he cares for Hogarth, demonstrating that he is so much more than just a machine. The ending makes it feel as though <em>The Iron Giant</em> has reached in, ripped out your heart, and stomped on it. A true classic. </p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Beloved real-time strategy classics <em>StarCraft</em> and <em>StarCraft II</em> will soon be available in Microsoft's Game Pass subscription for PC, the company <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/09/26/starcraft-game-pass/">announced</a> during the Tokyo Game Show.</p>
<p>It's already free to play both <em>StarCraft</em> and <em>StarCraft II</em>'s multiplayer modes on PC. This move to Game Pass will make the equally excellent single-player campaigns available to anyone with a subscription, though. Game Pass will also offer all the expansions for both games.</p>
<p>The subscription will provide access to <em>StarCraft Remastered</em>, a revamped version of the original 1998 game that came out in 2017, as well as the <em>StarCraft II Campaign Collection</em>, which includes all 70-plus single-player missions from <em>StarCraft II</em>'s <em>Wings of Liberty</em>, <em>Heart of the Swarm</em>, <em>Legacy of the Void</em>, and <em>Nova Covert Ops</em>.</p>
<p>The announcement was the lone bit of new information in a brief video by Xbox boss Phil Spencer. He appeared in the video wearing a <em>StarCraft</em> T-shirt, which might have gotten <em>StarCraft</em> fans' hopes up that the franchise would be getting a new game for the first time in over a decade.</p>
<p>That didn't happen, of course, but the games' addition to Game Pass will likely expose them to many new players who may have been too young to play the influential strategy titles when they debuted in 1998 and 2010.</p>
<p>These aren't the first Blizzard games to be added to Game Pass since Microsoft acquired Activision-Blizzard. First came <em>Diablo IV</em>, then <em>Overwatch 2</em>—the latter was free-to-play already by the time it came to Game Pass, but Microsoft included it in the Game Pass distribution platform and offered cosmetics and goodies to Game Pass subscribers.</p>
<p>The <em>StarCraft</em> games will launch for PC Game Pass and Game Pass Ultimate subscribers on November 5.</p>

			<p>In an interview <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202409/18892" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with Famitsu</a> about the Nintendo Museum that is due to open on October 2, industry legend Shigeru Miyamoto made some interesting comments about Nintendo's uniqueness and its desire to stand apart from what he called the 'performance console war' between Sony's PlayStation and Microsoft's Xbox.</p>
<p><em>If the goal is to preserve all of Nintendo's past assets so that people can understand what Nintendo is, then it's not just about the employees; we now have people spanning three generations who know about Nintendo. It would be great if those people could see it and understand what Nintendo is. I hope that through this, people will understand and refrain from dragging Nintendo into competitions like the so-called 'console wars,' which focus on high specs and hardware performance (laughs). Nintendo will continue to use the various technologies available today to create things in a way that's unique to Nintendo. We're not just limited to games; we'll also be involved in films and will continue to create a variety of entertainment content. I thought this would be a good opportunity for people to understand that, and that's why we made this.</em></p>
<p><em>I believe the most important thing is for various people to visit this museum and come away thinking, 'This is a company that's not at all related to the game industry competition or cutting-edge technology that people usually talk about.' Of course, we conduct technology research. In the past, analysts and others have said things like, 'Why isn't Nintendo focusing on networking?' or 'What about mobile?' or 'Why aren't you using cutting-edge chips?' However, if people calmly look at the exhibits, they'll realize that we've actually been working on those things all along. But Nintendo has a history of waiting for the right moment to release products, only commercializing them when we believe the timing is perfect. I think that becomes clear through the museum, and it helps build trust in Nintendo. For our shareholders as well, this serves as a kind of mid-to-long-term perspective, showing that they can trust us to manage the company properly.</em></p>
<p>With the unveiling of the Switch 2 believed to be imminent (the console is <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-official-name-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored</a> to have already entered full production), Miyamoto's comments may be interpreted as a way to prepare fans when the official specifications have been revealed. Indeed, from the leaks and rumors, the Switch 2 is <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-chip-hardly-match-xbox-series-s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimated</a> to be even less powerful than the Xbox Series S.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Nintendo has long since detached itself from the aforementioned 'performance console war'. The last time the Japanese company produced a console as powerful as its competitors was with the GameCube, which was unsuccessful commercially. Following that experience, Nintendo avoided fighting Nintendo and Sony in raw computing power and designed its consoles with specific gimmicks, such as motion controls for the Wii, the gamepad/touchscreen for the WiiU, and the hybrid handheld/home console for the Switch. Two out of three times, they were right; we'll see if whatever they come up with for the Nintendo Switch 2 will be a success or not.</p>

Good news, then, that they're currently running a publisher sale <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/hoodedhorsepublishersale2024">over on Steam</a> where those games and many others in their library are discounted.
</p>

<p>They've also just published Direct Horse, an excellently-named showcase of upcoming updates and recently announced games. Unfortunately the showcase itself is 16 minutes of excruciating sub-sub-sub Devolver faux-VHS faux-jokes, but you can subject yourself to it below.

<p>The announcement of the next-generation Nvidia GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards are still some time away, but we may have new information of what people can expect thanks to new leaks.</p>



<p>According to known leaker <a href="https://x.com/eXtas1stv/status/1839381163749904634" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">eXtas1s</a>, the company’s flagship RTX 5090 graphics card will feature 32GB GDDR7 memory with a TGP of 600W. The upper-mid range RTX 5080 will have 16GB of GDDR7 memory and a TGP of 400W.</p>







<p>For comparison purposes, the RTX 4090 has a TGP of 450W while the RTX 4080 has a TGP of 320W. </p>



<p>More details, including a full reveal of the RTX 50 Series graphics cards are expected to come at, or around, CES 2025 in January.</p>



<p>These are the first set of leaks for the upcoming lineup of graphics cards. Earlier in September <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-50-series-to-consume-more-power-than-40-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it was also reported</a> that the RTX 50 Series would consume more power than the previous generation. ExTas1s claim seems to corroborate that information. It was also first reported in July that the next set of cards <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-rtx-50-series-may-not-release-until-2025-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wouldn’t come until 2025.</a></p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Nvidia for comment on the leaks, but no response was received as of publishing.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">A real-life Destiny-themed Nerf gun is nothing new, with Bungie having previously released a giant replica of the Gjallarhorn rocket launcher. But the upcoming Ace of Spades Nerf blaster feels decidedly different, both in terms of its usability and the fact that this particular gun choice resonates more deeply with the story of Destiny 2.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie recently sent me the Ace of Spades, which I've spent the last few days playing around with, much to the disdain and horror, respectively, of my two cats. Not having seen any dimensions listed for the blaster prior to it showing up at my door, I was shocked to open the shipping box: This thing is <em>big. </em>It's about 18 inches from the tip of the handle to the end of the barrel, which may not sound enormous for something you'd display on your shelf, but as a handgun you're actually going to hold and use, it's hard not to laugh at just how big it is when first seeing it. They don't call them hand cannons in Destiny for nothing, I guess.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374223-aceofspadesswitch.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4374223" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374223-aceofspadesswitch.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4374223"></a><figcaption>The Ace of Spades makes a Nintendo Switch look tiny</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374223-aceofspadesswitch.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">That's not to say the size is a bad thing--quite the opposite. The scale doesn't feel far off what it's like to use the Ace of Spades in-game, and at least for me, this is ultimately destined to be displayed on a shelf in my office, so the larger size ensures it won't be dwarfed by what's around it. And despite being big, it's not so heavy as to be uncomfortable; it's got a decent heft to it that prevents it from feeling flimsy, though you won't mistake it for being anything but plastic.</p><p dir="ltr">Visually, the Ace of Spades looks decidedly nicer than the Gjallarhorn in my estimation. Though you still aren't going to mistake it for any kind of real weapon, it eschews the shiny look of the Gjallarhorn's plastic that gave it an exceedingly kid's-toy-style appearance. Instead, it's got more of a matte finish, with decals that resemble the standard in-game version, albeit with a change in color scheme to a white-and-orange design. (An Exotic ornament is on the way soon that will allow you to match up the in-game gun with the Nerf version's look.)</p><p dir="ltr">It looks very nice overall, although your expectations should be set accordingly: This is a $50 Nerf gun that also packs a battery-operated firing mechanism, meaning the exterior is not that of a non-functional collectible costing hundreds of dollars. Some of the decals, possibly because of the textured surface, look slightly imperfect, though this only becomes noticeable when more closely examining it. The left side is adorned with a number of warnings and other icons that distract from the design, so it's best to keep the right side visible, though I wish the Destiny and Nerf logos there were relocated to keep it looking as sleek as possible. Fortunately, the accusation of a fan's design for the gun being used without permission has led to that fan, Tofu Bunny, being <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-fan-accuses-bungie-of-stealing-their-design-for-new-nerf-gun/1100-6526438/">compensated and credited for their work</a>, so that brief drama seems to have worked out in the end, with Tofu Bunny saying they are "very grateful."</p><figure data-align="left" data-size="small" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374226-aceofspadesinhand.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4374226" data-ratio="1.7777777777778" data-width="720" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374226-aceofspadesinhand.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4374226"></a><figcaption>The Ace of Spades in hand</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374226-aceofspadesinhand.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The batteries are used to fire the 12 darts--six per drum shell, with a second drum shell allowing you to quickly reload--and this is the other area that was a pleasant surprise. Not having used a Nerf gun in about two decades, and never one that relied on batteries, I was stunned by the force with which it fires. Whereas firing the Gjallarhorn was like shooting out a bunch of wet noodles, this packs much more of a punch than I expected. To fire, you first hold a trigger located under your middle finger, which revs the firing mechanism (and generates an audible whirring noise), before then pulling the main trigger to shoot.</p><p dir="ltr">This might very well be the norm for battery-powered Nerf guns, but I was pleased to see the long ranges the darts could travel. I expected them to gently make it across a room, when in fact they were moving quickly and going upwards of 40-50 feet, making for a much more fun experience than I had imagined. When I first fired it at a wall in my office from about seven feet away, I was taken aback by how far the darts bounced off the wall, sometimes even ending up behind me. It packs such a punch that the darts can bounce off multiple nearby surfaces, meaning they can be easily lost. Depending on how cluttered your room is, you'll need to be prepared to go dart-hunting, though the orange tips make doing so slightly easier.</p><p dir="ltr">Naturally, I had to know if these darts would hurt to be hit with, so I enlisted my wife, who was all too eager to take me up on the opportunity. She shot me twice from about 12 feet away, which was all it took to determine that, while it's not going to leave a mark, it is still unpleasant enough to insist the attacker cut it out immediately. On her way out, I couldn't resist returning the favor. My wife's review? "That shit <em>stings</em>," though it's only a "brief sting."</p><p dir="ltr">I expected the Ace of Spades to be a hit most of all with my cats, but so far they've been too alarmed--perhaps by the firing noise--to take part in hunting down the fired darts. That might be for the best, given any chewing on the darts seems like it could render them unable to smoothly fit into the drum shell, though my opportunity for a hit video in which my cats fly across the room after darts apparently isn't going to present itself.</p><p dir="ltr">A few other minor quibbles include the battery compartment (located on the left of the barrel, and which takes four AA batteries that aren't included) being somewhat difficult to open even after removing the screw. My lack of long fingernails meant I had to wedge in a small flathead screwdriver to lift up the cover, which briefly gave me flashbacks of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/psa-dont-try-to-pry-your-destiny-2-the-final-shape-collectors-edition-open-like-me/1100-6522094/">mistakenly trying to pry apart the last Destiny collectible I got my hands on</a>. Thankfully, this time things worked out far better. There are also very small plastic dividers between the batteries, and I mistakenly bent one, preventing the batteries from making sufficient contact to function. That led me to firing the gun without battery power, which jammed the gun and made it difficult to get apart. Once I got the batteries properly seated, this was no longer an issue; you'll know you're good to fire when holding the rev trigger produces a noise. Pulling the hammer allows you to pop open the drum holder, but the drum slides right out if the gun is tilted backwards--good for reloading quickly, but potentially liable to it falling and hitting the ground. The drums are luckily sturdy enough that it doesn't feel as if they'll easily break, though.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374230-aceofspades.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4374230" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374230-aceofspades.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4374230"></a><figcaption>The Ace of Spades comes with two drum shells and 12 darts</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374230-aceofspades.jpeg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374231-ace1large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374232-ace2large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374233-ace3large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374234-ace4large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374235-ace5large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374236-ace6large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374237-ace7large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374238-ace8large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374239-ace9large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374241-ace10large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374242-ace11large.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4374231,1300-4374232,1300-4374233,1300-4374234,1300-4374235,1300-4374236,1300-4374237,1300-4374238,1300-4374239,1300-4374241,1300-4374242" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4374231-ace1large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4374232-ace2large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4374233-ace3large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4374234-ace4large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4374235-ace5large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4374236-ace6large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4374237-ace7large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4374238-ace8large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4374239-ace9large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4374241-ace10large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4374242-ace11large.jpeg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374231-ace1large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374232-ace2large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374233-ace3large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374234-ace4large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374235-ace5large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374236-ace6large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374237-ace7large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374238-ace8large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374239-ace9large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374241-ace10large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374242-ace11large.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">As noted above, I don't know that I'll be firing the gun all that often long-term, but that's okay. It looks nice on a shelf, and coming off the campaign of The Final Shape--the best narrative work Bungie has done to date--I really like having this to commemorate Cayde-6, who famously wields the Ace of Spades. The initial reveal that Cayde would return to the game after being killed off years ago initially set off alarm bells, but his story turned out to be central to both the very character-focused plot of The Final Shape and its post-campaign content. Bungie somehow managed to pull off a worthwhile return for Cayde, and while his part might now truly be done, he will forever remain a major figure in the history of Destiny.</p><p dir="ltr">Like many fans, the unfortunate <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-layoffs-include-senior-execs-luke-smith-and-mark-noseworthy/1100-6525488/">layoffs at Bungie</a> have left me feeling uncertain about the series' future, even as the studio continues to share <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-new-raids-and-dungeons-are-seeing-big-changes-with-2025-dlc/1100-6526715/">more on what to expect</a>. But having this as a way to remember Cayde's part--and by association, many of my favorite moments over the last decade of Destiny--is a far more meaningful display piece to me than a more straightforward statue of a character. The fact that I might still get some cat videos out of it is just a nice bonus.</p><p>The Ace of Spades Nerf blasters was initially only available to preorder for those who unlocked the new Legend title in Destiny 2. It's now available for all to preorder on the <a href="https://bungiestore.com/bungie-rewards-nerf-ace-of-spades-blaster" rel="nofollow ">Bungie Store</a> and is expected to begin shipping in October.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Modern Warfare III &amp; Warzone - The Haunting Season 6 Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Instead of weekly playlist rotations, players can expect only solo and quad playlists for standard battle royale on Urzikstan, and Resurgence maps are limited to duo and quads. This means the only way to play Warzone in trios is to play the competitive Ranked Play mode, which is getting a shorter timeframe for the final season. Season 6 of Ranked Play ends on October 17.</p><p dir="ltr">Raven Software didn't give a specific reason for the consolidation or why these exact playlists were chosen to be axed, but instead vaguely mentions that the change is related to making "preparations for the future of Warzone," and that more details will be shared in the future.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, the developer confirmed that Plunder, Bootcamp, and any active limited-time modes will remain available. Season 6 currently features a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-warzones-new-purgatory-ltm-cant-be-won-and-thats-why-its-great/1100-6526671/">really fun sandbox-style mode called Purgatory</a> that will be active in Warzone until October 16.</p><p dir="ltr">These limited playlist options will remain in Warzone until sometime later this year when the battle royale integrates with Season 1 of Black Ops 6. The first season of Black Ops 6 is set to introduce the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-cod-warzone-map-area-99-is-where-nuketown-was-born/1100-6526171/">new Area 99 Resurgence map</a> to Warzone, with Urzikstan remaining as the large map experience.</p><p dir="ltr">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 arrives on October 25 for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC. Make sure to check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-warzone-and-mw3-season-6-release-date-and-details/1100-6526396/">all the big announcements for Black Ops 6</a>, including campaign details, round-based Zombies, and Treyarch's new omnimovement system.</p>

            <p>
It's been a while since we heard anything substantial from Little Big Adventure: Twinsen's Quest, the remake of long-defunct developer Adeline Software's much-loved 1994 action-adventure. But it's now returned in a flurry of news, bringing with it a new trailer, a limited-time Steam demo, and a 14th November release date on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC.

<p>
Little Big Adventure (for those of you too young/previously indisposed to remember) tells the story of Twinsen - a model citizen turned fugitive overnight - as he attempts to escape evil dictator Dr. FunFrock. It offers a compelling mix of platforming, puzzling, and exploration that, 30 years later, has had a thorough makeover in Little Big Adventure: Twinsen's Quest.
</p>
<p>
Twinsen's Quest developer 2.21, which was founded by Little Big Adventure co-creator Didier Chanfray, announced a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/90s-cult-classic-little-big-adventure-is-set-to-make-a-return-in-new-game">bunch of ambitious plans</a> for the series back in 2021, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/little-big-adventure-1-2-get-cloud-saves-controller-support-and-more-in-new-update">updated remasters</a>, a remake, and even a (seemingly stalled) new entry. To date, the studio has released remasters of Little Big Adventure 1 &amp; 2, and its remake is now due before the end of the year.

<p>
Alongside a gently refreshed (and rather lovely) visual style, Little Big Adventure: Twinsen's Quest features an open world of reimagined islands, an enhanced version of Twinsen's Magic Ball weapon, redesigned controls, and a new soundtrack by original composer Philippe Vachey. There's a little more insight into its creation in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bncH6u3o5Bk">making-of video</a> published alongside its release date news. And if that's still not enough Little Big Adventure for you, a limited-time Twinsen's Quest demo featuring the remake's first chapter is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3021340/Little_Big_Adventure__Twinsens_Quest_Demo/">now available on Steam</a>. You'll need to be quick, however - it's only sticking around until 2nd October. 
</p>
<p>
Little Big Adventure: Twinsen's Quest launches digitally for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Switch, and PC (via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2318070/Little_Big_Adventure__Twinsens_Quest/">Steam</a>, GOG, and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/twinsens-little-big-adventure-remastered-1c39bb">Epic</a>) on 14th November. A limited edition physical release for PS5 and Switch arrives on 5th December.

But even in the short, two-minute teaser, it seems like HBO is taking a few creative liberties with the source material. So we figured we’d go shot by shot and break down the trailer, the ways it’s adapting the events of <em>Part II</em>, and try and suss out some of the new scenes that weren’t included in the game. Open up your music streaming service of choice, put on Pearl Jam’s “Future Days,” and read on.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7a500d2b3e34935936033d81d325d55a" data-recommend-id="image://7a500d2b3e34935936033d81d325d55a" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Catherine O'Hara turns on a timer." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Catherine O'Hara turns on a timer." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7a500d2b3e34935936033d81d325d55a" data-recommend-id="image://7a500d2b3e34935936033d81d325d55a" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Catherine O'Hara turns on a timer." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>As we saw in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-trailer-hbo-max-joel-ellie-abby-1851613343&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-trailer-hbo-max-joel-ellie-abby-1851613343">the first trailer</a></span>, it looks like Joel is going to therapy in season two. <em>Schitt’s Creek</em>’s Catherine O’Hara is playing Joel’s therapist, and we see her get a bit snippy with Pedro Pascal’s “sad dad.” She puts on a timer and asks if he “wants to start, or what?” I imagine Joel is not too thrilled at the idea of going to a therapist, and might be coming into these sessions rather guarded, so O’Hara’s character is likely unhappy with his dismissive attitude. </p><p>This scene does appear to be a kind of stand-in for the opening of <em>The Last of Us Part II</em> in which Joel confesses to his brother Tommy that he murdered dozens of Firefly radicals who were planning to kill Ellie to create a vaccine for the cordyceps fungus ruining the world. Does doctor/patient confidentiality apply to something of that magnitude?<br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0847cc0d5ae518ff4e941c71cc4633c8" data-recommend-id="image://0847cc0d5ae518ff4e941c71cc4633c8" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ellie walks through Jackson." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ellie walks through Jackson." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0847cc0d5ae518ff4e941c71cc4633c8" data-recommend-id="image://0847cc0d5ae518ff4e941c71cc4633c8" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ellie walks through Jackson." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p> Next we see a shot of Ellie walking through the snowy streets of Jackson, Wyoming. Joel and Ellie returned to this settlement after the events of the season finale. The small town is led by Joel’s sister-in-law Maria and sustains a decent population with good quality of life for the post-apocalypse. We also get a shot of Joel’s mailbox with “Miller” on the side of it. It’s all very idyllic. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a85665c1ed157d5ca1e36a64a4a111f2" data-recommend-id="image://a85665c1ed157d5ca1e36a64a4a111f2" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Joel picks up the guitar and Ellie plays it." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Joel picks up the guitar and Ellie plays it." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a85665c1ed157d5ca1e36a64a4a111f2" data-recommend-id="image://a85665c1ed157d5ca1e36a64a4a111f2" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Joel picks up the guitar and Ellie plays it." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Speaking of idyllic, Joel gifts Ellie an orange-brown sunburst acoustic guitar with a moth design on the fretboard. He did promise to teach her how to play, after all. The trailer plays Pearl Jam’s “Future Days” over the scene, but it’s unclear right now if that’s the song Joel will play for her when he gives her the guitar as he did in the game. <em>The Last of Us </em>show begins in 2003, rather than 2013 as the game did. So that song technically wouldn’t have been around then, as Pearl Jam released it in 2013. Ellie could learn a different song, or the show might just say “fuck it” and keep it in there anyway. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5307552b640f91fc161c008728e31223" data-recommend-id="image://5307552b640f91fc161c008728e31223" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ellie plays guitar as Dina sits down in front of her." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ellie plays guitar as Dina sits down in front of her." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5307552b640f91fc161c008728e31223" data-recommend-id="image://5307552b640f91fc161c008728e31223" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ellie plays guitar as Dina sits down in front of her." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p> Whether she learns “Future Days” or something else, Ellie starts learning how to play guitar thanks to Joel.

Most of what we see in this trailer looks like scenes that would fit neatly in the first half, but there’s a moment that seems a bit out of place. <em>The Last of Us Part II</em> is structured around multiple flashbacks, and the final one is a conversation between Joel and Ellie on his back porch. There’s a scene in here that sure looks like the beginning of that one, in which Joel is playing his guitar and stops when he sees Ellie, though from a distance. If this scene is in season two, it could mean a lot for the thematic thrust of <em>Part II</em>’s story, but we’ll see if this is a fake out soon enough.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="88e630a9840d01f7bc7a3692d7ba5ba9" data-recommend-id="image://88e630a9840d01f7bc7a3692d7ba5ba9" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Jesse puts something on the ground and looks at Tommy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Jesse puts something on the ground and looks at Tommy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="88e630a9840d01f7bc7a3692d7ba5ba9" data-recommend-id="image://88e630a9840d01f7bc7a3692d7ba5ba9" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Jesse puts something on the ground and looks at Tommy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Next, we get our first look at Young Mazino as Jesse.

Based on the cuts between this scene and the one featuring Abby crawling under a fence trying to avoid a group of infected, it seems like the creatures Abby faces at the beginning of the game have been spun off into a much larger threat for the show. One that reaches the Jackson borders, as well as those traveling on the outskirts of the town.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a8ec3ce74eba84316d730c89cc6ebe3b" data-recommend-id="image://a8ec3ce74eba84316d730c89cc6ebe3b" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Abby is saved from an infected and rides off on horseback." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Abby is saved from an infected and rides off on horseback." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a8ec3ce74eba84316d730c89cc6ebe3b" data-recommend-id="image://a8ec3ce74eba84316d730c89cc6ebe3b" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Abby is saved from an infected and rides off on horseback." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Abby gets pinned down by an infected here, but is saved by someone who puts a revolver right to that sucker’s head.

We get a good look at some of the Seraphites, a cult that lives in the Washington city where much of <em>The Last of Us Part II </em>takes place. The Sepharites are characterized in-game by the scars around their mouths and bulky trench coats, and they’ve got the same look in this trailer. We see a Seraphite man walking through a forest and Ellie looking at some of their graffiti in the city. It reads “FEEL HER LOVE,” referencing their prophet who was killed by the militaristic Washington Liberation Front. And now they’re still killing each other, because…<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="eae2c16bd65f277adc2a2769c0dd3400" data-recommend-id="image://eae2c16bd65f277adc2a2769c0dd3400" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Isaac stands over a bloody Seraphite soldier." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Isaac stands over a bloody Seraphite soldier." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="eae2c16bd65f277adc2a2769c0dd3400" data-recommend-id="image://eae2c16bd65f277adc2a2769c0dd3400" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Isaac stands over a bloody Seraphite soldier." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Jeffrey Wright reprises his role as Isaac for the show and is briefly shown standing over a naked, bloodied Seraphite man. He was introduced in <em>The Last of Us Part II</em> by way of a grisly torture scene, which was notably not until the second half of the game when it shifts to Abby’s perspective. So it’s unclear if this is the show taking creative liberties with the game’s timeline or if this is a different scene entirely.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="55def172aaf7f26a917b4e6e75816a9c" data-recommend-id="image://55def172aaf7f26a917b4e6e75816a9c" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A montage of action scenes from The Last of Us season two." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A montage of action scenes from The Last of Us season two." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="55def172aaf7f26a917b4e6e75816a9c" data-recommend-id="image://55def172aaf7f26a917b4e6e75816a9c" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A montage of action scenes from The Last of Us season two." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As the trailer wraps up, we get some rapid-fire action sequences like the aforementioned infected attack on Jackson, horseback chases, people getting set on fire, Ellie and Dina trying to escape infected on a broken down subway car, Ellie screaming out crying about something, and a nice shot of Tommy and Maria embracing to add something nice to the mix.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1ba426045889377aa21eab0eb7a13a3f" data-recommend-id="image://1ba426045889377aa21eab0eb7a13a3f" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ellie plays guitar as Joel watches." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ellie plays guitar as Joel watches." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1ba426045889377aa21eab0eb7a13a3f" data-recommend-id="image://1ba426045889377aa21eab0eb7a13a3f" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ellie plays guitar as Joel watches." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The trailer ends with one last shot of Joel and Ellie having a lovely time together bonding over the guitar, just to remind you that there was some joy in this world before all this mess.

He began by explaining that part of the reason for the existence of the museum is for "not only our employees but also people who know about Nintendo, including three generations of parents and children, could come out to see the museum and understand what Nintendo is all about."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/26/miyamoto-1727373909314.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Shigeru Miyamoto would rather you leave Nintendo out of the "game wars" conversation. (Image credit: Amy Sussman/Getty Images)</figcaption></figure></output><p>"I hope that they will understand Nintendo and not get involved in what is sometimes called the 'game war,' such as high specs and how to improve the performance of game consoles," he continued. "Nintendo will continue to make products that are uniquely Nintendo using various technologies available in the world today and we will continue to create not only games but also entertainment content."</p><p>Miyamoto's comments are candid, but also not a massive shock considering Nintendo has largely been left out of the console war conversation, at least in comparison to Sony and Microsoft. Those two companies have continued to focus on high specs and performance in particular, with Sony recently announcing the pricey <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-pro-officially-revealed-gamescom-2024">PS5 Pro</a>. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"Nintendo will continue to make products that are uniquely Nintendo using various technologies available in the world today."</p></div><p>And it's not like the approach hasn't been working for Nintendo, with the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/with-switch-2-waiting-in-the-wings-nintendo-believes-the-og-switch-has-plenty-of-sales-left-in-it">Switch still selling well</a> even as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-everyones-talking-about-nintendo-switch-2-leaks-today">its successor waits in the wings</a>. </p><p>These comments are only the latest from Miyamoto to make headlines, with the video game icon recently saying Nintendo <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/shigeru-miyamoto-on-ai-nintendo-would-rather-go-in-a-different-direction">would rather go in a "different direction"</a> from some of its industry peers when it comes to the subject of AI. </p><p><em>Thumbnail credit: Amy Sussman/Getty Images</em></p><p><em>Alex Stedman is a Senior News Editor with IGN, overseeing entertainment reporting.

                <p dir="ltr">California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a law, <a href="https://digitaldemocracy.calmatters.org/bills/ca_202320240ab2426" rel="nofollow ">AB 2426</a>, to address concerns over "disappearing" purchases of digital media, including games, movies, music, and ebooks. The law mandates that digital storefronts inform customers they are acquiring a license to use these products rather than indicating actual ownership, as reported by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/26/24254922/california-digital-purchase-disclosure-law-ab-2426" rel="nofollow ">The Verge</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Effective next year, the legislation prohibits digital retailers from using terms like "buy" or "purchase" unless they clearly state that customers do not receive unrestricted access. Retailers must disclose that these licenses can be revoked and provide a list of associated restrictions. Companies that fail to comply may face fines for false advertising.</p><p dir="ltr">This law emerges as digital game sales surge and subscription models dominate the industry, prompting questions about ownership. The gaming community is increasingly aware that titles may not be accessible in the future. An episode of GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/should-we-give-up-on-owning-games-spot-on/1100-6520479/">Spot On</a> earlier this year discussed a hypothetical scenario in which, wanting to revisit a game like Alan Wake 2 in 2045, players could find it unavailable due to the shift away from physical sales.</p><p dir="ltr">The legislation responds to practices by major companies like PlayStation and Ubisoft. Earlier this year, Ubisoft removed The Crew from player accounts after shutting down its servers, while last year, Sony indicated it would remove purchased content from users' libraries before reversing that decision.</p><p dir="ltr">"As retailers continue to pivot away from selling physical media, the need for consumer protections on the purchase of digital media has become increasingly more important," said California Assemblymember Jacqui Irwin <a href="https://a42.asmdc.org/press-releases/20240916-assemblymember-irwin-urges-governor-sign-legislation-increasing" rel="nofollow ">in a press release</a>. "AB 2426 will ensure the false and deceptive advertising from sellers of digital media incorrectly telling consumers they own their purchases becomes a thing of the past."</p><p dir="ltr">While the law raises awareness about the limitations of digital licenses, it does not prevent storefronts from revoking access to purchased content. This legislation reflects ongoing efforts to clarify the nature of digital acquisitions and the evolving landscape of media ownership.</p>
