That game where all you do is click a banana is now one of Steam's most popular releases ever. In fact, it is so popular, it has today bopped both Hogwarts Legacy and Baldur's Gate 3 down a place on Steam's most played games chart. 
</p>
<p>
Banana - as the game is aptly called - is now sitting proudly in ninth place on Steam's most played games charts in terms of all-time player peak. 
</p>
<p>
At the time of writing, that peak is 884,469 banana clickers, according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/charts/?sort=peak">SteamDB</a>.

<p>
To put this in perspective, Hogwarts Legacy (which became the best selling game of 2023 in the United States, surpassing sales of Call of Duty) has an all-time player peak of 879,308. It is now the tenth most popular game on Steam. </p>
<p>And, as for the wildy-praised and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-takes-home-best-game-and-four-more-awards-at-this-years-baftas">multi-award winning Baldur's Gate 3</a>? It is now out of the Steam top 10, with an all-time player peak of 875,343.</p>
<p>
"Banana is a clicker Game, in which you click a Banana! In Banana you click the Banana to gain even more Bananas," reads Banana's synopsis on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2923300/Banana/">Steam</a>. "Every 3 and 18 hours, you get dropped a banana. Each banana is also made by the community in Discord. Come hang out with us and let's grow into something awesome!"
</p>
<p>
The game currently sits with a Very Positive review average.

			<p>PlayStation's Liverpool-based studio Firesprite has now issued an official statement following the layoffs several months back.</p>
<p>Back in February of this year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-lays-off-8-of-playstation-workforce-london-studio-closed-guerrilla-naughty-dog-insomniac-affected/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sony announced</a> that it would be cutting 8% of its PlayStation workforce. Impacted studios included Guerrilla Games, London Studio, Insomniac, Naughty Dog, and Firesprite - the studio co-responsible for Horizon Call of the Mountain for PS VR2. "<em>Our philosophy has always been to allow creative experimentation", </em>PlayStation's <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-announces-its-two-new-ceos-hermen-hulst-and-hideaki-nishino/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upcoming co-ceo</a> Hermen Hulst said back in February.<em> "Sometimes, great ideas don’t become great games. Sometimes, a project is started with the best intentions before shifts within the market or industry result in a change of plan."</em></p>
<p>Fast forward four months, and Firesprite has <a href="https://x.com/FirespriteGames/status/1803012313596801044" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now released</a> an official statement on X about the unfortunate layoffs, offering gratitude to those affected. "Like several other teams across SIE and PlayStation Studios, Firesprite was impacted by redundancies announced in February of this year", the statement reads. "These past few months have been an incredibly challenging period for our studio whilst we underwent a difficult and lengthy consultation process. During this time, we have been focused on providing support to all those affected amidst these demanding circumstances.</p>
<p>The statement continues, "As the consultation process now draws to a close, we would like to extend our deepest gratitude to all of the incredible and talented colleagues who will always remain a part of our story. We face the future with resilience and determination, united in our vision to deliver unforgettable gaming experiences to our players."</p>
<p>We can only wish those affected the best and sincerely hope that they have since found a new job.</p>

Since then, the game has received a handful of updates as the live-service journey begins and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xdefiant-review-is-it-good-free-call-of-duty-ubisoft-1851499598&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xdefiant-review-is-it-good-free-call-of-duty-ubisoft-1851499598"><em>XDefiant</em></a></span><em> </em>evolves and changes over the coming months and years. </p><p>“Launch has been great,” said Rubin. “We’re extremely happy with our player numbers. It’s gone far beyond what we expected.”</p><p>Rubin explained to <em>Kotaku </em>that Ubisoft had tried to keep the game “pretty lowkey” and “grassroots.” The idea was to build a game and a dedicated community of players at the same time. However, the massive influx of new players and eyeballs since launch isn’t a bad thing. </p><p>“This tells us that gamers are genuinely interested in what we’re doing and are enjoying the fun gameplay that we’ve created,” explained Rubin. <br></p><h2 id="h18904"><a id=""></a>How Ubisoft plans to fix and balance <em>XDefiant</em></h2><p>However, while a lot of people have hopped into Ubisoft’s new F2P shooter, there have been some complaints from players about hit registration issues and desyncing problems. Basically, players are sharing clips of being killed behind a wall because on the other player’s screen they hadn’t made it to safety yet. Or they’re sharing videos of players being shot, but not taking damage as you would expect.</p><p>“We’ve had a great launch so far, but it has come with some issues. We own that and we’re not trying to hide from it,” said Rubin. </p><p>“This is the first FPS powered by the Snowdrop engine. So with that comes a lot of work to reconfigure the engine. And we’re finding new things all the time. There are growing pains, but in a good way for this team.” </p><p>Rubin further added that as a “live game” the real work is just beginning and they “absolutely” will continue to fix, tune, and improve “every part” of <em>XDefiant</em>.<br></p><p>With millions of players yelling online about problems, balance, and changes, I wondered what Ubisoft’s philosophy was for updating <em>XDefiant </em>and possibly changing its meta with a patch. Creative director Safy Saada explains that the team waits long enough to get plenty of data and then combines that with player feedback. </p><p>“As <em>XDefiant </em>evolves, we will keep finetuning the game,” said Saada. “We know we’ll always have [an] evolving meta and that’s a key element for this type of game.” </p><p> Saada says every time the team adds something new, like a faction or weapon, they’ll “probably have to rebalance” existing content. The creative director did confirm with <em>Kotaku </em>that Ubisoft plans to use “private test servers” in the future to “ensure its first iteration” of a change is as balanced as possible. </p><h2 id="h18905"><a id=""></a>Bunny hopping in <em>XDefiant </em>isn’t going anywhere</h2><p>One hot topic among the playerbase right now is bunny hopping in <em>XDefiant</em>. This is the act of players hopping up and down in different directions in firefights. At launch, players complained it was too easy to bunny hop and get kills, so in a recent patch (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/xdefiant/news/dj0iHxeSeSIcjkiH3Hxi8/xdefiant-y1s03-patch-notes&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/xdefiant/news/dj0iHxeSeSIcjkiH3Hxi8/xdefiant-y1s03-patch-notes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">which went live after this interview</a></span>) Ubisoft added some aiming accuracy penalties to b-hopping. But many players are still not happy about the current jumping meta. </p><p>“The intent of our movement has always been clear to us. We want there to be a skill gap,” said Rubin. “We also want there to be players saying, ‘I’m learning, I’m getting better at this game, I’m learning how to use the tools that the game has.’” </p><p>Rubin confirmed to <em>Kotaku</em> that it won’t be “nerfing” bunny hopping “into the ground.” But, as we saw with the recent accuracy penalty update, the team is still tweaking movement and the hops. </p><p>“We had an intent. And looking at that intent, we realized there were some things that needed to be adjusted,” said Rubin. “We’re adjusting the attributes on things like jump and other parts of the game to better suit the intended design that we wanted. Our intent was to always have <em>XDefiant </em>be a skilled FPS with good clean feeling movement that’s not overly complex, but is fun to master.” </p><h2 id="h18906"><a id=""></a>Making <em>XDefiant’</em>s fan-favorite maps</h2><p>The game’s various maps are one area of <em>XDefiant </em>that has received near-universal praise from fans and critics alike. While a couple of them aren’t as great as the rest—looking at you “Times Square”—the majority of <em>XDefiant</em>’s 14 maps are fantastic, rivaling the maps found in many other popular shooters. </p><p>Saada says he and the team are “super happy” about how <em>XDefiant</em>’s maps have been so well received by the community. According to the creative director, the maps in <em>XDefiant</em> are one of the game’s “key pillars.” I asked Ubisoft what goes into making a good arena shooter map, and Saada told me the team always tries to “start simple” and that the devs “really wanted to go back” to the original three-lane maps found in older <em>Call of Duty</em> games and similar shooters of the era. </p><p>“Then, the interesting part is bringing in what’s fun about the Ubisoft IPs we’re using,” said Saada. </p><p>In the game’s next season, starting on July 2, Clubhouse from <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> will be added to <em>XDefiant</em>. And while that Ubisoft tactical shooter is known for its destructible environments, <em>XDefiant </em>can’t match that kind of gameplay. However, Ubisoft still found a way to “celebrate” the game and its destruction.<br></p><p>“[Clubhouse in <em>XDefiant</em> looks] like an <em>R6</em> match just happened, with a lot of holes in the walls and floors as a part of the way we designed our lanes,” explained Saada. “So it’s really about mixing iconic flavors and elements from our titles with solid proven designs.”<br></p><h2 id="h18907"><a id=""></a>The challenges of making something like XDefiant</h2><p>A lot of work goes into developing, launching, and then maintaining an online video game.  I asked if Saada thinks players don’t realize how complicated these games are to develop, and he said that players know more today than 20 years ago.<br></p><p>Saada also said that even the team, made up of experienced devs, didn’t quite realize the “amount of work” involved with a game like <em>XDefiant </em>until they actually started to make it. He also said that while making a game like this takes a lot of time and energy, it’s also a “very fascinating” process. </p><p>“To start with just an idea and work all the way to the point where it gets in the hands of players and then making that idea evolve while experiencing it with the players, it’s a fascinating process,” said Saada. <br></p><p><em>XDefiant </em>is out now on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC. Its new season starts on July 1.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xdefiant-factions-just-dance-cleaners-dedsec-interview-1851540972&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xdefiant-factions-just-dance-cleaners-dedsec-interview-1851540972"><em>We also spoke to Ubisoft </em></a></span><em>about how it picks which factions to add to XDefiant and if the panda dancer from Just Dance will arrive in the FPS one day.</em><br></p><p><em>&nbsp; .</em><br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/hello-kitty-island-adventure-might-be-your-next-favorite-cozy-game<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Hello Kitty and the Switch seem like a perfect match…provided the framerate issues get resolved.</h2></div><section><p>Hello Kitty Island Adventure surprised me in the best way possible. Where I expected a lower-production value Animal Crossing-like game painted in Hello Kitty colors, made to cash in on Animal Crossing: New Horizons’ runaway success, and put in front of the lucrative mobile audience, the demo I played presented me with so much more. I explored, made friends, and completed challenges around an island in an early version of the Switch port for Hello Kitty Island Adventure.</p><p>Hello Kitty Island Adventure was originally released on Apple Arcade last year, blending management sim-like mechanics with light exploration, platforming, and puzzle solving to create a comprehensive cozy adventure. Think Animal Crossing or a less intensive version of Stardew Valley combined with A Short Hike or the exploration and quest systems you’d find in a 2D Zelda game. If you’ve played Animal Crossing, you’ll find a lot of this game’s setup pretty easy to parse out. It’s all about building out your island and inviting cute Sanrio characters to live on it.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Hello Kitty Island Adventure - First Nintendo Switch Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>I checked out an early story quest for about half an hour. I helped My Melody find new clothing stands for her clothing shop while playing as an adorably chunky, self-designed cat in a Gudetama outfit. I stumbled across so many small, fun diversions while looking around that kept me engaged during what would otherwise be a simple fetch quest in the starting area.</p><p>One task had me reliving Mario 64 Red Coin challenges as I raced to pick up a handful of pink coins in a quick timeframe. Another was less of a deliberate challenge and more of a collectible: statues of Gudetama, Sanrio’s lethargic egg mascot, are scattered around the island for you to photograph. I only found two or three of the 132 ovate statues peppered around the island, but you’ll be rewarded with special decorations, clothing, and other rewards for every 12 that you find and capture with your camera.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>These little diversions are admittedly small, but infusing microscopic platforming and puzzle challenges into the management sim-like quest structure adds so much value to your time. It encourages you to go off the beaten path and explore. That coin challenge I mentioned earlier, for example, led me to find a new item.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Infusing microscopic platforming and puzzle challenges into the management sim-like quest structure adds so much value to your time.</p></div><p>After that, I started on a story quest that helped me unlock a swamp-like section of the island, which in turn helped me make new friends, like Keroppi. My demo ended pretty soon after I unlocked this new area, but I was blown away after a look at Hello Kitty’s full map, which dwarfed the starting area. My half-hour with Island Adventure was clearly only the tip of the iceberg.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Developer Sunblink has been supporting and supplementing Island Adventure with free content updates Since its original release on Apple Arcade almost a year ago, regularly adding new characters from Sanrio’s surprisingly deep roster of characters to befriend. While the developer I spoke with didn’t confirm any details about who or what we should expect to see in the future, they’ve promised full parity with the mobile version day-and-date when it launches on consoles and PC next year.</p><p>Sunblink has done such a good job supporting its Apple Arcade hit, in fact, that my only concern with its future is its Switch port. The demo I played was presented on Switch and it ran pretty poorly. It was still playable, but it dropped a concerning number of frames. It’s an issue that I sure hope will be ironed out by the time Hello Kitty and friends make the jump to Nintendo’s handheld-console hybrid, but knowing what we’ve seen in other ports to the Switch, I’ll believe it when I see it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Chugging performance aside, I had a great time running around the island with Saniro’s charming stars. Whether I was doing mild platforming or completing a quest, I was consistently impressed with how and where Island Adventure took opportunities to give me stuff to do as I completed story quests. Fans of cozy games or someone who’s looking for a fun adventure for a younger gamer should keep their eyes on Hello Kitty: Island Adventure if they haven’t already had a chance to play it on Apple Arcade. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

That’s certainly the case for the Dragon Quest games, which are ripe for remakes in this vein and one reason why the initial announcement of Dragon Quest 3 was such a big deal. Now, after three years of radio silence, I was finally able to see the Dragon Quest 3 remake first-hand and despite the new graphical update, it’s exciting to see that this is very much a faithful recreation of the decades-old original.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>I got to play roughly 45 minutes of Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake on PlayStation 5, and as someone whose gaming life revolved around RPGs of its era, I certainly appreciate a good modernization of one. Much like other Square Enix HD-2D RPGs Octopath Traveler and Live-A-Live, it’s further proof that this direction is such an effective way to preserve the look and feel of classic pixel art with visual flourishes that are only made possible by today’s technology.</p><p>The demo starts early on in the story when the hero picks up a full party consisting of a Warrior, Cleric, and Mage. From the hero’s hometown of Aliahan, I ventured out onto the open region to travel to the northern town of Reeve. Here and in the overworld, the lighting and bloom effects give a pop to an already vibrant old-school look. Although the lay of the land remains the same, its redesign gives the world a greater sense of scale. Promontory Passage, which is the ruins that leads to the Dreamer’s Tower (the first dungeon), are a stark contrast from the original and the environmental details paint a much more lively picture that wasn’t previously possible. Even compared to the mobile remasters of Dragon Quest 3, the difference is night and day, yet it didn’t feel like I was playing a completely different game.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Unsurprisingly, gameplay mechanics are largely preserved with turn-based battles that unfold after choosing actions for each party member. Strategizing with spells and attacks in the hope they line up to take out enemies before they inflict too much damage on your party is the Dragon Quest way. Although I was only playing early levels with a limited number of options, I already know that because of its branching class-based system, Dragon Quest 3 can definitely ramp up in complexity. I regrettably killed many adorable Slimes in my short time playing, but facing Toadys, Bubble Slimes, and Stark Ravens in groups (and in succession when climbing several floors of Dreamer’s Tower) would be dangerous if I wasn’t smart with my spells and who I was targeting. So, I was happy to see this remake preserve the kind of difficulty that made the originals especially challenging.</p><p>Unlike those originals, which had a pop-up window in which battles took place, combat encounters transition to a full screen scene with some neat details. The party lines up before commands are issued, then it transitions to a pseudo-first-person viewpoint. While you don’t really get to see characters animate or attack in battle, there are at least a handful of new special effects when casting spells that weren’t there in previous versions. While the remake stays true to the originals in this respect, it’s one area where I hoped more inspiration would come through, to give party members a little more personality in combat.</p><p>And so, part of me wishes this remake was more drastic in its creative liberties and quality of life changes. The stiff character animations combined with the vivid HD-2D makeover don’t always work that well together, resulting in an uncanny valley effect that sometimes looks out of place. Combat also lacks snappiness – you can change the text box and battle speed to maximum but the awkward pacing from one attack to the next makes things a bit stilted. These seemingly minor blemishes really stand out, especially after other HD-2D RPGs, and I feel Dragon Quest 3 could better bridge the gap between modern and classic design principles.</p><p>Of course, ask 10 different people how far they think a remake should go in terms of changing the original and you’ll likely get 10 different answers, and regardless of these early shortcomings, I can still appreciate the fact that a classic 30-plus year old RPG is being revitalized in 2024. The heart of turn-based RPGs are timeless so even something like Dragon Quest 3, which remains steadfast in most of its original design with a very simple story, can still evoke the joy of the genre. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The difference is night and day, yet it didn’t feel like I was playing a completely different game.</p></div><p>It’s not a radical overhaul then, and if you’re coming fresh off other HD-2D games like Octopath Traveler 2 or Live-A-Live, you should set your expectations accordingly. But I do think it’s important to not just preserve older games with modern sensibilities but make them more approachable as time goes on. The HD-2D foundation once again proves to be nearly foolproof when it comes to recreating that classic charm and a great way to modernize an old RPG that many would not have otherwise revisited.</p><p>We’ll be able to see it all come together when Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake launches for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and S, Nintendo Switch, and PC on November 14 this year. On top of that, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-1-and-2-hd-2d-announced-along-with-3-remake-release-date-nintendo-direct-2024">Dragon Quest 1 and 2 HD-2D Remakes are also set to release</a> sometime in 2025, completing the original Erdrick triology in the series.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

It's the next full entry in the long-running Mario Party series and it's set to release on Switch on October 17, 2024.</p><p>It's themed around an island resort and features large maps like a race track called Roll 'Em Raceway with map-specific mechanics and a hazardous volcanic board called Goomba Lagoon with environmental hazards. Along with five brand-new boards, Mario's Rainbow Castle from Mario Pary 1 and Western Land from Mario Party 2 are also part of the roster of boards in this new game. There will be over 110 minigames featured in Super Mario Party Jamboree including a few that take advantage of Joy-Con motion controls. There is also a separate online competitive mode for up to 20 players to take part in minigames.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The last Mario Party game was Mario Party Superstars back in 2021, which was a celebration of the series' history. It included five classic boards, 100 of the series' best minigames, and a bunch of other throwbacks that really tickled those of us who remember old school Mario Party. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-party-superstars-review">Our review called it</a> "the best Mario Party has been in a very long time." We were slightly less impressed with its predecessor, Super Mario Party, but <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/10/03/super-mario-party-review">still called that</a> "far better paced than recent games," saying it "reset expectations of the series."</p><p>For all the reveals, be sure to check out our full roundup of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-june-2024-everything-announced">everything announced during the June 2024 Nintendo Direct</a>.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It has now been almost exactly seven years since <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/06/core-pokemon-rpg-metroid-prime-4-coming-to-nintendo-switch/">Nintendo first announced <em>Metroid Prime 4</em></a>&nbsp;and over five years since the company said it was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/01/nintendo-throws-out-metroid-prime-4-work-restarts-with-retro-studios/">restarting work on the game</a> with series mainstay Retro Studios. Now, Nintendo has finally shared the first glimpse of gameplay for the renamed <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>, which is now planned for a 2025 release.
</p><p>"After a very long time, we are finally able to share more information about this title," Nintendo executive Shinya Takahashi said during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX3BkD5PVUM">today's livestreamed Nintendo Direct presentation</a>, showing a remarkable talent for understatement. Takahashi went on to also ask that fans "please wait a little bit longer" for additional information before the game's planned release next year.</p>
<p>That "additional information" should include whether the highly anticipated game will launch for the Switch—as was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/06/core-pokemon-rpg-metroid-prime-4-coming-to-nintendo-switch/">promised in 2017</a>—or for Nintendo's next console, which the company <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/05/nintendo-pre-announces-a-switch-2-announcement-is-coming-eventually/">recently teased via a pre-announcement announcement</a>. Nintendo <a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1802702745276662114">kept its promise</a> that "there will be no mention of the Nintendo Switch successor" during today's Nintendo Direct presentation, but a major first-party franchise game launching in 2025 definitely seems well-positioned to serve as a showcase for new hardware that Nintendo seems to be planning for around the same time frame.
</p><p><em>Metroid Prime 4</em> also seems like a prime candidate to be the kind of "bridge game" that Nintendo sometimes launches across an aging console and its replacement hardware simultaneously. <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> served as such a bridge game <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/03/refreshing-new-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-is-an-instant-classic/">during the transition from the Wii U to the Switch in 2017</a>, and <em>The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</em> did so during <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2007/03/zelda-twilight-princess/">the GameCube to Wii transition in 2006</a>.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/01/nintendo-throws-out-metroid-prime-4-work-restarts-with-retro-studios/">In 2019</a>, Takahashi admitted that "the current development status of [<em>Metroid Prime 4</em>] is very challenged," leading to the "difficult decision" to "essentially restart development" with a new internal structure under Retro Studios. "It will be a long road until the next time we will be able to update you on the development progress," Takahashi said at the time, presaging the five-year wait for today's trailer.

<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMAgmdR8jwU">two-minute teaser footage</a> for <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> Nintendo released today features series protagonist Samus landing on a "Galactic Federation Research Facility" in the suitably cheesy, sci-fi-ish "Cosmic Year 20X9" (hey, maybe she'll <a href="https://homestarrunner.fandom.com/wiki/20X6">run into Stinkoman</a>). Background details in the trailer point to Samus intruding on some sort of alien civil war, with familiar-looking <a href="https://metroid.fandom.com/wiki/Space_Pirate">Space Pirates</a> firing on each other amid a barrage of anti-aircraft lasers.</p>
<p>The brief glimpse of gameplay we got features plenty of elements that will be familiar to anyone who has played the first three <em>Metroid Prime</em> games, including scanning objects for additional information, transforming into a morph ball to traverse narrow tunnels, and locking on to foes to easily circle them while firing away. The action-heavy portion concludes with the entrance of a mysterious figure in a strange, light-stripped mask breaking through an outer wall flanked by two seemingly docile metroids.</p>
<p>As the trailer concludes, we get a sweeping shot of a more tranquil, open area full of flowing waterfalls and giant trees, suggesting more of the exploration-heavy and combat-light puzzle-platforming sections the series is known for.</p>

<p>Months ago, in preparation for <em>Elden Ring's</em> expansion, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2778580/ELDEN_RING_Shadow_of_the_Erdtree/"><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a> (also on <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0700-PPSA04610_00-ELDENRINGDLC0000">PlayStation</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-gb/games/store/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-pre-order/9n5p5sc2rz7k">Xbox, </a>arriving June 21), I ditched the save file with which I had beaten the game and started over. I wanted to try out big swords and magic casting. I wanted to try a few new side quests. And I wanted to have a fresh experience with the game before <em>Shadow</em> arrived.</p>
<p>I have had a <em>very</em> fresh experience, in that this DLC has made me feel like I'm still in the first hour of my first game. Reader, this expansion is mopping the floor with me. It looked at my resume, which has "Elden Lord" as its most recent job title, and has tossed it into the slush pile. If you're wondering whether <em>Shadow</em> would, like <em>Elden Ring</em>, provide <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/03/is-elden-ring-really-that-hard-well-it-depends-what-you-mean-by-hard/">a different kind of challenge</a>&nbsp;and offer, like the base game, easier paths for <em>Souls</em> newcomers: No, not really. At least not until you're already far along. This DLC is for people who beat <em>Elden Ring</em>, or all but beat it, and want capital-M More.</p>
<p>That should be great news for longtime <em>Souls</em> devotees, who fondly recall the difficulty spikes of some of earlier games' DLC or those who want a slightly more linear, dungeon-by-dungeon, boss-by-boss experience. For everybody else, I'd suggest waiting until you're confidently through most of the main game—and for the giant wiki/YouTube apparatus around the game to catch up and provide some guidance.</p>
<h2>What “ready for the DLC” really means</h2>
<p>Technically, you can play <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> once you've done two things in <em>Elden Ring</em>: beaten <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Starscourge+Radahn">Starscourge Radahn</a> and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Mohg,+Lord+of+Blood">Mohg, Lord of Blood</a>. Radahn is a mid-game boss, and Mohg is generally encountered in the later stages. But, perhaps anticipating the DLC, the game allows you to get to Mohg relatively early by using a specific item.</p>
<p>Just getting to a level where you're reasonably ready to tackle Mohg will be a lot. As of a week ago, more than 60 percent of players on Steam (PC) had <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24176047/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-preparation-achievements-completed">not yet beaten Mohg</a>; that number is even higher on consoles. On my replay, I got to about level 105 at around 50 hours, but I remembered a lot about both the mechanics and the map. I had the item to travel to Mohg and the other item that makes him easier to beat. Maybe it's strange to avoid spoilers for a game that came out more than two years ago, but, again, most players have not gotten this far.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>I took down Mohg in one try; I'm not bragging, just setting expectations. I had a fully upgraded <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/moonlight+greatsword">Moonlight Greatsword</a>, a host of spells, a fully upgraded Mimic Tear spirit helper, and a build focused on Intelligence (for the sword and spell casting), but I could also wear decent armor while still adequately rolling. Up until this point, I was surprised by how much easier the bosses and dungeons I revisited had felt (except the Valiant Gargoyle, which was just as hard).</p>
<p>I stepped into the DLC, wandered around a bit, killed a few shambling souls ("Shadows of the Dead"), and found a sealed chasm ("Blackgaol") in the first area. The knight inside took me out, repeatedly, usually in two quick sword flicks. Sometimes he would change it up and perforate me with gatling-speed flaming crossbow bolts or a wave emanating from his sword. Most of the time, he didn't even touch his healing flask before I saw "YOU DIED."</p>
<p>Ah, but most <em>Elden Ring</em> players will remember that the game put an intentionally way-too-hard enemy in the very first open area, almost as a lesson about leveling up and coming back. So I hauled my character and bruised ego toward a nearby ruin, filled mostly with more dead Shadows. The first big "legacy dungeon," Belurat, Tower Settlement, was just around the corner. I headed in and started compiling my first of what must be 100 deaths by now.</p>
<p>There are the lumbering Shadows, yes, but there are also their bigger brothers, who love to ambush with a leaping strike and take me down in two hits. There are Man-Flies, which unsurprisingly swarmed and latched onto my head, killing me if I wasn't at full health (40 Vigor, if you must know). There are Gravebirds, which, like all birds in <em>Elden</em> <em>Ring</em>, are absolute jerks that mess with your camera angles. And there are Horned Warriors, who are big, fast, relentless, and responsible for maybe a dozen each of my deaths.</p>
<p>At level 105, with a known build strategy centered around a weapon often regarded as overpowered and all the knowledge I had of the game's systems and strategies, I was barely hanging on, occasionally inching forward. What gives?</p>

The Tracker is able to track and locate a crewmate's position on the map to sus out the Imposter. The Noisemaker, on the other hand, sends out a distress signal when killed. The visual indicator from the Noisemaker's death is able to easily rally and pinpoint the Noisemaker's location to more readily deduce the Imposter.</p>

While the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="474ebab7-368e-422c-bfb0-69eef4a14f11" href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/nintendo-switch-sports/par-for-the-course">initial offerings lacked depth</a> and sometimes left us craving more than the base game was able to deliver, Nintendo has stuck with the title and has improved the offerings through free updates. A few months after launch, the title <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="236b6aaf-61f8-424f-a9ca-4e5fb1ccce32" href="https://www.gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2022/09/13/nintendo-switch-sports-golf-arrives-this-holiday-season">added golf at no additional charge</a>, and during today's Nintendo Direct, we learned that another free update is coming to the game this summer to add basketball to the mix.</p>

<p>Nintendo Switch Sports' implementation of basketball uses motion controls to dribble, pass, and shoot. You can participate in two-on-two matches locally, or compete in Five-Streak Battle matches and Three-Point Contests. You can also take part in a solo Three-Point Challenge, where you need to make as many baskets as you can before time expires.</p>

<p>Nintendo Switch Sports' basketball free update arrives this summer. For more on Nintendo Switch Sports, be sure to read our review of the base game <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="474ebab7-368e-422c-bfb0-69eef4a14f11" href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/nintendo-switch-sports/par-for-the-course">here</a>.</p>

<p data-characters="198" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">For those viewers who were left feeling a little confused by the reveal of Sutekh in the latest episode of <em>Doctor Who</em>, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/doctor-who-brings-back-a-50-year-old-villain-in-shock-twist-and-fans-are-split/">The Legend of Ruby Sunday</a>, there is hope in the shape of <em>Tales of the TARDIS</em>.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="438" data-current-count="438" data-injectable="true"><em>Tales of the TARDIS</em> was originally created to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the show, and usually features previous iterations of the Doctor and their corresponding companions on board the Memory TARDIS, a TARDIS which features significant items and designs from every generation of<em> Doctor Who</em>. However, this week’s episode will be slightly different as the Doctor and Ruby enter the Memory TARDIS and travel back in time to 1911.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="236" data-current-count="236" data-injectable="false">Viewers will be able to get some answers as to who Sutekh is, accompanied by the Doctor and Ruby as they take a pause in events currently happening and take some time to consider what they’ve been through over the last few weeks. </p> <figure data-current-count="536" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via BBC</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="364" data-current-count="364" data-injectable="false">According to the BBC, the “timeless classic” <em>Pyramids of Mars</em> has been turned into feature-length omnibus episode with updated visuals and a cosmic makeover. Taking multiple episodes and condensing them into the 75 minute run-time of <em>Tales of the TARDIS </em>is no mean feat, but it should provide some answers for those who still have questions regarding Sutekh.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="402" data-current-count="766" data-injectable="true">There have previously been seven episodes of <em>Tales of the TARDIS</em>, looking back on everything from the Cybermen to Viking curses, though this will be the first time we’ve seen a current Doctor experiencing events of his previous regenerations.&nbsp;With <em>Empire of Death</em> being released just one day later, this might be the last chance to catch up on exactly who Sutekh is, and why he’s so dangerous.</p>
 <p data-characters="157" data-current-count="157" data-injectable="false"><em>Tales of the TARDIS</em> will air live on BBC4 in the UK on June 20 at 8 p.m. GMT, and will be available to watch on BBC iPlayer at any time after that point.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/is-ea-fc-24s-older-gen-version-better/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=is-ea-fc-24s-older-gen-version-better<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="199" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">In 2024, playing <em>EA FC 24</em>‘s old-gen version might not be on the wishlists of many players (unless they’re forced by choice of their consoles), and there are plenty of reasons behind that.</p> <p data-characters="440" data-current-count="440" data-injectable="true">However, a lot of community members have recently voluntarily switched to playing the old-gen version on their next-gen consoles (this isn’t possible on PC). At first, doing so might seem counter-intuitive, as the current-gen version has plenty of added advantages and new technology like HyperMotion. However, certain benefits come with the older version, especially if you’re frustrated with how HyperMotion works in the game.</p>
 <h2 id="h-why-should-you-choose-ea-fc-24-old-gen-version" data-injectable="false">Why should you choose EA FC 24 old-gen version?</h2> <p data-characters="358" data-current-count="358" data-injectable="false">HyperMotion has been a really interesting addition to <em>EA FC 24</em> (this year marks the third version of the technology), and it has had a telling impact on gameplay. It has had a massive effect on the gameplay, including how teams defend in shape. These are some of the noticeable differences you can expect in the old-gen version (compared to the current-gen):</p> <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="518" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>More defensive spaces: </strong>Manual defending becomes a lot more important, and your defense will break down if you take the defenders out of position.</li> <li><strong>More attacking options:</strong> The higher defensive space often allows more flexibility when building up attacks.</li> <li><strong>Greater emphasis on skills:</strong> Some of the skill moves can be a lot more effective than they’re in the current gen (this mostly depends on the players and their opponents’ levels).</li> <li><strong>Open passing lanes:</strong> I have personally found that when it comes to passing lanes, the options are way more than current-gen.</li> </ul>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via EA Sports</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="241" data-current-count="541" data-injectable="true">If you’re greatly frustrated with the general defensive shapes and lines found in the current-gen version. The old-gen version is definitely a lot more fun and entertaining, especially if outscoring your opponents is the main priority.</p>
 <p data-characters="107" data-current-count="107" data-injectable="false">There are some negative points to consider as well if you want to try out <em>EA FC 24</em>‘s old-gen version.</p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="227" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Inferior graphics:</strong> From player faces to general gameplay presentation – you’ll notice the difference in quality pretty fast.</li> <li><strong>Susceptible to counters:</strong> All the defensive attributes mentioned in this article will be applicable to you as well. If you’re someone who doesn’t manually defend very well, expect to concede plenty of goals.</li> <li><strong>Quicker gameplay:</strong> This isn’t necessarily a negative, but I like possession-based build-ups that have slower tempo. This style of play is pretty effective in the current generation, but not so much in the old generation.</li> </ul> <p data-characters="214" data-current-count="441" data-injectable="false">For those who love to play in an ultra-aggressive fashion on the pitch, the old-gen version of <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ea-fc-24-all-90-fantasy-golazo-or-gotg-hero-player-pick-sbc-rewards/">EA FC 24</a></em> is certainly better, as long as you don’t mind the lower-fidelity graphics and less attention to detail.</p>

<p data-characters="446" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/street-fighter-6-review-destructoid-fgc-capcom-fighting-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Street Fighter 6</a></em> is undoubtedly a fantastic fighting game, and it’s only going to get better thanks to its <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/snks-terry-and-mai-join-elena-and-m-bison-in-street-fighter-6-year-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">second line-up of DLC characters</a>, which includes SNK guest stars Terry Bogard and Mai Shiranui. However, there does remain one point of contention: the game’s microtransactions and monetization model. Yet despite the amount of complaints lobbied against them, it sounds like Capcom has no plans to adjust the microtransactions.</p> <p data-characters="728" data-current-count="728" data-injectable="true">Recently, <a href="https://kotaku.com/street-fighter-6-m-bison-terry-microtransactions-sale-1851545280" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a> got to speak with <em>Street Fighter 6</em> director Takayuki Nakayama and producer Shuhei Matsumoto, and it asked them about the discontent surrounding the microtransactions. There is a lot of additional content in <em>Street Fighter 6</em>, such as customization items, that you can’t just buy with real money. You have to first purchase the in-game Fighter Coins currency, and those are only available in specific bundles of 250, 610, 1,250, and 2,750, meaning you’ll often find yourself with some leftover coins once you’ve purchased the in-game items you want. On top of that, there are monthly $5/£4 battle passes and the DLC character passes which cost $30/£27, roughly half the price of the full game.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Capcom</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="816" data-current-count="1116" data-injectable="true">The point is, even after paying roughly $60/£50 on the game (possibly even more if you bought one of the special editions), <em>Street Fighter 6</em> still strongly encourages you to spend more money on its DLC and cosmetics. The sheer amount of microtransactions and Capcom’s pricing has been a sore spot since launch; I remember there being a lot of player outrage surrounding <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/15m8c5n/it_costs_100_to_unlock_all_of_street_fighter_6s/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the prices of the <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em> crossover content</a>, with all four costumes costing $15 a piece, making them collectively the same price as the base game. There was a similar backlash to the Outfit 3 DLC, which added new costumes for all 18 characters in the launch roster. The top comments underneath <a href="https://youtu.be/BYMrCxnf1bg?si=-h1gfWSFbHDbZgRA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the announcement trailer on YouTube</a> are full of people complaining about how you have to spend over $100 to get all of them.</p>
 <p data-characters="291" data-current-count="291" data-injectable="false">From the sound of things, though, enough people are happily (or perhaps begrudgingly) spending money on these microtransactions for Capcom not to consider making any adjustments to <em>Street Fighter 6</em>‘s monetization. When pressed on the matter by Kotaku, Nakayama and Matsumoto answered: </p> <blockquote data-current-count="671" data-injectable="true"> <p>“I mean people seem to be very interested in purchasable content especially that associates with the actual characters in the Fighting Ground Mode. And we see a lot of interest towards that so it’s something that we will continue looking into and seeing if there’s any new stuff that we can just… but in terms of the system it’s probably going to be as is.”</p> </blockquote>
 <p data-characters="667" data-current-count="667" data-injectable="false"><em>Street Fighter 6</em> is hardly the only game to draw complaints for its microtransactions; <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-mortal-kombat-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mortal Kombat 1</a></em>, for example, angered players when it offered a new Fatality for $10. Unfortunately, it’s been proven that microtransactions make game companies a lot of extra money. Sticking with the <em>Mortal Kombat 1</em> example, publisher Warner Bros. revealed late last year that <em>MK1</em>‘s microtransactions contributed to “meaningful” growth in content revenue (<a href="https://www.vg247.com/mortal-kombat-1-gross-microtransactions-work" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">via VG247</a>). If Capcom’s ever going to reconsider its approach to monetization, it requires enough people to not pay for them, but it doesn’t look like that will ever happen any time soon.</p>

<p data-characters="183" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Elden Ring</em>’s first and only DLC <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> is almost upon us. Ahead of its release on June 21, FromSoftware has revealed the minimum and recommended specs for PC players.</p> <p data-characters="383" data-current-count="383" data-injectable="false">This particularly comes in handy for players to know exactly what specs their desktops or laptops must have, in order to run the DLC. The specifications are not too different from what was required to play <em>Elden Ring</em> when it launched, so if <em>Elden Ring</em> runs on your system right now, it should be able to let you run the DLC as well. Check out the minimum and recommended specs below.</p> <figure data-current-count="683" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-minimum-system-requirements" data-injectable="false">Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree minimum system requirements</h2> <p data-characters="161" data-current-count="161" data-injectable="false">The following specs are required to at least run <em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</em>, which typically would be needed to run the game at its lowest video settings.</p> <ul data-found-items="6" data-current-count="401" data-injectable="true"> <li>OS: Windows 10</li> <li>Processor/CPU: Intel Core i5-8400 or AMD Ryzen 3 3300X</li> <li>Graphics/GPU: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 3GB, AMD Radeon RX 580 4 GB, or Intel Arc A380 6 GB</li> <li>Memory: – 12GB RAM</li> <li>DirectX: Version 12 (Feature level: 12)</li> <li>Storage: 80GB</li> </ul>
 <h2 id="h-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-recommended-system-requirements" data-injectable="false">Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree recommended system requirements</h2> <p data-characters="230" data-current-count="230" data-injectable="false">FromSoftware has also revealed the recommended specs for <em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</em>. These specs are not a requirement, but specify the hardware combination which can provide the optimum experience while playing <em>Elden Ring</em>.</p> <ul data-found-items="6" data-current-count="470" data-injectable="true"> <li>OS: Windows 10 / 11</li> <li>Processor/CPU: Intel Core i7-8700K or AMD Ryzen 5 3600X</li> <li>Graphics/GPU: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 8GB, AMD Radeon RX Vega 56 8 GB, or Intel Arc A750, 8 GB</li> <li>Memory: 16GB RAM</li> <li>DirectX: Version 12 (Feature level: 12)</li> <li>Storage: 80GB</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="391" data-current-count="391" data-injectable="false">While the PC system requirements are now out, that’s actually not all that you need to have on point in order to play the DLC. FromSoftware has locked access to the expansion behind two boss fights with Starscourge Radahn and Mohg, Lord of Blood. Apparently, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/elden-ring-fans-mustnt-forget-to-beat-mohg-if-they-want-to-play-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc/">only 39% of players have beaten Mohg</a>, as per the Steam achievements page. If you have not defeated Mohg yet, it’s high time now.</p>

		<p>Things are going very badly at the start of this trailer. Our protagonist, Takumi Sumino looks like he’s enjoying an idyllic anime walk with a friend, when suddenly, monsters attack. Admittedly, he’s decrying the fact that every day is exactly the same, and while I applaud his Nine Inch Nails references, he’s kind of asking for it.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Hundred Line -Last Defense Academy- – Announcement Trailer – Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ybTx8StTllQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>A mysterious school mascot – he looks like a cross between Colonel Sanders and a ghost jelly bean – helps them to escape, but he’s then forced to enrol at the Last Defence Academy alongside fifteen other recruits. Their mission is to defend the school against massive, vicious and extremely ugly monsters, in seemingly turn-based tactical combat. The trailer briefly shows us a snapshot of what looks to be a grid-based system, and large enemy forces grouped together into units. We see one of the characters then performing a cool motorbike drift that certainly looks good, but seems to do little damage.</p>
<p>As well as that, we can expect a heap of school-based melodrama, with the anime cutscenes presenting lots of shouting and stern faces, as they prepare to face the oncoming hordes. The enemies are surprisingly bright and colourful – greens, blues and yellows – but during at least one cutscene they also appear to be corrupted, with gross black growths escaping from their many-eyed bodies. It’s certainly a cool and intriguing setup, and given that it’s coming from the team behind Daganronpa, it’s definitely one to keep an eye on.</p>


<p>The Danganronpa series is similarly themed around a group of teenagers who are drawn into catastrophic shenanigans, though they’re being forced to murder each other there, so this seems almost tame in comparison. Whether there’s also going to be elements of visual novels or dating simulators remains to be seen.</p>
<p>The Hundred Line – Last Defence Academy will launch in early 2025</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metroid-prime-4-beyond-2025<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>During today's Nintendo Direct show, we finally got to see&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime 4&nbsp;</em>gameplay in all its glory, and not only that, but we got a new name and release window for the game as well.</p>
<p><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>, as it's now called, will arrive on Nintendo Switch sometime in 2025, and the first gameplay footage sure makes the game look like it's been worth the (admittedly very long) wait.</p>
<p>In the trailer from today's Direct, we see Samus landing on a planet that appears to be besieged by the Space Pirates, some of whom she takes down in classic&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime&nbsp;</em>first-person shooter style.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-direct-shooting.jpg?itok=jDWojzSz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-direct-shooting.jpg?itok=xiE7gnwS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Metroid Prime 4&nbsp;</em>looks like it'll bring some classic&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime&nbsp;</em>action next year.</figcaption></figure><p>We also get to see Samus switching to the Morph Ball to navigate some narrow passageways and above-ground railings, so it's all looking like the&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime&nbsp;</em>we know and love.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the trailer, we see what looks to be the bounty hunter&nbsp;Sylux, who's appeared in&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime&nbsp;</em>games before (albeit not in the main numbered series). He's flanked not only by Space Pirates, but also by two Metroids.</p>
<p>Finally, we get to see Samus emerging into a verdant, beautiful alien landscape, in the background of which can be seen a massive Yggdrasil-style tree.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, it's not clear how all of this fits together just yet, but it looks like&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime 4&nbsp;</em>development is fully back on track, which is reassuring. You can check out today's gameplay trailer right here.</p>

<p><em>Metroid Prime 4&nbsp;</em>has had a rather strange development cycle. It was first announced at E3 2017, but in January 2019, Nintendo revealed that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-reboots-metroid-prime-4-hands-development-to-retro-studios">development of the project had been rebooted</a> under original&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime&nbsp;</em>developer Retro Studios.</p>
<p>Following that announcement, the&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime&nbsp;</em>series went dormant for a number of years, although the release of last year's&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime Remastered&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/metroid-prime-remastered-is-perfect-test-run-for-metroid-prime-4">appeared to herald a resurgence</a> for the franchise.</p>
<p>Happily, it now appears that resurgence is well and truly here.&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond&nbsp;</em>launches for Nintendo Switch in 2025. Stay tuned for more info, and in the meantime, you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-june-2024">catch up on today's Nintendo Direct right here</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-announced<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>During today's Nintendo Direct presentation, Nintendo revealed a brand new&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda</em>&nbsp;game, and you won't be playing as Link in this one.</p>
<p><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>is coming on September 26th, and it uses the same cute art style espoused by 2019's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/legend-of-zelda-links-awakening"><em>Link's Awakening&nbsp;</em>remake</a>.</p>
<p>Strange rifts have appeared throughout Hyrule, and Link has disappeared into one of them, so it's up to Princess Zelda to find him and save the land. She won't be alone in her attempts to do so, however.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-beds.jpg?itok=TzU1cB-o 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-beds.jpg?itok=4IV8itDJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A new&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>adventure is coming later this year.</figcaption></figure><p>She'll be assisted by the fairy Tri, who will gift her the Tri-Rod, a rather intriguing artifact that allows her to memorize objects and conjure them at will.</p>
<p>In that sense,&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>looks like it's essentially a top-down&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>game with some of the creative spirit that made&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-wild">Breath of the Wild</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-kingdom">Tears of the Kingdom</a>&nbsp;</em>so special.</p>
<p>The trailer shows Zelda memorizing objects like boxes, shrubs, and beds, and then using them to bypass obstacles, get to higher ledges, and solve puzzles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zelda can also be seen memorizing enemies and projectiles to help her in combat. She doesn't fight with a sword, unlike Link, so you'll need to use ingenuity and quick thinking to get around combat challenges.</p>

<p>Hopefully,&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>represents an attempt to do for&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>what Nintendo has done for&nbsp;<em>Mario</em>, which is to say creating two parallel series that offer different gameplay styles (although those hoping for a return to classic item-based&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>gameplay may be disappointed by this one).</p>
<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>arrives exclusively for Nintendo Switch on September 26th. If you want to see everything else that was announced during today's Nintendo Direct, we've got a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-june-2024">full roundup for you here</a>.</p>

			<p>One of the best platformers on the Switch is still <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/donkey-kong-country-tropical-freeze/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze</a>, despite it being a pretty straight port of the Wii U game. But what about the original Donkey Kong Country Returns? Some people like that game even better than Tropical Freeze, and it’s currently stranded on the Wii and 3DS. Well, bust open the banana barrels, baby, because the game is coming back!</p>
<p>During today’s <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/nintendo-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Direct</a>, Donkey Kong Country Returns HD was announced. In addition to bumping up the resolution of the game’s graphics, this version of the game will also have all the content that was added to the 3DS version. Whether any all-new content has been added, remains to be seen. You can check out the first trailer for DK Country Returns HD, below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Donkey Kong Country Returns HD – Announcement Trailer – Nintendo Switch" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qdjam3yHC-4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Still looking pretty damn good all these years later! I’ve always liked DK Country Returns a bit more than Tropical Freeze, so I’m happy to see the game getting its due. Need to know more? Here’s Nintendo’s official description of the game…</p>
<p><em>“Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong are back for some ground-pounding action in this HD version of Donkey Kong Country Returns, originally released on Wii. The villainous Tiki Tak Tribe has stolen Donkey Kong’s precious banana hoard and the Kongs are barrelling after them in pursuit. Play solo, or with a buddy in local two-player co-op, in an adventure brimming with hijinks where you can stomp obstacles, send mine carts careening, fly high on rocket barrels and even hitch a ride on Rambi the Rhino. Experience 80 a-peel-ing levels, including the additional ones from the Nintendo 3DS version, when Donkey Kong Country Returns HD swings onto Nintendo Switch.”</em></p>
<p>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD jumps and rolls onto Switch on January 16, 2025. What do you think? Eager to give this one another (or your first) try?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Throne and Liberty Preview - A Good WoW Alternative?]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/throne-and-liberty-preview-good-wow-alternative</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/throne-and-liberty-preview-a-good-wow-alternative.904815/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/throne-and-liberty-preview-good-wow-alternative<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When <em>World of Warcraft</em> was at the height of its popularity, so many companies tried (and failed) to create a <em>WoW</em> killer. <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> succeeded in carving a huge niche in the market, but Blizzard's MMO still persists to this day. <em>Throne and Liberty, </em>however, might just be another hit in the making and perhaps even steal some ex-<em>WoW </em>players with its familiarity and likeness to the MMO.</p>
<p>I got a chance to play developer NCSOFT and publisher Amazon Games' upcoming MMORPG, <em>Throne and Liberty</em> during Summer Game Fest. Though it was a brief look, my time with <em>Throne and Liberty</em> shows some promise.</p>


<h2>Making Your Character in <em>Throne and Liberty</em></h2>
<p>My demo begins with character creation, which is about as robust as one would come to expect from an MMORPG. There's a slider for damn near everything, from cheek size to eyebrows. I could have spent my entire hour-or-so demo just customizing, which is a promising sign for those who love expressing themselves as much as I do.</p>
<p>While a few more hairstyles would have been nice, this is a work-in-progress, so hopefully there's more to come. This is my chance to hop on a soapbox and say the customization options in <em>World of Warcraft</em> are ridiculously outdated and pale in comparison to the likes of <em>Throne and Liberty</em>, even if the rest of the game feels somewhat mechanically similar.</p>
<p>Understanding the intricacies of an MMO in one small slice is nearly impossible, but the gameplay portion for of my demo for <em>Throne and Liberty</em> gives me a decent taste, at least. I started with an already-leveled character and a slew of abilities, which is perfect for trying out one of the game's many dungeons.</p>

<h2>A Good ol' Dungeon Dive in <em>Throne and Liberty</em></h2>
<p>Along with a group of a few other players and guided by a developer, we seamlessly hop into a dungeon and embark into the unknown. One thing that's important to understand is there are no classes in <em>Throne and Liberty</em>; rather, you carve your role in the group based on the combination of weapons you choose.</p>
<p>In my case, I opted for a pure magical DPS build with the wand and staff. In the main game, you can mix and match a set of two weapons, so that's how you'll ultimately determine your role in a group. Having mained a troll mage in <em>World of Warcraft</em> for over a decade, two magic-based weapons felt like a fit for me.</p>
<p>Many MMOs tend to overwhelm a player with its large selection of abilities, but <em>Throne and Liberty</em> is a bit more restrained and allowed for a manageable selection. I didn't feel overwhelmed by the spells I had, and managed to contribute to the rest of the group.</p>

<h2>The Fight to King Chimaerus</h2>
<p>The dungeon layout, by the way, is pretty simple and felt like one of your traditional MMORPG dungeons. Mobs scattered out and about, a few mini-bosses along the way, and of course, the final boss of the dungeon. There's something cathartic about running a dungeon with the pals, and I could imagine myself losing plenty of hours in <em>Throne and Liberty</em>.</p>
<p>This dungeon was by no means groundbreaking, though I got a taste of a few other features <em>Throne and Liberty</em> has to offer. Players can morph into animals to glide, run, swim, and the like, which should prove as a useful tool in overworld. At one point, a large room started to flood and we all turned into otters to navigate the waters easier.</p>
<p>You can safely land from high jumps by pressing the jump button while dropping, allowing you to glide -- this was used several times throughout the dungeon. Again, nothing groundbreaking here, but I imagine there are some more creative uses for these abilities as players progress through the vast world and its dungeons.</p>

<p>The boss fight at the end of the dungeon is a giant chimera called King Chimaerus -- this should be familiar to those who have seen footage for <em>Throne and Liberty </em>before. Like <em>World of Warcraft</em> (or plenty of other MMOs), you'll have to learn his patterns and be aware of your surroundings if you want to survive.</p>
<p>There's one ability a tank needs to soak in order to mitigate damage to party members targeted by this attack. Chains holding this hanging object in the middle of the room need to be interacted with at a specific moment to stun the boss, all the while we avoid pools of poison from Chimaerus' viper tail.</p>
<p>In the end, <em>Throne and Liberty</em> is a very familiar-feeling game, especially for those who are used to <em>World of Warcraft</em> like I am. But that has me intrigued, since I know it's a mechanically solid and accessible MMO, which seems like a rare find these days. I'm excited to see how <em>Throne and Liberty</em> sets itself apart when it releases at some point in the future.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24180967/dragon-quest-hd-2d-nintendo-switch<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="A0Xjor">The long-awaited “<a href="https://www.polygon.com/23278977/live-a-live-hd-2d-remake-square-enix-jrpg">HD-2D</a>” <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22456431/dragon-quest-12-announced-dq3-remake-treasures-keshi">remake of classic Enix role-playing game <em>Dragon Quest 3</em></a> is coming to Nintendo Switch this November, publisher Square Enix announced Tuesday during a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24180900/nintendo-direct-june-2024-everything-announced-games">Nintendo Direct</a> showcase. But <em>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D</em> isn’t the only classic Erdrick adventure coming from Square Enix — the collection <em>Dragon Quest 1 &amp; 2 HD-2D</em> was also announced Tuesday, giving fans of Akira Toriyama and Yuji Horii’s RPG series a lavishly remade trilogy to enjoy over the next year.</p>
<p id="kJc63H"><em>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D</em> will send players on a remade fantasy adventure as The Hero to take down the archfiend Baramos, traveling to towns, dungeons, and underground caves, and battling <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24094509/akira-toriyama-dragon-quest-slime">slimes</a> and other Toriyama-designed monsters in turn-based battles. The original <em>Dragon Quest 3</em> is set before the events of the first two games in the series, so, chronologically, playing <em>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D</em> first will prep you for the next two games.</p>
<p id="M4xSbL">Square Enix didn’t say much about what’s changing for <em>Dragon Quest 1 &amp; 2 HD-2D</em>, or whether they will feature expanded narratives as <em>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D</em> will, but that seems quite likely.</p>
<p id="8hCz8K"><em>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D</em> will be released on Nov. 14 on Nintendo Switch. <em>Dragon Quest 1 &amp; 2 HD-2D</em> are due sometime in 2025.</p>
<p id="TOHIas">Square Enix’s brand of HD-2D games started with developer Acquire’s retro RPG <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/7/12/17563366/octopath-traveler-review-nintendo-switch-jrpg"><em>Octopath Traveler</em></a> in 2018. The RPG publisher saw the potential in HD-2D for both new releases and remakes; the style has since been employed for <em>Octopath Traveler 2</em> and tactics RPG <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22958989/triangle-strategy-review-nintendo-switch-jrpg"><em>Triangle Strategy</em></a>, with plans for more remakes beyond the early Dragon Quest games.</p>

Use echoes of water blocks to reach new heights, make bridges out of old beds, throw rocks at foes – or find your own creative combination of echoes to do things your way.
