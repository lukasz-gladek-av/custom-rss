<figure><a title="EA CEO PAY INCREASE" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/dc250c7342108/ea-ceo-pay-increase.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: EA</em></figcaption></figure><p>EA's CEO, Andrew Wilson, has somehow managed to find himself $5 million richer than usual this year, according to the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0000712515/000130817925000556/ea014143-def14a.htm">latest Proxy filing by the company</a>.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ea-ceo-andrew-wilson-pay-ai-target">Stephen Totilo over at Game File</a>, the extra cash on top of an already very nice annual income, flies directly in the face of how the general population of workers for the company are being renumerated. This is all bad, however it has made for a rather amusingly shaped graph, so silver linings and all that.</p>

<p>Indeed, and ignoring the huge graph for just a second, EA reported the median income for full-time employees in the company circa 2024 was $117,000, down from $149,000 in 2023. That's...that's a massive drop. Now Totilo goes into some really depressing details here, in that EA's reported figures, according to Game File, are notoriously imprecise.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It’s ostensibly based on a median average, not the mean (median = pulling the middle number from a stack of salaries; mean = adding the salary stack together, then dividing by the number of salaries in that stack).<br>
Confusingly, EA says it used “the same median employee” in 2025 that it used to compare compensation with Wilson in 2023 and 2024.<br>
It does not explain that workers’ 2025 pay drop, but says its figures for CEO and worker pay both include bonuses and stock grants, which can rise and fall in a given year."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Regardless of whether or not you catch all that, the main thing to note, as ever, is that Joe Public gets less, while the CEO makes an extra stash that's more than most of us will see in our entire lives. As you were, comrades.</p>
<p>Now onto the graphs, and we'll let you <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ea-ceo-andrew-wilson-pay-ai-target">click through</a> to the very tall one but let's just say it really highlights, by having you scroll a few seconds longer than you may think you're gonna, all the way up from $100k right to that big fat £39 million dollar pay stack of Wilson's, just how huge the gap is between top and bottom...and with seemingly very little explanation.</p>
<hr>
<p><em><br></em><em>Think there's a bit of an unfair discrepancy between what CEOs are paid compared to their workforce? Would it be quicker to ask only those who don't to leave a comment? Let us know!</em></p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It had been six months since Pascal Gilcher, also known as Marty McFly, had released an update for his popular <a href="https://wccftech.com/rtgi-shader-adds-image-based-lighting-extended-ray-length-multiplier/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTGI ReShade shader</a>.&nbsp;However, a new version just became available to his <a href="https://www.patreon.com/mcflypg?" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Patreon</a> subscribers, and it's a big one.</p>
<p>The modder tried to implement the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-researchers-demonstrate-new-raytracing-algorithm-that-can-render-direct-lighting-from-millions-of-dynamic-light-sources/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ReSTIR GI</a> algorithm in his shader, but encountered several limitations, like chroma noise (because reservoir sampling can only hold light from a single direction), sample correlation that breaks denoiser variance estimation, and white noise output. Eventually, Gilcher decided to design his own sampling algorithm, which he reckons vastly outperforms ReSTIR GI in terms of quality.&nbsp;The RTGI shader has also received significant improvements to its reflections, which now trace pixel-perfect paths using HiZ Min-Max Tracing.</p>
<p>The modder also shared future plans to split RTGI's diffuse and specular components into separate shaders to manage them more easily.</p>
<p><iframe title="Marty's Mods | Update June 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PImgAUIoyZw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There were also improvements to other Gilcher's shaders, such as MXAO, which saw the fixing of the low-radius halos that manifested around objects, and especially Launchpad, whose optical flow is used by several other shaders. This new version of Launchpad introduces an innovative gradient descent-based algorithm that can handle subpixel shifts more effectively than traditional grid-based search methods.</p>
<p>Users can now choose from two general-purpose gradient descent optimizers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Newton: Converges quickly, making it more suitable for lower-quality settings.</li>
<li>SophiaG: Converges more slowly, but finds better minima, making it a good fit for high-quality settings.</li>
</ul>
<figure><figcaption>Launchpad - Before and After</figcaption></figure>
<p>Lastly, Gilcher has released a brand new shader: path traced volumetric fog. It was originally built as a ground truth reference for a real-time effect, but the modder ultimately enjoyed so much that the full path-traced version is now available in beta testing, although it's meant to be used for screenshots only. Check out the example below, which was captured in God of War.</p>
<figure><figcaption>Before</figcaption></figure>
<figure><figcaption>After</figcaption></figure>
<p>The path traced volumetric fog shader is currently only available at the most expensive Patreon tier, 'Photon Mappers', which costs $20 monthly.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Is there any video game series better suited to the <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/playing-with-history">Playing with History</a> treatment than the <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/sniper-elite">Sniper Elite</a> franchise? <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/rebellion">Rebellion Developments</a>’ finest has been encouraging players to crotch-shot Nazis for two decades now, ever since the first Sniper Elite was released way back in 2005 for the humble PlayStation 2 and original Xbox generation. It’s a series that has enabled players to fight alongside the French Resistance, explore the battlefields of North Africa, and infiltrate a multitude of supposedly impregnable German fortresses. This third-person stealth game has had a darn impressive run, and, with the success of this year’s <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/sniper-elite-resistance">Sniper Elite: Resistance</a>, that trend shows no signs of abating anytime soon.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sniper Elite: Resistance - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MfZU8JnBtrY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>So, considering all that, it’s no surprise I sought out the creative minds behind Sniper Elite to ask questions and find out more about the real-life history that helped bring the fictional adventures of Karl Fairburn to life. Questions like, across the Sniper Elite series, what informs the set-up and content of the missions that the player undertakes? Are they based on real missions that took place in WW2? Entirely invented? Or a combination of the two? I didn’t know the answers to any of these quandaries. Fortunately, Beck Shaw – Lead Level Designer, did:</p>


<p>“Early in the process of any Sniper Elite entry, we try to set the overall narrative of the game” explained Beck. “Within this, we look at location (country), enemies (who is the big baddie going to be?), when during the war does the game take place? etc. Once we have this foundation, we continue to refine it further and scout iconic locations (towns, cities, geographical landmarks) from within the country where we have decided to set the story. In terms of the actual missions, we take an amalgamation of inspiration from real wartime operations, popular media (movies, books, games) and also cool ideas that come to the team during our brainstorming sessions.”</p>
<p>This response got me to wondering… with all that research, have there been any real-life events or historical moments that have turned up in Sniper Elite which are so weird or unusual that most players think they are made up?</p>


<p>“Great question!” exclaimed Jean-Baptiste Bolcato – Executive Producer, Simon Richards – Lead Environment Artist, and Martin Carter – Studio Art Lead, in unison – causing my already quite substantial ego to expand enormously and, if I’m honest, rather painfully. “There are several super weapons that have featured in the series that are grounded in real life. One of these is the Ratte tank from Sniper Elite 3, which was a humungous tank that would have used a battleship turret for its main gun. It was never actually produced, but plans were made and shown to Hitler himself. There are other oversized “Wunderwaffe” and structures in the series that are grounded in reality, like the railway gun from Sniper Elite 4, the sub pen from St. Nazaire, and the fortified flak towers, which were built to protect Berlin and could house 15,000 people in one tower! Perhaps the wackiest weapon though is the Rat Bombs used in Sniper Elite 5 and Sniper Elite: Resistance – players might not think these were a real thing, but they were!”</p>
<p>That’s right, dear reader, the Rat Bomb was very much a real thing and is up there with the Bat Bomb in terms of animal-exploding brilliance. Back in 1941, boffins from the Special Operations Executive procured one hundred dead rats that were then stuffed full of explosives and sewn shut. Their cunning plan involved leaving the dynamite padded dead rat by a boiler. When the rat was inevitably spotted, the oblivious German would lob the critter into the flames to dispose of it, and then boom! Thing is, it never actually worked, as the Germans discovered the Rat Bombs before any went off. Though on the plus side, they spent a lot of time and effort regularly looking for more Rat Bombs which never existed.</p>
<p>Exploding pests aside, how do the team go about researching more conventional weaponry, to ensure they look and feel right?</p>
<p>“We put a lot of effort into ensuring the weapons that players use in the Sniper Elite series are as accurate as possible,” confirms Martin. “Firstly, we have a long-standing relationship with the Imperial War Museum which allows us to digitally map the rifles, pistols, and submachine guns. Enabling our design and art teams to create authentic in-game representations. We also undertake days on shooting ranges to fire as many of the weapons as possible. These sessions are filmed, and we use this footage to map the sounds of each weapon, as well as examine aspects like recoil.”</p>

<p>Now that is dedication. It also sounds like tremendous fun too. Though surely changes must be made to these weapons to ensure they work within the context of a video game?</p>
<p>Martin again: “In terms of weapons and their accuracy, we always aim to make the main weapon a 1-to-1 representation of their real-life counterpart. Examples of where we stretch the rules is when we create items like barrel variants – either to simply give the gun a new aesthetic, or to an improved attribute, such as increase reload or accuracy etc. Also, the camouflage painting of weapons is also not accurate to the WW2 period, although on many occasions, the camouflage paint used is based on real-world examples that could be found on uniforms or vehicles.”</p>
<p>When talking about guns in Sniper Elite, so the next obvious question has to do with the series distinctive ‘X-Ray Kill Cam’. This innovative feature is a gory delight that follows a bullet from the barrel of the player’s gun, right into the delicates of an unsuspecting Nazi. I wasn’t sure if I wanted to know the answer, but being a lover of danger, I thought I’d ask it anyway: What sort of research goes into ensuring this Kill Cam induced maiming is as realistic an experience as possible for the player?</p>
<p>“Our art team spends a rather disturbing amount of time looking at references for the Kill Cam.” Expounds Tom Beesley – Art Director, with a twisted grin. “This mainly focuses on studying the ballistics using high speed film and ballistic gel to get a far better visual representation of the cause and effect of a bullet impact on soft tissue. We have also studied in detail how organs would look and react to gunshot wounds, as well as using photogrammetry to scan organics to add a far higher quality bar to the overall visual. We established Sniper Elite’s Kill Cam as a ‘best in class’ some time ago, and we recognise its appeal to the players, so we are always trying to experiment and expand where it goes next.”</p>

<p>I can tell you where the bullet goes next, likely straight into a Nazi’s testicles. Talking of testicles – a question I never thought I’d type – for those players who have decided to shoot Hitler in the genitals using Kill Cam, did any research take place to confirm if the iconic marching song was correct and that Hitler did indeed only have one ball? If so, is there any truth that the missing ball bag was displayed as a war trophy displayed in the Royal Albert Hall?</p>
<p>Tom steps up to answer my probing and insightful question with relish. “There are many differing opinions as to whether Hitler was indeed running at 50%. Medical records apparently exist that attest to him having a condition called cryptorchidism. Equally there is a lot of evidence that the British propaganda machine was also working very effectively to build this into one of the original truly viral stories, even if it wasn’t true. As we know the despot loved to use body doubles and we have touched on that in the Sniper Elite series, so the question is how far would those body doubles be willing to go for an acting job!?”</p>
<p>That is an excellent, and rather unpleasant, thought. When it comes to Hitler’s doubles, Sniper Elite has dispatched numerous of their number in a variety of satisfyingly unpleasant ways. What has been the team’s favourite way to see off a Hitler clone?</p>
<p>Simon Richards, Lead Environment Artist: “I’m going to go with crushing Hitler with the bell in Sniper Elite 3”. Simon crows, “that one always stands out to me!” Meanwhile, Beck, goes with a far more understated option, “I think my favourite one is the bowling pin flying down the bowling alley in Sniper Elite 5!” To explain more of this would spoil the surprise, but it’s definitely worth booting up the game and doing some experimenting if you ask me.</p>

<p>As my time with the Sniper Elite team draws to an end, I just had to know, where’s next for the Sniper Elite series? Will Karl Fairburn be returning? “There’s so much of World War 2 we’ve not even explored in the Sniper Elite series, so who knows where we may end up” replies Beck, sneakily not giving anything away, “I obviously can’t talk about any specifics right now as we don’t have anything to announce just yet, but, in the meantime, we have another mission for Harry Hawker to undertake in Sniper Elite: Resistance!”</p>
<p><em>Excellent news! Frankly, the PWH Team can’t get enough of Sniper Elite, which is why you’ll definitely be finding out more about the fascinating real-life history that informed the series in our forthcoming book which, funnily enough, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/playingwithhistory/playing-with-history-pixels-polygons-and-the-past?ref=discovery&amp;term=playing%20with%20history&amp;total_hits=28&amp;category_id=35">is live on Kickstarter right now</a>! Our first volume will feature over 100 games, 200 pages, and 10,000,000 years of history – make sure you check it out!</em></p>

		<p>Super Mario Strikers will be joining the Nintendo GameCube library of games on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-online">Switch Online</a> + Expansion Pack next week, with kick off set for 3rd July 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="Super Mario Strikers – Nintendo GameCube – Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1VOcz6Z5PRY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Released back in 2005 toward the tail end of the GameCube era, Super Mario Strikers has become a real fan favourite, even with Mario Strikers Charged launching a couple years later for Wii, and then <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/06/14/mario-strikers-battle-league-review-switch-football/">Mario Strikers: Battle League</a> coming 15 years later for Switch. They didn’t quite scratch the same itch, and there’s plenty that will still proclaim the original Mario football game to be the best.</p>
<p>Super Mario Strikers will be playable exclusively on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> for subscribers to Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/gamecube-games-join-nintendo-switch-online-exclusive-to-switch-2/">GameCube game emulation is only available to the Switch 2 console</a>. While we’ve seen GameCube games ported to original Switch, including Super Mario Sunshine and the first two Pikmin games, Nintendo has chosen to segment this as a new console perk.</p>
<p>This joins a trio of games that were available for the Switch 2’s launch, so the full GameCube lineup from 3rd July will be:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker</li>
<li>SoulCalibur 2</li>
<li>F-Zero GX</li>
<li>Super Mario Strikers</li>
</ul>
<p>Previously teased as coming in future are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Super Mario Sunshine</li>
<li>Fire Emblem Path of Radiance</li>
<li>Pokémon XD Gale of Darkness</li>
<li>Chibi-Robo!</li>
<li>Luigi’s Mansion</li>
<li>Pokémon Colosseum</li>
</ul>
<p>Playing GameCube games again is great, especially with built-in support for wide screen and the ability to run at higher resolutions, and even with online multiplayer a possibility.</p>

<p>For the most authentic experience, you’ll want the official GameCube gamepad recreation which Nintendo has produced, and updated with wireless and Switch 2 system buttons. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/23/nintendo-switch-2-gamecube-controller-review/">I gave this a review</a>, saying “The Nintendo Switch 2 GameCube Controller is a great-feeling recreation of a classic gamepad, furnished with some extra hidden buttons to make it a shade more modern, but it’s too limited to use outside of the Switch Online game library.”</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-2-nvidia-dlss-4-amd-fsr-4/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Besides new content, Monster Hunter Wilds Title Update 2 is introducing some new features on PC, the full update notes confirmed.</p>
<p>Following the announcement of the update's <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-free-title-update-2-arrives-on-monday-adds-lagiacrus-and-seregios-to-the-hunt/">release date</a> and most significant additions, which include returning monsters Lagiacrus and Seregios, the <a href="https://info.monsterhunter.com/wilds/update/en-us/Ver.1.020.00.00.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Title Update 2 full notes</a> have gone live, confirming it will add NVIDIA DLSS 4 and AMD FSR 4 support on PC. Multi Frame Generation support is also being added by the update, featuring an Auto option that will dynamically turn frame generation on and off depending on the load. The upscaling and frame generation options will also be separated once the title update goes live, allowing users, for example, to use NVIDIA DLSS for upscaling and AMD FSR frame generation together, or any other combination. Rounding up the PC-specific additions are a warning dialogue that warns the user they are using out-of-date GPU drivers, new customizable keyboard configuration controls, and the option of copying the Lobby ID/ Hunter ID via the Start Menu and the Squad ID via the Squad Menu. Unfortunately, the Title Update 2 notes make no mention of performance or optimization improvements, so most users will still have to rely on Frame Generation to hit acceptable levels of performance.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the Monster Hunter Wilds Title Update 2, which launches next week on June 30, introduces Lagiacrus and Seregios, a Layered Weapons system, and many other features. Next month, hunters will also be able to take on Arch-tempered Uth Duna and participate in a Fender Special Collaboration event in August. The following Title Update, which has yet to be detailed, will launch in September.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. You can learn more about the game by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">review.</a></p>

That's bullshit, I didn't make it for the money at all," Zurawka said, revealing that in its biggest month so far it raked in $4,050 once expenses like Steam's cut were factored in. That was in April, when the game was at its attention zenith, with the number looking like it's steadily dropping in the couple of months since.</p>
<p>"It's not even paying a developer for us," the CEO claimed, "If you just look at the numbers, it's actually losing us money in the end."</p>
<p>This is where things get weird. Like some other free-to-play clickers seemingly attracting high player numbers on Steam, a lot of the folks the data counts as 'playing' Bongo Cat aren't people, they're bots farming and selling the cat hats and skins it dishes out on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/market/search?appid=3419430">Steam's community market</a> for real cash. Zurawka estimates that "roughly 50 percent" of Bongo Cat's player base, which <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3419430/charts/#1m">currently ranges</a> from about 150,000 to just under 200,000 at peak, is made up of these automated auctioneers.</p>
<p>Despite that, the developer says money made from this robotic wheeler dealing only amounts to roughly half or less what the game makes each month. Where does it prove its worth, then? Well, as a big bot-infested advert for another game Irox Games are trying to ensure doesn't drown in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steams-next-fests-have-grown-into-humongous-battle-royales-and-june-2025s-was-no-different">Steam's discoverability maelstrom</a>.</p>
<p>After having a roguelite city builder called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2473640/EcoGnomix/?curator_clanid=45040150">EcoGnomix</a> flop, Zurawka and co are using Bongo Cat to promote their next game, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3590650/OKU/?curator_clanid=45040150">Oku</a> - a very un-Bongo Catty monk adventure. They're even giving out some of those cosmetics to folks who do stuff like watch Oku's trailer. The exec says he's had publishers ask how much Bongo Cat cost to make, something that Eurogamer note could lead to potentially less ethical Bongo copycats.</p>
<p>I'll be honest, Steam's already bulging ranks being filled up even further with games that mainly exist, at least from a practical perspective, to advertise other games isn't a future I'd be a fan of. Though, given the times we're living in, that probably means it's the one we'll end up with.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, it's great to see devs working to find themselves solutions to the incredibly tough task that is making smaller games stand out from the crowd in the great rat race for Steampremacy, and Zurawka does appear to care about making Bongo Cat a good game real people do actually enjoy playing. It might be a tad idealistic, but I'm just hoping there's a better way that'll allow devs to concentrate on just making the games they want to, without having to consider aiming for a short turnaround viral hit that the robo-grinders really love.</p>
<p>As the dev told EG: "It's a bit disappointing to see that it takes you to having to be successful to be successful."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steams-popular-bongo-cat-clicker-is-losing-money-but-its-worth-to-its-devs-lies-elsewhere]]></content:encoded>

According to EA's pay ratio breakdown for the 2025 fiscal year, the annual total compensation of its "median employee" was $117,302. Or, to put it another way, Wilson earned 260 times more than the median EA worker over the past 12 months.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a notable shift compared to the 2024 fiscal year, which saw the median EA employee earn $148,704.

<p>As reported by <a href="https://wccftech.com/teamgroup-launches-apex-sd7-1-microsd-express-card-for-nintendo-switch-2/amp/">WCCFTech</a>, the company has detailed its Apex SD7.1 range, which includes storage sizes from 128gb right up to 1TB. From the press release, here's some further info. Oh, and we do like the little controller design on these, we must say:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Next-Gen MicroSD Express Technology – Comprehensive Performance Upgrade</em></li>
<li><em>Fully Compatible with Nintendo Switch 2<sup>[4]</sup> with Broad Device Compatibility</em></li>
<li><em>Ultra-Fast Read/Write Speeds up to 800MB/s &amp; 700MB/s</em></li>
<li><em>Certified by SD Association’s SVP Program</em></li>
<li><em>Evolved High Capacity Storage Space of up to 1TB</em></li>
<li><em>Seamless 4K Recording to Capture Every Moment</em></li>
<li><em>Comprehensive Protection with Lifetime Warranty</em></li>
</ul>

<p>There's also a bunch of details about how these cards are "resistant to water, shock, X-rays, static electricity, and extreme temperatures, enabling stable performance even in harsh environments." So, a standard Saturday night out in Glasgow with your Switch 2 should be fine, then.</p>
<p>Sounds great! Now, how much are they and where can we get all the biggest ones before they sell out? Well, for now, we have no details on pricing, but you can head over to the TeamGroup's website, where they detail <a href="https://www.teamgroupinc.com/en/shop/united-kingdom/">stores that should stock the cards once they release</a>. We've had a quick look and we can see that Overclockers is one supplier for UK-based gamers, whilst in the US you have Amazon and Newegg amongst your choices.</p>
<p>We'll keep you updated as soon as we've got further details on release dates and that all-important pricing!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Outer Worlds 2 may be a sequel, but it's definitely doing some things differently than its predecessor. One of those things is the ability for players to 'respec', that is to say, to change their allocation of perks, traits, and whatnot. The first game supported that, but the new game director Brandon Adler, who did not work on the original The Outer Worlds (but has credits in Obsidian RPGs like Neverwinter Nights 2, Alpha Protocol, Fallout: New Vegas, Pillars of Eternity and its sequel, and Avowed), has a different view on the matter. Speaking to RPG Site, he <a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/interview/17785-outer-worlds-2-director-interview-respec-rpg-choice-consequences" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a>:</p>
<p><em>We don't allow respec. Lots of people love respec… that is definitely one way you can go about things. I personally want the player to understand their choices are permanent – they matter – and then they think more about their choices. There's a lot of times where you'll see games where they allow infinite respec, and at that point I'm not really role-playing a character, because I'm jumping between -- well my guy is a really great assassin that snipes from long range, and then oh, y'know, now I'm going to be a speech person, then respec again.</em></p>
<p><em>For me, it's not wrong that people like to play like that. But I just like to make sure... Look, if we're going to do The Outer Worlds 2, I want to make sure that the role playing is really strong. I want to make sure that you're building your character and really doubling down - making sure that role-playing comes through the whole experience.</em></p>
<p>It's definitely an interesting view. I can see where he's coming from, although others will be disappointed by the lack of flexibility when building their new character. However, you are still allowed a bit of experimentation in the beginning, as you can still respect while in the tutorial area.</p>
<p>The Outer Worlds 2 will <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-launches-this-coming-october-on-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">debut</a> on October 28 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X and will be available on Game Pass from day one.</p>

Yet despite regularly attracting over 150,000 concurrents, the game doesn't actually make any money, its developer has revealed in a recent interview.</p><p>Marcel Zurawka is the CEO and co-founder of Irox Games, the studio behind Bongo Cat. In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steams-fourth-most-played-game-doesnt-really-make-any-money-and-its-developer-says-its-better-off-that-way" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, Zurawka pulled back the curtain on the game's viral success, revealing that the high player numbers haven't translated to income for the studio.</p><p>"Some people said, 'Oh you're now rich.' That's bullshit. I didn't make it for the money at all," Zurawka said. "So the first month of March, we made $2000 net, after Steam cuts and everything." He shares all of Bongo Cat's monthly income--$4050 for April, the peak of the game's virality, $3800 in May, and down to $2800 for June so far.</p><p>"It's not even paying a developer for us," he adds. "If you just look at the numbers, it's actually losing us money in the end."</p><p>Bongo Cat is a free <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-idle-games/2900-5676/" data-ref-id="2900-5676">idle game</a> that's really more of a desktop app than an actual game. It puts a little cat on top of your task bar, who taps his paws on a counter for every key press and mouse click. Bongo Cat can discover different hats as the counter goes up, and these items can be traded on Community Marketplaces for real money--which has also resulted in elevated bot activity in the game.</p><p>Zurawka says that the money made from marketplace transactions is generally less than half of Bongo Cat's total income, with the bulk of its sales coming from paid cat skins available in the game as microtransactions.</p><p>Making money was never the goal of Bongo Cat, however. "I want to have it as an easy companion tool for everybody and don't want anyone to pay anything," Zurawka explains. "For me, it should always be as accessible as possible. I don't want to pay-wall anything."</p><p>The game's success has had a different kind of positive impact on the studio, however, acting as a marketing tool that's driven views and wishlists for the studio's next title in development, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/oku/" data-ref-id="5000-681663">Oku</a>.</p>

After threatening strike action the union finally made a breakthrough when it reached a tentative agreement with the Xbox maker.

            <p>Leon Kennedy of the great hair and lovely jacket fame was once considered to be the protagonist of Resident Evil Requiem, however he is simply too much of a bad ass to be the main focus of a Resi game right now.</p>
<p>That is coming from game director Koshi Nakanishi, who in a recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hiC3qpghP0">Resident Evil Requiem video</a> said good ol' Leon simply isn't the kind of person who would "jump at something like a bucket falling", and therefore making a "horror game based around him" is tricky.</p>
<p>"No one wants to see Leon scared by every little thing," Nakanishi said. "He's actually quite a bad match for horror."</p>

<p>Resident Evil Requiem will instead be headed up by FBI intelligence analyst Grace Ashcroft, who is described as "introverted and easily scared". The developer wanted to have a character who "experiences horror from the same perspective as the player". Grace - and by extension us as the player - will learn to overcome any fear she has as the game progresses.</p>
<p>In a separate <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/26/resident-evil-requiem-producer-masato-kumazawa-qa/">PlayStation blog</a>, Resident Evil Requiem producer Masato Kumazawa said the aim of this release was to "focus on horror", and Grace is a "relatable" protagonist unlike series regulars Leon Kennedy and Chris Redfield.</p>
<p>"By making Grace someone who reflects the player's own vulnerability, we believe players will enjoy a gameplay experience filled with tension and immersion. When walking alone down a dark hallway, her breathing becomes erratic; when an enemy suddenly appears, she jumps in fright," Kumazawa explained.</p>
<p>"Grace is a character with a low tolerance for fear, but she grows throughout the story and eventually begins to confront various horrors with courage. By the time players finish the game, we're confident everyone will have come to love her!"</p>
<p>So, does this all mean Leon isn't going to show up at all in Resident Evil Requiem? Nah, I don't think so at all. Thankfully, there isn't too much longer before we find out, with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-9-officially-unveiled-coming-february">next entry in the Resi series releasing on 27th February next year</a>, across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and Steam.</p>

Now, developer Sloclap is teaming up with Puma, one of the leading companies in footwear and sports apparel, to bring players some new gear options in this wildly popular soccer game.</p><p>The official teaser video for this collaboration only shows a few of Rematch's new items, including a Puma shirt, shoes, and shin guards.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DP4gVa8v1ok" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DP4gVa8v1ok" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Apparently this is the only Puma-exclusive outfit currently in Rematch, but the announcement indicates that more Puma clothing options will be added over time. Sloclap also notes that "the in-game Rematch outfit consists of popular in-real-life collections mixed and matched to create a stylish outfit that lets you look as good as you play."</p><p>Over 1 million players sampled Rematch on its first day alone, including gamers who subscribe to Xbox <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-xbox-game-pass-games/2900-4001/" data-ref-id="2900-4001">Game Pass Ultimate</a>. The game depicts a potential future for soccer that's set four decades down the line. Instead of fielding a full team, there are arcade-style 5v5 matchups, with options for 3v3 and 4v4 battles as well. There have also been several tweaks to the game, including the removal of fouls, offsides, penalty kicks, draws, and shoot-outs. Even the ball is always in play because the entire game takes place inside a cage.</p><p>Although Rematch is available on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rematch-wont-have-cross-play-options-ready-in-time-for-launch/1100-6532448/" data-ref-id="1100-6532448">there aren't currently any options for cross-play</a>. Sloclap still intends to add that feature at a later date. Rematch players have recently discovered that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rematch-players-discover-jumping-is-faster-than-running-but-dev-is-fixing-that-soon/1100-6532753/" data-ref-id="1100-6532753">jumping is faster than running</a> in this game, but Sloclap is already planning a fix for that.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A few hours ago, Remedy Entertainment <a href="https://x.com/remedygames/status/1938250909865410867" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> via social media channels that its first multiplayer game, FBC: Firebreak, had surpassed one million players. At the same time, the Finnish developer acknowledged that it has <a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-gets-update-1-2-as-remedy-promises-lots-more-fixes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a lot of work to do</a> to improve the game:</p>
<p><em>As of last night, we have surpassed 1 million players in FBC: Firebreak. This is a significant milestone, so thank you for playing from all of us at Remedy. We know there is still a lot of work ahead of us, and we are super-motivated about it. We have a lot of exciting things cooking for Firebreak players! More about that soon.</em></p>
<p>Indeed, the game may have reached one million players, but that's not saying too much since it has been available on the two primary subscription services, Sony's PlayStation Plus and Microsoft's Game Pass, since day one.</p>
<p>On Steam, the FBC: Firebreak peaked at 1,992 players ten days ago, but it's been getting lower and lower. Yesterday, the daily peak was 169 players. At the time of writing, there are 78 players playing the game via Valve's platform. User reviews are 'Mixed', too, with just 67% leaving a positive review.</p>
<p>Now, it is definitely a little early to sound the requiem for the game. We've seen several online games starting badly and managing to claw back their way to a decent, active user base. The reverse is also true, with some games starting off strong and then dying down like a flame.</p>
<p>Ultimately, any live service game lives or dies depending on the developer's ability to gather feedback, analyze it, and implement it properly. We'll see in the next few months how well Remedy fares in this regard, where so many developers have stumbled.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, you can read our full review of FBC: Firebreak <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fbc-firebreak-review-in-progress-dont-forget-to-shower/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, penned by Francesco De Meo.</p>

            <p>An uncomfortable question I've been asking myself this morning is, now that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>'s free <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/824835185591719947">Siege mode update</a> is out, how much money I'd be convinced to part with if they, I dunno, added some Orks. Just a couple Orks. Few grots. Maybe a happy little squig. I ended up really enjoying the game after a rough start, and now this <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">co-op</a> horde mode is here, I think it's time to just, you know, pretend the whole Tzeentch thing never happened. It's a horde mode. Add some horde enemies. Happy little squig, you know? Look at him bounce. Wheeeeee.</p>
<p>Anyway the question is uncomfortable because my answer is, depressingly, however much they asked for. What do you mean Kill Team: Typhon is out of stock everywhere? Yes, I haven't even opened the last two boxes, but I'm not sure what that has to do with anything. Here's a trailer anyway. Warning: it's got space marines taking themselves very seriously in it.</p>

<p>Siege is a three player co-op wavey hordey PvE mode with a sort of roguelike resource structure where you'll gain 'requisition points' from defeating waves, to spend on things like consumables and reinforcements between rounds. I find the idea of buying a McNugget box of Cadians to throw at the enemy very funny. I'm not sure how useful they'll be considering how squishy they are in campaign but, hey, <em>it's not like they've got anywhere else to be</em>. Save up enough, and you can even call in a dreadnought.</p>
<p>Every five waves, you'll go up against elites like Hellbrutes, Carnifexes, and everybody's fave, Neurothropes. You then keep going until you're dead, or "fulfill your duty to the Emperor, for only in death does duty end", as the update puts it. Do they ever like, just have a nice biscuit and play Scrabble for a bit?</p>
<p>The update also adds some more paid cosmetics and weapon skins and maybe a pubic wig styled after the Emperor's glorious flowing locks. You can read the <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/230-patch-notes-8-0">full 8.0 patch notes here</a>. Here's a few highlights:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>The Thunder Hammer being available for Bulwark</li>
<li>The possibility to turn off bots in private lobbies</li>
<li>RTAO and DLSS 4 support</li>
<li>You can now change the color of your class's weapons by playing siege Mode.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>"Space Marine 2 is an often-satisfying scrapper that has me convinced of 40K's merit as a crafting ground for excellent-looking environments and creatures," wrote <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review">Brendy in his review</a>, "even if I'm not particularly moved by the bland character of Titus and his fellow Ultramarines". Personally, I've been really enjoying the PvE missions, especially this one where a random fellow marine and I shared the backstories that led to our undying hatred for the Tyranids.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The first DLC expansion for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/two-point-museum">Two Point Museum</a> will launch on 17th July, bringing Fantasy Finds into the exhibit halls with magical artefacts, class-based Fantasy Experts and a whole new realm for you to send them adventuring across.</p>
<p><iframe title="Two Point Museum: Fantasy Finds | Coming 17th July" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GRgEvhYj1L0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Fantasy Finds will add 40 new exhibits to discover, from the Teanie Kettle and Novel Wardrobe through to a Flying Carpet or a Mimic chest. With such wondrous magical marvels to behold, guests can easily get wrapped up in the action and become cursed, if you don’t maintain them properly.</p>
<p>That’s where Fantasy Experts come in, with Barbarian, Wizard, Rogue and Bard classes, each of which comes with specific stats. When sending them out on expeditions, you’ll have to juggle whether they’ve got enough Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence or Luck to overcome the challenges that await them, adding a little something extra to the expeditions found in the main game.</p>
<p>Of course, it wouldn’t do to just plop down your magic carpet in the middle of a boring hall. There’s 26 new decorations and utility items, interactive displays, banners, wallpapers, and floors to get the vibes just right for the three new guest archetypes that you’ll want to entertain. You can also buff museum staff with Mythical Gear to provide bonuses for protecting exhibits and giving a little more job security.</p>

<p>In the run up to the DLC release, Two Point Museum is 20% off in the Steam Summer Sale, while the DLC will have a 10% discount across PC, Xbox and PlayStation for its first week on sale.</p>
<p>Launching earlier this year, Two Point Museum is another great spin on the humorous management sim series. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/25/two-point-museum-review/">I said in our review</a>, “There’s great strides to allow for more customisation and creativity, a revamped structure to make revisiting levels more rewarding, and great variety in the core disciplines, but there’s also a few snags along the way and elements that could improved through updates and DLC.”</p>

			<p>Swedish game developer Fatshark <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-darktide-gets-new-arbites-class-via-dlc-and-free-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> the first paid DLC for Warhammer 40K Darktide earlier this week, adding the Adeptus Arbites class. Today, the studio has proudly shared that the launch has been successful. Martin Wahlund, CEO and Co-Founder of Fatshark, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>We more than doubled our estimated player goals on launch day alone. Thank you for making this launch one to remember!</em></p>
<p>The team also shared some fun stats. The Cyber-Mastiff companion has been petted more than 459,760 times as a reward for being a very good boy. Users have already killed 553,082,097 enemies with an Adeptus Arbites character. Their most used melee weapon so far is the Mk III Branx Pattern Arbites Shock Maul, used 969,008 times, while the most used ranged weapon is the Mk III Executioner Pattern Arbites Shotgun, used 1,157,103 times. The players' favorite ability is Break The Line, which was activated 715,525 times.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Darktide players can purchase the Arbites DLC for $11.99, although there's also a Deluxe Edition available at $18.99. This version includes a unique class outfit, a unique companion outfit, a portrait frame (this one can be equipped by characters of all classes), and four weapon skins.</p>
<p>Alongside the DLC, Fatshark also released a free update that introduced a more structured narrative path to ease new players into the game. The mission board system was revamped, too, increasing the number of mission options for all characters. The patch also increased the maximum number of Operatives to eight, as was the maximum number of weapon loadouts. Fatshark also added around 900 new banter conversations between characters.</p>
<p>Funnily enough, Darktide was not the only Warhammer 40K game to launch new content focused on the Adeptus Arbites. Owlcat's Rogue Trader cRPG also just released the Lex Imperialis expansion, introducing this very class of enforcers of the Emperor's justice, including a new companion, Solomorne Anthar.</p>

                <p>Nintendo is expanding <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/" data-ref-id="5005-154">Switch 2</a>'s slim GameCube library with another classic next week. The beloved arcade soccer game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/super-mario-strikers/" data-ref-id="5000-24383">Super Mario Strikers</a> will join the lineup on July 3.</p><p>Originally released in 2005, Super Mario Strikers is a fast-paced soccer game starring an assortment of iconic Mario characters. Like other Mario sports titles, the game features numerous arcade elements, including items like banana peels that can be used to trip up your opponent, as well as powerful special shots that are worth two goals if successfully executed.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VOcz6Z5PRY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1VOcz6Z5PRY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Super Mario Strikers would go on to spawn two sequels. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-strikers-charged/" data-ref-id="5000-28061">Mario Strikers Charged</a> launched for the Wii in 2007, while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-strikers-battle-league/" data-ref-id="5000-557731">Mario Strikers: Battle League</a> was released on the Switch back in 2022.</p><p>With the addition of Super Mario Strikers, Switch Online's GameCube library spans four games so far. Nintendo has already confirmed that more classics like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/super-mario-sunshine/" data-ref-id="5000-3885">Super Mario Sunshine</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fire-emblem-path-of-radiance/" data-ref-id="5000-20450">Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-colosseum/" data-ref-id="5000-18350">Pokemon Colosseum</a> are coming to the service in the future.</p><p>The GameCube library is one of a few Switch 2-exclusive perks of the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack plan. In addition, subscribers can download the Switch 2 upgrade packs for both <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild/" data-ref-id="5000-107502">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/" data-ref-id="5000-497748">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> for free, although it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-upgrade-process-is-mildly-confusing-for-nso-members/1100-6532137/" data-ref-id="1100-6532137">may not be immediately clear how</a>.</p><p>A base Nintendo Switch Online subscription runs for $20 a year, while the Expansion Pack plan costs $50 a year. Nintendo also offers an annual family plan for $80 that covers up to eight Nintendo Accounts across multiple systems.</p><p>Another perk of the Switch Online service is Switch 2's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-gamechat/1100-6531425/" data-ref-id="1100-6531425">GameChat</a> function, which allows users to chat and share their screen with friends. The feature is free to try for all Switch 2 owners until March 31, 2026 as part of an open-access trial period, after which point you'll need to have a Switch Online subscription to use it.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/command-line-newsletter/694028/meta-openai-100-million-bonus-talent-war</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/meta-says-it%E2%80%99s-winning-the-talent-war-with-openai.1229763/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>During a company-wide all-hands meeting on Thursday, some of Meta’s top executives were asked about the “$100 million signing bonuses” that OpenAI CEO <strong>Sam Altman</strong> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/688904/sam-altman-says-meta-has-offered-some-openai-employees-100-million-signing-bonuses">claimed</a> they had been offering to poach his employees.</p><p>“Sam is just being dishonest here,” <strong>Andrew Bosworth</strong>, Meta’s CTO, said at the meeting when asked about Altman’s remarks. “He’s suggesting that we’re doing this for every single person… Look, you guys, the market’s hot. It’s not that hot.”</p><p>The “$100 million bonus” headline has rightfully become a meme on social media since Altman said the number on his brother’s podcast. “What Sam neglects to mention is that he’s countering all these offers, creating a small market for a very, very small number of people who are for senior, senior leadership roles” in the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/command-line-newsletter/687173/inside-mark-zuckerbergs-ai-hiring-spree">new superintelligence AI team Meta is building</a>, Bosworth told Meta employees today. “That is not the general thing that’s happening in the AI space. And of course, he’s not mentioning what the actual terms of the offer are. It’s not [a] sign-on bonus. It’s all these different things.”</p><p>Bosworth then referenced recent stories about a handful of OpenAI researchers who are joining Meta and said there are “quite a few more in the pipeline that I can’t announce or share right now.”</p><p>“Sam is known to exaggerate, and in this case, I know exactly why he’s doing it, which is because we are succeeding at getting talent from OpenAI,” he said. “He’s not very happy about that.” </p><p>At the Thursday meeting, there were many employees present from the company’s engineering “bootcamp,” a multi-week onboarding program that assigns new hires to various teams. “For all the new bootcampers here, you didn’t screw up,” Bosworth said to laughs and claps from the audience. “You made a great decision. Comp is right where it should be.”</p><p>Bosworth wasn’t the only Meta exec to mention OpenAI during the internal meeting. CPO <strong>Chris Cox </strong>also acknowledged that, while Meta AI has one billion monthly users, engagement “is not nearly as deep as the way that people are using ChatGPT.” The standalone Meta AI app has only 450,000 daily users, he told employees, and “a lot of those folks” are using it to manage their Ray-Ban Meta glasses. </p><p>“We are not going to go right after ChatGPT and try and do a better job with helping you write your emails at work,” Cox said. “We need to differentiate here by not focusing obsessively on productivity, which is what you see Anthropic and OpenAI and Google doing. We’re going to go focus on entertainment, on connection with friends, on how people live their lives, on all of the things that we uniquely do well, which is a big part of the strategy going forward.”</p><p>Meta declined to comment on the internal meeting. </p><div><p id="iyo-versus-io"><h2><strong>Iyo versus io</strong></h2></p></div><p>When I spoke with <strong>Jason Rugolo</strong> on Thursday, I wanted to understand why he is suing the most influential company in tech. </p><p>Rugolo’s AI device startup, Iyo, recently <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/690858/jony-ive-openai-sam-altman-ai-hardware">won a temporary restraining order</a> that bars OpenAI from using the “io” brand for <strong>Sam Altman’s </strong>new hardware division with <strong>Jony Ive</strong>. In response, Altman <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/692840/sam-altman-io-trademark-battle-iyo-emails">took to his X account</a> to suggest that Rugolo filed his trademark lawsuit because OpenAI refused to invest in or buy Iyo, which is gearing up to release its first AI-powered, in-ear headphones later this year. </p><p>Rugolo acknowledges (and documents submitted to the court confirm) that he pitched Altman on investing multiple times. He also discussed an acquisition with io team members this year. Still, he says his lawsuit isn’t part of some revenge crusade, but rather intended to eliminate any confusion between his forthcoming <a href="https://x.company/projects/iyo/">Iyo One headphones</a> and Altman’s io.</p><p>Trademark lawsuits are a dime a dozen, but this one has broken through for good reason. There’s intense interest in what Altman and Ive are building (the first device <a href="https://www.theverge.com/openai/691737/openai-jony-ive-chatgpt-io-ai-device-wearable-headphone-lyo-lawsuit">apparently won’t be an “in-ear” product or a “wearable”</a>), and the case is a Rorschach test for how you feel about Altman, who is undoubtedly polarizing.</p><p>“I had a massive change in opinion on the guy,“ Rugolo tells me of Altman. “While I was meeting with them, I was under the spell of Sam Altman being a great entrepreneur and a really interesting person. That broke pretty instantly after their public announcement [of io].” </p><p>“<em>Am I getting screwed here?</em>” Rugolo recalls thinking. “When I talked to him on the phone and he made a Sopranos threat to sue me, I was just like, ‘Alright, this guy is a bad dude.’” Now, he says that Altman is trying to “manipulate the arguments in the public sphere” and “make me look like a money grubber or a sore loser, and I just don’t think it’s gonna work.”</p><p>“This is a baseless trademark dispute and not a case about stolen ideas or technology,” OpenAI spokesperson <strong>Kayla Wood</strong> says in a statement shared with me. “Iyo demoed a product in May 2025 that didn’t function properly or meet our standards in hopes that we’d acquire Iyo. We passed. Jason Rugolo was also well aware of the io name and never raised concerns before our announcement.”</p><p>Thanks to the millions of dollars he recently raised from his manufacturer, Pegatron, and a billionaire whom he refuses to name, Rugolo says Iyo has enough runway to last it through the end of 2026. When I ask if the device he teased in his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L61Kbo3y218">viral TED talk</a> last year is indeed shipping later this year, he says he’s about to fly to China to “basically be living at the factory.”</p><p>While he’s ready to go through the legal discovery process and take his case to trial, he hopes that OpenAI will “put their guns away” and “complete like grown-ups on product.” </p><p>“I will meet them in the market,” he tells me. “We will both try to launch stuff that’s really cool and see if we can serve our customers. They’ll just compete fairly and stop using the name. They have some of the best designers in the world, apparently. Think of a new name. You just can’t use the one that I told you about already, and that I’ve been using since 2019.”</p><div><p id="ai-is-coming-for-games"><h2><strong>AI is coming for games</strong></h2></p></div><div><p>So far, Runway is known for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/decoder-podcast-with-nilay-patel/679312/runway-ceo-cris-valenzuela-ai-video-copyright-hollywood-film-youtube">bringing generative AI to Hollywood</a>. Now, the $3 billion startup is setting its sights on the gaming industry.</p></div><p>This week, I was granted access to a new interactive gaming experience that Runway plans to make available to everyone as soon as next week, according to CEO <strong>Cristóbal Valenzuela</strong>. The consumer-facing product is currently quite barebones, with a chat interface that supports only text and image generation, but Valenzuela says that generated video games are coming later this year. He says that Runway is also in talks with gaming companies about both using its technology and accessing their datasets for training.</p><p>Based on his recent conversations, Valenzuela believes the gaming industry is in a similar position to Hollywood when it was first introduced to generative AI. There was considerable resistance, but over time, AI has been gradually adopted in more areas of the production process. Valenzuela says Amazon’s recent show, <em>House of David</em>, was made in part with Runway’s technology, and that his company is working with “pretty much every major studio” and “most of the Fortune 100 companies.” </p><p>“If we can help a studio make a movie 40 percent faster, then we’re probably gonna be able to help developers of games make games faster,” he says. “They’re waking up, and they’re moving faster than I would say the studios were moving two years ago.”</p><p>Naturally, I couldn’t let Valenzuela get off our Zoom call without asking him about his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-23/meta-held-deal-talks-with-startup-runway-in-ai-recruiting-push">recent acquisition talks</a> with Zuckerberg: “I think we have more interesting intellectual challenges being independent, and remaining independent for now.” </p><div><p id="elsewhere-in-openai"><h2><strong>Elsewhere in OpenAI</strong></h2></p></div><p><strong>No one knows what AGI actually means.</strong> That much is clear from this excellent <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-microsoft-duel-agi-high-stakes-negotiation?rc=v4bmzs">deep dive from <em>The Information</em></a> into Microsoft’s deal with OpenAI. There has been a lot of good reporting on the negotiations between the two companies, but this piece is the most comprehensive and detailed I’ve seen yet. It states that Microsoft will no longer receive exclusive access to OpenAI’s IP if it achieves “sufficient AGI,” which is contractually defined as when OpenAI’s board determines that the AI “has the capability to generate” the maximum profits its investors are entitled to. Amazingly, OpenAI doesn’t have to actually generate these profits. </p><p><strong>Two under-the-radar deals:</strong> Although they haven’t garnered many headlines, OpenAI announced an interesting partnership and a small acquisition this week. The first is a <a href="https://www.appliedintuition.com/news/applied-intuition-openai">deal with Applied Intuition</a> to “advance next-generation, AI-powered experiences in vehicles.” The second is the acquisition of the small team at <a href="https://www.crossingminds.com/">Crossing Minds</a>, an AI startup that helped e-commerce companies offer more personalized product recommendations. “Personally, joining OpenAI’s research team to focus on agents and information retrieval is a unique honor,” Crossing Minds founder <strong>Alexandre Eobicque</strong> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7343807373683113985/">writes</a>. “These are precisely the problems I’ve always been passionate about: how systems learn, reason, and retrieve knowledge at scale, in real-time.”</p><div><p id="personnel-log"><h2><strong>Personnel log</strong></h2></p></div><p><em>Some interesting career moves in tech:</em></p><div><ul><li><span>The three founders of OpenAI’s research office in Zurich, <strong>Lucas Beyer</strong>, <strong>Alexander Kolesnikov</strong>, and <strong>Xiaohua Zhai</strong>, <a href="https://x.com/giffmana/status/1938299990922674352">confirmed</a> they are joining Meta.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">After half a dozen hours in the earliest moments of the upcoming pirate RPG Sea of Remnants, I was left with tons of questions about how this one will ultimately turn out, whether it was the currently barebones turn-based combat system, the convoluted labyrinth of vendors and upgrade paths that reminded me a bit of an MMO, or the story and dialogue that were sometimes difficult to follow given this early build’s lack of English voice acting or reliable subtitles. But one thing that was never in doubt throughout all of that is just how much this colorful, over-the-top adventure is already absolutely dripping with style that’s so unbelievably hard to look away from, it made me eager to see more in spite of those rough edges. Seriously, the cartoonish characters, exaggerated (and often hilarious) animations, and gorgeous menus are some of the coolest I’ve seen since Persona 5, and even when I didn’t understand everything that was happening, I often couldn’t help but smile ear-to-ear. The version I played is so early and unfinished, it’s still pretty hard to tell if this will deliver in plenty of other areas, from gameplay to technical stability, but there’s plenty of time before the unspecific 2026 launch window to iron all that out, and it already has so much unique charm that I’m officially adding this one to my list of games to follow closely.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Before I get into what I liked and didn’t like in my time with Sea of Remnants, it’s worth mentioning again that what I played appeared to be an extremely early build that was quite unfinished and prone to all sorts of bugs and rocky technical performance. I’m used to playing unfinished products months and sometimes years before they see the light of day, but even by that measure, this one felt especially under construction. Menus and dialogue were riddled with placeholder text, crashes and bugs were quite frequent, and the entire thing hadn’t been optimized for non-Mandarin speakers like myself, which often left things lost in translation. For all of these reasons and more, it was more than a little hard to tell how things will pan out, both from a technical perspective and where gameplay is concerned, since many ideas were clearly extremely unbaked. Keep that in mind as you watch this video.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What I do know about Sea of Remnants is that it’s playing in a lot of the same space as Sea of Thieves, with open-world high seas to explore as a pirate crew and islands to visit, filled with loot waiting to be plundered. But it also distinguishes itself with unexpected elements, like the turn-based combat that happens when you’re ashore, or the RPG/MMO mechanics that accompany it – to the point where I’m not even sure what odd blend of genres the final product is shooting for, and every 30 minutes came with another surprise that added to that confusion, like how, late in the demo, I learned there were hundreds of recruitable companions I could take with me on voyages and build bonds with. And this is all without having been able to see any of the planned multiplayer components in action, as this will all apparently be taking place in an online world where you can interact with other pirate captains.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I’m not even sure what odd blend of genres the final product is shooting for.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, a lot of the ideas Sea of Remnants threw at me were pretty hard to get a sense for in this build, like the turn-based combat, where my buccaneer crew and I crossed swords and blunderbusses with rival skallywags and local fauna. While beautifully animated, the bits I played were also extremely oversimplified, either due to the section I played being pretty early on in the adventure, or just because it was quite clearly still a work in progress. As a big fan of turn-based battles, I’m hopeful they can flesh out some of the mechanics here to reach the heights of some of my recent favorites like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 or Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth, but for now it mostly reminded me of a very stripped-down version of Persona 5.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The good news is that, no matter how unfinished any aspect of Sea of Remnants was, it was consistently and without exception one of the most interesting games I’ve played in a long time. The humanoid characters (all of which are puppets for some reason) have a ton of personality despite their wooden faces, and their exaggerated animations really cracked me up. And despite having Sea of Thieves pirate vibes, I rarely felt like I knew what was going to happen next, like how after beating a giant ape boss on an island and getting back on my boat to go home, I suddenly found myself under attack by that same monkey out for revenge, who now captained his own vessel and blasted me with cannon fire. Then, even though I sent him to Davy Jones’ locker, my ship was sunk moments later anyway in the most silly cutscene imaginable. I still feel like I don’t really understand what it will feel like to play the final product, as it swings so wildly between juggling an inventory of loot, blasting cannons on a boat, and choosing between very confusing dialogue options with various party members, but even though playing through that confusion was often a little unintuitive, I certainly can’t say it wasn’t interesting – quite the opposite.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was also really nice to see such a unique setting, because although there’s a lot of typical piracy shenanigans you might expect, there are also really strange concepts peppered throughout that kept me on my toes, like how my journey started out with me finding the moon buried beneath the sea (!?), or how the marionette characters apparently lose their memory whenever they’re destroyed on an adventure, but always find themselves back inside the main island of Orbtopia to begin again. There’s also a really distinct punk vibe throughout the entire world, as everything is covered with graffiti and many of the characters act like reckless teenagers who cut class to cosplay as mischievous pirates. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The big question with Sea of Remnants is if its unmistakably cool presentation and interesting hodgepodge of ideas can actually come together into something coherent, and I truly feel no closer to answering that after more than six hours with it. For now, it’s definitely interesting and distinctive enough for me to anxiously wait to see more, but we’ll likely need to wait a fair bit longer before we can get a better feel for how it’s shaping up – especially when it comes to technical performance and the online aspects that were completely absent from this build.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The big question with Sea of Remnants is if its unmistakably cool presentation and interesting hodgepodge of ideas can actually come together into something coherent.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I can definitely see the beginnings of a vision here though, where the punk aesthetic and killer art style play well with over-the-top ship combat and slower, more tactical turn-based battles on foot to create something really special. Plus, we can always use more pirate fantasy in our lives, and I can already tell that this goofy take on the genre will bring a very fresh perspective. Granted, I have no idea how they’ll make online multiplayer, where friends would presumably come along for the ride, work with the turn-based combat and NPC party members. But hey – if they manage to pull it off it sounds like it’d be awesome, and if they don’t at least it’ll be something unique nonetheless.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/sea-of-remnants-preview-sea-of-thieves-piracy-meets-persona-5-stylishness-but-is-it-more-than-skin-deep]]></content:encoded>

        <p>“The game market is tough now,” said Arc System Works chief creative officer Daisuke Ishiwatari during today’s Arc System Works Showcase announcing the project. “To overcome that Arc System Works has launched a new project. It’s an action game project… Let me explain. Arc System Works is a fighting game company. I’m sure most of you recognize us as so. However, to achieve a new brand, where we are known for quality mid-range <a title="Genres > Action [2,837 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action games</a>, we decided to establish a new pillar outside of fighting games.</p><p>“You might be wondering why I specifically use the term mid-range. There are many reasons, but one is that even creators themselves can enjoy striving for their dreams. In recent years, with AAA blockbusters and excellent indie titles gaining popularity, it has become extremely risky for companies to create new series. This has led to dwindling opportunities for young creators to have their own projects. We feel the need to focus our efforts towards the future a decade from now, such as to build stable development schemes and to accumulate technology and know-how.</p><p>“Our flagship title <em>Guilty Gear</em> has now become a million selling copy work—but its very first installment was a small-scale project. From there, over many long years, we built a foundation that could guarantee a certain level of quality in the fighting games genre. Similarly we hope to take a step with this project that will eventually lead to bigger dreams. And precisely because they are mid-range titles, this will create many opportunities to produce many titles and cultivate many creators, and we hope that will become one of the future values of Arc System Works.”</p><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p><h2><span>Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="DAMON and BABY | Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sBEFzd4zr-M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/06/arc-system-works-announces-action-game-damon-and-baby]]></content:encoded>
