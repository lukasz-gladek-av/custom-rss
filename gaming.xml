			<p>To celebrate the 15th anniversary of the Metro series, developer 4A Games announced that <a href="https://wccftech.com/metro-2033-legacy-an-upcoming-expansion-mod-shown-in-first-trailer/">Metro 2033 Redux</a> will be&nbsp;free for the next 48 hours on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/286690/Metro_2033_Redux/">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/metro_2033_redux">GOG</a>, and Xbox.</p>
<p>A short clip of gameplay from Metro 2033 Redux announces the giveaway with a post on the series' official X account. The post showcases the definitive version of the first installment of the series, which launched back in 2010. Redux, the version that is free for players to grab, was released four years later, in 2014.</p>
<p>It's unclear why PlayStation players are left out of the loop or if they'll be included in a future giveaway. For now, though, you're better off running to one or all of the aforementioned digital storefronts to add a free copy of Metro 2033 Redux to your library.</p>
<p>The Metro series celebrated its actual 15-year anniversary on March 16, 2025, and at the time announced that there would be "<em>events, deals, and celebratory content</em>" posted throughout the year. In addition to getting Metro 2033 Redux for free, you can also get the rest of the series on sale on Steam and GOG. Though&nbsp;Metro 2033 Redux isn't available for free on PlayStation, it is heavily discounted, along with the other games in the series.</p>
<p><iframe title="15 Years Of Metro  -  Celebration" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RbADeT1-HLw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Metro 2033 Redux will take you back to the series' origins, but so will the most recent game in the Metro series, last year's prequel VR title <a href="https://wccftech.com/metro-awakening-vr-announced-for-psvr2-launches-november-7/">Metro: Awakening</a>. But no new mainline entry has pushed the story forward in years.</p>
<p>Regarding what's next for the franchise, formally 4A Games Ukraine, now Reburn studio has already <a href="https://wccftech.com/4a-games-confirm-theyre-making-the-next-metro-with-dmitry-glukhovsky/">confirmed</a> that they are working on a new Metro game with the series creator Dmitry Glukhovsky. Still, there's been no news on this new title in some months. It'll be a while longer before we get any new word on how the title is progressing.</p>
<p>In the meantime, grab Metro 2033 Redux for free while you can, especially if you missed it being free on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/everything-and-metro-2033-redux-now-free-on-the-epic-games-store/">Epic Game Store</a> a few years ago.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</a>'s remake is near upon us, going by the Loud Noises online. Somebody's finally managed to get a response out of Bethesda regarding the much-tipped Oblivion comeback, and it is that special flavour of non-committal that attracts the true believers like wasps to a capsized icecream van. "We have no official information on an Oblivion remake," observed the company's Support staff in a <a href="https://x.com/BethesdaSupport/status/1909296361503174761?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1909296361503174761%7Ctwgr%5E874b2fca725c12b2e6308c72ab0ce2fe03d343f8%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thegamer.com%2Foblivion-remake-elder-scrolls-bethesda-support-denies-rumours-no-information%2F">response</a> to some nosy parker last week. "Apologies for any confusion."</p><!--more-->
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/oblivion-remake-elder-scrolls-bethesda-support-denies-rumours-no-information/">The Gamer</a> for spotting the above. I've been avoiding a lot of the rumours because frankly, many of them read like people converting to <a href="https://deadspace.fandom.com/wiki/Unitology">Unitology</a> after stumbling on an extra-twisty Nik Nak. But there are now enough of them that I can mash them all together like I'm turning junk bonds into triple-A securities, and pass the results off as reporting. Seriously, though, there's quite a lot of smoke in the air. It feels increasingly like there's an announcement in the offing. Here's a quick round-up of the most substantial and/or recent pieces of gossip.</p>
<p>- Back in 2023, Microsoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dishonored-3-plus-fallout-3-and-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remasters-appear-on-leaked-microsoft-doc">accidentally shared</a> a 2020 planning document with details of several possible projects, including a new version of Oblivion.</p>
<p>- This January, MP1st <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/the-elder-scrolls-oblivion-remake-real-gameplay-improvement-details">dug up a former Virtuos employee's CV</a> which makes mention of an Unreal Engine 5 Oblivion remake, detailing improvements to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>'s stealth, stamina and blocking.</p>
<p>- But a few days ago, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Game Of The Year Steam page <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/900883/history/">was updated</a> to remove some older trailers. Routine housekeeping?</p>
<p>- Jeff Grubb, a dependable disseminator of insider gossip, has claimed on Giant Bomb's 7th April <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ifsfg5XFuRI">The Power Block</a> video that the reveal is definitely coming this month.</p>
<p>- <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1900277200592548120">NateTheHate</a> claims the remake will be revealed <em>and</em> released this month, in comments green-ticked by <a href="https://x.com/Andy_VGC/status/1900289910801916177">Andy Robinson</a> of Vero Gusto Computing. Andy Robinson once beat me at Mortal Kombat in front of Netherrealm and I despise him to this day, but I have never known him to tell a fib about a video game.</p>
<p>If you're ambivalent about Oblivion, or disinclined to engage with anything Microsoft-backed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bds-calls-for-boycott-of-microsoft-and-xbox-gaming-products-over-alleged-israeli-military-connections">in light of recent reporting</a>, you might prefer to check out certain community initiatives that take inspiration from Oblivion, like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-gets-a-whole-gamejam-dedicated-to-persuasion-pie-co-hosted-by-a-dont-nod-developer">this persuasion-themed game jam</a>. There's also <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1jyh4fx/oblivion_remake_official_footage/?utm_name=web3xcss">this fun demake</a> co-starring Bethesda's indefatigable Adoring Fan.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

He describes frustration with his own lack of upward momentum, as he was passed over for the role of <em>Dragon Age</em>’s creative director in favor of Mike Laidlaw. He says he was eventually won over by Laidlaw’s leadership and that the fantasy series benefited from it, but after he left the series to work on something else, things started to change.</p><p>Gaider asked to move on to something else within BioWare after <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>’s launch in 2014, and it was between either <em>Mass Effect: Andromeda</em> or “Dylan,” the game that would become <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/how-biowares-anthem-went-wrong-1833731964&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/how-biowares-anthem-went-wrong-1833731964"><em>Anthem</em></a></span>, the studio’s ill-fated loot shooter. Opting to work on the latter, he says the experience illuminated tensions between the different BioWare teams and that he felt the <em>Anthem </em>team didn’t want him there.</p><p>“You see, the thing you need to know about BioWare is that for a long time it was basically two teams under one roof: the <em>Dragon Age</em> team and the <em>Mass Effect</em> team,” Gaider wrote. “Run differently, very different cultures, may as well have been two separate studios. And they didn’t get along. The company was aware of the friction and attempts to fix it had been ongoing for years, mainly by shuffling staff between the teams more often.

At all.”</p><p>Gaider says that some of his conflict with the<em> Anthem</em> team came from higher-up instructions to write something more “science fantasy,” similar to <em>Star Wars</em>, whereas the original concept had been more of a “beer &amp; cigarettes” sci-fi world similar to <em>Aliens</em>. According to Gaider, he was frequently given feedback that his ideas were “too <em>Dragon Age</em>.”</p><p>“I won’t go into detail about the problems except to say it became clear this was a team that didn’t want to make an RPG,” Gaider wrote. “Were very anti-RPG, in fact. Yet they wanted me to wave my magic writing wand and create a BioWare quality story without giving me any of the tools I’d need to actually do that.”</p><p>After it became clear that that the project wasn’t a good fit for him, Gaider told BioWare’s bosses that he’d stick with it if there was some kind of promotion on the other side, and when he was turned down, he quit and went on to co-found Summerfall Studios. The studio’s first game, <em>Stray Gods</em>, is a musical game following a modern version of the Greek god pantheon.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/the-minecraft-movie-has-added-a-disclaimer-warning-viewers-not-to-throw-popcorn/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Minecraft Movie is proving to be a cultural phenomenon. It’s Chicken Jockeying for position in 2025’s list of box office hits, but the fandom is going overboard to the point theaters are issuing a warning disclaimer to Minecraft Movie patrons.</p>



<p>A Minecraft Movie was always going to be a success. Mojang’s Minecraft is far too big and has resonated with hundreds of millions of players for years. So it doesn’t shock me (or anyone) that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/a-mine-craft-movie-biggest-ever-video-game-movie/">A Minecraft Movie is the biggest opening day ever for a Video Game Movie</a>.</p>



<p>It made over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/minecraft-movie-301-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$300 million in its opening weekend</a>, and people are flocking to see the movie every day. Its success has already put the wheels in motion for a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/minecraft-movie-sequel-already-being-discussed-says-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sequel</a>. It’s fair to say the filmmakers—and theaters—will be looking for viewers to control themselves more with a follow-up. For some reason, people are throwing popcorn around rather than eating it.</p>

<p>Movie popcorn isn’t exactly cheap, so it baffles me why people are yeeting it around like there’s no tomorrow. However, this is exactly what’s happening in theaters around the world right now.</p>



<p>The “Chicken Jockey” viral Trend sees attendees start hollering and throwing popcorn everywhere when a certain action in the movie happens. Some of the social media scenes are a real “must be seen to be believed” type of deal. But it probably needs to stop, which is why more recent showings now come with a disclaimer.</p>



<p>X user <a href="https://x.com/ScaredGirlTweet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@ScaredGirlTweet</a> shared a video of the new disclaimer. It says: “<strong>Welcome to the Block Party. Please remember, be kind, be respectful, and most of all, remember that popcorn buckets are not to be used as Ender Pearls.</strong>“</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>For those who don’t get the reference, Ender Pearls are items that can be thrown in Minecraft—the more you know!</p>

            <p>More people have managed to take <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> out for a test drive, and new discoveries are now popping up online.</p>
<p>This includes what appears to be a pilotable hovercraft-like attachment for Mario and co's more standard karts, akin to that big-rig which was commandeered by Birdo in the initial reveal trailer.</p>

<p>According to a video shared by YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GettingMadz">GettingMadz</a>, when you are going about the waters in this craft - which reminded me like some kind of Thunderbird 2 and 3 hybrid - you will be able to take out quite a few other players. This doesn't surprise me, given the size of the thing compared to Bowser in his pre-selected kart.</p>
<p>A voice in the background, seemingly a Nintendo representative, said there will be similar vehicles to this hovercraft-type machine found in the city areas as well. I am assuming that will be the likes of the aforementioned big-rig we saw Birdo drive into and boost off in.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, another user quoting a social media post of GettingMadz' Mario Kart World footage has shared an image of what appears to be a large helicopter, suggesting that this too will be pilotable on the game's release.</p>
<p>"This just confirmed my theory of there being a lot of other vehicles like this in the game where you enter these huge question block warp zones to control them," <a href="https://x.com/nin10doland/status/1910855366012715204">the user wrote</a>, adding Nintendo seems to still be keeping a lot about its upcoming Mario Kart game quiet.</p>
<p>Perhaps we will learn more about these massive yet mysterious vehicles on 17th April, when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-announced-as-switch-2-launch-title-complete-with-24-player-races-new-modes-and-more">Nintendo is hosting a dedicated Mario Kart World Direct</a>.</p>

<p>Our Tom has already taken the upcoming game for a whirl, calling Mario Kart World "undoubtedly <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>'s killer app" and one he can't wait to play more of.</p>
<p>"Mario Kart World's reinvention of the series may be a gamble, but it's absolutely one I think will pay off. With a web of possible routes and hours of time likely to be spent exploring every corner of its highways, deserts and mountains - or racing to stay ahead of the competition in Knockout Tour - it's just as well the game's a Switch 2 launch title," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-reinvents-the-series-and-feels-like-switch-2s-killer-app-after-an-hour-of-hands-on-play">Eurogamer's Mario Kart World preview</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
GameCube exclusive <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/eternal-darkness">Eternal Darkness</a> remains a cult classic among video game horror fans for its patented 'sanity system' - a series of paranoia-inducing effects meant to confuse the player and reflect your in-game character's spiralling psyche.
</p>
<p>
While something of a gimmick, Eternal Darkness remains notorious today for the system - which included the game pulling stunts like pretending to crash or turn your TV off, or faking the deletion of your save file. 
</p>
<p>
Whether a marketing tactic or not, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/nintendo-of-america">Nintendo of America</a> filed <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US6935954B2/en">a very real patent for the sanity system back in 2000</a>, which finally expired in 2021. And every so often since then - particularly with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shadow-of-mordors-brilliant-nemesis-system-is-locked-away-by-a-warner-bros-patent-until-2036-despite-studio-shutdown">recent discussion around Warner Bros holding the patent for Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor's Nemesis system until 2036</a> - the matter has resurfaced.

"It looks like the infamous patent on the sanity system from Eternal Darkness is now in the public domain," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/rato9h/looks_like_nintendos_patent_on_a_sanity_system/">wrote reddit user DocMemory</a>, shortly after the patent's time period ran out. "Let me just mention that I am not a lawyer and this should not constitute legal advice."
</p>
<p>
But what if you did ask a lawyer, and did get legal advice? Could anyone now copy Eternal Darkness' sanity system and use those same sanity effects for themselves? I was intrigued. 
</p>
<p>
"You SHOULD be able to use whatever elements of an expired patent are necessary to its use (as described in the patent)," video game legal expert and creator of the <a href="https://vl.hoeglaw.com/">Virtual Legality podcast</a> Richard Hoeg told me.
</p>
<p>
"But NOT anything that is not 'necessary' (graphics, perhaps some specific implementations - eg, sanity effects - as that's artistic expression rightly protected by copyright)."
</p>
<p>
In other words, while you might be able to implement a similar version of Eternal Darkness' sanity system, directly copying elements from Eternal Darkness could prove more complicated. 
</p>
<p>
Nintendo of America's original patent describes a game system that incorporates a character's sanity level "that is affected by occurrences in the game such as encountering a game creature or gruesome situation". In short, the more bad stuff you see, the worse things get.
</p>
<p>
But there are nuances - your character can rest or progress through an area more slowly to mitigate the sanity system's effects. 
</p>
<p>
"As the character's sanity level decreases, game play is effected such as by controlling game effects, audio effects, creating hallucinations and the like," the patent continues. "In this context, the same game can be played differently each time it is played."
</p>
<p>
The patent goes on to detail a list of possible hallucinations that players may experience as a result of the sanity system, including:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Wall carvings coming to life and reaching out for the character</li>
<li>Something in wall or under floor moving by the character (Frighteners type of thing)</li>
<li>Statue watching the character (Head tracking)</li>
<li>Suit of armour moving (Relaxed to on guard stance)</li>
<li>Static statue or object that appears to follow the character when they're not looking</li>
<li>False doors that appear and disappear when the attempt to open is made</li>
<li>Glowing eyes blinking in the darkness, yet when the area is illuminated they disappear</li>
<li>Painting that shifts and changes along with its meaning</li>
<li>Points of interest markers that the character's head will watch</li>
</ul>

<p>
As well as a list of more physical effects that impact gameplay:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Hallucination: lights go out, and a creature appears as lights come on, then the lights go back off, then the light comes back on and the creature is gone</li>
<li>Stretching walls and corridors so they require more time to traverse</li>
<li>Bleeding walls</li>
<li>Enormous roar that emits from a tiny rodent (Mouse or rat)</li>
<li>Dripping water from above, but when the character takes a second look it is now blood</li>
<li>Shadows that appear to shift and change</li>
<li>Character's torch mysteriously blows out, loud noise then it is once again lit</li>
<li>Faint maniacal laughter (That gets louder and louder as the character draws deeper into insanity)</li>
<li>Ambient audio, such as a water drip could become louder as insanity increases, so a really insane character will occasionally have this irritating dripping sound to distract him</li>
<li>Lagging shadow (the character's shadow appears to follow the character)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Eternal Darkness sadly never got a sequel, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eternal-darkness-spiritual-successor-announced">attempts at crowdfunding a spiritual successor were made by some of the game's development team</a>. Perhaps we should all just look forward to experiencing Eternal Darkness' sanity effects as they were originally programmed, if and when the game gets a fresh release via the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/classic-gamecube-games-coming-to-switch-2-via-switch-online-along-with-purchasable-gamecube-inspired-controller">Switch 2's Nintendo Switch Online GameCube catalogue</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/carlo-acutis-gamer-saint<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Over the summer, the story of Carlo Acutis made headlines at <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/pope-recognises-second-miracle-by-gods-influencer-as-the-catholic-church-prepares-to-canonise-its-first-gamer-saint/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gaming</a> <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-catholic-church-is-about-to-canonize-its-first-gamer-saint" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sites</a>: Acutis, who died of leukemia at age 15 in 2006, is set to be canonized by the Catholic Church at the <a href="https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/260581/carlo-acutis-and-pier-giorgio-frassati-to-be-canonized-in-2025-pope-francis-announces-dates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">end of April</a>, making him the first millennial to become a saint. While the word “saint” probably conjures up martyrs and monastics from centuries past, Acutis was by all accounts a regular 2000s-era kid. He was a devout Catholic who attended daily Mass, but he also played soccer, hung out with friends, and played video games. He’s said to have owned a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/25/europe/carlo-acutis-mother-sainthood-pope-francis-intl/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation</a> and enjoyed Halo, Pokemon, and Mario games, though he <a href="https://aleteia.org/2022/10/12/why-bl-carlo-acutis-limited-his-video-game-time" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">limited his gaming time</a> to an hour a week.&nbsp;</p><p>Acutis has a global following, like many figures who’ve gone through the long, rigorous process of sainthood. His <a href="https://religionnews.com/2025/03/31/crowds-flock-to-newest-catholic-saint-in-assisi-a-millennial-teen-whose-ordinariness-is-the-draw/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tomb</a> sees plenty of visitors in person and via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDkelBOase0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">livestream</a>. A church in England has a <a href="https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/258249/stained-glass-window-dedicated-to-blessed-carlo-acutis-creating-stir-in-english-parish" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stained-glass window</a> of his likeness, complete with cell phone. There was an attempt to make a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-aFFqIQ02U" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">video game</a> about his life in 2023, though its <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/acutisgame/acutis-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kickstarter</a> was cancelled and there’s been no word of it since. The Church recently <a href="https://apnews.com/article/carlo-acutis-millennial-saint-relics-sale-italy-catholic-f5a65136f90673ed038cc2e61dd76368" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spoke out against the online market for his relics</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>But for all this popularity, there’s also a certain “<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/how-do-you-do-fellow-kids" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how do you do, fellow kids</a>” energy to the way he’s been labelled “<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpvzpxgzpnlo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">God’s influencer</a>” and “<a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/07/01/nx-s1-5024766/carlo-acutis-first-millennial-saint-pope-canonization" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the patron saint of the internet</a>.” The attention his gaming habits have received reinforces the idea that there’s something <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-discord-is-the-church-a-place-for-gamers-to-worshi-1836507187" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">irreligious</a> about video games, and the strict limits he set on himself further drives that home. And, for all his purported relatability, what we know about his internet usage isn’t the “like and subscribe” YouTube videos or secret fan fiction sites you might expect of kids today: Instead, he made a website for his local church and one cataloging <a href="https://www.miracolieucaristici.org/en/Liste/list.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eucharistic miracles</a>. He died before Facebook became ubiquitous, and shortly after the <a href="https://x.com/jack/status/20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first tweet</a> hit the internet. What example can the internet’s unofficial “patron saint” really set, especially for young people, if he was so strict with his gaming time and didn’t live long enough to regret going on TikTok?&nbsp;</p><p>To talk about all this, I reached out to Shane Liesegang, SJ, who <a href="https://www.jesuits.org/stories/from-video-game-designer-to-jesuit-with-shane-liesegang-sj/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">worked on games</a> like <em>Fallout 4</em> and <em>Skyrim </em>before joining the Jesuits. While he still works on <a href="https://shaneliesegang.com/projects/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">personal projects</a> and <a href="https://religionnews.com/2023/11/21/how-game-designer-turned-jesuit-ended-up-writing-about-space-religion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bigger games</a> from time to time, these days he’s a <a href="https://beajesuit.org/jesuit-formation/studies/#:~:text=After%20professing%20First%20Vows%2C%20a,further%20deepens%20his%20Jesuit%20identity." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scholastic</a> living in the Philippines studying migrant theology; over email, Liesegang tells me “Basically migrants and refugees are kind of my ‘vocation within a vocation.’”&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><h2><strong>The road to sainthood</strong></h2><p>The first thing Liesegang points out to me is that the word “saint” is a lot more complicated than many people understand it to be: “The Church’s definition of a saint is, simply, someone who is in heaven,” he says. “This is distinct from the <em>title</em> of ‘Saint,’ which indicates a person has been authoritatively declared to be a saint by the Church in the process of canonization. That is, they have been added to the list of saints considered to be authentic and trustworthy… Thus we get the repeated phrase that only God makes someone a saint; the Church merely recognizes it. So there are, of course, substantial numbers of saints that are not canonized, and who are in fact entirely unknown outside their most immediate context.”</p><p>The process by which someone officially becomes a saint has changed over the centuries, but these days involves rigorous investigation into their life (Liesegang tells me, “Imagine the deepest, most thorough background check possible and then also imagine how far it can go when there is no rush.”). This process also includes what might be the biggest stumbling block to modern people: verifying a saint’s miracles.</p><p>Liesegang says a saint’s miracles are “basically considered as ‘proofs’ that the person made it into heaven and now has some sway.” Acutis’ first miracle occurred in 2013, when a <a href="https://angelusnews.com/faith/the-miracle-attributed-to-carlo-acutis-prayers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brazilian woman</a> claimed her son, who’d suffered from a lifetime of digestive issues due to a pancreatic disorder, was able to eat normally after praying to Acutis for healing. His second miracle involved a <a href="https://www.vaticannews.va/en/pope/news/2024-05/pope-francis-saints-decrees-miracle-acutis-allamano.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">woman</a> who suffered head trauma after falling off her bike in 2022; the woman’s mother prayed for healing at Acutis’ tomb, after which it’s said her daughter’s condition promptly began to improve.</p><p>While Liesegang points out that the Pope “can basically give you credit for a life of virtue and let that count” as a number of the required miracles, inexplicable healings and their like “do seem to fly in the face of our rigorously scientific and materialist worldview. So here I will say: you might be surprised at the stringency of the standard the Church applies when it determines miracles to be genuine. Medical miracles require a team of neutral doctors to vote [multiple times].… The investigation process on these things is <em>staggeringly</em> thorough — if they found anything that made them question [Acutis' cause as a whole, it], would have been stopped.”&nbsp;</p><p>The line between a miracle and something medicine can’t yet explain might be a thin one, up to interpretation. Father Angelo Romano, the general relator of the Dicastery for the Causes of Saints, told <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2024/dec/03/miracle-vatican-dicastery-secret-saint-carlo-acutis-pope" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Guardian</a> in its fantastic deep-dive into the sainthood process, “The way miracles are seen has obviously changed as the world has changed… The question is: what is today the state of the art of medicine? We have to judge from the present moment of knowledge… We cannot judge based on what you might discover tomorrow.”&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Teen known as 'God’s influencer' set to become Catholic Church’s first millennial saint" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1aQC3Q-PToA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Beyond miracles, the cause of sainthood also requires some earthly sway; since its inception it’s been a grassroots movement on the part of a saint-to-be’s devotees. While I’ll be honest that, as a non-Catholic, I found it a little hard to believe some relatively unremarkable kid could earnestly gain this kind of widespread attention, Liesegang says that “without a genuine popular movement, [Acutis’ cause] wouldn’t have gone anywhere, so I will give credit that there are a number of people genuinely devoted to him.”&nbsp;</p><p>But how effective that devotion can be in the cause of sainthood has always been complicated by class, geography, and race. The Guardian notes that the documentation of scans and tests required for medical miracles can put causes without financial or technological access at a disadvantage. The Guardian also points out that the causes of several would-be saints of color have moved far slower than Acutis’. Courtney Mares, author of a book about Acutis and a correspondent for the Catholic News Agency, told <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/carlo-acutis-millennial-patron-saint-internet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wired</a>, “It is remarkable that Carlo Acutis will be canonized so close to the date that he was born. For context, of the 912 saints canonized by Pope Francis, the next most recent birth date was in 1926.”&nbsp;</p><p>Acutis was born in London and grew up in Milan. He came from what the AP calls a “<a href="https://apnews.com/article/carlo-acutis-saint-millennial-catholic-church-assisi-ec1b2805f12f1795833c02c1c266d9f8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wealthy family</a>;” his <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Carlo-Acutis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">father</a> worked in banking and finance, and his mother worked in <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/religion/article/how-i-raised-a-saint-by-the-mother-of-teenager-carlo-acutis-0bfgxcklp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">publishing</a>. While Acutis obviously didn’t just buy his way into sainthood given the rigors of the process, an access to resources and his geographic location surely didn’t hurt.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Since the<a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/canonization" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> formalization</a> of the sainthood process, Liesegang says that “class has definitely played more of a part. (Race, sadly, has always played a part.) A degree of cynicism is warranted, but there is the less nefarious reality at work, too, that the investigation process can be time-consuming and costly, and it’s certainly easier to do that work if someone pushing the cause is willing to pay.”</p><p>“There’s always been a need for people to work, push, and hustle to get someone canonized,” Liesegang continues. “Money is the same cheat code here that it is in most parts of society. (Starting in the late medieval period, you see a lot of saints whose biographies basically read ‘came from a wealthy family, entered a convent, and died.’ I’m not questioning the lives of any of those people, but it’s not too hard to see why they got the recognition.) Folks from more modest backgrounds still get in, of course, but it usually requires either overwhelming acclaim, more time, or both.”</p><p>Ultimately, Liesegang says, “Acutis has a leg up, but only in getting the ball rolling. All the money in the world can’t make people love you (just ask Elon Musk).”</p><h2><strong>Does God hate games?</strong></h2><p>Part of Acutis’ appeal comes from how current he is–or, at least “current” by the Church’s slow-moving standards. As Father Carlos Acácio Gonçalves Ferreira, rector of Acutis’ shrine in Assisi, told Wired, “It’s a beautiful thing that for the first time in history you can see a saint dressed in jeans, sneakers, and a sweatshirt.”&nbsp;</p><p>His gaming habits are part of that modern appeal. On the one hand, the games he played are so standard as to seem almost counter-intuitive to the idea that he’s remarkable; on the other, that he set such rigorous limits on himself is pretty rare for a teen, or for anyone who plays games. A book about his life <a href="https://aleteia.org/2022/10/12/why-bl-carlo-acutis-limited-his-video-game-time" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claims</a> he was concerned by how riled up his friends got while gaming; his <a href="https://abc7chicago.com/post/video-gaming-teen-become-catholic-millennial-saint-pope/15019268/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mother</a> says he limited his gaming time out of fear of addiction and the “dangers of the internet.”&nbsp;</p><p>While a saint who played video games might give a young Catholic kid ammo to argue for a console or some V-bucks, it could just as easily be used by a parent to keep their kid away from games–if a <em>saint</em> knew he barely stood a chance against them, what hope does your average kid have? Acutis’ relationship to games also made me wonder what role they could have played in his sainthood beyond the novelty of “Catholic saint” and “video games” in the same headline. Is he a saint <em>despite</em> games or because he overcame them in some way, or could they have added something to his spiritual life?&nbsp;</p><p>Liesegang, as a game designer, acknowledged his own bias here before saying, “I don’t know that there’s anything particularly remarkable about him being a gamer per se, other than it being a reminder that God can be and is present everywhere. The Jesuit principle ‘<a href="https://www.jesuits.global/spirituality/finding-god-in-all-things/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">finding God in all things</a>’ means that anything which does not directly injure your relationship with God is in fact something that can support and nurture it. So we find God in music, in literature, in theater, in films, in science, in exploration, and, yes, in video games.”</p><p>Liesegang praises games for their ability to “get the player to feel like a part of something bigger, to think about moral choices both individual and systemic, to feel a range of emotions, to connect with others. All of these things are potentially part of a vision of humanity that I think is in line with God’s.”&nbsp;</p><p>“But we also see that [games] have the potential to make people <em>less</em> developed in their humanity: isolated, cruel, cold. That’s apparently what Acutis saw in some of his friends and why he chose to moderate his gaming. I wish more people had that level of discernment, to say ‘oh, I don’t like how this is affecting me, even if it is flooding me with dopamine.’”&nbsp;</p><p>Liesegang tells me a story from his days as a game designer: “I remember sitting in a meeting once when I still worked in games where a tech artist was showing off a new system he had developed for having bodies explode in the game. I’m enough of a programmer to appreciate what he had done at the craft level, but I just felt very uneasy. I’m not a prude, but it started to make me think, i<em>s this what I want my name on?</em> A long road from there to being a Jesuit, but those little tugs at your soul do mean something.”&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time, Liesegang notes, “Go into any Catholic church and you will find a prominent central display of the body of an executed man, sometimes still alive and writhing in agony.”&nbsp;</p><p>I’d ultimately agree with Liesegang’s feeling that if God can be found everywhere, that includes in video games. It’s an understanding rooted in Jesuit theology; while we don’t know if Acutis shared it, he did attend a Jesuit school in Milan. (For what it’s worth, I worked briefly with the Jesuits as a prison chaplain during my time in divinity school.) But whatever Acutis’ specific beliefs, Liesegang’s view shines new light on the attention paid to his gaming habits. Rather than being a headline-making incongruity or a cudgel parents might use to keep their kids away from games, they could be seen as a holistic part of his faith, just as much as his religious devotion or Catholicism-focused websites.</p><p>“God is glorified by more than just attending Mass and praying rosaries,” Liesegang says. “God is glorified when I work for social justice, when I learn about other cultures, when I solve a new programming problem, when I tend our community garden, when I wash dishes with my brother Jesuits. Whatever makes you more human also makes you closer to God.”</p><h2><strong>Household saints</strong></h2><p>Beyond being careful with your gaming time, what is the positive example Acutis as a saint might uniquely be able to offer? What can a 15-year-old, even one who might now have special sway in heaven, really teach people about how to live alongside the horrors of the modern internet, or within the culture wars that exploded in gaming after his death? He at least <em>lived</em> in our context, unlike other saints, but in our current era of streamers and Instagram, does he really deserve the moniker of “God’s influencer?”</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Beatification of Carlo Acutis: The first millennial to be declared Blessed | EWTN News Nightly" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HFmj9Fw6Acw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Liesegang agrees with me that there’s something a bit forced in the whole “God’s influencer” line, saying, “The Church moves too slowly to ever be hip, so there will always be a bit of [that] ‘hello fellow kids’ energy.” But, he says, “there <em>is</em> also genuine religiosity among youth, so finding ways to tap into that is good.”</p><p>Acutis’ example to youth might be especially valuable these days, as institutions both secular and religious fail them. Youth are<a href="https://www.ncronline.org/news/study-shows-young-adults-leaving-church-start-down-path-age-13" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> leaving the Church</a> while adult converts like <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/11/jd-vance-catholic-pope-clash/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">J.D. Vance</a> and the “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/09/opinion/nyc-catholicism-dimes-square-religion.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dimes Square</a>” scene enter it; there might be something cringe about the “<a href="https://religionnews.com/2025/02/12/hes-a-young-millennial-catholic-priest-of-course-hes-a-social-media-influencer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">influencer</a>” of it all, but it’s an earnest, <a href="https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/46124/carlo-acutis-loved-the-homeless-st-francis-of-assisi-and-souls-in-purgatory" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">charity-focused</a> cringe, instead of a reactionary, Right-leaning one. If Acutis shows young people a positive way to live their values within the Church if they’re seeking that connection, I think that’s ultimately a good thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Liesegang says, “We use ‘saint’ in casual conversation to say that someone is perfect, that their lives are fully exemplary, and that they are somehow otherworldly. There is this connotation that they are somehow specially touched by God from the beginning, given a special grace that the rest of us don’t have… Sometimes, even within the Church, we use ‘saints and sinners’ as a kind of dialectic, implying that these are two separate groups. But every saint was also a sinner. We should never forget that. These are not perfected people rising out of humanity, but heroes from within, who did the work and struggled and failed and kept going.”</p><p>I’ll admit that, despite my education in theology, Acutis’ cause is the first time I’ve been inspired to learn more about how sainthood works, in an effort to understand why <em>him</em> instead of people I’d personally imagine more deserving. (Out of respect for all of your time, I’ve cut how frequently I demanded Liesegang explain why Acutis but not <a href="https://catholicworker.org/dorothy-day/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dorothy Day</a>, whom he reminded me <a href="https://catholicworker.org/acclaiming-saint-dorothy-an-argument-against-her-canonization/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">didn’t want to be called a saint</a>.) And talking to someone on the “inside” of the Church showed me that, even if there <em>is</em> something a bit eye-rolling about a lot of this, Acutis can also remind people of the sanctity of the everyday, where a religious life can live alongside a conscious approach to secular hobbies like video games.&nbsp;</p><p>And while the “saints” and “miracles” of it all might still feel alienating, Liesegang offered his personal interpretation of all that, saying he doesn’t see miracles as “God waving a magic wand to give us something we want. For me, it goes back to the core revelation of Christianity, that God <em>is</em> love. Not a metaphor, not a simile, not poetic language, but literally that the least wrong way to think of the Mystery That Underlies Reality is to think of it as love… When we say that humans are made in the image of God, that’s what I think it means — it’s our capacity to love that makes us like God. We don’t have [God’s] same power to remake reality, but in small ways, when we choose to not give in to the basest firings of our neurons driven by our selfish genes, when we allow that deepest part of us to operate as it should, when we love, those are miracles. And that’s an encouraging thought, because it means it’s happening all the time, all around us.”</p><p><em><strong>Clarification, 4/14, 11:50am</strong>--Edited the wording of how the Church investigates miracles to be more clear that doubts specifically related to miracles would not stop the process.</em></p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/xalavier-nelson-interview-strange-scaffold-el-paso-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles"><h3>How Xalavier Nelson Does It</h3></a><p>"The systems you set up give you the life that you live in.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shotgun-cop-man-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Devolver Digital and developer DeadToast Entertainment have announced the release date for shoot-'em-up&nbsp;<em>Shotgun Cop Man</em>, in which you must descend into hell in order to arrest Satan himself.</p>

<p>Announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shotgun-cop-man-my-friend-pedro-creator" rel="nofollow">in February</a>,&nbsp;<em>Shotgun Cop Man&nbsp;</em>is the next game from DeadToast, whose name you might recognize from the similarly irreverent shooter&nbsp;<em>My Friend Pedro&nbsp;</em>(although this one doesn't feature any talking bananas, to the best of my knowledge).</p>

<p>It's launching on May 1st, also known as May Day in Europe, which feels particularly appropriate given the frantic nature of your mission. The game will be landing on Switch and PC, and while there's no word of a Switch 2 release, I'm not sure this one would benefit from the new machine's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-specs-revealed" rel="nofollow">beefier specs</a> anyway.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shotgun-cop-man-release-date-shooting.jpg?itok=Wx1t8aGX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shotgun-cop-man-release-date-shooting.jpg?itok=K2JJIdKt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Shotgun Cop Man&nbsp;</em>is coming to a PC or Switch near you in May.</figcaption></figure><p>In&nbsp;<em>Shotgun Cop Man</em>, you play as the titular law enforcement officer, and it's your job to enter hell in order to arrest Satan. As you can probably imagine, he's none too pleased about the intrusion, so you must battle your way through the hordes of the underworld to reach him.</p>

<p>DeadToast says you'll be armed with "a devastating arsenal and a relentless thirst for glory" in the pursuit of said goal; not only will you have access to a range of weapons (including the titular shotgun), but you'll also use them to propel yourself through&nbsp;<em>Shotgun Cop Man</em>'s world.</p>

<p>The game will feature a handcrafted campaign with more than 150 levels to take on, but once you're done with that, you can also try out user-generated levels or perhaps even make your own.</p>

<p>Various challenges are also available if you want to step up your&nbsp;<em>Shotgun Cop Man&nbsp;</em>experience a notch, including No Damage runs, Speedrun parameters, and Kill All stipulations.</p>




<p><em>Shotgun Cop Man&nbsp;</em>is coming to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2966850/Shotgun_Cop_Man/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and Nintendo Switch on May 1st.</p>

			<p>Indiana Jones and The Great Circle on PlayStation 5 Pro features Global Illumination, Ambient Occlusion, and other improvements over other console versions while running at a consistent native 4K resolution.</p>
<p>A new comparison video shared today by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ElAnalistaDeBits" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ElAnalistaDeBits</a> takes a good look at the PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro versions of the game developed by MachineGames, providing additional information on both. On base PlayStation 5, the game runs in its single display mode with dynamic resolution scaling ranging between 1800p and 1620p, with drops to 1440p. On PlayStation 5 Pro, on the other hand, the game is generally displayed at native 4K resolution, as confirmed<a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-runs-native-4k-playstation-5-pro/"> last week</a>. The PS5 Pro version also features improvements to Global Illumination, Ambient Occlusion, and Contact Shadows, although the improvements aren't huge. In addition, both versions of the game are extremely well optimized, as were the Xbox Series X and S versions, maintaining consistent 60 FPS with ray tracing enabled.</p>

<p>It's good news that Indiana Jones and The Great Circle looks and runs well on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro, as it is a game worth experiencing.

<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is an excellent adventure/action game that features one of the best Indiana Jones stories, great level design that rewards exploration, and awesome ray traced visuals. This might just be the best game dedicated to Dr. Henry Walton we've ever seen.</em></p>
<p>Indiana Jones and The Great Circle later this week, on April 17th, on PlayStation 5. The game is also available on PC and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-roadmap-q2-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stalker-2-roadmap-for-q2-2025-promises-a-life-updates-and-more.1163775/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-roadmap-q2-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GSC Game World has released a brand new&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>roadmap that covers the second quarter of the year, and it promises more fixes to the game's A-Life system, plus lots of other new features and tweaks.</p>

<p>A-Life, which is the name GSC Game World gives to the system that governs its NPCs' ambient behavior, has been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-a-life-20-gsc-game-world" rel="nofollow">the subject of some controversy</a> since&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>'s launch, with numerous <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-update-1-1-a-life" rel="nofollow">updates</a> attempting to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-update-12" rel="nofollow">address</a> some of its most critical issues.</p>

<p>That hasn't changed in the new roadmap, which promises "A-Life/AI updates" in Q2. These updates consist of "persistent" improvements to the system, as well as "smarter human combat", mutants eating corpses, and more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stalker-2-roadmap-q2-2025-pointing.jpg?itok=zc-NJulR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stalker-2-roadmap-q2-2025-pointing.jpg?itok=PZ3yqgs2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>is getting some big changes throughout the rest of the quarter.</figcaption></figure><p>It's not all about A-Life, though. The new&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>is also promising the release of a beta modding SDK (software development kit), allowing you to make your own&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>mods. A closed beta will also be held with mod makers to test out the feature.</p>

<p>Also on the list are features like mutant loot, the ability to skip the game's shader compilation, and an increase to the player's stash window, as well as two new weapons. Naturally, this all sits alongside "further stabilization, optimization, and 'anomalies' fixing" (i.e. bugs).</p>

<p>The next-gen update to the&nbsp;<em>Stalker: Legends of the Zone&nbsp;</em>trilogy, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-roadmap-legends-of-zone-next-gen-2025" rel="nofollow">promised for 2025 back in December</a>, is also scheduled for this quarter, although it may well get delayed again.</p>

<p>GSC Game World says this roadmap, which is the first of a new three-monthly cycle, will help&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>to "become the game we imagined - and you deserve".</p>




<p>In case you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>, it's the long-awaited sequel to the cult classic 2007 FPS&nbsp;<em>Stalker: Shadow of Chernobyl&nbsp;</em>(which still maintains the old Russian spelling of the town's name, unlike <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl" rel="nofollow">the sequel</a>).</p>

<p>Like the first game,&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>has you exploring the Chornobyl nuclear exclusion zone (albeit a heavily fictionalized version of same), seeking out anomalies and artifacts while also grappling with disparate factions.</p>

<p><em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1643320/STALKER_2_Heart_of_Chornobyl/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/stalker-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

If you've been playing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-blue-prince">Blue Prince</a> and thinking, ah, this could really benefit from having approximately 16.7 million fewer colours and a couple more homicidal husks in diving suits, may I usher you wincingly towards Repose. It's a moodalicious, monochrome dungeon-crawler in which you get 50 in-game steps to search hideously dishevelled techno-crypts for oxygen cylinders, before you die of exhaustion. More likely, you will die of getting shot by a zombie astronaut. Here's a trailer.

<p>
Like Blue Prince, Repose invites you to make use of a notepad. Unlike Blue Prince, this isn't because you'll be jotting down clues about winsome dartboard puzzles. It's because the game doesn't have a save system. It has save codes, instead. Ah, save codes. Once a routine video game design convenience, now the province of the utter sadist. There are, at least, permanent progression elements such as doors you can unlock from the other side.
</p>
<p>
The grid-based format and 50-step limit might lull you into thinking that Repose is a turn-based game. It isn't. If you see a threat, you've got a second to either flinch away or belt it with your fireaxe. The axe is one of two starting possessions in the demo, which is still live on Steam. The other is a glowstick, which lends a gorgeously chiselled glimmer to your surroundings but also makes you visible from a whole 'nother tile away. Try not to equip it absent-mindedly. There are guns in the screenshots, but I've yet to acquire one.
</p>
<p>
The demo doesn't dig deep into the story, but what's here pongs of corpo-dread and existential <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a>. The first location in the game is called Cafe Void - bet the coffee's good there. Your employer is simply The Company. There's a character who warns you not to sleep in any beds you encounter, which is not helpful in a game where you can only take 50 paces before keeling over. In the undeniably existential confines of my flat, 50 paces is good for... three, maybe four midnight toilet round-trips. My flat doesn't harbour any astronaut husks, mind. Not since the landlord put his foot down about couch surfers.
</p>
<p>
Repose launches today. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3002510/REPOSE/">Read more on Steam</a>. Alternatively, try <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/void-stranger">Void Stranger</a> - it has a similar vibe but is (so far) sexier and weirder and marginally less punitive, providing you accept that 'failing' your first run is desirable.

<p>Another indie games studio is closing its doors. It  has been announced that Makea Games, the studio behind the game Supermoves, is shutting down “effective immediately”.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/toikka_activity-7317524349664509953-Y8MO?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAe8N2cBgr8yAdDlzNawvOXeqb-JdsGiQC4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announcement was made</a> on Monday morning by the studio’s CEO and founder Tomi Toikka.</p>



<p>“After over three incredible years building Supermoves and bringing the vision of the Makeaverse to life through user-generated content, we’ve reached the end of the road for Makea Games,” Toikka said. “Despite our team’s best efforts — and the unwavering support of our community, collaborators, and partners — we are deeply saddened to announce that Makea Games is officially winding down, effective immediately.”</p>



<p>He closed his statement thanking those who believed “in a small team with big dreams” while adding that there is a “fire to build again”.</p>



<p>Makea Games’ first, and only, game called Supermoves: World of Parkour launched in August 2024. According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1959580/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>, the game’s playerbase peaked at just 50 players with a recent 24-hour peak of just two players.</p>



<p>What do you make of Makea Games shutting down less than a year after releasing its first game? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/1896/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-around-the-world-high-game-price-is-a-universal-pain<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">What a year for Nintendo to finally release the Switch 2. While the hardware itself looks to be what anyone could have hoped for in a Switch successor — a more powerful version of the console millions of owners already love — the economic uncertainty gripping the world has made the Switch 2 a much more complicated prospect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that’s before we even consider the trade war the United States is currently engaged with China in. The $450 USD console price point and $80 USD sticker on Mario Kart World has made the Switch 2 something of a flashpoint amid the rising cost of games and gaming hardware, both here in the US and abroad. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">To get a better idea of how the world is reacting to the Switch 2, I spoke with editors from IGN brands across the world to get a sense of the Switch 2’s impending release.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">How the Rest of the World Feels About the Switch 2</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">After consulting with editors from IGN sites abroad, including those based in Europe, South America, and Asia, the reception to the Switch 2 has been, well, mixed. The<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-tech-specs-battery-life-4k-and-up-to-120fps-storage-and-more"> hardware improvements</a> like 120hz refresh rate, HDR, and 4K output are praised, but missing features like not having an OLED screen are seen as serious drawbacks. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“As far as reception goes, IGN Italia’s readers are predominantly dissatisfied with the Nintendo Switch 2,” says IGN Italy editor-in-chief, Alessandro Digioia. “Among hundreds of comments across news articles and social media, the main concerns revolve around the price point, the lack of an OLED screen, the absence of a trophy/achievement system, and a modest launch line-up. While some third-party announcements were welcomed, many readers expected more from Nintendo’s first-party titles.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN Portugal’s Pedro Pestana shared similar sentiments from their readers – sentiments they agreed with: “Personally, I'm not that impressed with Switch 2, as it is basically a souped up Switch 1 - better in every sense, but without the novelty factor of the original. That being said, I reckon it's gonna come down to the games, and Mario Kart World looked damn nice.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Other regions are seemingly more receptive to the Switch 2’s hardware improvements. IGN Benelux’s Nick Nijiland says the site has been getting mostly positive feedback, despite the price of the console. “We have seen in our region that the console has been received very well. People complain about the price, but at the same time the console sold out within hours. We put up a post on our website stating that we would let our readers know through our Discord server when pre-orders went live and our Discord got so many new members that day, it was insane.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN Turkey’s Ersin Kilic also shared positive views from the region’s readers. “When I look at the comments, it is seen as positive that Nintendo corrected the points criticized on [the first] Switch. Although the console is stylish and uses LCD, the fact that the screen is much better was received positively.” However, Kilic says “the most criticized point was that Hall Effect was not used in Joy-Con 2,” which some gamers hoped could minimize the risk of Joy-Con drift. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN China’s Kamui Ye gave both sides of reader reactions to the Switch 2. “The reveal event has been met with widespread disappointment due to its lackluster launch title lineup and perplexing regional pricing strategies,” they explained. Furthermore, Ye says the launch lineup that didn’t include a new Mario, Legend of Zelda, or Animal Crossing was another negative.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“However, optimism persists among core fans regarding Nintendo's long-term plans,” Ye adds. Along with the belief of a better software lineup down the line, any of the horsepower and battery concerns for the Switch 2 “appear secondary to loyalists prioritizing backward compatibility, hardware refinements like magnetic Joy-Cons, and Nintendo's legacy of iterative software support.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Ultimately, the brand's entrenched fanbase seems willing to tolerate short-term missteps, betting on Nintendo's historical ability to refine its platforms through compelling games over time,” Ye says.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Hardware Price and Tariff Fears</h2><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Direct: Nintendo Switch 2 Console Slideshow</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Switch 2 is expected to launch at a $450 USD price point in the United States when it is made available to pre-order some time in the future. The reason <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-delays-switch-2-pre-order-date-in-the-us-to-assess-impact-of-trumps-tariffs">pre-orders have yet to happen in the United States and Canada</a>, despite the rest of the world already registering their purchases with retailers, is of course due to an ongoing tariff situation from President Trump. It’s a state of affairs that’s seemingly making Nintendo reconsider how to roll out the console properly in time for its June 5 release date.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Naturally, IGN editors from Europe aren’t particularly impacted by the tariffs in their regions, where pre-orders are already up and running.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“In Germany, nobody is really worrying about the tariff situation regarding the Switch 2,” says IGN Germany’s Antonia Dressler. However, the actual retail price of the Switch 2 is a separate matter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There are a lot of complaints about the pricing of the console… and [readers are making] direct comparisons with the pricing of the PS5 [which] is seen as the better console,” explains Dressler. Despite the complaints, though, pre-orders do seem to be coming in for the region.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The pricing of the Switch 2 firmly places it in direct competition with consoles like the PS5 and Xbox Series X in many regions, making the choice of which console to get even harder for global buyers. “At the moment, Nintendo's official website is taking pre-orders and the price is R12,499,” says IGN Africa’s Zaid Kriel. “It is not crazy pricing, but it's now in the same bracket as the PS5 and Xbox Series X. It's no longer a cheaper alternative, and that could be a problem, especially with the increase in game prices Nintendo has introduced.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/09/nintendo-switch-2-accessories-1744213576987.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Buying the Nintendo Switch 2 with a number of accessories will not be cheap. </figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/does-the-price-of-the-switch-2-overshadow-its-reveal">pricing problem pretty much overshadowed everything</a> going on around the Switch 2 reveal, good or bad,” IGN France editor-in-chief, Erwan Lafleuriel, says. “The debate is raging mainly about prices, but I believe because it was kind of easy to overshadow a reveal lacking in many other aspects. Part of that is... we already knew most of what was revealed from the leaks. And there is no impressive 'one more thing' to add. Even in terms of games, it's good, but it feels like something is missing.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other regions outside of the United States, however, are contending with the fallout of the tariffs. IGN Brazil’s Matheus de Lucca says, “The current tariff war initiated by the United States makes the scenario even worse for Brazil, since the Real is a weak currency compared to the dollar and an increase in the price of the Switch 2 in the United States will most likely have a huge impact on the whole of Latin America. The scenario of uncertainty and a possible increase in the price of the console could make the Switch 2 accessible to only a very small group of players in the Brazilian market.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is also the unique situation in Japan where Nintendo is launching a region-locked version of the hardware at a lower pricepoint to protect its domestic market “I think Nintendo knew they couldn’t go over 50,000 yen in Japan – the weak yen means the relative pricing scale is very different here,” says IGN Japan’s executive producer, Daniel Robson. “But presumably they also realised that if the console was much cheaper here than anywhere else, people would try to import it or buy all the stock when they visit Japan. Hence the region lock – our cheaper Switch only plays Japanese games and supports only Japanese accounts. I’m sure this is a direct result of the global trade situation.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Robson also says that, “The price is still high, and will be tough for many families here, but it's far more competitively priced than the 77,000 yen PS5. Not to mention that Japan is firmly a Nintendo country – the house of Mario dominates the console Top 10 week in, week out, so I doubt families here will be able to go without a Switch 2. That said, as a parent, I’m secretly relieved that my daughter hasn’t asked for a Switch 2, as the price puts it comfortably over the bounds of a birthday present.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Software Price Remains the Biggest Pain Point</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite the issues of hardware costs and tariffs, the biggest bugbear affecting the general feeling regarding the Switch 2 announcement has been the price of software. Some of that pain is to be expected: Nintendo games have always been expensive and held their price, and it’s only natural that Nintendo would join the trend of increasing game prices. But it seems the company may have jumped the gun by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-exclusive-mario-kart-world-justifies-its-80-price-tag-nintendo-insists-in-first-comments-addressing-cost-controversy">pricing Mario Kart World at $80 USD</a>. While Nintendo says pricing will be determined on a game-by-game basis, with other Switch 2 launch window games priced at $70 USD or as low as $10 USD, the move has prompted fears that the gates are now fully open for even more expensive software.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Game pricing is by far the biggest issue raised, not only by our readers but by the Italian gaming community at large,” says IGN Italy’s Digioia. “Many feel that Nintendo's new pricing structure is unjustifiable, especially in light of recent increases that came with the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S era (when AAA titles moved from €70 to €80). Now, Nintendo is pricing some first-party games at €90, which has caused considerable concern - particularly given the company's historically conservative approach to discounts. The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-tutorial-game-welcome-tour-costs-10-nintendo-explains-why-its-not-a-free-console-pack-in">€9.99 price for Switch 2 Welcome Tour </a>sparked additional backlash, and even the paid upgrade paths for existing Switch games are widely seen as another way to extract money from loyal customers.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“People are pissed,” IGN Germany’s Dressler says plainly. “Especially with the 90 Euro for Mario Kart World, that is a record for a video game in Germany; not even titles like Assassin’s Creed cost as much (talking about the base version). It also seems ridiculous that the tutorial game will cost anything — Nintendo just looks absurdly greedy right now.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/02/nintendo-direct-nintendo-switch-2-4-2-2025-2-1743605101158.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">While Mario Kart World's $80 is the main offender, fans are also annoyed by the $10 charge for Switch 2 Welcome Tour. </figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Take a look in any Switch 2 comment thread on IGN.com and you’ll find similar sentiments; the high price of games is unwelcome, especially in a time of increased living costs. A more unusual perspective can be found in mainland China, however, where there are no current plans for an official release. As a result, Switch 2 shoppers there may have to look to the gray market, with stock coming from Japan and Hong Kong – places where prices for games look to be a bit cheaper.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Regarding pricing, game prices in Hong Kong and Japanese editions are relatively lower compared to Western markets. Observations from social media comments under our content show most players find the official price acceptable,” IGN China’s Ye says. “While the console itself has seen some price hikes, users generally consider it more cost-effective than handheld PCs like Steam Deck, especially with backward compatibility support. Based on our data, Chinese mainland Nintendo Switch 1 players appear largely receptive to the official Nintendo Switch 2 price increase.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Right now it seems sensible to bet that the Switch 2 will be a success – it’s a safe, recognizable upgrade to one of the most popular and beloved consoles of all time. But what kind of a success story Nintendo has on its hands remains to be seen. The threat of an era of $80 games during a time of economic hardship has clearly put a substantial amount of prospective buyers into a negative headspace. Plus there are still many unknowns surrounding the console, especially in the United States where tariffs stand to negatively impact the North American launch. Then there’s the question of how international politics may result in potential stock shortages and impact the system’s launch around the globe. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For all those unknowns, what is clear from chatting with IGN’s global staff is that Nintendo has whipped up excitement around the world. It’s just excitement with a few more caveats than you’d expect from Nintendo. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-stock-update-journey-together-lost-origin-ex-big-boxes<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Grab packs without paying a premium.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I rarely need an excuse to grab more <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-tabletop">Pokémon cards</a>, but every so often, something especially good comes along. Right now, a few premium boxes are <em>actually</em> worth it. Not because they’re stacked with guaranteed hits (they’re not), but because the sets inside are finally seeing a drop in single-card prices.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That opens two solid options: rip the packs and hope for something great, or skip the gamble and grab your chase cards while they’re cheaper. Either way, it’s one of those rare moments where buying in doesn’t feel like lighting your wallet on fire. With decent promos, good pack variety, and a few worthwhile extras, these boxes are the ones to watch.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Pokémon TCG: Iono’s Bellibolt ex Premium Collection</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, it's one of the pricier premium collections out there. And yes, you get a Bellibolt ex promo, which is about as subtle as a battery-powered frog can get. But the real draw here is the 2 x <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-journey-together-preview">Journey Together</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-azure-legends-tins-has-surging-sparks-boosters-in-stock">Surging Sparks</a>, Obsidian Flames, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-scarlet-violet-twilight-masquerade-expansion-preview-hands-on">Twilight Masquerade</a> and Paradox Rift packs. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Single prices from Journey Together are already coming down, which is great if you’ve been waiting to scoop up stuff like Perrin or Pecharunt ex without giving your credit card a stress headache. You also get an acrylic standee display and photo stickers, which is either a cute bonus or something you'll shove in a drawer forever. I’m choosing to see it as décor. Don’t ruin this for me.</p><div catalogid="4ac4de63-9c20-473d-b7e3-7114da2d9a01" id="218624"><div id="218624" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Iono’s Bellibolt ex Premium Collection</h3></p></div><h3 data-cy="title3">Single Card Options</h3><h2 data-cy="title2">Pokémon TCG: Infernape V Box</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">This is probably the easiest yes on the list. It's cheap, it’s on sale, and it includes packs from Fusion Strike and Lost Origin. That’s a decent combo if you like old sets with some high highs and very, very low lows. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re thinking of chasing Gengar VMAX or Giratina V, just know those prices are finally starting to cool off. So you can skip the suspense and buy singles now, or you can open these and pretend you’re immune to regret. Either way, the Infernape and Empoleon promos make nice binder filler, and the oversized card will make a great bookmark for someone who doesn’t read.</p></div><div catalogid="4ac4de63-9c20-473d-b7e3-7114da2d9a01" id="218625"><div id="218625" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Infernape V Box</h3></p></div><h3 data-cy="title3">Single Card Options</h3><h2 data-cy="title2">Pokémon TCG: Ogerpon ex Premium Collection</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">This one’s for anyone who actually plays the game or just likes pretending they might. You get six Twilight Masquerade packs, a Teal Mask Ogerpon ex promo, and sleeves that don’t suck. Twilight Masquerade’s singles are already starting to slide in price, including cards like Carmine, Bloodmoon Ursaluna, and Dragapult ex. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So if there’s a card you’ve been eyeing, now’s the time to grab it without going through a box’s worth of filler. Still, if you do want to roll the dice, this is probably the best pack selection of the bunch. Plus, the magnetic card protector almost tricks me into thinking I own something valuable. Almost.</p></div><div catalogid="4ac4de63-9c20-473d-b7e3-7114da2d9a01" id="218626"><div id="218626" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Ogerpon ex Premium Collection</h3></p></div><h3 data-cy="title3">Single Card Options</h3><h2 data-cy="title2">Pokemon TCG: Stacking Tin (Q1 2025)</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Is it weird that this is the one I’m most tempted by? You get three booster packs from three solid sets: Stellar Crown, Surging Sparks, and Temporal Forces. That gives you a shot at everything from Pikachu ex to Hydreigon ex to Iron Crown ex. Or nothing. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s also on the table. But with single prices dropping in all three of those sets, this is a decent way to gamble without spending too much. You also get two sheets of stickers, which is exactly the kind of freebie that tricks me into thinking I made a responsible decision.</p></div><div catalogid="4ac4de63-9c20-473d-b7e3-7114da2d9a01" id="218627"><div id="218627" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokemon TCG: Stacking Tin (Q1 2025)</h3></p></div><h3 data-cy="title3">Single Card Options</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

                <p dir="ltr">Even after a reveal showcase over the weekend, there was confusion about one crucial aspect regarding <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-everything-we-know-about-bungies-extraction-shooter/1100-6514617/">Marathon</a>: the game's price point. Developer Bungie has clarified that the extraction shooter won't be "a full-priced title." However, the entry cost still hasn't been detailed, with that info apparently arriving in the summer.</p><p dir="ltr">Originally, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungies-marathon-is-a-polished-extraction-shooter-but-that-might-not-be-enough/1100-6530826/">GameSpot's Marathon preview</a> noted that the game would be full priced since Bungie has referred to the shooter as "a premium title." <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1911121437848371405" rel="nofollow ">On X</a>, Wario64 shared those details before <a href="https://x.com/MarathonTheGame/status/1911129962943549877" rel="nofollow ">the official Marathon account</a> stepped in to spell out the current pricing situation for Marathon. Yes, it's described as a premium experience, but it won't carry a premium price tag (think $70). What the entry cost will ultimately be for the game will have to wait for a few months, though.</p><p dir="ltr">Last September, it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungies-marathon-will-be-40-report/1100-6526561/">reported that Marathon would cost $40</a>. There were no plans to transition to a free-to-play model at the time, and apparently the shooter was too far along in development to even make that change. Previously, Sony (which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-acquired-by-sony-for-3-6-billion/1100-6500122/">now owns Bungie</a>) has released similar live-service games at the $40 price point: Helldivers 2 and Concord. Obviously, the results from those couldn't be more different, but there is clear precedent for that entry fee.</p><p dir="ltr">What we do know is that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungies-marathon-releases-in-september-on-same-day-as-another-big-game/1100-6530810/">Marathon will launch September 23</a> on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. If that date sticks out to you, it's probably because <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6529507/">Borderlands 4</a> will arrive on that same day. Before then, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-closed-alpha-begins-in-april-heres-how-to-sign-up/1100-6530808/">Marathon is getting a closed alpha this month</a>. You can join <a href="https://discord.com/invite/marathonthegame" rel="nofollow ">the game's Discord channel</a> for a chance to participate.</p><p dir="ltr">Marathon isn't the only game at the center of a price-point debate this month. Nintendo has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-defends-mario-kart-worlds-80-price-tag/1100-6530643/">defending the decision to launch Mario Kart World for $80</a> on Switch 2 in June.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/blizzard-has-10-year-plan-for-diablo-iv/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/diablo-iv-great-albeit-safe-hack-n-slash-action/">Diablo IV</a> was released in 2023, it was the first new mainline entry in the series in more than a decade, and according to the Diablo series general manager Rod Fergusson, we'll be playing Diablo IV for just as long before we can start to expect Diablo V.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/chain-interview-marc-merrill-rod-fergusson-shuhei-yoshida-more">Game File</a>, Fergusson said that Blizzard is with Diablo IV "<em>for the long haul" and that the studio's plans for the game span</em> the next decade. So, don't expect to hear anything about Diablo V until approximately 2033.</p>
<p>"<em>We're here for the long haul,</em>" Fergusson said. "<em>We've been doing long-range planning recently. And I've created a roadmap - a 10-year roadmap...it was actually a 12-year [roadmap] - I can see this, this, this and this and all these different things that we can do, [which] is really inspiring. And it's really exciting. We're focused on what players want...I can't tell you much more than that."</em></p>
<p>The shortest time between Diablo releases was the four years between the first and second games. After that, it was 12 years before Diablo III came around and another 11 years between Diablo III and Diablo IV. So telling players to expect another 10-year gap between series installments is nothing new, and it would be on the shorter side if Diablo V released precisely 10 years after Diablo IV.</p>
<p>As far as short-term plans go, Blizzard announced the<a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-ivs-2025-roadmap-unveiled-new-expansion-in-2026/"> 2025 roadmap for Diablo IV</a> less than a week ago at the time of writing, confirming that a new major expansion for Diablo IV won't arrive until sometime in 2026 and that in the meantime, the significant updates in 2025 will come in the form of seasonal changes and quality of life updates players are still waiting for, such as being able to use keyboard and mouse controls on a console, which won't arrive until sometime this summer, according to the current schedule.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Kingdom Come 2 Characters Are Not Coming to Fortnite, Despite Recent Claims]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-2-characters-not-coming-to-fortnite/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kingdom-come-2-characters-are-not-coming-to-fortnite-despite-recent-claims.1163733/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-2-characters-not-coming-to-fortnite/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It was recently claimed that a slew of characters from popular franchises were heading to Fortnite, which isn’t by any means a reach for the game. The list featured the likes of Agent 47, Mortal Kombat fighters, Jack Black, and Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 characters.</p>



<p>The latter title was a bit out of left field, as aside from having a successful launch in February, there’s no real reason why Fortnite would accommodate characters from the medieval RPG epic.</p>



<p>I caught up with one of the game’s actors and tuned into the Warhorse team on socials to see this claim debunked.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-henry-of-tilted-towers">Henry of Tilted Towers</h2>



<p>We recently reported <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-characters-list-leaked/">on a claim that aired</a> during an episode of the XboxEra Podcast. During a brief segment, ShpeshalNick claimed that a string of characters is coming to Fortnite, some more bizarre than others. Amongst the list sat ‘Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2’ characters.</p>



<p>I leapt straight over to catch up with Luke Dale, the talent behind Hans Capon in KCDII, and he was none the wiser about the leak. He suggested that KCDII’s publisher might <span>b</span>e <strong>making moves </strong>without anyone knowing, but the team at Warhorse Studios, KCDII’s developer, echoed the sentiment:</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The claim hasn’t been corroborated by any of the ‘typical’ Fortnite leakers and insiders, so for now, I’d advise taking this with a pinch of salt. The folks at Warhorse might be trying to subvert our expectations by playing it down, or they could genuinely have no idea what this claim is taking about.</p>



<p>It’s not unheard of for a popular franchise or release to make it into Fortnite <strong>just because </strong>it’s successful, but out of the entire list provided by ShpeshalNick, Kingdom Come just stands out as being too out of left field.</p>

challenging if you had the right loadout. Protagonist Sam Porter Bridges amassed an impressive arsenal of weapons to use against the BT entities--which weaponized his blood and other bodily fluids to harm them--and near the end of the game, you would gain access to a rocket launcher that could be used to take down kaiju-sized BTs.</p><p>The recent trailers for Death Stranding 2 have suggested that we'll see the scale of these boss fights increase. One of the new BTs glimpsed is essentially a giant gnarled hand that can outrun Sam, and in another scene, Sam's ally Heartman faces off against a truly colossal BT by combining another BT with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-can-preorder-a-model-kit-based-on-death-stranding-2s-magellan-vehicle/1100-6530029/">DHV Magellan submersible</a>, creating something that looks <em>very </em>similar to the Metal Gear Rex mecha. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-introduces-its-own-solid-snake-sort-of/1100-6529990/">Considering that Death Stranding 2 has its own Solid Snake</a>--sort of--it's not exactly surprising to see references to Metal Gear Solid in a Hideo Kojima-directed game.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach launches on June 24</a> for PS5, and it looks like the live-action movie adaptation of this post-apocalyptic series <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-death-stranding-2-fanciest-in-game-timepiece-is-real-but-itll-cost-you-1600/1100-6530011/">may have just found its director</a>.</p>

		<p>After an interminable wait, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones And The Great Circle</a> is finally <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/24/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-comes-to-ps5-on-17th-april/">coming to PS5 this week</a>. Now Sony lovers can rejoice in travelling the globe, exploring beautiful locales, discovering mystical relics, and hitting fascists with a surprisingly varied selection of comedy objects – for my money, an umbrella is the best.</p>
<p>Indiana Jones is, of course, an iconic character. Over the course of three films – yes, there have definitely positively only ever been <em>three </em>films – Indy became the hero of every child of the 1980’s; so much so, that even the character’s shadow became instantly recognisable. Indiana Jones And The Great Circle brilliantly captures all the whip-cracking, snake-fearing, and fedora-wearing excellence of the films, distilling them into an interactive experience that puts the player firmly in the role of the world’s most dashing professor.</p>



<p>I’ve been thoroughly enjoying Indiana Jones And The Great Circle on PS5, and it was whilst clambering the rooftops of Vatican City (before dropping down behind an unsuspecting Blackshirt and knocking him flat out with a handy mandolin) that I got to thinking – has there even been a real-life Indiana Jones? We all get to be Indy digitally now, but has anyone ever done it for real? The adventures, the danger, the thrills and spills?</p>
<p>Fantastically, the answer is yes. But there’s not just one real-life Indy, there are several! Here though, for your eyeball’s enjoyment, are my two absolute favourites.</p>

<p>Born in 1884, in Beloit, Wisconsin, Roy Chapman Andrews was trained by his father to use a shotgun when only nine-years-old. He put that skill to good use, stuffing and selling the animals he shot to pay for college. In adulthood, Andrews became a world-famous explorer, leading dangerous expeditions through China, Tibet, and Mongolia. He lived a life of danger, always on the edge. In one of his many books, he wrote about how he nearly died ten times, “Two were from drowning in a typhoon, one was when our boat was charged by a wounded whale; once my wife and I were nearly eaten by wild dogs, once we were in great danger from fanatical lama priests; two were close calls when I fell over cliffs, once I was nearly caught by a huge python, and twice I might have been killed by bandits.” I don’t know about you, but fanatical lama priests would make a great plot for a fourth Indy film, should they ever make one.</p>
<p>Andrews was a boffin too, just like Indy. He proved that dinosaurs hatched from eggs during an expedition in Mongolia, he discovered that the extinct Gray Whale wasn’t extinct after all, and he wrote a stonking twenty books. Heck, he became so famous that he even featured on the cover of Times Magazine in 1923.</p>
<div id="attachment_458883"><p id="caption-attachment-458883">TIME Magazine Cover Featuring Roy Chapman Andrews (29 Oct 1923)</p></div>
<p>The uncanny similarity to Indy doesn’t end there though, as Andrews wore a fedora and also suffered from ophidiophobia – the fear of snakes. Quite understandable, as in Mongolia Andrew’s tent was invaded at night by a pack of Vipers, forcing him to fight them off with any object he could find – which, as I’ve learned from playing Indiana Jones: The Great Circle, was probably a shovel, a beer bottle, and a wrench.</p>

<p>Then there’s Percy Fawcett, a British Army Officer, who spent two decades exploring the treacherous jungles of South America. Born in 1867, Fawcett was commissioned into the Royal Artillery before finding his way into spying for the British Government. In 1906, to settle a border dispute between Bolivia and Brazil, Fawcett was tasked with mapping an area of unexplored Jungle that separated the two countries. His adventure should have taken him two years to complete, if he even survived, as the jungles were rife with dangerous creatures and even more dangerous and unpleasant human slavers. Yet, despite the challenges, Fawcett wrapped up his expedition in a few months. This proved a turning point for Fawcett, the Amazon became like a drug for him. He returned again and again to the jungle, despite nearly dying on numerous occasions from causes as varied and nasty as starvation, disease, and mutiny. Still, none of that put off Fawcett, as he became dedicated, in a very Indy way, to finding a ‘lost city’. The city of Z.</p>
<p>Where did this idea of a lost city come from? The early conquistadores spoke of towns and villages found dotting the Amazon, yet these had never been uncovered. Fawcett reasoned, why couldn’t there be a large settlement hidden in the Amazon? After all, Hiram Bingham III had recently rediscovered Machu Picchu, a humongous city hidden in the Peruvian Andes for centuries, so why couldn’t there be a mysterious city in the depths of the Amazon too?</p>
<p>Taking a quick break from exploring to fight bravely on the Western Front in the First World War (why not, right? The dude was a spritely 50 years old at the time), Fawcett returned to begin his search of the Amazon. It was in the National Library of Brazil that Fawcett, just like Indy, found a mysterious ancient document, tucked away. Written by a slaver in 1753, the text spoke of a ruined city, an ancient metropolis, rich for the finding. That was all Fawcett needed; he headed out for adventure. His search continued for years, before finally, in 1924, Fawcett and his party disappeared without a trace. No-one knows what happened to Fawcett, did he ever find ‘Z’? Or did he just meet his end at the hands of a naffed off Xavante warrior?</p>
<p>Fascinatingly, Fawcett’s signet ring was found in 1979, but no other traces of the explorer were ever discovered. Still, Fawcett lived his life like Indiana Jones until the very end, yearning for adventure, for the thrill of discovery, to journey deep into the unknown.</p>

<p>So, as you fire up Indiana Jones And The Great Circle on your PS5 this week, as you swing across a pit trap using your trusty whip, as you search dark catacombs with only a candle to light your way, as you solve brain-tickling puzzles in the depths of an ancient temple, spare a thought for Roy Chapman Andrews and Percy Fawcett, who did all that thrilling stuff for real.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-prices-rising-europe-uk-australia-new-zealand<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has announced that it's raising the prices of the PS5 in certain regions, although the price of the accompanying disc drive accessory is actually going down.</p>

<p>In a PlayStation <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/13/ps5-price-to-rise-in-europe-australia-and-new-zealand/?sf276959904=1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a>, Sony says that because of a "challenging economic environment" which involves "high inflation and fluctuating exchange rates", the PlayStation 5's price will be increasing in Europe, the UK, Australia, and New Zealand.</p>

<p>Happily (or perhaps not if this is the model you're thinking of buying), the PS5 Digital Edition is the only model affected in Europe and the UK, although both models are getting a price increase in Australia and New Zealand, unfortunately.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ps5-price-rises-consoles.jpg?itok=Xhcr_JYv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ps5-price-rises-consoles.jpg?itok=hPGVbS8F 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The PS5 is getting a price hike in some areas.</figcaption></figure><p>Although the PS5 itself is getting a price hike, the PS5 Disc Drive's RRP will be decreasing in all four of the previously-mentioned areas. These price changes kick in today.</p>

<h3>Europe</h3>

<ul><li>PS5 Digital Edition:&nbsp;€499.99</li>
	<li>PS5 Standard Edition: no change</li>
	<li>PS5 Disc Drive:&nbsp;€79.99</li>
</ul><h3>UK</h3>

<ul><li>PS5 Digital Edition: £429.99</li>
	<li>PS5 Standard Edition: no change</li>
	<li>PS5 Disc Drive: £69.99</li>
</ul><h3>Australia</h3>

<ul><li>PS5 Digital Edition:&nbsp;AUD $749.95</li>
	<li>PS5 Standard Edition:&nbsp;AUD $829.95</li>
	<li>PS5 Disc Drive:&nbsp;AUD $124.95</li>
</ul><h3>New Zealand</h3>

<ul><li>PS5 Digital Edition:&nbsp;NZD $859.95</li>
	<li>PS5 Standard Edition:&nbsp;NZD $949.95</li>
	<li>PS5 Disc Drive: NZD $139.95</li>
</ul><p>As you'd probably expect given its price is already pretty high, the PS5 Pro's price isn't going anywhere, at least for now. These price increases are strictly for the base PS5 models (well, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-slim-officially-announced-coming-this-holiday-season" rel="nofollow">newer slim models</a>, at any rate).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ps5-price-rises-pro.jpg?itok=FNgXJ0dR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ps5-price-rises-pro.jpg?itok=RcaptrO5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The PS5 Pro won't be subject to the new price hikes.</figcaption></figure><p>This isn't the first time in the last couple of years that Sony has hiked PS5 prices. Back in October 2023, the company upped the cost of its console's Digital Edition by $50 alongside the announcement of the slimmer redesign.</p>

<p>Sony's PS5 price hikes also come at a time when the price of consoles is a hot topic, largely thanks to two things: the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">announcement of the Nintendo Switch 2</a> and its $449.99 price tag, and President Donald Trump's sweeping economic tariffs, which appear to be in constant flux at time of writing.</p>

<p>At any rate, if you want to buy a PS5 (and not a PS5 Pro) in the aforementioned regions, the new price hikes go into effect today. Bear that in mind before you go shopping!</p>

            <p>I cannot remember any of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a>’s bosses, so it’s perhaps for the best that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>: On The Beach will let us skip right past them – skip right past them like children who think video games are just Instagram montages and that the Power of Choice is a Christian rock band. Kojima Productions’ forthcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> off-Reeder will apparently give you the option to bypass bossfights after your defeat, with information about the character then fed to you in the form of image and text descriptions. In other words, Death Stranding 2 is secretly a hybrid visual novel.</p><!--more-->
<p>I jest, I jest! No visual novel would ever receive this kind of financing. They probably blew through the entire budget of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/amarantus">Amarantus</a> on Troy Baker’s eyeshadow. Rest assured that Death Stranding 2 will have traditional real game accoutrements like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-death-stranding-2-trailer-features-a-familiar-bandana-and-a-weapon-to-legally-surpass-metal-gear">shooting and cyberpunk pedalos</a>, but should you miss claiming a boss’s scalp by millimetres you will now have the option of delegating its defeat to the Game Over screen.</p>
<p>"For boss battles in DS2 (presumably in easy mode) there will be an extra option on the Game Over screen below the 'continue' option," explains <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1910720581085126707">Genki_JPN</a> on Xitter, translating and summarising comments from game director Hideo Kojima during a recent <a href="https://x.com/koji10_tbs">Koji Pro radio broadcast</a>, as passed on by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-will-let-you-clear-bosses-without-actually-defeating-them">Eurogamer</a>. The bossfight and any story revelations therein will then be spelled out "like a novel".</p>
<p>What will the Kojima faithful make of all this? As Matt Jones <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/pillowfort.bsky.social/post/3lmrgnq4bec26">points out on Bluesky</a>, other developers have proposed to let players skip things and gotten it in the neck from people who regard ‘cheating’ at games as some kind of Nietzschean self-negation.</p>
<p>Back in 2012, for example, BioWare writer Jennifer Hepler <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/escape-escape-embracing-skippable-combat">received a torrent of abuse from disgruntled Dragon Age 2 players</a> over a recirculated interview from 2006, in which she argued that some games might benefit from the option to skip the combat. Something tells me that Kojima will be granted more latitude. Myself, I see no harm in letting Death Stranders skip bossfights as long as Death Stranding 2 doubles down on the hiking mechanics and lets me choose from a selection of bootlace knots to modify my stamina and agility. Also I want a pogo stick.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Small Black business come ups are always the move. </p><p>On the other hand, the first episode of “Live,” which aired Thursday evening (April 10), is so irrepressibly awful, I won’t know how to explain it to the aliens when they come. It was so terrible, the only reason I turned it back on after shutting it off after the first 12 minutes is to write this piece intelligently.</p><p>The show is a fusillade of f***kery that manages to do everything, everywhere wrong, all at once. The problems start with celebrity host Yvonne Orji, who is meant to bring her irreverent,<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theroot.com/yvonne-orji-gets-honest-about-the-pent-up-energy-of-b-1850996498&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theroot.com/yvonne-orji-gets-honest-about-the-pent-up-energy-of-b-1850996498"> virginal</a></span> humor to the proceedings, but most of her “jokes” land like a fart in church. In contrast, Amuli is happy allowing her contestants to deliver the personality on her “PTB,” limiting her flair to a cute lil’ mic twirl and that shimmy she does when she lands a match.</p><p>Then, there’s the cast of singles, who are all well-dressed and range from decently to preternaturally attractive. A significant aspect of O.G. “PTB’s” charm is that several of its contestants look like they either rolled out of bed to come to the show or their friends should be arrested for allowing them to go on camera dressed as they are. And they <em>damn</em> sure don’t all look like they had modeling contracts at some point.</p><p>There’s also the jocular tone of the whole proceedings — as if no one is <em>really </em>there to find a boo and it’s all for play-play. The several reality TV stars ruin the whole damn thing: The first single guy is a jackwagon named Johnny Bananas who was on MTV’s “The Real World” and who goes out of his way to be the most inauthentic human being next to the guy whose job it is to maintain President Donald Trump’s hair.</p><p>So many other aspects of “Live” just don’t hit. The post-round “confessionals.” The live audience and Orji responding to every <em>single</em> balloon pop. The vibe that everyone is there for exposure — which, in fairness, is a staple of the O.G. “PTB,” where 85 percent of the participants are “entrepreneurs.”</p><p>“Live” is yet another example of an authentically Black product getting in the hands of folks with money who bastardize and gentrify it to a pulp. It’s like what would happen if “Verzuz,” the beloved pandemic-era music competition which featured Black artists in every episode, pitted Taylor Swift against Katy Perry.</p><p>In fact, the racial dynamics on “Live” are cringy out the gate: One of the non-Black women pops on Bananas and says, “My physical type is Black,” to which he, a white boy, responds, “I’m Black from the waist up.” And there’s the blondest woman on the panel “rapping” and gyrating while insisting she grew up in Michigan listening to…Chingy. (So, “Right Thurr” on repeat her whole childhood?) Also, the spirit of Dr. Umar Johnson flowed through me every time a white woman popped on a Black male single.</p><p>We simply don’t have to worry about this shit on Amuli’s “Pop the Balloon.”</p><p>Arguably, the O.G. “Pop The Balloon” isn’t actually good <em>for </em>Black folks in how it lays bare the interminable, tired 50-50, “what-do-you-bring-to-the-table”-head ass conversations — that’s a discussion for a different rant. But there’s something charming about the low budget, somewhat ratchet nature of Amuli’s version: The whole thing looks like its shot on a Samsung Galaxy phone and paid for with a few orders of Zaxby’s, and we love it.</p><p>Fortunately, Amuli will continue her Wednesday YouTube show, hopefully maintaining the stripped-down, all Black vibe with which we fell in love. Because my guess is, with the seemingly universal early disdain for “Pop The Balloon Live,” it’s gonna go the route of the “Good Times” Netflix “remake” very damn soon.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
