<p>It was officially dissolved earlier this month</p>

<figure data-uuid="1421921698a16"><a title="Mighty No. 9" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1421921698a16/mighty-no-9.large.jpg"></a></figure><p>Keiji Inafune's video game company Comcept, originally founded in December 2010, has been "officially dissolved by a shareholders' resolution" earlier this month on 13th January 2026.</p>
<p>A notice was published about this today in Japan's government gazette Kanpo (<a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2026/01/comcept-shuts-down">thanks for the heads up, Gematsu</a>).</p>
<p>If you're a tad confused based on previous reports and updates, Gematsu's creator and editor Sal Romano has provided a bit more clarity about what exactly has taken place here (<a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/comcept-shuts-down.1419268/page-2#post-150647608">via ResetEra</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>LEVEL-5 never actually acquired Comcept. Early reports of the LEVEL5 comcept establishment came from Japanese blogs reporting on it from Weekly Famitsu, and mentioned comcept becoming a subsidiary of LEVEL-5, but this was actually a misunderstanding.</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="rsFcYrj6oHY" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rsFcYrj6oHY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytrsFcYrj6oHY" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rsFcYrj6oHY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rsFcYrj6oHY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f132xikmos&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div><blockquote>
<p>The official announcement later posted here --- <a href="https://www.level5.co.jp/news/20170615_02/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">https://www.level5.co.jp/news/20170615_02/</a> --- only mentions that a new company called LEVEL5 comcept was established, and that it is a fully owned subsidiary of LEVEL-5. It still refers to Inafune is comcept's CEO, as well as a co-CEO of LEVEL5 comcept with Akihiro Hino. It even mentions that titles currently in development by comcept at the time would continue to be managed by comcept (and not LEVEL5 comcept).</p>
<p>It's mentioned in the article, but LEVEL5 comcept was already dissolved and taken over by the newer LEVEL-5 Osaka Office following Inafune's departure from LEVEL-5 in mid-2024. This is the studio that made FANTASY LIFE i.</p>
<p>However, comcept as a separate company still existed. Until now that is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Comcept made headlines over the years for its troubled release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/mighty_no_9">Mighty No. 9</a>, which originally started life as a Kickstarter project. Before founding his studio, Inafune worked at Capcom on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamegear/mega_man">Mega Man</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/onimusha_2_samurais_destiny">Onimusha</a> and multiple other well-known video game series.</p>
<p>Apart from Mighty No. 9, the studio helped out with games such as <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/psvita/soul_sacrifice">Soul Sacrifice</a> and <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-one/recore">ReCore</a>. As for Level-5's Osaka office, it most recently worked on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fantasy_life_i_the_girl_who_steals_time">Fantasy Life i</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/inazuma_eleven_victory_road">Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</a>.</p>

<article id="article">
<header><section>
<p>Here's how it holds up</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/grid-legends-deluxe-edition">GRID Legends: Deluxe Edition</a> speeds onto the Switch 2 this week, and it just might be the best-looking game to date on Nintendo's new hybrid system.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/reviews/grid-legends-on-switch-2-an-excellent-racer-stacked-with-graphics-options">Digital Foundry has now taken a look</a>, and here's exactly what you can expect when it comes to the game's performance and resolution across the docked and handheld modes.</p>
<p>The docked graphics mode runs between 1080p and 1440p at 30fps, and docked performance mode is 792p to 1080p and maintains a smooth 60fps.</p>
<p>As for the handheld experience, GRID Legends includes four options on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>This includes performance, battery saver, balanced and graphics modes. In graphics the game runs between 792p and 1080p at 30fps, and in performance it's 684p to 828p at 60fps. The battery saver and balanced modes result in lower resolution and frame rates of 30fps and 40fps.</p>
<p>So, what's the best way to play? Here's Digital Foundry's recommendations:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"For the docked experience, we're going to have to give the nod to the 30fps graphics mode simply because so much of the visual experience is stripped back to give you that 60fps alternative that the game loses a lot of its graphical appeal - and we have to wonder why the option for a 40fps balanced mode that traded some resolution for features didn't make its way into the shipping game. For mobile gaming, it's perhaps no surprise that we've opted for that 40fps alternative: resolution is OK, a 25ms per-frame refresh still looks good on the VRR panel and while you don't get volumetric lights, the return of screen-space reflections is worth it."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/grid-legends-deluxe-edition">our review here on Nintendo Life</a>, PJ O'Reilly recommended the "smooth performance" option and was still blown away by how great it looked on the big screen. He was also impressed with the range of graphics options and just how "solid" they were across both the docked and handheld modes.</p>
<p>If you want to find out even more details about the Switch 2 version's graphics, performance, added extras and how it compares to other platforms, check out Digital Foundry's video review above and its website for a more comprehensive breakdown.</p>

<p>We weren't expecting this!</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Nintendo released a major update for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon 3</a> this week, and in case you missed it, it adds health bars to the game.</p>
<p>This has come as a real surprise to Splatoon players, as up until now, the enemy's health in multiplayer was displayed through visual cues. As Nintendo notes, the remaining health of opponents will now be shown above their heads for "a few seconds" when they're visible. Certain abilities can also make this bar visible.</p>
<p>Here's Nintendo's official description about the implementation of health bars in multiplayer:</p>
<h2>Health bar</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"With version 11.0.0, it’s now possible to see an opponent’s remaining health when they’ve been hit. Previously, you could only see how damaged an enemy was by looking closely at how much ink they were covered in – not so easy to do in the heat of battle!</p>
<p>"Now, their remaining health will be shown in a bar above their head for a few seconds, provided they’ve not ducked behind cover or dived into their ink. Though if the opponent is visible via abilities such as Thermal Ink or has been marked by things like a Point Sensor or Wave Breaker you’ll be able to see it even then!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As mentioned by Nintendo, it's not always the easiest to see "how damaged an enemy" is in the heat of the battle, so this update will no doubt help, even if it arguably removes some of the uniqueness and charm of the team-based squid-shooter.</p>
<p>Nintendo also mentions how you can now also see the health bars of your teammates when they've taken damage, which may allow you to save them before they're wiped out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"You’ll also be able to see the health bars of your teammates if they’ve taken damage. Keeping an eye on these health bars is a great way to support your allies or chase down weakened foes – even if you’ve teamed up with Inklings and Octolings you’re not familiar with."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apart from these updates, Nintendo has also highlighted some other notable updates, including a new state known as "Flow Aura", updates to the game's hit detection, and stealth jump. You can find out more about all of this in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/splatoon-3-ver-11-0-0-update-launches-this-week-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">official patch notes</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>GDKP runs are still banned in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/world-of-warcraft/" id="830">World of Warcraft,</a> even if the player base thinks it’s a ridiculous and ineffective ban.</p>



<p>GDKP (Gold Dragon Kill Points) are types of raids in WoW that allow players to bid on loot after boss battles, and even though the highest bidder wins, the gold earned from the bids is then put into a pot and split amongst all players.</p>



<h2 id="h-world-of-warcraft-players-want-gdkp-unbanned">World of Warcraft Players Want GDKP Unbanned</h2>



<p><a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/in-game-advertising-services-channel-in-burning-crusade-classic-anniversary/2238861" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Blizzard </a>recently issued a statement on their forums, noting that the policy around GDKP runs has not changed in anniversary Realms in either North America or the EU. However, the statement also claims that players are not restricted from buying or selling game services for in-game, but boosting communities are not permitted.</p>



<p>For the most part, comments on the post suggest that the ban doesn’t actually work, with one user commenting, “Continuing to deny GDKP on Anniversary realms while refusing to admit that the economy is absolutely horrible and the ban has not given the results you claimed it would.”</p>



<p>Then, of course, there are the people who are extra intense about the news, such as one user saying, “Absolutely moronic. Give us back GDKP. Everyone who takes this game semi-seriously wants it back… Give us back GDKP or people will quit!” </p>



<p>Blizzard does remain steadfast in their decision, however. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The team behind Omelet You Cook, a cooking roguelike, is worried about the release of Slay the Spire 2, which could take away all the buzz the game could have.</p>



<p>Roguelike games are plentiful in 2026, but Slay the Spire arguably stands head and shoulders above the rest in the genre. Omelet You Cook, published by SchuBox Games, offers a unique take on the genre and is currently available on Steam Early Access. However, it’s scheduled to leave early access on February 8, giving the game only one month before Slay the Spire’s long-awaited sequel comes out and dominates the roguelike discussion.</p>







<h2 id="h-slay-the-spire-2-hits-early-access-in-march-2026">Slay the Spire 2 hits Early Access in March 2026</h2>



<p>In September 2025, Mega Crit announced that the sequel to the massively popular 2019 roguelike deck builder would be hitting Early Access in March, following a delay. </p>



<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/roguelike/slay-the-spire-2-pulls-a-silksong-scares-indie-devs-into-releasing-roguelike-ahead-of-schedule-in-fear-of-losing-players-to-an-absolute-juggernaut-in-our-own-genre/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+, </a>Dan Schumacher noted that they originally assumed they would not have to compete with the massive title because they believed it was still set to release in late 2025. </p>



<p>However, as it turns out, they missed the delay announcement. Schumacher even joked that he won’t have time to finish his own game because he’ll be too busy playing that</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“There was no way we could release at the same time as an absolute juggernaut in our own genre,” he says.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He encourages audiences to be kind to the title as it leaves early access in February, noting that it’s a big jump, but they want the chance to have a wider audience play the game.</p>







<p>You can pick up Omelet You Cook right now on Steam and Early Access for $15. There’s a free demo, as well.</p>

With a vibrant aesthetic that aims to recreate the richness and dynamism of hand-drawn Japanese animation, <em>Homura Hime</em> tasks players with ridding the world of the fiendish Archdemon Girls and their monster hordes, utilizing slick melee combat evocative of the <em><a title="Series > NieR [9 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/nier">NieR</a></em> and <em>Devil May Cry</em> series. Dodge the barrages of enemy attacks and string together flashy combos to clear the battlefield, excising tainted souls from a troubled world and unraveling the mysterious legacy of the titular heroine.</p><p>Welcome to a world populated by both humans and demons. Here, troubled souls burdened by intense emotion or deep regret are transformed into archdemons when they pass through the veil of mortality. These archdemons have the power to corrupt the very foundation of the world, contaminating their surroundings and the creatures who dwell within them. Those tainted by this demonic power turn into lowly monsters; vicious fiends that operate solely on raw instinct. When this world becomes threatened by a quintet of extremely powerful Archdemon Girls, the High Priestess has no other choice but to turn to Homura Hime, the “Flame Princess” and the strongest exorcist. Alongside her devoted aide Ann, Homura Hime must embark on a divine mission to eliminate the five Archdemon Girls and their monster hordes, banishing their evil and purifying her discordant world.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_1022093"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->

			<p>In <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nioh 3</em>, the mistake you may make is treating the Samurai and Ninja styles as a binary choice, picking whichever you feel is best in each situation. And you wouldn't be terribly wrong: both styles are perfectly viable on their own and there is no direct penalty for staying in one all the time.</p>



<p>However, if you do that, you are limiting your potential. Switching between the two styles is the essential "next step" in the combat dance that the <em>Nioh</em> series has always championed. </p>



<p>Welcome to the Dojo. In this guide, we will go over some of the game's central combat mechanics, such as Arts Proficiency, and how they come together to dictate a very unique combat flow.</p>



<div><h2>Table of contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#h-why-ki-damage-matters" data-level="2">Why Ki Damage Matters</a></li><li><a href="#h-the-challenge-of-style-differences" data-level="2">The Challenge of Style Differences</a></li><li><a href="#h-the-power-of-arts-proficiency" data-level="2">The Power of Arts Proficiency</a></li><li><a href="#h-the-nioh-3-combat-loop-distilled" data-level="2">The Nioh 3 Combat Loop, Distilled</a></li></ul></div>



<h2 id="h-why-ki-damage-matters">Why Ki Damage Matters</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nioh-3-Ki-Damage-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>The key to combat in <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Nioh 3</em> remains the same as in previous entries: <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">depleting enemy Ki</strong>. By doing so, you gain a massive advantage over enemies, no matter their type.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Human Enemies:</strong> Once their Ki is gone, they are open to grapple attacks.</li>



<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Yokai:</strong> Lowering their Ki allows you to stagger them with any attack, and reducing their Max Ki opens them up to a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Final Blow</strong> for massive damage.</li>
</ul>



<p>While you can mostly ignore these mechanics for the majority of regular enemies during your first playthrough, dealing Ki damage is non-negotiable for bosses. It is the only way to deal high damage without them constantly retaliating and interrupting you.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-challenge-of-style-differences">The Challenge of Style Differences</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nioh-3-Combat-Styles-2.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>In <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Nioh 3</em>, depleting Ki has become slightly more challenging. Samurai Style attacks are generally slower than in <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nioh 2</em>, and the primary Ki-destroying weapon, the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Tonfa</strong>, now exclusive to the Ninja Style.</p>



<p>Because of the sheer attack speed, the Ninja Style is naturally better at chipping away an enemy's Ki through a constant barrage of strikes, regardless of the equipped weapons. This quick pace serves a second purpose as well: building <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Arts Proficiency</strong> much faster.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-power-of-arts-proficiency">The Power of Arts Proficiency</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nioh-3-Arts-Proficiency-Full-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Arts Proficiency is the mechanic in Nioh 3 that allows you to deal boss-melting damage, not counting Living Artifact, which can still take advantage of it to utterly annihilate most enemies. </p>



<p>As you attack in either style, you fill the Arts Proficiency gauge. Once filled, your next Martial Art or Heavy Attack is significantly powered up. In addition, the more different attacks you chain together while the gauge is active, the more powerful each one becomes.</p>



<p>At this point, you can easily understand how Ki depletion and Arts Proficiency in Ninja Style start building a basic combat flow. If a Yokai isn't out of Ki, it isn't staggered by your combo, and they can and will interrupt you. Unless you equip the  Oprresive Strength Samurai skill, but that opens up a survivability problem that can only be solved with advanced builds providing automatic healing by landing attacks.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-nioh-3-combat-loop-distilled">The Nioh 3 Combat Loop, Distilled</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nioh-3-Combat-Flow-Distilled-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>With all the above in mind, the basic Nioh 3 combat loop can be distilled as such:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Pressure With Ninja Style:</strong> Start the fight in Ninja Style to deplete the enemy's Ki and rapidly build your Arts Proficiency gauge.</li>



<li><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Deal Damage With Samurai Sty</strong>le<strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">:</strong> Once the enemy's Ki is depleted (and they are staggered), switch to Samurai Style to unleash your high-damage Strong Attacks and Martial Arts combos.</li>



<li><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Recovery:</strong> As your assault ends, switch back to Ninja Style after using Ki Pulse to shorten your recovery time. This allows you to recover Ki more quickly, and use <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Ninjutsu </strong>(whose charges should be full following your Samurai Style combo) to deal burst damage from a safe distance.</li>
</ul>



<p>As you progress and gain a deeper understanding of these mechanics, you won’t need such a rigid structure. You'll find yourself switching styles instinctively based on the rhythm of the duel. However, for those first few hours in the Warring States, this loop is highly recommended to help you mow down Yokai and build the confidence required to become the next Shogun.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nioh-3-Samurai-Skill-Tree.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>To avoid <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">overwhelming players</strong>, <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nioh 3</em> introduces mechanics gradually, perhaps a little too slowly. For the Samurai Style, the flow of combat is entirely centered on switching between <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Low, Mid, and High stances, </strong>which is something you cannot take advantage of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">as only Mid stance is available from the beginning of the game</strong>.</p>



<p>As such, the first few enemies of the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Warring States</strong> starting map feel more <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">challenging than they should</strong>.

<p>Furthermore, you should also learn <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Deflect as soon as possible.</strong>. By pressing the Block button (<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">L1/LB</strong>) just before an attack connects, you will deflect an enemy attack, stagger them briefly and build your <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Arts Proficiency gauge</strong>. This <strong>increases</strong> the power of your Martial Arts and Heavy Attacks.</p>



<p>If the complexity of the Samurai stances feels like too much at the start, don't be afraid to lean on the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Ninja Style</strong>.

<p>The <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Ki Pulse</strong> remains the most important mechanic in the franchise.

<p>The only metric that truly matters is <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Agility</strong>, determined by your <strong>Current Encumbrance Ratio</strong>:</p>

<p>In <em>Nioh 3</em>, however, the introduction of <strong>Ninja</strong> style made <strong>dodging a valuable defensive option</strong>, more than in its predecessors, with an <strong>increased distance</strong> and the ability to dodge quickly after attacking with <strong>Mist</strong>, the Ninja style equivalent of <strong>Ki Pulse</strong> (but without Ki restoration!).</p>



<p>At the start of the game, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">mastering the nuances of both styles can be a challenge</strong>. Guarding, however, is a solid defensive option for both styles, so use the protection granted by this technique to learn how enemies attack, and so when you can use the Ninja style's superior agility to dodge when required.</p>

<p><em>This tip is more about improving your enjoyment of the game, rather than learning how to play. </em></p>



<p>The new open-field maps in <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Nioh 3</em> make exploration highly rewarding.

<p>However, <strong>don't overdo it.</strong> If you clear every single icon before moving the story forward, you risk out-leveling the content and stripping away the challenge.</p>



<p>Play naturally and follow what interests you rather than chasing every waymarker. Remember that in a Team NINJA game, <strong>the first playthrough is essentially the tutorial</strong>, so you’ll have plenty of time to explore every inch of the map once the real game begins in the higher difficulty unlocked after completing the game for the first time.</p>

			<p><em><strong>Nioh 3</strong></em> is the first new entry in the hardcore action role-playing game series by Team NINJA in over 6 years, and a lot has changed since the second entry.</p>



<p>While the <strong>basic combat mechanics and loot system are rooted in the franchise's history</strong>, the third entry introduces <strong>many changes and additions</strong> that can leave even veterans a little confused.</p>



<p>In this&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Complete Walkthrough and Guides Hub</strong>, you will find everything you need not only to successfully complete your journey through time but also to have tons of fun while doing so, starting from the <strong>Warring States period</strong>, which can be experienced in the massive <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-new-demo-ps5-pc-january-29-2026-carries-full-game-crossplay-missing/">free demo</a></strong> available on PC and PlayStation 5.</p>

<h2 id="h-overview">Overview</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/20260118012947_1-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Nioh 3 feels both fresh and familiar</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Nioh 3</em> is a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">hardcore action role-playing game</strong> where players control Takeichiyo Tokugawa (who can be <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">fully customized</strong> at the beginning of the game via a deep character creator) as they journey through time to <strong>seek and defeat their treacherous brother Kunimatsu</strong>, who has unleashed Yokai in the land and is using the fabled Spirit Stones to become the shogun in place of his sibling.</p>



<p><span>Besides featuring another story which sees the appearances of real-history figures like Ieyasu Tokugawa,&nbsp;<em>Nioh 3</em>&nbsp;features a&nbsp;<strong>combination of old and new mechanics</strong></span>&nbsp;that enhance the series' challenging experience, but that may take <strong>some time to get used to</strong>, especially if you're coming straight from previous entries in the series.</p>



<p id="h-if-you-re-feeling-lost-in-this-sprawling-adventure-our-essential-tips-guide-will-help-you-come-to-grips-with-the-most-important-mechanics-in-the-game-and-start-having-fun-right-from-the-get-go">If you're feeling lost in this sprawling adventure, our <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/enter-the-dojo-5-essential-tips-to-learn-nioh-3/">Essential Tips guide</a></strong> will help you come to grips with the most important mechanics in the game and <strong>start having fun right from the get-go.</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-story-progression">Story Progression</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nioh-3-cutscene-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>In Nioh 3, you will meet a lot of characters, including real historical figures</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Unlike previous entries in the series, which had players pick missions from several regional maps, <em>Nioh 3</em> features <strong>multiple open-field maps</strong> that let you explore different locations and reach the <strong>main mission locations</strong> directly while engaging in plenty of side content.</p>



<p>At end of these, which play like the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">classic closed-off missions</strong> from previous entries in the series, you will have to defeat the <strong>fearsome bosses</strong> to destroy the <strong>Crucible</strong> and progress the story. This will unlock <strong>new regions of the open-field maps and brand-new maps.</strong></p>



<p>Even before the first Warring States period map opens up, you will have to contend with <strong>powerful bosses</strong> that can be frustrating to take down. This is the case of <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/warrior-of-the-east-how-to-beat-yamagata-masakage-in-nioh-3">Yamagata Masakage</a></strong>, who will bar your way as you make your way through Yokai at the start of the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-combat">Combat</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nioh-3-Combat-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Nioh 3 significantly evolves the series' combat system</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The most significant change to <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Nioh 3</em>'s combat system, aside from the ability to jump and briefly engage in aerial combat, is the introduction of two fighting styles: <strong>Samurai and Ninja.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Samurai Style</strong> plays like the characters from the first two entries in the series, allowing players to wield select weapons in <strong>three different stances</strong> and unleash powerful <strong>Martial Arts,</strong> which can be enhanced with the <strong>Arts Proficiency</strong> system.</p>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Ninja Style</strong>, on the other hand, is a faster combat style that can use <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Ninjutsu skills</strong> to disrupt enemies, deal elemental damage, and avoid enemy attacks with <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">superior agility.</strong></p>



<p>Both fighting styles can also be further empowered by <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Guardian Spirits</strong>, which grant access to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">two</strong> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">elemental skills</strong> each that replace the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Yokai Skills</strong> from <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nioh 2</em> and the powered-up <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Living Artifact</strong> state, which replaces Living Weapon from the original <em>Nioh</em> and Yokai Shift from <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nioh 2</em>.</p>



<p>In case you are feeling <strong>confused</strong> about the <em>Nioh 3</em> <strong>combat flow</strong> amidst Samurai Style with its three stances and Ninja Style, you are not alone. <span>T</span>o learn the basics of this flow and how Arts Proficiency and Ninjustsu tie the two styles together, check out our&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/enter-the-dojo-mastering-nioh-3-combat-and-arts-proficiency-flow/">Mastering Nioh 3 Combat and Arts Proficiency Flow guide.</a></strong></p>

<p>Likewise, returning from its predecessors are <strong>multiple Skill Trees</strong> for the Samurai and Ninja Styles and all weapons, which can be used to unlock the <strong>Martial Arts</strong> that define each weapon and style.</p>



<p>New to the <em>Nioh</em> series are <strong>Skills and the Skill Points </strong>required to activate them. Learned by completing specific tasks, these skills <strong>empower</strong> both the Samurai and Ninja Style and provide bonuses for both.</p>



<p>Rounding up the <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nioh 3</em> character progression mechanics are <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Soul Cores</strong>. Dropped by Yokai, these can be set in the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Onmyo Box</strong> at the Shrine in either Yin or Yang position to get access to either <strong>Onmyo magic spells</strong> or the <strong>ability to summon Yokai</strong> to unleash their signature attacks.</p>

<p>Doing away with the classic linear design of the previous entries in the series, <em>Nioh 3</em> introduces <strong>open fields</strong> that replace the top-down maps of its predecessors. These maps are filled with <strong>side content</strong> to complete, including the Myth sidequests, formidable enemies, Crucible Wraiths and tons of treasure.</p>



<p>While traversal is always conducted on foot, you will unlock <strong>new traversal skills</strong> as more Guardian Spirits join you. They will also provide you with the power needed to unlock new areas and take advantage of the <strong>Spirit Veins</strong> to reach previously inaccessible areas.</p>

<p>The <strong>Diablo-style loot system</strong> returns in <em>Nioh 3.</em> By exploring the open fields and defeating both humans and Yokai, you will be able to find all <strong>sorts of loot</strong> ranging from Samurai and Ninja weapons to helmets, armor, gauntlets, graves, and accessories, coming in <strong>four rarity levels</strong> which determine how many passive skills they grant once equipped.</p>



<p>After reaching a certain point in the story, you will also unlock the <strong>Blacksmith</strong>, who will forge you weapons depending on the Smithing Texts you have found and customize them in different ways.</p>

<p>The asymmetrical mechanics have been further expanded in <em>Nioh 3</em> by introducing the <strong>Bloodedge Demon</strong>, a malignant Yokai that gathers the spirits of defeated Revenants appearing in different places all over the open-field maps.</p>

              <p>The current YouTube thumbnail meta requires people to pose extravagant claims or make dramatic declarations alongside exaggerated facial expressions of shock or skepticism. It’s <a href="https://nationalpost.com/news/mind-the-curiosity-gap-how-can-upworthy-be-noble-and-right-when-its-clickbait-headlines-feel-so-wrong">curiosity gap</a> farming on steroids, increasingly aided by genAI to flood the platform with absurd content. BabyTuber thumbnails are the antidote.</p> <p>An artist who goes by Jamie on Bluesky shared the first one <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/lmaonadestand.bsky.social/post/3md7egs5bus2l">earlier this week</a>. It was titled “Why I’m Switching” and showed an infant furrowing its brow while pondering upgrading from toy blocks to a bead maze. There’s a thought bubble, a greater than sign, and a question mark. It’s perfect.</p>   <p>Jamie encouraged others to get in on the fun and share their own Babytuber thumbnails. Some people did.

<p>Group SNE is adapting another video game into a tabletop RPG. This time, it’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/fromsoftware/" id="87617">FromSoftware’s</a> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/elden-ring-nightreign/" id="2260" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elden Ring Nightreign.</a></p>



<p>Group SNE has adopted many games for tabletop RPGs, including Armored Core 6, Dark Souls, and the original Elden Ring. The next TTRPG is scheduled for release in the spring of 2026. Elden Ring Nightreign is a twist on the original Elden Ring concept, turning the game into a three-player co-op game.</p>

<p>In December 2025, The Forsaken Hollows DLC launched for Nightreign. That DLC launched two new character classes, new bosses, and more. So far, the game has sold over 5 million units, and the DLC has also secured millions of sales.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> has struggled a touch with its endgame pretty much since launch, but with the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-mmos-mmorpgs">MMO's</a> next big update, Chapter 3, is promising to offer a revamp that you (yes, you! The person playing Dune: Awakening right now! Maybe!) have been after. A release date was also offered up for the big update, alongside some specifics on just what this new endgame might look like.
</p>
<p>
Dune: Awakening Chapter 3 is apparently set to arrive as soon as next week, February 3rd, so you've not got all that long to wait. In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1172710/view/541129246577262618">blog post</a> over on Steam, Funcom explained that the biggest bits of feedback regarding the endgame included the desire for more options, more rewarding ways to play, more things to do, more ways to progress player characters, and other bits, all of which will apparently be addressed in the update.
</p>
<p>
For starters, after you reach Plastanium (Tier 6), there'll be "deeper choices, shared goals, and more ways for players to continue growing." The new Specialization and Augmentation systems should allow for more in-depth progression, and there'll be 10 new locations to explore on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overland">Overland</a> Map, "including unique repeatable testing stations that feature challenging boss encounters with scaling difficulty and increasingly valuable loot."
</p>
<p>
Quite amusingly, you will also not have to pay taxes for your bases anymore! All because nobody liked it, which shows you that if we really wanted to, we could all stop paying our actual taxes too (Mr. Government I'm just goofing around, I promise). Those of you that haven't logged in in more than 28 days will also get a return package with some helpful tools too. Whether any of this is enough to bring people back or keep people happy, who knows! We'll find out soon enough in the Switter replies, I'm sure.

            <title><![CDATA[Xbox Hardware Is Still Falling, Falling, Falling]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/xbox-earnings-q2-game-pass-hardware-next-gen-pc-2000663911</link>
            <guid>1419148</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The decline in Xbox hardware revenue has become so predictable you could <a href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-bethesda-xbox-game-pass-watch-special-edition-1850527638">set your <em>Starfield</em> watch to it</a>. Microsoft reported its second-quarter earnings on Wednesday and, yes, console sales are down yet again. But the rest of the gaming division didn’t have a such a hot holiday either. The company is blaming year-over-year declines on the lack of strong releases near the end of 2025. Hmmm.</p> <p>“Xbox content and services revenue declined 5 percent (down 6 percent CC) on a prior year comparable that benefited from strong first-party content performance,” reads the company’s <a href="https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https://microsoft.com/en-us/investor/earnings/FY-2026-Q2/Document/DownloadDocument/141/SlidesFY26Q2.pptx">latest earnings presentation</a>. “Xbox hardware revenue declined 32 percent.”</p>

 <p>But last year’s numbers weren’t exactly stellar. The gaming division <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/xbox-revenue-fell-7-in-q2-as-hardware-sales-dropped-29/">saw a 7 percent decline</a> overall in the second quarter. Xbox hardware was down 29 percent this time in 2025, while content and services were only up 2 percent. Holiday 2024 had <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> and <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</em> but was otherwise quiet.</p> <p>Holiday 2025, on the other hand, saw the release of <em>Ninja Gaiden 4 </em>and&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>, while<em> Flight Sim</em> came to PS5. Also the underperforming <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> which, combined with a major Game Pass price hike, might have led to a spike in churn. We don’t know, though, because Microsoft still isn’t releasing new subscriber numbers.</p>

 <p>All we know for sure is that the Xbox Series X/S is an ever-shrinking part of the equation for Microsoft Gaming and the company in general. And it’s been that way <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-x-s-sales-microsoft-next-gen-exclusives-1850375665">almost every year</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-ps5-sales-exclusivity-starfield-microsoft-1851436748">since the consoles launched</a>. The company has promised <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-next-gen-backwards-compatibility-microsoft-pc-2000644836">new hardware</a> but the priorities of the evolving Xbox platform seem to increasingly lie beyond it.</p>

 <p>With the AI arms race led by Microsoft and others spiking <a href="https://kotaku.com/intel-cpu-production-pivot-ai-data-centers-shortages-increase-price-ram-memory-pc-2000663095">gaming hardware costs in the near term</a>, maybe that’s for the best.</p>
