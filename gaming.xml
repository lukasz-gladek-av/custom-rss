            <p>Activision has published a 25-page white paper exploring the impact of skill-based matchmaking (SBMM) on its multiplayer lobbies, determining that SBMM is better for all players.</p>
<p>As spotted by indie game developer and consultant <a href="https://x.com/tha_rami/status/1817178179208925317">Rami Ismail</a>, the report – which can be <a href="https://www.activision.com/cdn/research/CallofDuty_Matchmaking_Series_2.pdf">read in full on Activision's official website</a> – outlines an "amazing A/B test" where Activision "secretly progressively turned off SBMM and monitored retention… and turns out everyone hated it, with more quitting, less playing, and more negative blowouts".</p>

<p>Activision announced plans to launch the series of white papers back in <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/01/call-of-duty-update-an-Inside-look-at-matchmaking">April</a>, and has already considered the impact <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/01/call-of-duty-update-an-Inside-look-at-matchmaking">connections and Time to Match</a> has on online play.</p>
<p>The most recent paper, however – entitled "Matchmaking Series: The Role of Skill in Matchmaking" – "shares a look at matchmaking inside Call of Duty multiplayer, including how we always work to create a balanced system for the benefit of all players. While skill is one of many factors in matchmaking; it is not the driving force behind Call of Duty’s matchmaking system".</p>
<p>"Playing a better opponent may push players to become more proficient over time, but being severely outperformed in their matches, our testing has shown, instead leads players to quit matches in progress or to not play multiplayer," Activision surmises.</p>
<p>It also confirmed that it whilst it was "considering a single core multiplayer playlist that does not use skill as a factor in matchmaking", Activision believes "historical testing reveals that low- and mid-skill players would be unlikely to participate in such a playlist. As a match can only be created from players actively searching for a playlist, the likely result would be matches composed solely of high-skill players."</p>
<p>The experiment, Activision opines, shows that the existing SBMM system allows a broadest range of players to participate in "all key parts of Call of Duty's game design in core multiplayer".</p>
<p>This "includes games where players can contribute meaningfully to their team, not only with wins, but for their own personal records and achievements".</p>
<p>"The system strives for team balance, where players are not consistently on the wrong side of blowout matches. Players who frequently experience blowouts are seen to quit matches in progress and the game itself, which negatively impacts the experience for players of all skill levels," Activision concluded.</p>
<p>"We will always strive to improve our approach to matchmaking to ensure that players of all skill levels are having the best possible experience. A healthy player population is good for everyone in the community."</p>
<p>Further research papers into ranked played and "experimental methods" are expected later this year.</p>
<p>ICYMI, last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-is-heading-to-xbox-game-pass-this-week">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 joined Xbox Game Pass earlier this week</a>.</p>

            <p>Amazon Prime's Like a Dragon adaptation Like a Dragon: Yakuza will premier on 24th October, 2024.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/like-a-dragon-yakuza-tv-series-on-amazon-prime-later-this-year">Previously</a>, we'd been told the series would debut on 25th October.</p>
<p>To mark the change, Amazon also dropped a tantalising, if brief, peek at what's to come in a new teaser trailer:</p>

<p>Sega's Yakuza game series released in 2005. Amazon says in the video description that it was "positioned as an entertaining game for adults, which found massive fanfare amongst its target audience".</p>
<p>The series will span two time periods - 1995 and 2005 - and follow "the life, childhood friends, and repercussions of the decisions of Kazuma Kiryu, a fearsome and peerless Yakuza warrior with a strong sense of justice, duty, and humanity".</p>
<p>"The series depicts the lives of fierce yet passionate gangsters and people living in a huge entertainment district, Kamurochō, a fictional district modeled after the violent Shinjuku ward’s Kabukichō, that acts as the backdrop of the gameplay," the description adds.</p>
<p>"Like a Dragon: Yakuza showcases modern Japan and the dramatic stories of these intense characters, such as the legendary Kazuma Kiryu, that games in the past have not been able to explore. Coming October 24 to Prime."</p>
<p>Japanese actor and model Ryoma Takeuchi (who cameoed in Detective Pikachu, among other roles) will take on the lead role of Kazuma Kiryu, while Masaharu Take (The Naked Director) will direct.</p>
<p>The TV series is yet another indication of the success of the series, which has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-sammy-reports-best-financial-performance-for-a-decade-despite-european-studio-disappointment">sold 21.3m units in total</a>. The most recent game, this year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-hits-1m-sales-in-first-week">Infinite Wealth, sold 1m units in its first week</a> and was the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-is-series-biggest-steam-launch-to-date">series' biggest Steam launch ever</a>.</p>
<p>As Ed reported for us at the time, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yakuza-was-flat-out-rejected-by-sega-in-its-first-proposal-says-series-creator">Sega "flat out rejected" the first proposal for the game</a>, presuming it wouldn't attract mass audiences. Yet the TV series is likely to do just that, especially following the success of Amazon's Fallout series, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-tv-show-was-watched-by-65m-people-in-its-first-two-weeks">was watched by 65 million people</a> in its first 16 days of release and has already been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-show-officially-renewed-for-second-season">renewed for a second season</a>.</p>

            <p>For those watching the Olympics opening ceremony last night, no, that was not your imagination – a familiar hooded Assassin did indeed invade the rooftops of Paris last night.</p>
<p>Whilst it's hard to find footage given a trigger-happy copyright gremlin is striking down videos all over the place, there are still a number of images and video of Assassin's Creed Unity's Arno carrying the Olympic torch for anyone who missed it:</p>

<p>And no, it's not a coincidence – that really is an Assassin's Creed reference. Though it had been <a href="https://x.com/ac_landmarks/status/1816424863961411730">suggested</a> that Ubisoft's tentpole franchise may be making an appearance, last night the French company confirmed it:</p> <div>

<p>Assassin's Creed Unity – which will soon celebrate its tenth anniversary – was set in 18th-century Paris, which makes Arno's return fitting, if a little surprising given he is perhaps not the most beloved Assassin, and Unity was not the best-performing game at launch.</p> <div>

<p>It does, however, commemorate the hugely-successful series in a mainstream event seen by millions, and solidifies just how influential Ubisoft is to the people of Paris.</p>

            <p>I like a good factory game, but there's a fine line between "I enjoy this" and "I am uninstalling this before it ruins my year." I can't tell on which side of the divide <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shapez-2">Shapez 2</a> will fall, but I'm planning on finding out when it launches in Early Access next month on August 15th.

<p>Here's the Early Access announcemnt trailer from earlier this week:

<p>Like most factory games, Shapez 2 is about laying down conveyor belts to carry items between machinery that alters those items in some capacity. The difference is that instead of rendering one type of ore into another, Shapez is all about... shapes. That allows the game to broaden the possible solutions, with no predetermined recipes for the objects you're trying to create. Instead, it gives you machines that perform simple, fundamental actions - cutting a shape in half, changing its colour, rotating it, etc. - which you can puzzle out how to combine.
</p>
<p>The second compelling element to me is that the machinery is free to plonk down, and resources are infinite. It's more of a pure puzzle game, nearer the Opus Magnum end of the spectrum than the Factorio end. That's where I live. (Ollie, who lives in every factory possible, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shapez-2s-next-fest-demo-is-the-purest-catnip-for-factory-game-lovers">loved the Shapez 2 Next Fest demo</a>.)
</p>
<p>I didn't play the original Shapez (which has overwhelmingly positive reviews and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1318690/shapez/">currently costs less than £1 on Steam</a>) but I admit, the leap to 3D presentation does make the sequel seem more approachable. You'll find Shapez 2 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2162800/shapez_2/">also on Steam</a>, where it's aiming to be in Early Access for around six months.</p>

<p>World Of Goo's premise is simple enough. Goo balls slither around levels and you can pick them up. Hold them close to other goo balls and they will form connective beams, fixing them in place. Through this, you can build towers towards a level exit, and unused goos can scale the tower and escape. It's Lemmings with a 2008 physics twist.

<p>What makes World Of Goo a classic is that, on top of such a simple premise, each level introduces a delightful surprise: new types of goo, new obstacles, new settings, and so on. I remember people crowding around my monitor as I played it in an office in 2008 and <em>applauding</em> during end-of-level cutscenes, overcome by what an explosive and coherent act of imagination the whole thing was. The prototypical example of an indie game taking a good idea and exploring it to its fullest potential.
</p>
<p>Which, if you buy the argument, makes it a tough act to follow. I'd be worried about World Of Goo 2's ability to find as much invention as the original if sixteen years hadn't elapsed. Since it has been that long, I'm just happy there's more of it, and if it repeats a bunch of ideas and is ultimately a lesser game, then who cares, I'd still have fun playing it.
</p>
<p>August 2nd. I think Brendy's bagsied the review.</p>

            <p>Grimdark hack-and-slasher <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/no-rest-for-the-wicked-2024">No Rest For The Wicked</a> has received its first major update - or the first that isn't focused on bug fixes and performance improvements, anyway. It focuses on revamping the Crucible, the endgame's repeatable roguelite, adding more randomisation to arenas and a new system of player buffs.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"One of the biggest features that we always envisioned for the Cerim Crucible but weren’t able to ship at launch is this Echoes. Echoes allow you to customize every run with a huge variety of buffs and effects, creating a staggering amount of possibilities as it allows you to create a build on top of your build," says Moon's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1371980/view/4338739067969013801">own introduction to the update</a>. "Thanks to Echoes and the randomization of them, no two runs in the Crucible will ever be alike."
</p>
<p>The randomised chambers you'll fight through have been tripled in number, alongside a new art theme, a new vendor, and a new enemy faction called the Gloam. Glowing with a "corrupt bioluminescence", the Gloam will only appear in the Crucible for now, but will be added to the overworld in a later update. 
</p>
<p>Outside of the Crucible, the update adds some extensions to the overworld, new agear upgrades, "punchier" effects in combat, stray animals you can pet, several further performance upgrade, and Steam Deck verification. You'll <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1371980/view/4372516525986618808">find the full patch notes over on Steam</a>.
</p>
<p>No Rest For The Wicked is from Moon Studios, known previously for the two Ori games. If what you crave is another maudlin metroidvania from them, you're out of luck: they say they'll be working on No Rest in Early Access <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dont-expect-ori-3-anytime-soon-as-devs-say-theyll-be-working-on-no-rest-for-the-wicked-for-up-to-a-decade">for up to a decade</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/warcry-briar-and-bone-review.938487/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warcry-briar-and-bone-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Warcry</em>&nbsp;Briar and Bone is the third expansion in the latest season of Warcry. It follows the same format as the previous expansion's release, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/warcry-hunter-and-hunted-preview-who-let-dogs-out">Hunter and Hunted</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/guides/warcry-pyre-and-flood-guide-life-vs-death-clash">Pyre and Flood</a>,&nbsp;where it contains 2 new warbands and their rules, and a single piece of scenery, rather than the full scenery set up that earlier season's boxes contained.&nbsp;In this article, we'll have a look at what's in the Briar and Bone box, talk in-depth about the 2 new warbands, and explain why this box is different from previous seasons, and if you're a new player, what you need to use it.</p>
<p><em>Warcry</em> is a skirmish wargame, set in Games Workshop's larger <em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar&nbsp;</em>setting. As a skirmish game, <em>Warcry</em> features a small number of fighters, rather than huge battles fought with entire armies.&nbsp;We've covered <em>Warcry</em> in depth since its first edition, and you can read our review of the latest starter set <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-warcry-crypt-of-blood-review-skirmish-gaming-101">Crypt of Blood</a>.</p>

<h2>What Does Warcry Briar and Bone Contain?</h2>
<p><em>Warcry</em>&nbsp;Briar and Bone contains:</p>
<ul><li><em>Warcry</em>&nbsp;Briar and Bone Warband Tome</li>
<li>8x Twistweald miniatures</li>
<li>8x Teratic Cohort&nbsp;miniatures</li>
<li>1x Ravening Gnarloak&nbsp;scenery piece</li>
<li>Fighter and ability cards for both warbands</li>
<li>42x Battleplan cards</li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warcry-briar-and-bone-005.jpg?itok=dx_Jho3P 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warcry-briar-and-bone-005.jpg?itok=pBsKzdrQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>What Do I Need To Use The Warcry Briar and Bone Box?</h2>
<p><em>Warcry</em>&nbsp;Briar and Bone is an expansion pack for <em>Warcry</em>, so it doesn't require everything needed to play.</p>
<p>To use <em>Warcry</em> Briar and Bone you will also need the following&nbsp;<em>Warcry </em>products:</p>
<ul><li><em>Warcry</em>&nbsp;Core Rulebook</li>
<li>Six-sided dice (D6), measuring tools and tokens</li>
<li>A game board and scenery set (you can use anything you want, including your existing scenery, or the new official set for this season, the&nbsp;Savage Lands: Scales of Talaxis&nbsp;scenery box)</li>
</ul><h2>What Warbands Do You Get In Warcry Briar and Bone?</h2>
<p><i>Warcry </i>Briar and Bone, as standard with <em>Warcry</em> expansions, includes 2 brand new warbands, the&nbsp;Sylvaneth Twistweald, and the&nbsp;Ossiarch Bonereapers Teratic Cohort.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warcry-briar-and-bone-003.jpg?itok=xqOTilmw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warcry-briar-and-bone-003.jpg?itok=VhFL3MOO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h4>Twistweald</h4>
<p>The Twistweald aren't the Sylvaneth warriors as you know them, they are forest spirits infected with bizarre arcane parasites, that makes them outcasts from their own kind for fear of spreading the infection further. They're not fast, but they're durable and they all have access to the powerful Quad ability, Twisted Song, that lets them remove damage and make a bonus move or attack action. They also have an ability card filled with offensive doubles and triples, like the Swamsage's Thorned Grasp that deals 2 damage to an enemy on a 2 plus, and continued dice rolls for damage as long as you roll higher than the previous roll.</p>
<p>The Twistweald fighters are expensive, with the cheapest costing 110 points,&nbsp; but they have a solid mix of hard-hitting close and ranged attacks to spread amongst the warband. The spitesspear armed Twistroot has a great range 2, 4 dice 2/4 damage attack that keeps enemies at range.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warcry-briar-and-bone-002.jpg?itok=ylqWIvW_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warcry-briar-and-bone-002.jpg?itok=n6rNAySO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h4>Teratic Cohort</h4>
<p>The Teratic Cohort are some of Nagash's most pitiful creations, sculpted into skeletal beasts from failed soldiers, their minds forever tormented, which makes them lethal to their enemies. Their animalistic nature gives them the Predatory Ravage reaction, which allows them a free attack after damage has been dealt to them by either discarding a wild dice or subtracting 1 from the attacks and damage from each hit dice from the attack. This reaction can be super lethal from the warband's leader, the Kavalos Centari, an amalgamation of warrior and steed, who attacks with 5 dice at range 3.</p>
<p>The rest of the warband are a mix of Mortek Cyloptians, slow and durable warriors with strength 5 attacks, and the 2 types of beasts, the winged Aviarch Harpies, and houndlike Teratic Prowlers.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warcry-briar-and-bone-004.jpg?itok=M0We4Nz6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warcry-briar-and-bone-004.jpg?itok=hvsPczY8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>What Are Our Final Thoughts On Warcry Briar and Bone?</h2>
<p>The 2 warbands in <em>Warcry Briar and Bone</em> aren't to my taste, although I've always liked the Bonereapers aesthetic, but both are very thematic and matched well against each other. The Twistweld and Teratic Cohort are both slow and durable, and each has a slightly faster fighter option for moving on objectives, or late-game repositioning. I love that they're both outcasts from their own societies, and are still battling each other for the benefit of their own hated factions. I do love the Ravening Gnarloak terrain piece, and kicking an enemy fighter into the maw is extremely satisfying.</p>
<h2>Should I Buy Warcry Briar and Bone?</h2>
<p>If you want either of the warbands and the scenery piece in this set, then this will probably be the only way to get them for a couple of months before their individual release. If the warband's playstyle or aesthetics don't appeal to you, you won't get much out of this. There is an additional game option, Battle Traits included in the rulebook that adds additional abilities for all <em>Warcry</em> warbands, but that won't be enough to justify the cost if you don't want either of the warbands, and should be published in the <em>Warcry Annual</em> at the end of the season.</p>

		<p>Back in June, there was confirmation from Amazon that there was a Like A Dragon Yakuza show coming, with it set to be released on October 24th. During San Diego Comic Con, Amazon dropped the first proper teaser for Like A Dragon Yakuza, showing glimpses of scenes from the show, including the nightlife, fighting, and a unique take on the Millennium Tower,</p>
<p><iframe title="Like A Dragon: Yakuza - Teaser Trailer | Prime Video" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mZkC1sYxzZo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Like A Dragon Yakuza will be an adaptation of the first Yakuza game, which originally released in 2005. It sees Kiryu and his sworn brother Akira Nishikiyama, aka Nishiki, fall on different sides as they both rise through the ranks. Before the teaser, it was announced that Kento Kaku was cast as Nishiki, joining Ryoma Takeuchi who is playing Kiryu Kazama. Masayoshi Yokoyama, Director of RGG Studio also had a message for fans, and his reaction to the show which you can watch below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Like a Dragon: Yakuza - Director of RGG Studio / Executive Producer - SDCC Interview | Prime Video" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9NS-3_Gqr-s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>When the show was originally announced, Amazon said, <em>“The series’ story is set in two time periods, 1995 and 2005, and follows the life, childhood friends and the repercussions of the decisions of a fearsome and peerless Yakuza warrior with a strong sense of justice, duty, and humanity.”</em></p>

<p>Like A Dragon Yakuza will have a total of six episodes, with the first three episodes dropping at the same time on October 24th on Amazon Prime.</p>

			<p>Wizards of the Coast is once again pushing itself toward videogames. President and CEO Chris Cocks openly said as much during the Q&amp;A portion of Hasbro's Q2 2024 earnings call (transcript available <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/07/26/hasbro-has-q2-2024-earnings-call-transcript/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Fool.com</a>), revealing that the studio has hired veteran executive John Hight with the goal to ship one or two games per year starting in late 2025 or early 2026 at the latest, thanks to a yearly investment of around $125 million.</p>
<p><em>John, I think, is a luminary hire. He's had a major hand in a bunch of franchises: Warcraft, Hearthstone, God of War, and even going way back to Command &amp; Conquer. He's worked on some great stuff, which I think is perfectly on point with what Wizards of the Coast is all about and what our digital gaming strategy is all about, which is extending a bunch of great mid-core and hard-core brands and an expertise in designing for those kinds of audiences and helping us digitize what those brands can do. I think between our board moves and with talent that we brought on board, most recently with John, but even before that, studio leaders we have like Ames Kirshen, who was in charge of the Batman: Arkham series; James Ohlen, who was the Head of Creative Design at BioWare, responsible for the first Baldur's Gates, Neverwinter Nights, Mass Effect.</em></p>
<p data-uw-rm-sr=""><em>We're going all in on becoming a digital play company. Roughly, our capital envelope is about $250 million a year. About half of that is going into Digital Games. Our goal is to be shipping one to two new games per year starting as early as late 2025, potentially early 2026. And I think we have a balanced approach to that. When you look at our game, when you look at our portfolio of investments in games, whether they're partnerships or JVs that we're doing are just fully internal investments.</em></p>
<p><em>And then you look at our whole lineup of licensed games, we have 150 projects that are either active in the market or in development. I think it's important for us to have a hand as a publisher to guide our franchises and to work on the areas and the audiences that we think are hyper-important. But I also think it's important for us to work with the best partners in the business and extend those franchises in areas where either we don't have the expertise or we don't have the platform. And I think we've been doing a good job of it.</em></p>
<p><em>It's no accident why I think we're the No. 1 licensor in the space. And I think we're going to be a top publisher eventually in the space, and we're going to take our time and do it right.</em></p>
<p>It's not the first time we <a href="https://wccftech.com/wizards-coast-dd-based-videogames/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heard</a> Cocks talking about a push toward the videogame industry, particularly <a href="https://wccftech.com/wizards-of-the-coast-seven-or-eight-dd-games-are-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for the Dungeons and Dragons franchise</a>. However, last year Wizards of the Coast <a href="https://wccftech.com/wizards-of-the-coast-reportedly-cancels-at-least-5-games-including-2-dd-titles-from-hidden-path-otherside/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">canceled</a> five games, including two D&amp;D projects in development at Hidden Path Entertainment and OtherSide Entertainment.</p>
<p>Given the newly confirmed push, it's safe to guess those projects were axed due to their own problems rather than a change in strategy. Wizards of the Coast currently owns <a href="https://wccftech.com/archetype-entertainment-is-a-new-wizards-of-the-coast-studio-working-on-a-sci-fi-rpg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Archetype Entertainment</a> (which is working on the Mass Effect-like sci-fi RPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/exodus-is-an-epic-sci-fi-rpg-from-bioware-vet-james-ohlen-features-matthew-mcconaughey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Exodus</a>), <a href="https://wccftech.com/wizards-of-the-coast-opens-austin-studio-for-aaa-game-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Skeleton Key</a>, Atomic Arcade (currently working on a triple-A GI Joe game based on the character Snake Eyes), and Invoke Studios, formerly known as <a href="https://wccftech.com/wizards-of-the-coast-acquires-tuque-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tuque</a> and now working on a <a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-and-dragons-aaa-unreal-engine-5-from-dark-alliance-dev-invoke-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new triple-A Dungeons and Dragons game</a> powered by Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>Wizards of the Coast is also <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-franchise-to-continue-as-wizards-of-the-coast-talks-to-many-partners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in talks</a> with various partners to continue the Baldur's Gate franchise following Larian's decision to find its own path elsewhere.</p>

		<p>During San Diego Comic Con, NetherRealm Studios revealed a major new expansion for Mortal Kombat 1, and it is called Khaos Reigns. This new expansion brings a new story to Mortal Kombat 1, expanding on the game’s events with a new threat that threatens the peace of Liu Kang’s reshaped universe. That threat is Titan Havik, who wants to tear down everything and bring anarchy to the realm.</p>

On release, those who have access to Kombat Pack 2 will receive Cyrax, Sektor, and Noob Saibot. The three guest characters, who are yet to receive release dates, are Ghostface from the Scream movies, the T-1000 from Terminator 2, and Conan The Barbarian. Kombat Pack 2 will not be available as a standalone purchase, and those who have Khaos Reigns will get one week early access to the guest characters. Finally, Animality fatalities will be brought back for Mortal Kombat 1, and these will be added as part of a free update for all players. Those who pre-order Khaos Reigns will get bonus costumes, and those are Wedding Scorpion, Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 Sub Zero, Empress Mileena, and Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 Noob Saibot.</p>

<p>In our Mortal Kombat 1 review, Nick said, <em>“Mortal Kombat 1 serves as a love letter to fans of this thirty-one-year-old franchise and as a pseudo-reboot it also has potential appeal to newcomers alike. There’s still room to grow and I’m sure it will just keep getting better, but Mortal Kombat 1 is already definitely worth your time.”</em></p>

<p>It’s not a strange concept whatsoever – footballers are investing in the esports industry all the time. From David Beckham’s ambassadorship of Guild Esports to Sergio Aguero’s foundation of KRU, these top-tier sports personalities are moving more into esports with each passing day. I recently had a sit down with Robert Lewandowski to discuss the synergy between esports and traditional sports, which was enlightening.</p>



<p>Now, according to one of Diogo Jota’s managers, the Liverpool player wants to start a Counter-Strike team, which would assumedly sit under the banner of Luna Galaxy, the superstar player’s established esports organisation.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-next-step">The Next Step</h2>



<p>Diogo Jota’s esports organisation – Luna Galaxy – already has a foothold in various games, such as Rocket League and EA Sports FC, but Counter-Strike 2 could be the player’s next vertical. He was recently spotted at the Esports World Cup attending the grand final in the Counter-Strike 2 tournament between G2 Esports and Natus Vincere. </p>



<p>In a quick chat with one of his managers, it was revealed that while Jota doesn’t play CS2 himself, he wants to field a team in the space.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s not a bad idea – Counter-Strike sits at the top of the esports table and is one of the most consistently popular games in the world. The esports ecosystem around Counter-Strike 2 has tens of millions of dollars pumped into it every year, and it’s one of the most prolific games in the landscape – Jota would undoubtedly enjoy making a foray into the scene.</p>

<p>Fallout: London was released on July 26 to a relatively mixed reception, with the launch of the game-sized mod being marred by instability and constant crashes. I managed to get hands-on with the mega-mod after a lot of work which saw me installing it first for Steam, realising it wouldn’t work, then buying Fallout 4: GOTY on GOG and reinstalling the entire setup. It then worked, but it wasn’t without issues.</p>



<p>Here’s my Fallout: London review and early impressions of the snippets I’ve seen before I was blocked entirely by constant crashes.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-can-t-beat-free">Can’t Beat Free</h2>



<p>Fallout: London is free – unless you’re like me and you need to buy the game on GOG to get it running. The mod is hosted on GOG, it’s downloaded via GOG <strong>exclusively</strong>, and when you do so, you’ll notice that there’s a GOG-themed outfit you can pick up in Fallout: London right off the bat. It’s a bit shady that it runs best on GOG’s version of Fallout 4, but that’s a debate for another day.</p>



<p>I’m (almost) a Londoner – I live around half a mile outside one of the city’s boroughs and regularly dip in to do the tourist thing. I think I’m relatively well-placed to pass judgment on the city represented in Fallout: London, and I’d love to do so, but I managed to explore so little of the city that it’s moot.</p>



<p>From what I did see, I can stress that Fallout: London is deeply authentic in its representation of the United Kingdom. Everything is quintessentially British, from the scenery to the finer details (such as calling an elevator a ‘lift’), and as someone local to London, the minor opportunities I had to explore did reveal to me an environment that felt accurate. I had a glimpse at the top-down map in the game’s ‘Atta-Boy’ device and was surprised at the size and scope of it – it’s <strong>enormous</strong>.</p>



<p>That’s where a lot of my positivity about Fallout: London comes from. It’s hard to believe that something this big is completely free. With 200 quests, 20 factions, an entire city built from the ground up, celebrity voice actors, and a genuinely innovative take on a long-established post-apocalyptic series, Fallout: London feels like a premium game.</p>



<p>It even launched with immense issues – which is typical for an AAA title these days.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-fallout-london-good">Is Fallout: London Good?</h2>



<p>I’m basing this on about 20 minutes of gameplay, but Fallout: London <strong>is </strong>good. I didn’t want to like it because it’s a lore-breaking concept at best, but it has so much potential, that it’s unreal. Let me reel off some of the things that impressed me the most:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>The voice acting is the best I’ve ever heard in a mod</strong> – it’s studio quality</li>



<li><strong>The world-building is phenomenal</strong> – you feel like you’re in a Bethesda-crafted city</li>



<li><strong>The sheer depth of originality is unmatched</strong> – every weapon, creature, character, and even the detritus and base concepts of the game such as perks and skills are original</li>



<li><strong>The scope of this mod is awe-inspiring</strong> – the size of the map, the depth of the story, and the sheer number of people involved in its creation are all mind-boggling</li>
</ul>



<p>Fallout: London incorporates elements of other mods and is inspired by other successful creations brought about by the Fallout community. Some base elements are such subtle improvements to the overall Fallout 4 experience, it’s nuts. For instance, the movement mechanics – you don’t just break into a straight sprint, but a run turns into a sprint over a few seconds, giving you the impression of your character having inertia applied to them.</p>



<p>I’m genuinely quite heartbroken that Fallout: London appears to be unplayable for many people. It’s being hit hard on social media and in reviews because it’s so difficult to get it running. The installation process is far from being simple, and it looks as though you need to buy the game on GOG to get anywhere with it. I managed to get 20 – 25 minutes into the game before a string of crash loops made it <strong>impossible </strong>to progress.</p>



<p>I sincerely hope the FOLON team can patch some of these issues up, as the minute they do, I’ll be neck-deep in Fallout: London.</p>

<p>Adin Ross was banned on Twitch more than a year ago, and it was months after that we learned why. During a ‘multistream’, he had a chat window open on his Twitch stream taken from <strong>Kick</strong>, and in that chat window, multiple slurs and insults were displayed. This earned him a permanent ban, and to this day, the idea of him resurfacing on Twitch hasn’t really been considered. </p>



<p>Now, Twitch’s CEO, Dan Clancy, has revealed that a sit-down with Adin Ross and a genuine chat could result in the controversial creator being reinstated on the platform.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-changed">Changed</h2>



<p>Following a lengthy break from streaming, Adin Ross recently returned to the scene to stress that he was ‘changed’ and that he didn’t want to spend his time aggravating people on stream or falling in and out of scandalous situations. Instead, he revealed that he wanted to partner with other creators and make genuinely interesting and innovative content to ‘fix’ his image.</p>



<p>It seems that this promise has piqued the interest of Dan Clancy, the CEO of Twitch who recently engaged in a phone call with FaZe Ronaldo, stressing his openness to gauging Adin Ross’ new mentality for himself:</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>FaZe Ronaldo called the Twitch CEO Dan Clancy to ask him to unban Adin Ross</p><p>“I’m open to chatting with him… to see if he can convince me that he really is different” <a href="https://t.co/4babRVqBhv">pic.twitter.com/4babRVqBhv</a></p></div>— Jake Lucky (@JakeSucky) <a href="https://twitter.com/JakeSucky/status/1816675536195793223?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 26, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>It wouldn’t be the first time that Clancy has been instrumental in reversing a permanent ban. Some will likely never get the opportunity to return to the platform, like the recently disgraced Dr Disrespect, but the door is now open ever so slightly wider for Adin Ross. Given that for a time he was Kick’s flagship creator, how will the Stake-backed streaming site react to Clancy’s interest in bringing Ross back to Twitch?</p>

<p>Activision has just published a document online titled ‘Matchmaking Series: The Role of Skill in Matchmaking’, which blows the lid off SBMM, the much-debated mechanic that’s designed to keep players engaged in Call of Duty for as long as possible. This expansive, revealing document spends 25 pages breaking down the concept of ‘skill’ in the overarching SBMM model, with Activision’s teams confirming <strong>what skills </strong>are examined by the mechanic.</p>



<p>Oh, and they also revealed a secret experiment that took place to see how players performed with massively lowered levels of SBMM.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-everything-is-revealed">Everything is Revealed</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://www.activision.com/cdn/research/CallofDuty_Matchmaking_Series_2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the sizeable document published by Activision</a>, one of the biggest contributors to ‘Skill-Based Matchmaking’ is discussed: <strong><em>Skill</em></strong><em>.</em></p>



<p>The opening pages of the document revealed that ‘skill’ is calculated using three criteria:</p>



<ul>
<li>Match Total Kills</li>



<li>Kill / Death Ratio</li>



<li>Kills / Deaths by Enemy</li>
</ul>



<p>That last one is clever, as it enables Activision to give you an accurate skill reading regardless of ‘self-killing’ deaths. That means that players can’t ‘break’ SBMM by repeatedly killing themselves to drop their K/D artificially. The team went in-depth about the various tests they’ve performed over the years to continually refine SBMM. </p>



<p>In 2024, Activision performed a secret experiment on Modern Warfare 3, dropping the skill metrics from SBMM for thousands of players to see how it panned out. The test was run for an entire month, during which players would have been matched more ‘randomly’ against competitors. In a report discussing the findings of this experiment, Activision noted that with reduced skill considerations in the SBMM mechanics, 90% of players suffered from a reduced ‘returning player rate’.</p>



<p>Put simply, when lobbies were more randomised and skill wasn’t taken into consideration, players quickly abandoned the game and took long to return. Further, the team tracked an increase in ‘quit rate’ in 80% of all players taking part in the secret test, which is a huge figure. It proves that players get increasingly frustrated when SBMM <strong>isn’t </strong>as strong as it should be.</p>



<p>Again, Activision pointed out that the first thing the matchmaking process looks for is geolocation, matching players with other gamers that are close to them geographically. Then, the system considers skill, using a player’s percentile rating to match them with closely aligned users. Then, the players’ desired control schemes are considered. </p>



<p>There was an interesting scenario outlined by the team that shows how matchmaking works when you queue with a talented player:</p>



<p><em>‘Take for instance a party of two players, Alice and Bob, Bob is an average player with 50% skill percentile and Alice is an elite player with 99% skill percentile. If we matchmake them with Bob’s skill, Alice is practically guaranteed to be the best player in every lobby they join, more so than if she played solo. If we matchmake on Alice’s skill, then Bob will likely be the worst player in every lobby they join. Thus, we must match them in the middle such that the worst player gets some opponents of equal footing while minimizing the inherent advantage of the better player.’</em></p>



<p>Ultimately, this is the deepest dive we’ve ever had into how SBMM works. While it’s understandably being tweaked all the time, the fundamentals have remained the same for years. It’s nothing short of interesting for Call of Duty fans and pro players.</p>

<p>It seems like every day there is a new esports tournament being announced with a massive prize pool and various games being showcased. Many of these tournaments would never exist if not for some of the biggest events in esports that still stand at the top of the industry each year. There is a staggering list of the best esports events that make up the core following of the wider industry – they’re the shining gems that glow amid thousands of annual competitions.</p>



<p>To that end, here is a list of some of the top esports tournaments in the business today.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-top-esports-tournaments">The Top Esports Tournaments</h2>



<p>Some of the best esports tournaments are being run yearly, making them incredibly popular. With increasing popularity, it seems as if a large majority of these tournaments will continue every year, as there is no shortage of funding.  From fighting games to first-person shooters, many of these tournaments focus on one title, while others mix a variety of games for a massive weekend of events.</p>



<p>Some of the biggest esport events even hold multiple tournaments a year, giving viewers and players a chance to participate at least once.</p>



<p>Here are some of the best and biggest tournaments in esports.</p>







<figure></figure>







<p>Being one of the world’s largest MOBAs, League of Legends is deserving of its World Championship that is held each year. In fact, in 2023, the League of Legends World Championship broke records as the most-viewed esports tournament of all time.</p>



<p>The game continues to keep itself at the top with one of the biggest viewer bases on Twitch and millions of dollars on the line each year during the World Championship.</p>



<p>For casual players, the game continues to keep itself in the spotlight, which has helped push its esports events to the top.</p>



<h2 id="h-dreamhack">DreamHack</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>DreamHack has been around for years now, as this massive convention is a stronghold within the esports world. With some of the best esports events taking place at DreamHack, many fans from around the world travel to attend.</p>



<p>The best part about DreamHack? It has multiple events a year. Not only that, but the convention showcases multiple games. From Fortnite tournaments to Rocket League tournaments to Super Smash Bros. tournaments, DreamHack has it all. </p>



<p>It’s a relatively cheap event to attend and happens in multiple cities around the world, giving everyone a chance to travel to it. Some of the tournaments also feature prize pools that sit around a quarter million dollars.</p>



<p>DreamHack has everything a gamer could need, from large tournaments to free-to-play small ones, making it one of the best esports events in the world.</p>







<h2 id="h-fortnite-globals">Fortnite Globals</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Following the success of the Fortnite World Cup back in 2019, Fortnite officially launched Fortnite Globals. This large esports tournament happens once a year in the fall, as many big online tournaments are held throughout the year leading up to it.</p>



<p>Those who qualify in one of the three FNCS (Fortnite Championship Series) that are held throughout the year will be flown to wherever Fortnite Globals is held. The tournament only features 200 players (100 duos) and usually has a prize pool of a couple of million dollars.</p>



<p>With a massive fan base, competitive Fortnite continues to grow as more and more people have been attending these large events. The event usually brings out multiple creators too, such as SypherPK, Sommerset and more, to help push popularity.</p>



<p>Fortnite Globals still stands to be one of the most valuable esports tournaments, as many Battle Royales struggle to gain the traction that Fortnite has.</p>







<figure></figure>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-games-announces-mortal-kombat-1-khaos-reigns/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Warner Bros. Games announced that Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns, a new expansion, will be released. A new Kombat Pack, adding six new characters to the game, will launch alongside the expansion. The expansion will be released digitally on September 24 at 8 AM PDT / 10 AM CDT / 11 AM EDT / 4 PM BST for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation, and PC.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PF7nFD80g3M" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new expansion</a> adds a new cinematic narrative to the pre-existing story mode. After ridding of the invaders who endangered Fire God Liu Kang's New Era of Peace, a new threat arrives in their place from an alternate timeline. The invaders are led by Titan Havik, who aims to bring the realm to its knees, prompting Liu Kang to rally his army once more to defeat the danger.</p>
<p>With the addition of Kombat Pack 2, returning combatants such as Noob Saibot, Cyrax, and Sektor will be joining the fray. In addition to the three returning fighters, guest fighters such as Ghostface, T-1000 (Terminator), and Conan the Barbarian are making their debut appearance in Mortal Kombat 1.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, those who aren't interested in the story mode but want to get their hands on Kombat Pack 2 will have to purchase the entire Khaos Reigns expansion, as Kombat Pack 2 is not being sold as a standalone bundle. Khaos Reigns will cost $49.99 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and $39.99 for those who play the game on Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>For those who already own <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mortal-kombat-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mortal Kombat 1</a>, the fan-favorite feature of Animalities will return as a free content update for all game owners. This feature allows characters to morph into their spirit animal to decimate their defeated opponents. Animalities can be performed by all playable fighters and will be available on September 24 in conjunction with the expansion release.</p>
<p>In addition to these new add-ons, all owners of Mortal Kombat 1 will receive a free MK 95 Scorpion character skin inspired by the original Mortal Kombat movie, which will be available in-game today.</p>
<p>For those eager to get their hands on the expansion, you can pre-order it on all platforms as of today. The expansion will include both the Khaos Reigns expansion and the Kombat Pack 2. All pre-orders will receive four new character skins at launch, which include Wedding Scorpion, Empress Mileena, and Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 versions of Sub-Zero and Noob Saibot.</p>
<p>Ghostface, T-1000, and Conan the Barbarian will be released post-launch, with a one-week early access period provided to those who own the Khaos Reigns expansion.</p>
<p>If you are someone who doesn't yet own the game, you can additionally pre-order the Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns Bundle on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC for $59.99 and Nintendo Switch for $49.99, which will grant you immediate access to the previous Kombat Pack. Additionally, for any new Mortal Kombat 1 players, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/mortal-kombat-1-trailer-reveals-dlc-fighter-takeda-takahashi/">first Kombat Pack</a> is now available as part of the Mortal Kombat 1 Premium Edition, or you can purchase it separately.</p>

It unfolds after the events of the story campaign and centers on the invasion of Titan Havik from an alternate reality, who seeks to spread anarchy across all timelines.</p>

<p>The expansion's cinematic story introduces new playable characters, Noob Saibot and the now female Sektor and Cyrax. These three fighters make up half of Kombat Pack 2 and will be available when the DLC launches on September 24.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In keeping with the tradition of prior games, the second half of Kombat Pack 2 features guest fighters from various films. <em>Scream</em>’s Ghostface, <em>Terminator 2</em>’s T-1000, and Conan the Barbarian are on the way, but there’s no release window for their arrival. Kombat Pack 2 comes included with Khaos Reigns and cannot be purchased as a standalone character bundle.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PF7nFD80g3M" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Animalities are making their return as a free content update upon Khaos Reigns’ release. First introduced in Mortal Kombat 3, these beastial finishing moves see fighters morph into animals to eviscerate opponents. The trailer reveals Mileena can turn into a giant, horrifying praying mantis, for example, and a press release states every playable fighter will have an Animality (which would include the movie-born guest fighters for an interesting thought).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Speaking of free content, today, owners will receive the MK95 Scorpion skin modeled after his appearance in the live-action 1995 Mortal Kombat film.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Khaos Reigns launches digitally on September 24 for all platforms MK1 is available on. It will run for $49.99 on every platform except for Switch, where it costs $39.99.

Alongside gameplay we have first-look images of each DLC fighter joining the Mortal Kombat 1 roster. The DLC, titled Khaos Reigns, includes the three aforementioned movie representatives, as well as Noob Saibot, Sektor, and Cyrax. It launches digitally on September 24 across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC (Steam and Epic Games Store).</p><p>Like many characters in the alternate universe that is Mortal Kombat 1, Noob Saibot, voiced by Kaiji Tang, sports a new look. It’s Sektor and Cyrax who get the biggest changes, though, as NetherRealm has revealed that both characters are female in this universe. Sektor voice actor Erika Ishii also says that their character is not a robot like in past entries and is instead human this time around. Cyrax is voiced by Enuka Okuma.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Here's the Khaos Reigns story setup, per publisher Warner Bros. Games:</p><blockquote>After repelling the invaders who endangered Fire God Liu Kang’s New Era of peace, Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns expands the story campaign with an all-new cinematic narrative. When a perilous threat arrives from an alternate timeline, led by the ruthless Titan Havik whose sole mission is to throw the realms into khaos, Liu Kang must rally his champions and put faith in his enemies to defeat this grave danger. If they fail, the New Era will be reduced to anarchy.</blockquote><blockquote>Adding to the growing roster of playable fighters, Kombat Pack 2 features returning kombatants Noob Saibot, voiced by Kaiji Tang; Cyrax, voiced by Enuka Okuma; and Sektor, voiced by Erika Ishii, all with unique backstories as part of the reimagined Mortal Kombat 1 Universe. As Sub-Zero, Bi-Han was the Lin Kuei’s ruthless Grandmaster, but his soul was stolen by Titan Havik to create the perfect henchman, Noob Saibot, who is now dedicated to fomenting anarchy. Born into the Zaki, one of the Lin Kuei's many sub-clans, Cyrax became a martial arts prodigy with an independent streak and untamed desire to serve the clan on her terms, or not at all. Growing up immersed in Lin Kuei culture under the tutelage of her parents, Sektor becomes a master armorer, skilled warrior, and Sub-Zero’s most trusted lieutenant, committed to advancing the clan’s future at all costs.</blockquote><p>Ghostface is one character who keeps nearly the same look across each movie they appear in, so it's no surprise to see them show up here with few changes. Terminators, on the other hand, come in many shapes and sizes, with NetherRealm using Arnold Schwarzenegger's take on the character for DLC in Mortal Kombat 11. Patrick provided voice work and his likeness for Khaos Reigns, while Conan brings back Schwarzenegger's appearance for another round, too.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/26/kombat-pack-2-1722031394032.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Mortal Kombat 1 Kombat Pack 2 roster.</figcaption></figure></output><p>It's currently unclear when each of Mortal Kombat 1's Kombat Pack 2 fighters will be released. It's also unclear when more gameplay will be released or how NetherRealm has chosen to tackle each of their innevitably gory Fatalities.</p><p>Unfortunately, every character in the Khaos Reigns Kombat Pack 2 was known a month ahead of today's SDCC reveal thanks to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-dataminer-unearths-what-looks-like-the-next-6-dlc-characters">a datamine leak</a>. Still, the official announcement brings fresh looks at how these characters will be portrayed, with NetherRealm also confirming that longtime Scream actor, Roger L. Jackson, voices Ghostface. Arnold Schwarzenegger does not provide voice work for Conan.</p><p>Mortal Kombat 1 Kombat Pack 2 continues the studio's trend of bringing crossover characters into the fold. In addition to a host of other classic fighters, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-homelander-peacemaker">Kombat Pack 1</a> introduced a few not-so-super comic book characters, including Homelander from The Boys and Omni-Man from Invincible. SDCC is still underway, so be sure to keep up with all of the announcements <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/san-diego-comic-con-2024-everything-announced">here</a>.</p><p><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.
