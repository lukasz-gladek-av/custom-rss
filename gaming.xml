<p>One of the most asked-for changes to Call of Duty Warzone arrives with Season 03, which drops tomorrow, April 2. In this long-awaited update, console-based Warzone players will <strong>finally </strong>be able to switch off crossplay functionality in regular multiplayer matchmaking.</p>



<p>That means that they can remove any chance of connecting with PC players, which eradicates a fair portion of the user base that engages in nefarious practices like <strong>cheating</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-long-time-coming">Long Time Coming</h2>



<p>In a recent <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/03/call-of-duty-bo6-warzone-season-03-patch-notes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> breaking down the Season 03 patch notes, it was confirmed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In Season 03, we’re giving console players more granular options by separating the MP Ranked Play and Call of Duty: Warzone Ranked Play settings and adding a new Multiplayer-only setting for Quickplay, Featured, and Party Games matches.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This means that console players will be able to <strong>switch off crossplay in Warzone </strong>for regular multiplayer matches.</p>



<h3 id="h-how-to-turn-off-crossplay-in-warzone">How to Turn Off Crossplay in Warzone</h3>



<p>To switch off crossplay in Warzone on console, you’ll need to navigate to the network settings menu and select ‘Cross-Play Off’. This will lock your selection unless the following happens:</p>



<ul>
<li>If you play with a mixed-platform party, your settings will be temporarily adjusted to ‘Cross-Play On’</li>



<li>If you play with at least <strong>one </strong>PC player, your settings will be temporarily adjusted to ‘Cross-Play On’</li>
</ul>



<p>Once your party returns to a single platform, your settings will automatically update to reflect your original choice.</p>



<p>Activision has warned that locking your matchmaking mechanics to a single platform might negatively impact your queue times, but that’s a small price to pay for feeling a little safer while playing Warzone on console.</p>



<h3 id="h-when-does-the-new-warzone-map-come-out">When Does The New Warzone Map Come Out?</h3>



<p>If you’re eager to switch off crossplay and dive into Verdansk, the new Warzone map, you don’t have long to wait. It’ll drop in Call of Duty: Warzone on April 3 at 9 am PST / 5 pm BST.</p>



<p>It has been several years since Verdansk was last in Warzone, and it’s expected to be a resurgence of sorts (no pun intended) for the popular battle royale map.</p>



<p>Let me know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a> how much of a W this crossplay decision is.</p>

<p>It was recently discovered that one of the most popular Warzone emotes is returning with the Season 03 update. It’ll be tucked into the battle pass, so you’re guaranteed to unlock it if you play enough. If you were around during the peak of Warzone when Verdansk first existed, you’ll recognise how humorous this emote can be.</p>



<p>That’s right – <strong>the middle finger emote is coming back to Warzone</strong>.</p>



<p>But there’s a catch.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-crank-job">Crank Job</h2>



<p>The ‘Crank Job’ middle finger emote was a fan-favourite when it first emerged in Warzone. It allowed players to rebel against their opponents one last time as they lay bleeding out on the floor. It was great fun when fused with killcams, which is why it rapidly became one of the most popular emotes in the game.</p>



<p>It was recently revealed that the middle finger emote will return to Warzone in the Season 03 battle pass.</p>



<p>There’s a catch, unfortunately. </p>



<p>It has been mentioned that it’s a third-person variant of the Crank Job emote, which might eradicate any sense of whimsy attached to popping it once you’ve downed an enemy. I’m willing to hold out hope that it’ll be as funny as ever, but the third-person aspect might have ruined it a bit.</p>



<p>Here’s what everyone’s favourite Warzone emote used to look like:</p>



<div><article><p><span>A 3rd Person Version of the ‘Middle Finger’ Emote is RETURNING in the </span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackOps6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#BlackOps6</a><span> Warzone Season 3 Battlepass 😭 </span></p></article></div>







<p>There will be plenty more to unlock in the Season 03 battle pass in Black Ops 6 and Warzone, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/r0-z3-skin-call-of-duty-controversial-paywall/">a new Roze skin</a>, the AMAX, and the HDR sniper rifle.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/coyote-vs-acme-fuck-david-zaslav<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last week<a href="https://www.thewrap.com/coyote-vs-acme-update-offers-warner-bros/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> an excellent report on The Wrap revealed that</a>, despite initially walking back its decision, Warner Bros. is indeed intent on throwing <em>Coyote vs Acme</em>--a funded, shot and completed motion picture--in the trash. Not because it sucks, but to save some money on taxes.</p><p>It's not the first time this has happened recently--"content" ranging<a href="https://gizmodo.com/disney-streaming-cuts-tax-writeoffs-1850502594" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> from Disney TV shows</a> to a <em>Batgirl </em>movie has met with the same fate--but this one stung a little more. Disney and HBO removing TV shows that people had already had a chance to see was one thing, and <em>Batgirl</em><a href="https://www.nme.com/en_au/news/film/batgirl-movie-so-bad-not-releasable-says-dc-studios-3390857#:~:text='Batgirl'%20movie%20was%20so%20bad%20it%20was%20%E2%80%9Cnot,releasable%E2%80%9D%2C%20says%20DC%20Studios%20boss&amp;text=Leslie%20Grace%20as%20'Batgirl'%20CREDIT,Grace%2C%20Brandon%20Fraser%20and%20J.K." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em> </em>was reportedly also very bad</a>, which was another.</p><p>But <em>Coyote vs Acme</em> has been seen by <em>nobody</em>. The movie--directed by Dave Green, written by <em>May December's</em> Samy Burch, produced by (among others) James Gunn and starring characters that define Warner Bros.' entire existence--was paid for, is finished, is ready to be seen, and now it stands a very real chance of being deleted forever, just to save a company some money.</p><p>It's an incredibly dystopian situation we all find ourselves in, where art is only made to be fed into a woodchipper to serve shareholders, and it's one<a href="https://www.looper.com/1161829/hollywood-creatives-are-breathing-fire-over-the-current-trend-of-tv-tax-write-offs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> that's been covered extensively elsewhere</a>, so I'm not going to get into the reeds over the politics and economics of the decision here.</p><p>What I am going to say, though, is that if you work at Warner Bros., or anywhere related to Warner Bros., and you have any access to this movie whatsoever, it's your moral imperative to leak it to the world before it's too late. If Warner Bros. don't want to release it, and have reportedly blocked attempts for other companies to release it, then what does it matter?</p><p>(<strong>Please note</strong>: I am not a lawyer or law enforcement officer and this does not constitute actual advice).</p><p>As we <em>have </em>covered previously,<a href="https://aftermath.site/there-is-no-piracy-without-ownership" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> there is no piracy without ownership</a>. If we can't buy or rent the thing, and likely never will be able to do so via legal means, then leaking this movie and putting it on torrent sites shouldn't be seen as stealing, either. By all accounts Warner CEO David Zaslav is happy throwing this movie in the bin, without selling a single theatre ticket or digital rental, so whether we get to see it for free or not doesn't move that financial needle one bit.</p><p>What leaking the movie <em>would </em>do is save a piece of art that hundreds of people poured their hearts and souls into for months or even <em>years</em>. That shouldn't be a crime. That's public service.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>UPDATE 9:45pm ET, March 31, 2025</strong>: <em>Stand down everyone.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/counter-strike-2-3-31-update-new-armory-weekly-care-package-skins-and-a-bigger-banana/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It’s no April Fool’s Day joke: Valve has dropped their latest Counter-Strike 2 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/730/view/529842339955343453" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">update</a> on March 31st, featuring a handful of new weapon skins and a “clean up” Inferno and Train. It’s no brand new operation, but it’s a pretty sizable update to CS2 compared to others.</p>



<h2 id="h-counter-strike-2-march-31st-update-new-changes">Counter-Strike 2 March 31st Update – New Changes</h2>



<p>The CS2 weekly care package feature now includes three new weapon collections added to the drop list: Ascent, Boreal, and Radiant. The new collections have added “over 70 new [weapon] finishes,” featuring a wide variety of styles. It doesn’t appear that players will get to choose which weapon collection their weekly care package skin comes from, but it does increase the variety of skins that appear.</p>



<p>New skins aren’t exclusive to just the weekly care package for this update. A new case and a new weapon skin collection have been added to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cs2-the-armory-update-charms-battle-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Armory</a>. Players can acquire the Fever case from the Armory page for two credits. By purchasing a Fever case key, players can open their case for a chance at the AWP Printstream or get extremely lucky and open one of several Shattered Web knives in Chroma finishes. Players can also spend four Armory credits to get one random skin from the new Train collection. The “limited edition” item has also been swapped out, and players can save 15 credits for one of the XM1014 Solitude variants. This items will be removed from the Armory on Sunday, July 13.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As for gameplay changes, Inferno and Train and have been hit with some “spring cleaning.” Both maps now feature some “cleaner surfaces, less clutter,” and a noticeably wider Banana section (B Main area) on Inferno specifically.</p>



<p>Any new skins in particular catch your eye? Let us know which one is your favorite in the comments or on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

According to the post, the layoffs are due to the fact that the company has completed one of its "mandates," and presumably has no other work to reassign the employees to.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>"Today, we informed our studio staff that we are going to let go up to 75 valuable members, as one of our mandates is coming to an end," the statement reads. "It is not a reflection of their dedication or skills, but unfortunately, we don’t have the capacity to entirely reallocate them to our other ongoing projects and services.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>"These very talented, highly experienced experts are going to enter the employment market, and we are working to support them through this transition."</span></span></p>

</a>





<p>Fable, set for release in 2026.</p>

</article><p><span><span>The statement goes on to mention that, despite laying off people related to that former, unnamed mandate, "Eidos-Montréal stays committed to deliver its other projects currently in development." The only public project the developer is currently working on is Fable, which it's assisting the main team at Playground on, but it's unclear whether that's a project Eidos-Montréal will continue to work on or the mandate it recently completed.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Over the past few years, layoffs have decimated the gaming workforce, affecting tens of thousands of people. The last news story posted on </span></span><span><span>Game Informer</span></span><span><span> before our closure last year was about </span></span><a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/07/31/bungie-lays-off-over-200-employees-announces-plans-for-deeper-integration-with-sony"><span><span><span><span>200 people losing their jobs at Bungie</span></span></span></span></a><span><span>. On the other hand, one of the first stories written upon our return was about </span></span><a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/03/24/united-videogame-workers-cwa-is-the-first-industry-wide-video-game-union"><span><span><span><span>the creation of a gaming industry-wide union</span></span></span></span></a><span><span>.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>As always, the hearts of </span></span><span><span>Game Informer's </span></span><span><span>staff are with those affected by these layoffs, as well as those still at the studio.</span></span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/03/31/take-two-ceo-on-gta-6-release-date-we-want-to-maintain-the-anticipation-and-the<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>In a video interview with <em>Bloomberg</em> last Friday, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick discussed, among other topics, <a href="https://gameinformer.dev.anyforsoft.com/news/2023/12/04/grand-theft-auto-vi-revealed-with-first-official-trailer-alongside-2025-release">Grand Theft Auto VI</a>. Although he, unsurprisingly, doesn’t spill the beans on the release date, Zelnick provided some insight into Take-Two and Rockstar’s reasoning for keeping fans waiting.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the end of the interview, Zelnick was asked the million-dollar question: when is GTA VI launching and why is Take-Two/Rockstar keeping it such a big secret? Zelnick responded:</p>

<p>“The anticipation for that title may be the greatest anticipation I’ve ever seen for an entertainment property. And I’ve been around the block a few times, and I’ve been in every entertainment business there is. We want to maintain the anticipation and the excitement. And we do have competitors who will describe their release schedule for years in advance, and we’ve found that the better thing to do is to provide marketing materials relatively close to the release window in order to create that excitement, on the one hand, and balance the excitement on that anticipation. And we don’t always get it exactly right, but that’s what we’re trying to do.”</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0M53-LKlECk" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Earlier in the interview, Zelnick was asked to explain the 12-year wait between GTA V, released in 2013, and GTA VI, providing additional context for Rockstar’s release cadence:</p>

<p>“Well, there are really two reasons,” says Zelnick. “We set an intention to rest our intellectual properties. So some of our competitors come to market very regularly, maybe even annually, with their titles. We only annualize our sports entertainment titles. For our non-sports titles, we think you need to create enormous anticipation, on the one hand. And of course on the other hand, it takes a long time to develop these big robust experiences.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rockstar Games seeks perfection in what they do, and perfection’s a pretty high bar. It takes a long time. And the reflection of that approach is in the success of Grand Theft Auto V, which has actually excelled in three console generations, which is extraordinary…so think of the high bar that that creates for us, of course, but much more so for the consumer.”</p>

</article><p>Grand Theft Auto VI was announced in December 2023. Set in a modern-day Vice City (which is modeled after Miami and South Florida), it appears to star two protagonists, including the series' first female lead, although Rockstar has not yet divulged details on these characters or their relationship with each other. The reveal trailer became a massive success, <a href="https://gameinformer.dev.anyforsoft.com/news/2023/12/06/grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer-surpasses-100-million-views-breaks-record-for-most">garnering over 100 million views</a> in just a few days and setting a YouTube record for most views within a 24-hour period.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Grand Theft Auto VI is slated to release sometime this year on consoles. A PC version has yet to be confirmed, though if it does launch on the platform, it will <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-unconcerned-by-plummeting-ps5-and-xbox-sales-insists-gta-6-will-cause-a-meaningful-uptick-in-console-sales-in-2025?utm_source=threads,twitter">likely arrive later</a>.

            <p>
Eidos-Montréal, the Embracer-owned studio currently providing support on Microsoft's Fable reboot, is laying off "up to" 75 members of staff, saying it doesn't "have the capacity to entirely reallocate them to our other ongoing projects and services."
</p>
<p>
News of the layoffs - which follows 97 job cuts at Eidos-Montréal last year - was confirmed in a <a href="https://x.com/EidosMontreal/status/1906728993061020142">statement shared on social media</a>. "Today, we informed our studio staff that we are going to let go up to 75 valuable members," the studio wrote, "as one of our mandates is coming to an end. It is not a reflection of their dedication or skills, but unfortunately, we don't have the capacity to entirely reallocate them to our other ongoing projects and services.
</p>
<p>
"These very talented, highly experienced experts are going to enter the employment market," the statement continued, "and we are working to support them through this transition. Eidos-Montréal stays committed to deliver its other projects currently in development."
</p>
<p>
Eidos-Montréal's most recent game, Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy, released in 2021 when the studio was still owned by publisher <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>. Following its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-sells-off-western-studios-and-ip-including-tomb-raider-and-deus-ex">purchase by Embracer Group in 2022</a>, however, it was reportedly set to work creating a new game in the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deus-ex">Deus Ex</a> series - a project that was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-cancels-deus-ex-game-in-development-for-two-years">canned last year amid a devastating programme of "restructuring" and cost cutting at Embracer Group</a> that resulted in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-the-human-cost-of-embracers-restructuring-programme">over 4500 job losses across the company</a>.
</p>
<p>
Since then, it's been confirmed Eidos-Montréal is assisting Microsoft's Playground Games as the Xbox studio attempts to get its long-awaited - and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xboxs-fable-reboot-delayed-into-next-year">recently delayed</a> - Fable reboot over the finish line. Today's statement suggests Fable isn't Eidos-Montréal's only project, but it's unclear what else the studio may be working on at present.
</p>
<p>
Layoffs have continued to blight the games industry in 2025 following an already devastating few years which have seen over 25,000 employees lose their jobs since the start of 2023. So far this year, <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2025">1200 layoffs have been recorded</a>, affecting workers across the likes of Unity, PlayStation, Ubisoft, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/warner-bros-games">Warner Bros. Games</a>, Sumo Digital, Splash Damage, Bossa Studios, Night School, and Cyan, Inc. Results of a GDC State of the Games Industry survey shared earlier this year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gdcs-state-of-the-games-industry-survey-says-one-in-ten-respondents-laid-off-in-2024">revealed one in 10 of the 3000 developers canvassed were laid off in 2024</a>.

                <p>ROG has released a brand new teaser trailer for a seemingly new handheld device that it's working on. Though this announcement is exciting as is, the official Xbox X account offered a cheeky response to the trailer, fueling rumors that a collaboration between the two companies could be in the works.</p><p>Originally shown on Twitter, ROG's trailer shows a the company's mascot, Omni, messing with some sort of technological chamber. When it goes inside, the machine's shaking causes a ROG Ally and a controller to fly into the chamber with it. Unable to stop the process, Omni then emerges from the chamber, merged with the handheld and controller, hinting at some sort of new handheld in production.</p><p>Xbox then <a href="https://x.com/Xbox/status/1906769447341510708" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">responded to the trailer with a meme,</a> seemingly confirming that it's involved somehow.</p><p>There have been reports of an Xbox handheld in the works, and that Microsoft would be working with third-party vendors in order to make them. This initiative is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-branded-handheld-planned-for-later-this-year-report/1100-6530020/" data-ref-id="1100-6530020">reportedly called Project Kennan,</a> could very well be the same handheld device ROG is teasing in its latest trailer.</p><p>In other Xbox news, Microsoft is also reportedly developing its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-xbox-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6525379/" data-ref-id="1100-6525379">next generation console already</a>. According to current rumors, the system will reportedly be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-xbox-might-not-be-a-traditional-console-may-launch-in-2027-per-insider/1100-6529996/" data-ref-id="1100-6529996">more like a PC than a traditional console</a> and is scheduled for a 2027 launch. It's also possible that this handheld could be a stepping stone to see if Microsoft could create a first-party handheld for the next Xbox like Valve with the Steam Deck or Sony with the PlayStation Portal.</p>

One of the biggest changes in Season 3 of Black Ops 6 is the option for console players to turn off cross-play in standard game modes.</p><p dir="ltr">It's no secret that Call of Duty has struggled with cheaters. With the launch of Season 3 and return of Verdansk, Activision is looking to crack down on cheaters and provide a hacker-free experience for players. Part of this change will finally give console players the ability to turn off cross-play in standard Black Ops 6 multiplayer matches, as this feature was previously only available to disable in Ranked Play mode.</p>

            <p>
Following recent claims Microsoft's much-rumoured handheld Xbox will arrive later this year in collaboration with an unspecified "PC gaming OEM", hardware manufacturer ASUS has shared a teaser trailer suggesting the machine is real and set to be revealed soon.
</p>
<p>
Word that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-next-gen-console-reportedly-targeting-2027-with-handheld-device-due-this-year">Microsoft was partnering with a third-party company to release an Xbox-branded handheld this year</a> first surfaced via Windows Central, which reported the device was being developed under the codename Keenan and would look "unmistakably 'Xbox'", sporting familiar design sensibilities and even an Xbox guide button.
</p>
<p>
Skip ahead a couple of weeks and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXzXhezpSF4">ASUS has now shared a teaser</a> for what appears to be its next-generation ASUS ROG Ally gaming handheld - a video that doesn't perhaps <em>immediately</em> scream Xbox with its magenta hues and weird dabbing robot. However, at one point during its brisk runtime, a ROG Ally and Xbox-style controller are seen hurtling through the air before disappearing into a machine where some sort of fusing process unfolds.

<p>
The inference is clear enough, but Microsoft's involvement in the project was seemingly all but confirmed when Xbox's official social media account <a href="https://x.com/Xbox/status/1906769447341510708">replied to ASUS' teaser post</a> with the side-eye monkey meme. Obviously, all this stays in the 'speculation' bucket until either party is ready to go beyond memes and teases, but the pieces are undoubtedly starting to fall into place.
</p>
<p>
According to Windows Central's previous report, this year's Xbox-branded handheld will be something of a stop gap while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phil-spencer-says-no-red-lines-over-any-xbox-game-coming-to-nintendo-or-playstation">Microsoft continues developing its own Xbox gaming handheld</a> internally. The company's said to be targeting a 2027 launch for this other machine, which will reportedly arrive alongside an Xbox Series X/S successor and "several new controller options".
</p>
<p>
However things pan out, it's a pretty exciting time in the world of handheld gaming - not least because <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-reportedly-prepping-playstation-5-portable-plans-to-battle-nintendos-handheld-dominance">Sony is reportedly also working on its own handheld device</a> in the form of portable PS5, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Nintendo's hugely anticipated Switch 2 is just days away from its big reveal</a>.

At the moment I’m just trying to stay focused and get patches out ASAP. Also looking forward to getting started on content updates as soon as all major bugs are patched.” </p><p>When asked about porting the game to consoles, Tyler seemed interested but wasn’t sure if Microsoft and Sony would allow the game on their digital stores. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/3164500/Schedule_I/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3164500/Schedule_I/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reviews for <em>Schedule I</em></a></span> are extremely positive and most players seem happy with the content available at launch and are excited for the game to expand via promised updates that will arrive over the next few weeks and months. </p><p>In a time when massive games developed by hundreds of people and costing <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/concord-shutting-down-closing-servers-refunds-ps5-1851638566?_gl=1*1ssvoho*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MzQ0MDQ0NC4yNzguMS4xNzQzNDU1NDA0LjE2LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/concord-shutting-down-closing-servers-refunds-ps5-1851638566?_gl=1*1ssvoho*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MzQ0MDQ0NC4yNzguMS4xNzQzNDU1NDA0LjE2LjAuMA..">tens of millions of dollars (or more) are flopping</a></span>, its nice to see something succeeding and proving that you don’t need hyper-realistic graphics or live-service features to succeed. Instead, you can just make a game that offers players a unique or enticing experience and sell it at a fair price.  And if you get lucky and people like it, you might end up with one of the biggest games of 2025 and beat AAA studios and publishers. <br></p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The only thing I really desperately want and need at the launch of Switch 2 is a shiny new 3D <em>Mario </em>game. Give me a new <em>Mario </em>game as big and awesome as <em>Odyssey</em>, and I’ll buy a Switch 2 on day one. Considering the last big 3D <em>Mario </em>game was <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>, released in 2017, it seems like we are due for a new one.</p><p><strong>John Walker: </strong>It’d be weird if there weren’t a new <em>Super Mario</em>, right? My wish is for something that realizes the amazing promise of <em>Bowser’s Fury</em>, an open-world-ish 3D <em>Mario</em> game with all the imaginative innovations Nintendo could do with all that space. It’d be <em>crazy</em> if there weren’t <em>Wind Waker</em> and <em>Twilight Princess</em> remakes, but then it’s been <em>crazy</em> that those haven’t happened for every year of the original Switch, too. Can we all agree to collectively boo if there’s word of a <em>Pikmin 5</em>?</p><p><strong>Kenneth Shepard:</strong> <em>Breath of the Wild 3 </em>and a <em>Pokemon MMO</em>.</p><p><strong>Ethan Gach:</strong> <em>Donkey Kong Country 6</em>, some first-party gimmick party game called, like, <em>Mouse Attack</em> or something, and a port of <em>Sea of Thieves</em>. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8997bcdff410a320304a57d189ed8068" data-recommend-id="image://8997bcdff410a320304a57d189ed8068" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Switch 2 displays a patent for the Joy-Con mouse functionality.

Paying extra for this will also be the only way to utilize voice chat. The Virtual Console will return to the eShop, but NES games will be $10 each, with $10 added on for each subsequent console generation. There will be no built-in social media sharing.

That would be a really boring answer. Another option is that C stands for connect and this will be the button you use to sync stuff or maybe even connect to an OG Switch? The wildest idea I’ve come up with: The C button stands for camera. In this scenario, you’ll be able to hit it, and the Switch 2 controller will become a virtual in-game camera controlled via motion in games that support photo modes. The truth is that I don’t know what the C button will do, but hopefully it’s not something annoying that makes me hate using the Switch 2.</p><p>  <strong>John Walker:</strong> I’m at my most pessimistic here.

I really hope I’m wrong, and that mysterious button causes games to climb out of the screen or something. </p><p><strong>Kenneth Shepard: </strong>C stands for “Car horn,” so the Switch 2 honks if you press it.</p><p><strong>Ethan Gach: </strong>The C button stands for ChatGPT integration and will summon a Shigeru Miyamoto MiiBot that gives you tips for playing games. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7bbe6298886a467edc1476828a1292f9" data-recommend-id="image://7bbe6298886a467edc1476828a1292f9" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Switch 2 sits in a dock.

Interestingly, I wonder if the Steam Deck’s success in recent years has helped devs get better at optimizing settings for a portable, smaller device with a limited battery. If so, that could be very helpful for Switch 2 ports.</p><p><strong>Kenneth Shepard:</strong> It will be powerful enough to run old Switch games like they should have run on the last one, god willing.</p><p><strong>Ethan Gach:</strong> People are going to be asking for a Switch 2 Pro by Christmas. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="25d90edbff26f6fa55f946ab4205712b" data-recommend-id="image://25d90edbff26f6fa55f946ab4205712b" data-format="png" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A cartridge is shown being inserted into a Switch 2.

I expect that for the following 20 months or so, getting your hands on a Switch 2 will involve scanning Discord servers, religiously following Wario64 on Twitter for stock updates, and being ready to drop everything at a moment’s notice to snag one before a thousand resellers show up with bots to vacuum up any units that arrive in warehouses or stores. Or you might be able to pay triple the price to get a Switch 2 via eBay. But don’t do that. Don’t reward the resellers.</p><p><strong>Ethan Gach:</strong> Absolutely not. I think pre-orders might be touch-and-go, especially if there’s little to no scalper protection and resellers are inflating demand. But I also think Nintendo delayed this console by a full year to make sure it had enough stock so that you could walk into a Target or Best Buy once school is out and upgrade to a Switch 2. The alternative is Nintendo risks a small but not insignificant group of Switch owners upgrading to a PS5 or Steam Deck instead. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="477cfa797b2be5fdf0b5ff67d0836cea" data-recommend-id="image://477cfa797b2be5fdf0b5ff67d0836cea" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Master Chief Collection appears on Switch 2.

Rockstar brought the <em>GTA Trilogy</em> to Switch, as well as some other games. But <em>GTA V </em>remains unavailable on Nintendo hardware. That’s a huge market that could be buying Shark Cards in <em>GTA Online</em>. And with <em>GTA 6</em> unlikely to arrive on Switch 2, <em>GTA V </em>might be the next best thing. And hey, maybe a <em>GTA IV </em>port, too. I also wouldn’t be shocked if some more Xbox games arrived on Switch 2.<em> Forza Horizon 5 </em>on a Switch 2 sounds splendid. </p><p><strong>Ethan Gach:</strong> I expect Microsoft to load up the Switch 2 with former Xbox console exclusives including <em>Halo: The Master Chief Collection</em>, the rumored <em>Gears of War </em>anthology, <em>Diablo 4</em>, and a bunch of other games. <em>Elden Ring</em> is a riskier but more exciting bet. But I’ll go big and say <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> comes to Switch 2 before the end of 2025!</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered makes its bow on PC, broadening the game’s availability. The survival title already looked unbelievable on consoles, so let’s tell you its PC specs and system requirements to have you clacking at Clickers in no time.</p>



<p>The Last of Us Part 1 Remastered came to PC, so it makes sense for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-last-of-us-2-remastered-announces-free-no-return-content-for-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered</a> to follow suit. Naughty Dog’s award-winning sequel is here in all its remastered and revitalized glory. It features the complete dual-narrative of The Last of Us Part 2 but comes with lots of new features.</p>



<p>Not everyone’s PC setup is the same. This is why system requirements are important before a game’s release. Naughty Dog has unveiled the entire list of PC specs and requirements here, and you should look to see which tier you are compatible with.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.naughtydog.com/blog/the_last_of_us_part_ii" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Last of Us Part 2</a> Remastered’s requirements are split into four categories: <strong>Minimum, Recommended, High, and Very High</strong> settings. Minimum is what you need to run Part 2 at all. We need to hit these requirements to ensure the game works and we don’t run into any problems.</p>



<p>The game runs better the closer you get to “Very High.” This is reserved for the most elite gaming configurations though, so don’t be disheartened if you fall short of the requirements.</p>



<p>Without further ado, here’s every set of system requirements for The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered on PC.</p>

The premiere PC gaming marketplace saw a major downturn in revenue for new games, pushing Valve to put significant work into new features that would drive engagement and sales on the platform.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Their main priority? Pushing developers to add demos and putting those demos in front of as many players as possible.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"In 2023, Valve actually made less money from new games, it actually declined," said game marketing strategist Chris Zukowski. "All of 2024 was them pushing out features, thinking that they needed to fix the issue. They Flooded the store with features that all focus on demos. Valve was saying, in not so subtle terms, that everyone needs to make a demo."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Everything is demo oriented">Everything is demo oriented</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Zukowski gave a talk on navigating these new Steam features at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco. We sat down with him after the talk to dive into the topic in more detail. The main point of the talk was that demos are the key to getting discovered on Steam. It's natural, according to Zukowski, that interest in your game will have a greater chance at visibility if you give streamers a way to play.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"For most games, social media doesn't work," Zukowski said. "And the reason is streamers can play a demo. Streamers can't play a screenshot. They need the demo, and when they play it on stream, it brings their audience."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/marketing/-the-public-are-kinda-crazy-palworld-developer-pocketpair-underlines-the-human-cost-of-success" target="_self" data-discover="true">'The public are kinda crazy:' Palworld developer Pocketpair underlines the human cost of success</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While the majority of the talk was focused on demos, Zukowski also elaborated on what else developers can do to get exposure for their demo and game. It involves launching a page, gathering some sort of audience, and then running a playtest in order to drum up interest. Developers only have one shot at releasing a demo and leaving a good impression, and a playtest can give them a chance to "iron out the kinks" according to Zukowski. He estimated, from extensive data, that 100 concurrent players may be the threshold to being discovered by the algorithm.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The real revelation is that a demo launch is front page featuring now," Zukowski said. "It's big, but you have to have an existing audience and you have to have enough players simultaneously playing your demo for the Steam algorithm to put you on the front page."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Zukowski was insistent that you can't just throw a game page up on Steam, launch a demo, and then expect success. It's not that easy for developers to get discovered in a marketplace that sees thousands of new games released every year.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The playtest is like priming the pump," Zukowski said. "It's getting the pump working."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/marketing/senua-s-saga-hellblade-ii-dominates-bafta-games-awards-2025-nominations" target="_self" data-discover="true">Senua's Saga: Hellblade II dominates BAFTA Games Awards 2025 nominations</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Zukowski brought up several specific examples of games using this method within the past year. Some had been near dormant for months, sometimes years, before running a playtest and then launching a demo. Those games' wishlist numbers shot up soon after.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A common mentality: release demos close to a game launch, so that players could try the experience and have it be top-of-mind when the full game hits. Zukowski refutes that idea, saying that momentum doesn't play a role in smaller game launches. The games are so small that a big influx of players, especially a long way from launch, is better than trying to set up some sort of curated event around launch.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The good, the bad, and the AI slop">The good, the bad, and the AI slop</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One point brought up during Steam Next Fest was that these new demo and discovery features elevated almost every game who utilized the feature on Steam, including what some journalists called "AI slop."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Day one of Next Fest, everyone gets a certain amount of impressions," Zukowski said, adding that wishlist numbers will impact how many impressions a game may get at first. On day two, Zukowski pointed out that Steam had given visibility to everyone, including games many considered poor quality. "That's Steam giving everyone visibility."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Steam's algorithm then gives certain games more of a boost based on impressions and other statistics. Games that don't get that attention will sink to the bottom, having wasted their chance at gaining players while showcased on the front page.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/marketing/astro-bot-and-black-myth-wukong-take-the-lead-in-gdca-2025-nominations" target="_self" data-discover="true">Astro Bot and Black Myth: Wukong take the lead in GDCA 2025 nominations</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The system that Steam is using for demos is brand new. It's not even a year old in its current iteration. The main question that popped into my mind was, "How well with all this work in a few years after demos have flooded the store just as much as other games have?" Zukowski's answer was that discoverability isn't that much of an issue to begin with.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He showed me a graph that he had removed from his talk, as it would "take too much time to explain" as part of his current presentation. It showed how many games were released per year on Steam and how many games of that number actually received more than 50 reviews.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">From 2019 to 2024, several thousands more games were released each year, culminating in over 18,000 games in 2024. However, only a little over 4,000 of those games actually received more than 50 reviews. The same went for every year, where only a fraction of the games released picked up any traction on Steam.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I think the problem is that [...] a lot of people are making their first game. They don't know how to make the type of game the Steam audience likes, or aren't skilled enough, or it's just their first game. I think the biggest limiting factor is not visibility, Steam gives us a ton of visibility," Zukowksi said, adding that Steam players have a certain taste. "Demos give everyone a better chance to see these games and make a judgement."</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
