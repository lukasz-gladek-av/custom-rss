            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/17/gta-6-targets-late-2025-release-date-as-take-two-narrows-launch-window/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Grand Theft Auto VI is officially targeting a late 2025 release, as Rockstar’s parent company Take-Two Interactive narrowed the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gta-6">GTA 6</a> launch window in their <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/e357ad06-0762-4e80-b80c-e3869252fdfe">Q4 2024 earnings report</a>.</p>
<p>“Our outlook reflects a narrowing of Rockstar Games’ previously established window of Calendar 2025 to Fall of Calendar 2025 for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto VI</a>,” Take-Two Chairman and CEO Strauss Zelnick wrote in the report. “We are highly confident that Rockstar Games will deliver an unparalleled entertainment experience, and our expectations for the commercial impact of the title continue to increase.”</p>


<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/05/gta-6-watch-first-grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer-2025-release-date/">GTA 6 was unveiled</a> with a fantastic looking announcement trailer at the end of last year, with Rockstar at that time pinning the game’s release for 2025. The rumour mill got spinning at that point, with reports suggesting that Rockstar was aiming for an early 2025 release. We don’t know if that was the actual target and things have slipped, or if late 2025 was always the internal goal, but either way, we now know to expect the long-awaited sequel toward the end of next year.</p>
<p><iframe title="Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer 1" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QdBZY2fkU-0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto VI takes us all back to Vice City for another crime story. The trailer introduces us to Lucia, the series’ first female protagonist, as well an as-yet-unnamed male counterpart. Lucia seemingly starts off the game getting out of prison after a bit of “bad luck”.</p>

<p>It’s clearly a modern day setting in the fictionalised state of Leonida, with a handful of things like social media shown in the trailer, but that won’t stop there being plenty of iconic classic cars and inspirations from the breadth of American culture in the South East of the country and Florida in particular. From packed beaches to going across the swamps on hover craft, and partying at the tops of skyscrapers, there’s also jokes thrown into the trailer about battling crocodiles in back garden swimming pools, “Floridaman” antics – Leonidaman in the game – and plenty more.</p>
<p>All of this should be reassuring to Take-Two’s investors, especially after the company announced and enacted a sweeping layoffs and cost reduction programme. Investors <em>love</em> when companies cut jobs, but what they’re really waiting for is GTA 6 and the next iteration of GTA Online, and it’s a nice fillip when there’s been a slight 3% decline in Net Bookings.</p>
<p>GTA 5, by the way, has now sold a simply astonishing 200 million copies.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/take-two-head-denies-closing-olliolli-world-kerbal-2-devs.874041/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-denies-roll7-intercept-closure<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick has denied shutting down two studios under the company's umbrella earlier this month, despite strong evidence to the contrary.</p>

<p>Back in early May, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/intercept-games-shut-down-kerbal-space-program-2">evidence began to emerge</a> that&nbsp;<em>Kerbal Space Program 2&nbsp;</em>developer Intercept Games had been shut down, including Intercept employees posting on LinkedIn about being laid off, as well as <a href="https://esd.wa.gov/about-employees/WARN" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a filing</a> announcing the closure of a Take-Two subsidiary with around 70 employees.</p>

<p>Subsequently, Bloomberg then reported that&nbsp;<em>OlliOlli World&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Rollerdrome&nbsp;</em>developer Roll7 was to be shut down, citing "documentation reviewed" by the publication.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-on-intercept-roll7-we-didnt-shutter-those-studios" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a recent call with IGN's Rebekah Valentine</a>, however, Zelnick said that Take-Two "didn't shutter those studios" and that the company "[hasn't] shuttered anything".</p>

<p>Valentine says she then attempted to press Zelnick on whether he was denying the reports of Roll7 and Intercept's shutdown, whereupon a Take-Two PR representative said the company's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-interactive-layoffs">cost reduction plan</a> constituted a "5% reduction in headcount", but that no "label-by-label breakdown" had been given.</p>

<p>Following this exchange, Valentine asked Zelnick whether Private Division, the Take-Two-owned parent company of both Roll7 and Intercept, was in trouble, but Zelnick said he "[doesn't] think so".</p>

<p>Zelnick goes on to say that Take-Two tends to leave announcements to each individual label, and that he's not "trying to be cute or difficult", but that higher-ups "don't tend to bring those discussions into these meetings".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kerbal-space-program-2-intercept-take-two.jpg?itok=Ar694seG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kerbal-space-program-2-intercept-take-two.jpg?itok=3Br5slvN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Kerbal Space Program 2</em>&nbsp;developer Intercept's fate is up in the air.</figcaption></figure><p>As pointed out <a href="https://x.com/jasonschreier/status/1791221008470278554" rel="noopener" target="_blank">by Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a>, this isn't the first time Take-Two and Zelnick have muddied the waters when it comes to closing a studio under the company's remit.</p>

<p>Schreier says that in 2013,&nbsp;<em>BioShock 2&nbsp;</em>developer 2K Marin was shut down, but that neither Take-Two nor Strauss Zelnick would acknowledge the shutdown publicly and would act "in press releases as if the studio still existed, when in fact it did not".</p>

<p>Since no official announcement has technically been made regarding the shutdown of Roll7 or Intercept, it's possible that Zelnick is being absolutely accurate and that neither studio has been shut down, but given the evidence to the contrary, that seems unlikely.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in Take-Two news, the company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-6-coming-in-fall-2025-publisher-take-two-reveals" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recently revealed</a> that&nbsp;the hotly-anticipated&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-premiere-date">officially revealed last year</a>, will be launching in fall 2025. Watch this space for a mad scramble on other developers' part to avoid this window at any cost.</p>

And we’re not seeing any signs that the automaker plans to remove Steam from current owners’ vehicles through a software update. However, Tesla’s already seems to be leaning toward dropping Steam support for some other models.</p><p>Steam isn’t available in the Cybertruck, for example, and Tesla hasn’t said whether it plans on bringing the gaming platform to its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23529762/tesla-steam-holiday-update-2022-gaming-intel-amd-ryzen">bestselling Model Y and Model 3</a> vehicles, despite newer models sporting improved AMD Ryzen processors.

Steam launched in a revised 2022 version of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252832/tesla-model-s-redesign-plaid-mile-range-interior-refresh">redesigned</a> Model S and Model X.

Musk has said a retrofit would be available, but <a href="https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/retrofit-for-steam.288873/">it’s not free</a>.</p><p>There’s speculation that Tesla might be backtracking on powerful gaming hardware in new Model S and X vehicles.

  <p id="inxy9D"><em>Disney Lorcana</em>’s newest set, <em>Ursula’s Return</em>, drops Friday at local game stores and Disney parks before its mass market retail release on May 31. While fans that are already heavily invested in the trading card game will be reaching for those pricey booster boxes, new players and collectors will be more interested in the set’s two new starter decks that can get them up and playing right away. We’ve had them both on the table for a few weeks now, and each one is fairly competitive right out of the box. But they could easily benefit from some simple upgrades. These are your best bets.</p>

<p id="k6Ocw1"><em>Lorcana</em>’s new <strong>Amber and Amethyst</strong> starter deck, titled <em><strong>Madrigal Magic</strong></em>, is the most in need of tinkering. The Madrigal family’s various abilities are highly synergistic, and having more of them on the table at any one time will give you an advantage — especially late in the game. Therefore, the most important addition to the deck is <strong>Alma Madrigal, Family Matriarch</strong>. </p>
<p id="OpHsN8">The un-inkable card costs a modest three ink to play, and it’s a lightweight in a fight with just one attack and three defense. The ability to grab two lore upon questing is certainly handy, but the card’s real value comes in its special ability. Called <strong>To The Table</strong>, it allows players to shuffle their deck — not their discard pile — for a Madrigal character card before placing it on top of the deck to be drawn next. Having a few of these in your deck could be just the thing to pull off some much-needed late-game combos.</p>

<p id="ShsJiB"><em>Lorcana</em>’s <strong>Sapphire and Steel</strong> deck for <em>Ursula’s Return</em>, titled <em><strong>Stand Together</strong></em>, is pretty pugnacious. To get the most out of it, you’ll need to be challenging your opponents on the regular, leaning on your Support abilities to maximize damage and your Resist abilities to take a punch. But the songs included in this deck — Seldom All They Seem, One Last Hope, and Dig A Little Deeper — add more flavor than flash. So why not fold in some damage-dealing songs instead?</p>
<p id="gdDub0"><strong>And Then Along Came Zeus</strong> would be an excellent, and thematically appropriate, choice. It deals five damage when sung, but you’ll need at least a four-ink glimmer to sing it. Another good choice would be <strong>Let The Storm Rage On</strong> (sing cost three, two damage) or <strong>Strength of a Raging Fire</strong>, which deals damage equal to the number of characters you’ve got in play.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24158540/arctic-eggs-egg-frying-game-steam-release<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="9899F9">We are currently in the middle of a bountiful month for indie games, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-play/24151036/best-indie-games-2024">our collective cup runneth over</a> with inventive, stunning, and incredible titles. So I apologize that I have to stop and beg you, upon bended knee, to please <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2763670/Arctic_Eggs/">play this game</a> about flipping eggs in the Arctic.</p>
<p id="SNfQ6s">That’s not me simplifying the plot as a joke; that’s just the game. It’s stylized like games of the PlayStation era, and the game starts with the camera pointed straight at a chicken. I stumble forward past rows and rows of chickens, until I see a guard. His mask is intimidating, but he’s pretty polite to me. It seems like I tried to escape from ... whatever this place is, and as a result, I have been forcibly downgraded. I can walk, and I can cook. That’s it.</p>
<p id="rEkZuB">Walking is pretty simple, but cooking is not. All those chickens lay a lot of eggs, and I cook ’em up for people. One of my hands grasps the pan, and I can control the intensity or sensitivity of my grip with the scroll wheel. Then, I move the mouse to slide the egg inside the pan. </p>

<p id="Kl1uaM">This isn’t incredibly difficult per se, and some people will grasp it easier than others. I can’t think of another game that had physics-based instrument controls attached to the mouse, so I had to learn how to do that from scratch. As a result, I’m a pretty terrible chef.</p>
<p id="bKyhCM">Once one side of the egg is cooked, I have to do the Dark Souls of egg-cooking and flip it delicately onto its other side. I can see why this place needs so many chickens; I’ve tossed dozens of eggs out of the pan. Some people want me to throw stuff like bacon in with their egg, which makes for a greater challenge because if anything falls out of the pan, I have to start over from scratch. The more ingredients, the higher the risk that something goes flying. Sometimes, god forbid, they want more eggs.</p>
<p id="plI82Q">No one seems to mind my frequent stumbles; after spending fifteen minutes juggling one lady’s egg and her cigarette — an unusual garnish, but not my breakfast — and flipping eggs and cigarette butts everywhere, she was still impressed. I move from hungry person to hungry person, sinking further and further into this surreal world with striking visuals. There’s a very compelling game built around this simple gimmick, and I’m glad I stumbled across it during a month crammed full of great little gems. </p>

It’s now been a week, and though he was stalled at Malenia for the longest time, Cenat is now within a stone’s throw of beating the game.</p><div data-video-id="196773" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Summer Soulslike Keeps Looking Better And Better" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="95" data-playlist="196773,195502,195624" data-current="196773"><div><p>This Summer Soulslike Keeps Looking Better And Better</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196773/196773_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196773/196773_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196773/196773_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196773/196773_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22330.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>Let’s back up a bit though, because Cenat’s stream has been a rollercoaster to watch from afar. As far as I know, Cenat has never played a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fromsoftware-soulslike-ranked-elden-ring-dark-souls-ps5-1850289282&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fromsoftware-soulslike-ranked-elden-ring-dark-souls-ps5-1850289282">soulslike</a></span> game before, let alone a FromSoftware title. The last game that he cleared on stream in a similar manner was Sucker Punch’s samurai action title <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ghost-of-tsushima-the-kotaku-review-1844368841&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-of-tsushima-the-kotaku-review-1844368841"><em>Ghost of Tsushima</em></a></span>, which is a markedly different experience than FromSoft’s immensely difficult epic.</p><p>Since he began <em>Elden Ring</em>, social media has been awash with reactions to Cenat’s thoroughly enjoyable playthrough. Given his inexperience with these particularly difficult games, as well as his penchant for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://clips.twitch.tv/SpunkyTenuousGaurM4xHeh-wj7eCGoxOX4xc0UZ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://clips.twitch.tv/SpunkyTenuousGaurM4xHeh-wj7eCGoxOX4xc0UZ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dramatic overreactions</a></span>, viewers have especially enjoyed poking fun at his hardship. For example, Cenat got incessantly trolled for getting stuck on the Tree Sentinel, an optional mini boss that players often encounter at the beginning of the game, for six hours.</p><p>Other highlights include the typical hallmarks of a soulslike playthrough, including nonstop shouting, occasionally violent outbursts towards inanimate objects, and a flying controller. Every now and then, friends of Cenat’s have even appeared on stream in full armor to advise him on what to do, or to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Kaimafiaupdates/status/1789470418577031267&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Kaimafiaupdates/status/1789470418577031267" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fight each other with fake swords</a></span>. At one point, Cenat was even delivered an NBA Finals trophy, because why the fuck not? It’s been a great time and it shows: At its peak, the stream has drawn about 230,000 concurrent viewers.</p><p>Cenat’s <em>Elden Ring </em>streams have become such an event that countless Twitter accounts, including one that goes by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://twitter.com/TheClipBot&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://twitter.com/TheClipBot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@TheClipBot</a></span>, have been steadily updating users on Cenat’s progress, including which bosses he’s defeated, his death count, and how long the streamer has been at it, as well as general events that happen onstream.</p><p>When he hasn’t been playing <em>Elden Ring</em>, Cenat has been taking small social media breaks, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/officialcvaults/status/1790098757230407795&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/officialcvaults/status/1790098757230407795" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">discovering that he might have a testicular torsion</a></span> with the help of his chat, and sleeping on stream. Despite the lack of activity during the latter parts of the stream, Cenat’s viewership has remained in the tens of thousands as his chat tries to goad him into waking up and reflects on the most recent events of the stream. It’s like the world’s most wholesome incarnation of <em>The Truman Show</em>. Y’know, minus all the viscera and otherwise disgusting imagery to be found in <em>Elden Ring.</em></p><p>I’d been catching stray highlights from social media all week, but I <em>had </em>to tune in to see Cenat take on Malenia. She’s widely considered the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-youtube-lionheart-malenia-buff-bleed-reddit-1850387548&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-youtube-lionheart-malenia-buff-bleed-reddit-1850387548">hardest boss in the whole game</a></span>, one of the hardest fights in any FromSoft game, and she stalled the guy for more than 24 hours before he beat her late last night. I’m so glad I started watching when I did because seeing Cenat take on Malenia was nothing short of <em>incredible</em>. After 120 hours of playing <em>Elden Ring</em> and an unknown amount of attempts against Malenia specifically, he beat her first phase only to be <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/scubaryan_/status/1790866249712357838&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/scubaryan_/status/1790866249712357838" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stunned</a></span> to discover she had a second one. When I tuned into the stream yesterday afternoon, Cenat was hyping himself up as he fought her, likening the fight to a heist he’d already committed before, and continually deployed phrases like “get ya money” or “refill the tank” as he attacked her and refilled his health. I think my favorite callout might’ve been when he just shouted “Cops!” as Malenia jumped into the air and released ghostly images of herself in her second phase.</p><p>The chat meanwhile was, and remains, completely engaged. While there were naysayers throughout chastising Cenat, an overwhelming number of his hundreds of thousands of viewers have been cheering him on. Repeated chants of “Lock in” were scattered throughout and without fail, someone commented something along the lines of “I WAS HERE” whenever Cenat reached Malenia’s second phase, as if trying to preempt the eventual victory they saw coming. Others were less helpful, like the hilarious stray commenter who simply typed “FART IN HER EYES.” Throughout the stream, and the Malenia fight in particular, folks have obviously been trying to advise Cenat, and whenever he’s been able to read the chat (which is moving a mile a minute at any given moment) he’s engaged with them and adapted his strategies and builds accordingly.</p><p>It feels worth mentioning that Cenat also took on this insanely difficult fight with no armor or help. His loadout consisted of the Rivers of Blood katana—which he’s been taking advantage of to make her bleed—when I first tuned in, though he eventually adopted a second sword and a dual-blade approach before finishing her off. Cenat refused to summon any players who would’ve gladly assisted him, nor did he use any of the popular spirit ashes in <em>Elden Ring</em>, like the mimic tear or Black Knife Tiche. With Cenat beating this fight in nothing but underwear, I think I’m going to have to concede that he is, in fact, the greatest <em>Elden Ring </em>player ever. Either him or <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-malenia-boss-goldfish-twitch-stream-1850610071&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-malenia-boss-goldfish-twitch-stream-1850610071">the goldfish</a></span> that also beat her a while ago.</p><p>The thing that finally did the trick? Cenat used a rune arc to activate the Great Runes you collect from fighting the major bosses. With the aid of these greatly amplifying passive abilities, he defeated her on his literal next try after 1610 total deaths in the game. Upon beating her, all of Cenat’s nearby friends flocked to his side as he triumphantly jumped up and down, sat on the Iron Throne replica that’s been sitting in the room behind him since the beginning of the stream, and blared a Malenia remix that he’d queued up at some point in the last day. It was, without a doubt, the feel-good gaming moment of the year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Following its acquisition of Activision-Blizzard, it should surprise no one that Microsoft intends to go full bore with the Call of Duty franchise. They’re casting a wide net, launching their titles on Xbox systems, PC, and now PlayStation. But is Black Ops 6 coming to Game Pass, too?</p>



<h2 id="h-will-black-ops-6-launch-on-game-pass">Will Black Ops 6 Launch on Game Pass?</h2>



<p>According to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-game-pass-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent reports</a>, Black Ops 6 will indeed launch on Game Pass. Whether or not it launches on day one remains to be seen, but knowing Microsoft and its usual launch plans, it’s absolutely likely. Just take a look at Starfield. The open-world RPG was their most anticipated title, and they launched day one on Game Pass.</p>



<p>We had an inkling that the next Call of Duty would come to Game Pass. Previously, Sarah Bond at Microsoft revealed the team intends to launch every first-party title on Game Pass, including Call of Duty. We just saw Diablo IV hit Game Pass, so why not the biggest first-person shooter franchise, too?</p>







<h2 id="h-when-will-black-ops-6-come-to-game-pass">When Will Black Ops 6 Come to Game Pass?</h2>



<p>As mentioned, it’s unclear whether the upcoming first-person shooter intends to launch on day one, though it’s becoming increasingly more likely. That said, Black Ops 6 will likely launch on the subscription service on release day, which is currently October 25!</p>



<p>Considering Call of Duty remains one of the most popular competitive first-person shooter franchises in the world, earning countless hundreds of millions of dollars annually, it’s surprising to see Microsoft forego retail sales in favor of their monthly subscription service.</p>



<p>Will you play it on Game Pass or buy a copy outright? I’m curious to see how this affects sales, though Activision pushes microtransactions in multiplayer hard!</p>

Go ahead and count out Grand Theft Auto VI, for a few reasons. First, it's under Take-Two's Rockstar Games label instead of 2K. Additionally, the game has already been revealed and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-release-date-now-set-for-fall-2025/1100-6523520/" data-ref-id="1100-6523520">Take-Two has set a Fall 2025 release window</a> for the anticipated game.</p><p dir="ltr">According to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-borderlands-4-reveal/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming</a>, Borderlands 4 from Gearbox seems like the safest bet to show up at Summer Game Fest.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/05/17/hades-iis-first-patch-changes-how-sprint-and-resource-collecting-works<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Hades II has taken the gaming world by storm, and I'm not just saying that because it's the subject of <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/magazine">our current cover story</a>. But while many have been surprised by the sheer volume of content available so far, it's still in Early Access, so the team at Supergiant will be updating and patching it for the foreseeable future. The first of those patches came today, and it adds a few small quality-of-life improvements.</p>

<div>
<blockquote>
<div dir="ltr" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><p>Our first Early Access patch for Hades II is out now on Steam and the Epic Games Store!! We're very grateful for all the feedback so far, which inspired this first set of targeted improvements and fixes.</p><p>
🌒Full Patch Notes: <a href="https://t.co/HDQRCANrv1">https://t.co/HDQRCANrv1</a> <a href="https://t.co/RJO0ayFb8c">pic.twitter.com/RJO0ayFb8c</a></p></div>
— Supergiant Games (@SupergiantGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/SupergiantGames/status/1791148077283410206?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 16, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div>

<p>The first change comes to the sprint mechanic, a feature the original Hades did not have. By holding the dash button, Melinoë will begin to run, making it easier to avoid enemy attacks or cross larger lengths of the map. Several boons also only activate while sprinting, so it's a crucial mechanic for Supergiant to get right. After this first patch, sprinting is faster and it's easier to turn, and related boons have been re-balanced accordingly. Additionally, The Swift Runner upgrade at the Altar of Ashes (which increases sprint speed by 20%) now makes your dash immediately start, so you can escape danger more reliably.</p>

<p>The patch also does a minor overhaul of the resource collection system. As you progress, you'll unlock different tools, like the pickaxe and the shovel, to harvest different types of materials, like minerals and seeds. Before the patch, choosing a tool before a run meant you could only harvest those specific resources until you returned to the crossroads. If you picked up a shovel and encountered a fishing spot, you were out of luck. Now, players can harvest any resource they encounter in a run, but selecting a certain tool just makes its corresponding resource much more likely to appear. Now, a shovel-wielding Melinoë can attempt to catch any fish she comes across, but it's much less likely she encounters one in the first place.</p>

<p>The patch also includes a number of other smaller fixes, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350?emclan=103582791472836561&amp;emgid=4175477072263852699">which you can read in their entirety here</a>. Just be wary before unveiling those spoiler tags if you haven't made it through the bulk of the game, as they reveal the existence of certain characters or locations you likely haven't encountered yet.</p>

<p data-characters="275" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">You thought you were done with <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-animal-well/">Animal Well</a></em>? It’s not done with you. There’s a whole ‘nother game after your game. After you’ve dipped your toes, you’re given a flute with a pretty helpful postgame power: The power to fast travel. Here’s how to use it.</p> <p data-characters="505" data-current-count="505" data-injectable="true">You can first reach the flute after you gather eight of the eggs. Once you do, return to the Egg Room where all the eggs are displayed. The bottom left door will nudge its way open. Down a corridor, you’ll come to a room with a chest, and inside it is the flute. The flute’s use isn’t immediately clear, but you play notes by holding the tool button and pressing a direction, whether that is through keys or a joystick. You use these directions to input codes which do a variety of different things.</p>
 <p data-characters="137" data-current-count="137" data-injectable="false">There’s a notation given within <em>Animal Well</em> that you see when you pick up the flute. It labels the eight directions, appropriately 1-8.</p> <p data-characters="289" data-current-count="426" data-injectable="true">1 is set to the right direction, and then it continues clockwise. Down-right is therefore 2, down is 3, down-right is 4, and so on until you get to 8 (up-right). I’m going to use this notation, because it’s both easier to write and also how its displayed in <em>Animal Well’s</em> game-speak.</p>
 <p data-characters="234" data-current-count="234" data-injectable="false">Some (maybe all) codes are hidden in the environment, but others are completely unknown.

            <p>Creative Assembly, the studio best known for their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> Total War series, are rumoured to be working on a licensed Star Wars title. ‘Rumoured’ is the key word here, mind. <a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/total-war-star-wars-reportedly-in-works-at-creative-assembly/">Dualshockers </a>credit “a reliable source” with the information that “three new Total War games are currently in development,” and that “one of the three new projects is expected to be a Star Wars-themed Total War game.” There’s currently no further information beyond that, I’m afraid, although I’ve reached out to Creative Assembly for comment.</p>

<p>Let’s break this down a little, assuming we take the “three new Total War games” as fact. By this point, anyone would tell you that one of those titles is the heavily rumoured Total War: Warhammer 40,000. Creative Assembly have a long-standing relationship with Warhammer owners Games Workshop, one that’s proved exceptionally profitable for both sides. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer">Total War: Warhammer</a> series of games was even credited, alongside <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-vermintide-2">Vermintide 2</a>, for being responsible for GW bringing back an entire tabletop setting in The Old World. Twarhammer is a significant moneymaker for CA, and the setting isn’t a fraction as popular as 40k. Also, come on. They’ve already got all those orc models.</p>
<p>That’s two games left. Again, even assuming there’s three in development, which seems like a lot for a studio that’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cancelled-shooter-hyenas-was-reportedly-segas-most-expensive-game-ever">undergone</a> as much <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sega-cancel-hyenas-and-several-unannounced-games-due-to-covid-era-losses">tumult</a> as Creative Assembly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sega-sells-company-of-heroes-developer-relic-and-lays-off-more-staff-at-creative-assembly-and-hardlight">recently</a>. Out of those two, it feels very unlikely to me that the studio won’t have at least one historical title in the works. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-three-kingdoms">Total War: Three Kingdoms</a> was the fastest selling one they’ve done, and fans are still clamouring for a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/medieval-ii-total-war">Medieval</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rome-total-war">Rome 3</a>. This is a studio that built their name on, and has consistently released a steady stream of, historical games. I can’t see them stopping any time soon.</p>

<p>So, that’s one left, going by the rumours. What might support it being a Star Wars title? For one, the series has only dabbled in primarily ranged warfare before, a la <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-empire">Empire</a>. It would make sense for them to want to build a new engine for 40K, and you could imagine they’d want  to double-dip on that engine and some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-space-games-on-pc">space game</a> assets. The only other convincing argument I can point to is ‘<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-star-wars-games-on-pc">Star Wars games</a> popular’. They are though.</p>
<p>That said, I just can’t see the setting working well. I understand there’s lots of deep lore, but look, I played the X-Wing minis game, and there’s 3 factions in that. Rebels, Empire, and ‘Scum and Villainy’ - basically just the bounty hunters and that. Not enough for a Total War game, I don’t reckon. All this aside, I certainly wouldn’t say no for a chance to send a formation of wompas careening into rebel lines, and I can see it being a decent success for the studio if it does turn out to be in development. I’ll let you know if I hear anything else.</p>

Microsoft teased an extended Direct for an unknown game directly after its June showcase, which fans quickly pieced together to be this year’s <em>Call of Duty </em>reveal. According to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/8/24151814/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-strategy-changes-arkane-tango&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/8/24151814/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-strategy-changes-arkane-tango" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Verge</em></a></span>, Microsoft had until recently been debating whether to keep <em>Call of Duty</em> off Game Pass, or add it and increase the price of the service. It’s unclear if the new reporting by <em>The Wall Street Journal </em>means Game Pass will get another price hike in 2024, or if <em>Call of Duty</em> will be exclusive to certain tiers. </p><p>Microsoft didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. </p><p><em>Call of Duty </em>costs hundreds of millions to make each year, and each year it sells tens of millions of copies. The cycle was so lucrative for publisher Activision that it slowly forced every studio it owned to contribute to making the hit series. When Microsoft finished its $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard last year, whether <em>Call of Duty</em> would join <em>Diablo 4</em> and other games on Game Pass was one of the big questions. </p><p>While Microsoft made a big push behind Game Pass heading into the Xbox Series X/S console generation, subscription growth has seemingly slowed and plateaued in recent years. It’s not clear if adding<em> Call of Duty </em>to the service would bring in enough new monthly members to replace all of those who would decide not to buy it at full retail price of $70 as a result. Former Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick famously testified last year that he had decided not to put <em>Call of Duty</em> on subscription services precisely because the math didn’t work out financially.</p><p>Microsoft had roughly 34 million Game Pass subscribers as of February of this year.

The tech giant footing the exorbitant bill to grow Game Pass might have seemed likely as recently as February when Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamefile.news/p/microsoft-phil-spencer-xbox-cloud-interview&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/microsoft-phil-spencer-xbox-cloud-interview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>Game File</em></a></span>, “Our intent is the full portfolio of games from ZeniMax, Activision Blizzard and XGS—Xbox Game Studios—will be on Game Pass, day one.” </p><p>This month, however, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-studios-arkane-tango-gameworks-hi-fi-rush-1851470253&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-studios-arkane-tango-gameworks-hi-fi-rush-1851470253">Microsoft closed a handful of studios</a></span>, including Arkane Austin and Tango Gameworks, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-bethesda-studio-closings-arkane-too-many-games-1851464885&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-bethesda-studio-closings-arkane-too-many-games-1851464885">with <em>Bloomberg</em></a></span> reporting that the acquisition of Activision Blizzard had put more scrutiny on Xbox, and pressure to generate higher profits, from the larger company.

<p>It feels like we’ve seen very little about Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2 since its initial announcement. The marketing behind the game feels flat. Still, receiving a sequel to one of the most unique story-driven adventures is exciting. The mental health aspects still impress today, and so the second is definitely on our radar. But is Hellbade 2 coming to Game Pass?</p>



<h2 id="h-will-hellblade-2-launch-on-game-pass">Will Hellblade 2 Launch on Game Pass?</h2>



<p>As a first-party launch, Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2 will absolutely launch on Game Pass on day one. You can play Hellbade 2 via Game Pass on May 21, so long as you have an active subscription. </p>



<p>If you have the Ultimate Plan for PC and Xbox, then you can play Hellblade 2 on either system without paying the retail price. An Ultimate Plan goes for $16.99/month, which is an absolute steal considering the number of quality titles available to download and play.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-does-senua-s-saga-hellblade-2-play">How Does Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2 Play?</h2>



<p>If you’ve never played the first Hellblade, you’re in for a bit of surprise with the sequel. It’s an action-adventure with a third-person perspective in which you take on the role of Senua. She’s a Viking facing horrors both externally and internally.</p>



<p>One of the most significant selling points of the Hellblade franchise is its portrayal of mental health. You see, Senua suffers from psychosis, which she believes is a curse on her people. During regular gameplay, you’ll hear voices and see things in the environment, but they’re not genuinely present. It’s an engaging gameplay mechanic that alters how you interact with the world and characters.</p>

This was by far Microsoft's biggest acquisition ever.</p><p>Ever since Microsoft's deal to buy Activision Blizzard was announced in January 2022, many have wondered if new or catalog Call of Duty games would arrive on Game Pass. That still hasn't happened, though. The Call of Duty franchise is a sales juggernaut, with its games regularly ranking as among the best-selling games of the year. Putting new Call of Duty games on Game Pass could interrupt this in some way, many have theorized, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-on-game-pass-is-not-guaranteed-microsoft-having-internal-debates-about-it-report/1100-6523291/" data-ref-id="1100-6523291">Microsoft itself was said to be debating what to do. </a></p><p>The new Call of Duty game for 2024 has not yet been announced, but a reveal could happen anytime now, if historical trends follow. 2023's Modern Warfare III, for example, was announced in August 2023, though many believe this year's game will be announced sooner.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/05/17/despite-speculation-microsoft-will-reportedly-launch-this-years-call-of-duty-on<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Microsoft is reportedly planning to launch this year's Call of Duty on its Xbox Game Pass subscription service, according to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/microsoft-call-of-duty-game-pass-53e8930c"><em>The Wall Stree Journal</em></a>. This follows reports in previous weeks indicating <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/05/09/xbox-reportedly-debating-putting-call-of-duty-on-game-pass-alongside-price-hike">Microsoft and Xbox were mulling over whether or not to launch the next iteration</a> in the franchise on Game Pass, out of fear it might hurt sales.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2023/10/13/microsoft-has-officially-acquired-activision-blizzard-for-69-billion">After acquiring Activision Blizzard for a colossal $69 billion last year</a>, fans and analysts have speculated about how Microsoft will handle the Call of Duty franchise moving forward. It will obviously be a big draw for Xbox Game Pass, pulling in new subscribers, but most every year, the new Call of Duty is the best-selling game of the year – save for last year, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/01/08/hogwarts-legacy-has-sold-more-than-22-million-copies-in-less-than-a-year#:~:text=Hogwarts%20Legacy%20Has%20Sold%20More,Than%20A%20Year%20%2D%20Game%20Informer">where Hogwarts Legacy took that crown</a> – and a Game Pass launch could affect those sales numbers.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UtTd3_2WjEg" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>However, this new report from&nbsp;<em>The Wall Street Journal&nbsp;</em>seemingly clears the air around that topic.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Microsoft plans a major shake up of its video game sales strategy by releasing the coming installment of Call of Duty to its subscription service instead of the longtime, lucrative approach of only selling it a la carte," the story reads.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course, things could change so we'll see what happens. It's likely we'll be learning what the next Call of Duty game is next month as part of the <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/05/08/the-2024-summer-gaming-showcase-schedule">gaming showcase summer</a> that includes <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/05/16/summer-game-fest-to-have-more-than-55-studios-and-publishers-including-playstation">Summer Game Fest</a>, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/04/03/ubisoft-forward-confirmed-for-june-same-week-as-summer-game-fest">Ubisoft Forward</a>, and an <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/04/30/xbox-games-showcase-announced-for-june-followed-by-a-secret-direct-for-a-beloved">Xbox Games Showcase followed by a secret direct</a> that is probably focused on Call of Duty.</p>

            <p>
Microsoft plans to launch this year's Call of Duty via Xbox Game Pass for the first time, in a first for the franchise. 
</p>
<p>
That's according to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/microsoft-call-of-duty-game-pass-53e8930c">The Wall St Journal</a>, which today reported that Microsoft had now made the decision ahead of the game's formal unveiling next month.
</p>
<p>
While Xbox has always brought new first-party games to Xbox Game Pass on day one, and Activision Blizzard is now a Microsoft first-party publisher following the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-has-finally-bought-activision-blizzard">completion of its $68.7bn takeover</a>, there had still been a question mark over whether Call of Duty would be included. 
</p>

<p>
Alongside FIFA, now EA Sports FC, Call of Duty remains one of the most reliable franchises to still sell millions each year - and every year. Including it in Microsoft's subscription service will make a dent in that sales revenue - but it will also undoubtedly help drive sign-ups to the subscription service.
</p>
<p>
Key questions now are whether Xbox Game Pass remains at its current price point, or whether Call of Duty might only be included in a pricier tier.
</p>
<p>"This is the right move for Microsoft because it's a multi-platform title that is being sold for $70 outside of the subscription and because it's a live service title with in game purchases," games industry analyst Daniel Ahmad <a href="https://twitter.com/ZhugeEX/status/1791470465753518402">wrote</a>. "That model can also work for other Xbox first party games."</p>
<p>
This year's Call of Duty remains unannounced, though is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-2024-a-black-ops-title-set-in-the-gulf-war-new-report-claims">widely expected to be a fresh Black Ops entry set in the early 1990s during the Gulf War</a>. Microsoft will detail more about the game next month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-games-showcase-announced-for-june-with-mystery-game-direct">dedicating an entire hour to it following its main Xbox Showcase event on 9th June</a>. 
</p>
<p>
That event, timed during the old E3 week, will also see Microsoft show off some of its other 2024 titles, including Indiana Jones and the Great Circle and Avowed, as well as further off projects. It will also be an oppurtunity for Microsoft to turn the page on a particularly bruising period marked by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-to-lay-off-1900-people-across-xbox-and-activision-blizzard">layoffs</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-reportedly-shipped-five-times-more-ps5-consoles-last-quarter-than-microsoft-did-with-xbox">lacklustre console sales</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-shuts-slew-of-bethesda-studios-including-redfall-hi-fi-rush-developers">Bethesda studio closures</a>, and the decision to begin launching Xbox exclusives on PlayStation and Switch - something which has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-bosses-reportedly-pushing-for-no-red-line-around-which-xbox-games-launch-on-playstation">not been universally popular within the company</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gaming-business-weekly-roundup-may-17th<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's time for a look at what's been happening on the business side of the gaming industry this week, and sadly, the ongoing wave of layoffs and studio closures has continued.</p>

<p>Some studios have closed down, while others have seen staff departures or changes in personnel. It's been a busy week for the industry, so let's take a look at what's been going on!</p>

<h3>Square Enix staffers hit by layoffs</h3>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/powerwash-simulator-gaming-business-roundup.jpg?itok=IXafmLkL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/powerwash-simulator-gaming-business-roundup.jpg?itok=d3dsGIzN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Square Enix has laid off some Collective employees.</figcaption></figure><p>Reports <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/square-enix-confirms-us-eu-layoffs-as-part-of-restructuring/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">emerged this week</a>&nbsp;that&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth&nbsp;</em>publisher Square Enix will lay off a number of employees across its publishing and IT departments, as well as the Square Enix Collective indie label, which is responsible for&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator</em>&nbsp;(among other games).</p>

<p>The news came in the same week that the studio declared a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/square-enix-financials-profits-down">70% drop in profits</a> on a year-over-year basis, with a large part of that loss coming as part of a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/square-enix-140m-loss-shakeup">pipeline shakeup</a> involving multiple cancellations.</p>

<p>The company also <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1791067904534057070" rel="noopener" target="_blank">rebranded its Creative Business Unit III studio</a> this week, renaming it to Creative Studio III. It's a much catchier name!</p>

<h3>More layoffs at&nbsp;<em>Palia&nbsp;</em>developer Singularity 6</h3>

<p>After laying off <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palia-developer-singularity-6-layoffs">"around 35 percent" of its staff</a> earlier this year,&nbsp;<em>Palia&nbsp;</em>studio Singularity 6 has once again been hit by the layoff wave.</p>

<p>The studio <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-palia-studio-singularity-6-lays-off-36-employees" rel="noopener" target="_blank">told Game Developer this week</a> that 36 staff members, or around 40% of its remaining staff, have been laid off in order to help the studio navigate a "tough economic period".</p>

<h3><em>Conan Chop Chop&nbsp;</em>dev Mighty Kingdom cuts almost 30% of staff</h3>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/conan-chop-chop-mighty-kingdom.jpg?itok=EsdI_rby 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/conan-chop-chop-mighty-kingdom.jpg?itok=XA6gZKWR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Several Mighty Kingdom employees were axed this week.</figcaption></figure><p>Mighty Kingdom, the studio responsible for games like&nbsp;<em>Conan Chop Chop&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Star Trek Lower Decks: The Badgey Directive</em>, also announced layoffs this week.</p>

<p>The company <a href="https://x.com/MightyKingdom/status/1789819762052116621" rel="noopener" target="_blank">said on X (formerly Twitter)</a> that a "restructuring" has resulted in "a 28% reduction in our workforce", a decision the studio says it made with a heavy heart.</p>

<h3><em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Fae Farm&nbsp;</em>studio Phoenix Labs gets gutted</h3>

<p>Phoenix Labs, the studio responsible for the&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter</em>-esque&nbsp;<em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>and the cozy farming sim&nbsp;<em>Fae Farm</em>, has been hit hard by layoffs and restructuring as well.</p>

<p>Per ex-UX lead <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7196914989192933376-H9Kq/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Noah Watkins</a>, Phoenix Labs has laid off all staff currently working on unreleased projects and has canceled those projects too. Dev <a href="https://x.com/KneehighPark/status/1791149869161210218" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Shaan Joshi</a>&nbsp;corroborates this info.</p>

<p>Furthermore, principal engineer Kris Morness <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kris-morness_phoenix-labs-was-acquired-by-forte-over-a-activity-7196912654806835200-eeAv/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reveals</a> that Phoenix Labs was bought up by blockchain company Forte "over a year ago", and that today's cancellations and layoffs come from Forte.</p>

<h3><em>Drag Her!&nbsp;</em>is canceled and its dev team is no more</h3>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/drag-her-gaming-business.jpg?itok=7eb7nWYX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/drag-her-gaming-business.jpg?itok=rvcaF7_7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Drag Her!&nbsp;</em>has been canceled, sadly.</figcaption></figure><p>Fighting Chance Games, developer of drag queen fighting game&nbsp;<em>Drag Her!</em>, <a href="https://x.com/dragherthegame/status/1790774142947532929" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced this week</a> that the project has been canceled and the studio has been shut down.</p>

<p>According to Fighting Chance, a "groundswell of audience support", as well as a fully-funded Kickstarter campaign and a number of other things in&nbsp;<em>Drag Her!</em>'s favor, haven't resulted in a publishing deal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, a free version of&nbsp;<em>Drag Her!</em>, which includes three queens, a local versus mode, and online multiplayer, is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2446820/Drag_Her/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">available right now on Steam</a>.</p>

<h3>Gameloft closes down its Cluj-Napoca, Romania branch</h3>

<p><em>Disney Dreamlight Valley&nbsp;</em>developer Gameloft revealed this week that it will close down its Cluj-Napoca branch, leaving over 130 employees jobless.</p>

<p>The company confirmed this news in a statement given to <a href="https://dorusupeala.ro/concedieri-in-masa-la-gameloft-200-de-oameni-dati-afara-la-cluj/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Romanian news writer&nbsp;Doru Supeala</a>, who also speculates that the studio's Bucharest office could be in trouble as well.</p>

<h3>Unity Create head Marc Whitten resigns</h3>

<p>Marc Whitten, the head of Unity Create (the department that heads up Unity's engine and editor segments), is quitting at the start of June.</p>

<p>That's according to an <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001810806/eec3d75b-73a1-4c25-8c37-a1b6a6f679c8.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SEC filing</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/unity-create-boss-marc-whitten-is-resigning" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Game Developer</a>), which also confirms Whitten will remain at Unity until December 31st. Unlike former CEO <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unity-ceo-john-riccitiello-retiring-after-runtime-fee-controversy">John Riccitello</a>, Whitten did not resign following Unity's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unity-developers-outraged-after-major-pricing-change">runtime fee controversy</a> last year.</p>

<h3>IO Interactive gets a new CTO</h3>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/io-interactive-new-cto-hitman.jpg?itok=ZD5iw8GB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/io-interactive-new-cto-hitman.jpg?itok=954Uq5mR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>IO Interactive has a new CTO, who may or may not be Agent 47 in disguise.</figcaption></figure><p>This week,&nbsp;IO Interactive, best known for the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/io-interactive-new-studio"><em>Hitman&nbsp;</em>series and its upcoming <i>James Bond&nbsp;</i>game</a>, hired a new chief technology officer.</p>

<p>Ulas Karademir joins the company from RealityOS, but he's also worked at Unity and, uh, IO Interactive, where he was an employee between 2007 and 2014.</p>

<h3>Starbreeze reports a loss for Q1, appoints a new interim CEO</h3>

<p><em>Payday&nbsp;</em>developer Starbreeze has reported a 21 million SEK (roughly $2 million) loss for the first quarter of 2024, according to an <a href="https://corporate.starbreeze.com/en/press/press-releases/2024-05-14-starbreeze-ab-publ-interim-report-january-march-2024/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">interim report</a> published earlier this week.</p>

<p>The studio has also <a href="https://corporate.starbreeze.com/en/press/press-releases/2024-05-15-starbreeze-ab-appoints-a-new-interim-ceo/">appointed a new interim CEO</a>&nbsp;in the form of Mats Juhl, who replaces previous interim CEO&nbsp;Jürgen Goeldner following the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-studios-ceo-steps-down">departure of former CEO Tobias Sjögren</a> earlier this year.</p>

<h3><em>Granblue Fantasy: Relink&nbsp;</em>developer Cygames opens a new branch</h3>

<p>It's not all doom and gloom in the industry this week, however. Cygames, whose name you might know from&nbsp;<em>Granblue Fantasy: Relink&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising</em>, has opened a new branch.</p>

<p>The studio's new Singapore arm follows the establishment of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/granblue-studio-cygames-sets-up-new-branches-in-us-and-europe">branches in the US and Europe</a> last year. We'll have to wait and see what Cygames Singapore has in store.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/weirdest-game-of-2024-steam-arctic-eggs<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There I was thinking the strangest game of 2024 already dropped, but I'm here to say: I was dead wrong. That one scene or three from <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-review-id-explain-but-i-dont-think-i-can">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> </em>got nothin' on what <em>Arctic Eggs</em> is cooking.</p>

<p>I stumbled upon this game by accident, but with a name like <em>Arctic Eggs</em>, it certainly piqued my interest. From what I can tell, it once was a game jam entry that turned into a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2763670/Arctic_Eggs/">full release</a>.</p>

<p>That in itself is a selling point for <em>Arctic Eggs</em>, because quite a few game jam titles turn out to be some of the more memorable experiences in gaming.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/arctic-eggs-humor-1.jpg?itok=vvLic8OF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/arctic-eggs-humor-1.jpg?itok=betyhDbf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>He ain't wrong.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Arctic Eggs</em>' Cold Future Is Literal Insanity</h2>

<p>And memorable<em> Arctic Eggs</em> most definitely is. I was not prepared for this absolute nutcase of a cooking game. It's like a fever dream, with its hazy, low-poly graphics and some of the most out-of-pocket NPC dialogue ever. Graphically, it's actually super well done and creates a vibe that few games capture, like a constant stream of weird injected into your monitor.</p>

<p>In <em>Arctic Eggs</em>, your escape attempt from this weird arctic outpost leads to you becoming its latest egg-handling chef. Hungry people abound, and it's your job to cook up whatever they desire. It's not the cooking that stood out to me (at first) but rather how downright <em>odd </em>the dialogue was.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/arctic-eggs-humor.jpg?itok=n2OrU2_E 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/arctic-eggs-humor.jpg?itok=QPH9YOEj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sure bud. Whatever you say.</figcaption></figure><p>Literally everyone in <em>Arctic Eggs</em> is a freak. You've got people spouting the most random string of words, like this one girl comparing cooking to cleaning toilets, or how they used to use my character's nose as a sundial when the power was out. Then in comes folks spouting deep philosophical truths, and I'm just like, "Man, I am not prepared for this."</p>

<p>And I didn't even touch on the subtle worldbuilding the developer injects here and there. This arctic civilization is ruled by the enigmatic Saint of Six Stomachs. Armed guards are everywhere for <em>some</em> reason. Further lore was established as I gutted a fish, with more information flowing on the screen as the knife sunk deeper into this poor creature.</p>

<p>The NPCs themselves look just as wacky as their dialogue. Clearly, we're in this near-future setting, some characters with cybernetic parts and oh god, what is on that guy's face? After a while, you get used to it and the weird becomes normal, but someone will always come back to surprise you with dialogue even more unhinged than the last. Such is life in the future.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/arctic-eggs-cooking.jpg?itok=ZeXQ_A27 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/arctic-eggs-cooking.jpg?itok=i4b1umt7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Oh god, it's an absolute mess.</figcaption></figure><h2>Wait, the Gameplay Is Great, Too?</h2>

<p>Underneath all this humor and oddity is a shockingly well-made game, from <em>Arctic Eggs</em>' music, art design, and most importantly gameplay. You're here to cook for the hungry people of this world, and no demand shall go unfulfilled. Cooking eggs is not sufficient enough, no, you're going to be working with the finest cuisine this world has to offer.</p>

<p>Cooking up eggs is easy enough. You're equipped with a frying pan, and players can adjust the sensitivity of the pan. Things are a little slippery at first and flipping your egg over might take a few times, but before you know it, you've practically earned a Michelin Star. <em>Arctic Eggs</em> has such a simple hook and premise, but it's so very addicting.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/arctic-eggs-cooking-2.jpg?itok=edY_h0ux 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/arctic-eggs-cooking-2.jpg?itok=r2XodxXv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>When you don't say "when" to the Olive Garden cheese grater.</figcaption></figure><p>One of your first requests is an egg and a cigarette. Okay, that's pretty weird, most definitely not sanitary, but who am I to judge? Believe me, though, it gets stranger and stranger. The ingredients you work with are bizarre and add all new challenges to the gameplay.</p>

<p>The wide breadth of ingredients I cooked for these people include, but are not limited to: eggs (obviously), fish in a tin (the tin gets cooked too!), live pufferfish (I thought that killed you?), a whole-ass stingray, beer in the bottle, and whiskey glass and ice cubes. These are all mixed in the singular pan, often creating a culinary disaster.</p>

<p>Really, this is a game you'll have to play for yourself to truly understand. I took a risk playing this game with absolutely zero expectations, and found a veritable goldmine of humor and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/poed-definitive-edition-review-more-like-pooed">eccentricity</a>. So, if you're feeling adventurous, go ahead and dive into the madness that is <em>Arctic Eggs</em>.</p>

<p>To claim that Grand Theft Auto 6 cemented itself as one of the most anticipated upcoming games of all time following its reveal trailer would feel like the understatement of the century. Even today, many years later, Grand Theft Auto V and GTA Online continue to pull in impressive numbers and revenue. It makes sense that we all want to see what’s next. But is GTA 6 delayed?</p>



<h2 id="h-was-grand-theft-auto-6-delayed">Was Grand Theft Auto 6 Delayed?</h2>



<p>Believe it or not, quite the opposite. Recent rumors circulated that Grand Theft Auto 6 would launch in 2026 following a delay. However, Take-Two Interactive fully intends to launch GTA 6 in 2025, specifically during the fall period, most likely between September and November. </p>



<p>Before their insistence, most of us assumed a 2026 release date for GTA 6. It made the most sense, considering how long it takes to develop a game of this size and scope. Plus, there’s the simple matter of money. Take-Two and Rockstar continue to rake in loads of cash from GTA Online’s Shark Cards, netting them more than anyone can count—hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-the-grand-theft-auto-6-release-date">What is the Grand Theft Auto 6 Release Date?</h2>



<p>We don’t know an official release date for the upcoming open-world crime adventure. As mentioned previously, Take-Two and Rockstar Games intend to launch GTA 6 in Fall 2025, which is still more than a year away. During that time, we could see a delay. We’ll likely receive an additional trailer or two, likely a cinematic and a gameplay trailer, along with a release date and pre-order information. But all of that takes time to happen and come together!</p>



<p>We’ll update you the moment we know more about the GTA 6 release date!</p>

<p>The Wall Street Journal is claiming that this year’s Call of Duty title, believed to be Black Ops 6 will be coming to Game Pass.</p>



<p>Past rumours have suggested that Microsoft has been heavily considering the move; however, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/microsoft-call-of-duty-game-pass-53e8930c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">WSJ claims</a> that the company has made a decision.</p>



<p>“Microsoft plans a major shakeup of its videogame sales strategy by releasing the coming installment of Call of Duty to its subscription service instead of the longtime, lucrative approach of only selling it a la carte.”</p>



<p>This isn’t particularly new news, though, as earlier this month Sarah Bond revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-game-pass-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">every first-party game owned by Microsoft will be coming to Game Pass</a>, including Call of Duty.Microsoft finalized its&nbsp;$68.7 billion&nbsp;deal to acquire Activision Blizzard in late 2023, with the publisher now owning the IP of Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, Diablo, and more. </p>



<p>Black Ops 6 will have an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-black-ops-6-reveal-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in-depth deep-dive</a> following the Xbox Games Showcase on June 9.</p>



<p>According to recent leaks, the pre-order bonus for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 includes a brand-new operator for Modern Warfare 3—Woods. The iconic hero from the single-player campaign of the past few Black Ops titles returns, albeit a bit older and more gruff overall. He’s certainly seen better days, obviously, with scars and wrinkles littering his face.</p>



<p>Will you be picking up Black Ops 6 on Game Pass? Let us know down below!</p>

        <p>25-year-old UK esports event was scheduled to return in September, sales of tickets to RuneFest postponed</p>

    </div>


  

    

</header>  <div>



            <p>Player1 Events has reportedly laid off an unknown number of staff, believed to be the majority of the company, and shut down long-running UK video games event Insomnia Gaming Festival.</p>
<p><a href="https://esports-news.co.uk/2024/05/14/player1-events-layoffs-insomnia/">Esports News UK</a> reported that several former employees of Player1 Events have shared news of the redundancies online.</p>
<p>Sources told <em>GamesIndustry.biz </em>the layoffs included the entire sales and marketing team, with some suggesting the company itself has shut down. We have also heard Insomnia Gaming Festival will not return.</p>
<p><em>GamesIndustry.biz </em>has been reaching out for comment but has yet to receive a response.</p>
<p>Esports News UK also reported that all but one of the company's directors have resigned over the past nine years, most within the last five.</p>
<p>On the Companies House listing for Supernova Events and Esports Ltd, which encompasses Player1, only co-founder and CEO Paul Wedgwood is an active director. He was appointed to the role on April 16, 2024 — the same day that financial controller Nicole Avery and group CFO Christopher Sharp, the two remaining directors, resigned.</p>
<p>The last Insomnia Gaming Festival event, i72, took place between March 28 to April 1. Esports News UK was told that some contractors and freelancers who worked this event have yet to be paid.</p>
<p>It is unclear what the layoffs and shutdown of Insomnia mean for other Player1-organised events, such as RuneFest, the fan festival for Jagex's fantasy MMO RuneScape.</p>
<p>RuneFest was due to return from September 7 to 8, 2024, and 1,000 additional tickets were due to be made available on Wednesday, May 15. But the company announced the day before <a href="https://x.com/RuneFest/status/1790442657853915447">via social media</a> that it was postponing ticket sales "due to unforeseen circumstances."</p>
<p>More than 70 Insomnia events have run over the past 25 years. The shows took places primarily at Birmingham NEC and were the biggest independent esports events on the calendar. They also featured playable games and appearances from well-known influencers and content creators.</p>
<p>Insomnia was started by Multiplay, which was <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/uk-retailer-game-acquires-multiplay">acquired by UK retailer GAME in 2015</a> and the events division was later rebranded to Player1 Events. This segment was <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/game-sells-insomnia-gaming-festival-organiser-to-supernova-capital">acquired by Supernova Capital in 2021</a>.</p>
<p>Insomnia's collapse leaves EGX and WASD as the UK's main consumer shows. WASD took place in April in London, while <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/egx-and-mcm-come-together-for-2024">EGX is co-locating with MCM</a> in October this year.</p>

<p data-characters="334" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">When you think about the age of <em>Minecraft</em>, it’s tempting to just round up to it being roughly a decade old, maybe a little bit more. Despite its huge impact on the gaming industry – retaining a dominant position for years – it’s easy to forget that Mojang’s sandbox sensation is older than many of us can recall.</p> <p data-characters="324" data-current-count="324" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wikipedia</a> has it down as a game that came out in 2011, which would make it around 13 years old (or it will be in November). That puts it on par with <em>Skyrim</em>. But that’s just taking into account the final release. Just before that, <em>Minecraft</em> had a beta version and before that still, it was very much in its alpha phase.</p> <figure data-current-count="624" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Minecraft is turning 15 | Come celebrate with us!" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LKw_2rj7hLc?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="434" data-current-count="434" data-injectable="true">That particular build of the game was released unto the world on May 17, 2009. That puts it at roughly 15 years old, at the time of this writing. The story goes that over on <a href="https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=6273.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TIG Forums</a>, a user called Notch (a name we’re all familiar with now – not always for the best reason, it has to be said) uploaded a Java applet for an early version of a game they’d been working on. The game in question was, of course, <em>Minecraft</em>.</p>
 <p data-characters="316" data-current-count="316" data-injectable="false">To celebrate this momentous occasion (how many other games can say they’re still going strong after a decade and a half?), developer Mojang has launched a 15-day celebration. The video above gives us a glimpse of what’s to come, which includes deals, discounts, and surprises, all kicking off from today.</p> <h2 id="h-such-humble-beginnings" data-injectable="false">Such humble beginnings</h2> <p data-characters="226" data-current-count="542" data-injectable="true">The most interesting thing about that original forum post was what others thought of this newfangled thing called “mine…craft.” Other users were quite enthused by this alpha build of some one-person project. </p>
 <p data-characters="475" data-current-count="475" data-injectable="true">People seemed to enjoy the building mechanics, while others uploaded photos of some of the structures they’d been working on. I also love that one user that simply says, “THIS IS THE BEST GAME I’VE PLAYED EVER! BETTER THAN SPELUNKY!” One other person said, “Well, when an alpha keeps drawing me back to play it, you know you’ve got something good.” These comments go on for 96 pages, with the last message being posted in April 2017.</p>
 <p data-characters="332" data-current-count="332" data-injectable="false">Praise indeed, but little did these people realize just how enormous the game would become. <em>Minecraft</em>‘s sole creator took inspiration from Bullfrog’s comically dark ’90s RTS game <em>Dungeon Keeper</em>, an obscure block-based game called <em>Infiniminer</em>, and a bit of <em>Dwarf Fortress</em>, and put it all into their passion project.</p> <p data-characters="343" data-current-count="675" data-injectable="true">You don’t need me to tell you the rest of the story. <em>Minecraft</em> has gone down as one of the best-selling video games of all time, second only to <em>Tetris</em>. By October 2023, it had <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/minecraft-has-sold-300-million-copies/">sold more than 300 million copies</a> since launch. While <a href="https://tetris.com/about-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Tetris</em> boasts a staggering 540 million copies</a>, that game has had a lot longer to rack up such huge numbers.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Minecraft – Shape Your World" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9aDWhUJdYDk?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="243" data-current-count="543" data-injectable="true">In terms of sales alone, <em>Minecraft</em> is more successful than <em>GTA 5</em>, <em>Skyrim</em>, <em>Wii Sports</em>, and <em>Mario Kart 8</em>. And all this began from a single post on a forum which encouraged people to try out an alpha build of a new game from an unknown developer.</p>
 <p data-characters="198" data-current-count="198" data-injectable="false">It’s fun to see what everyone thought of that simple build 15 years ago, as well as the plans Notch was making for future versions (which included the Creative Mode and Survival Mode staples).</p> <p data-characters="318" data-current-count="516" data-injectable="true">Since then there have been a number of spin-offs, such as <em>Minecraft Stories</em>, <em>Minecraft Dungeons</em>, as well as plenty of ports of the OG game, including on mobile. There’s even been an episode of the <em>Simpsons</em> that parodied the visuals in one of the episode’s openings, plus a parody of the game in <em>South Park</em>.</p>
 <p data-characters="406" data-current-count="406" data-injectable="true">Look, maybe <em>Minecraft</em> isn’t quite as in the mainstream limelight as it once was. Since Microsoft bought the IP back in 2014, it’s become a much bigger beast, but it sort of feels like it’s plateaued now. Doesn’t seem like it could possibly get any bigger. However, <a href="https://www.searchlogistics.com/learn/statistics/minecraft-user-statistics/#:~:text=Minecraft%20Key%20Statistics,-Minecraft%27s%20growth%20made&amp;text=Minecraft%20has%20over%20166%20million,revenue%20in%2Dgame%20sales%20alone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">statistics show</a> that millions of people are still logging in on a monthly basis, so it must be doing something right.</p>
 <p data-characters="532" data-current-count="532" data-injectable="true">Again, all this from a game that’s a decade and a half old. What was I doing back then? I was about to graduate from university. I was about to be spat out into the real world during an economic crisis (yes, another one). The PS3 and Xbox 360 generation of consoles were halfway into their respective lifecycles.

<p>Ghost of Tsushima: Director’s Cut is finally available on Steam, marking yet another PlayStation-exclusive title making its way onto PC platforms worldwide. It has enjoyed a relatively positive reception, securing more than <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2215430/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">57,000 peak concurrent players</a> and narrowly edging out Horizon Zero Dawn, the first PlayStation game that was introduced to Steam a couple of years ago.</p>



<p>However, the launch of Ghost of Tsushima: Director’s Cut on PC hasn’t been a walk in the park, as many players have reported some teething issues.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-finding-balance">Finding Balance</h2>



<p>Ghost of Tsushima is performing well enough on PC, pulling in a slew of positive reviews – but some users are experiencing some irritating issues that are making them regret their purchase. On Steam, users have reported crashes and connection issues, and while the former issue is thought to be tied to certain hardware configurations, the connection issues are in part linked with the PSN account controversy.</p>



<p>Aside from Sucker Punch addressing the successful launch of Ghost of Tsushima: Director’s Cut, nothing else has been said by the firm, leading some users to wonder if they’ll ‘acknowledge’ the issues.</p>



<p>Fans of Ghost of Tsushima were sent into a spiral recently when Ubisoft revealed Assassin’s Creed: Shadows, which on the surface boasts many similar mechanics and elements when compared with Tsushima. Ghost of Tsushima may have done so well at launch because the new trailer for AC Shadows got gamers excited to experience a samurai-based adventure – which is what they’re getting in droves in Ghost of Tsushima.</p>

        <p>The move has provoked criticism, but the ethos this has created at PlayStation has largely been a force for good</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Sony announced its <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/playstation-full-year-revenues-rise-to-275-billion-but-narrowly-misses-ps5-sales-target">full-year results for 2023 earlier this week</a>, with the PlayStation business posting continued solid growth that was basically in line with its revised estimates from a few months ago, albeit significantly undershooting the sky-high estimates it had originally forecast at the start of the year.</p>
<p>As ever, there were various interesting bits and pieces in the results – I'm personally always struck by the long-term story Sony's financials tell of PlayStation's ever-growing dominance of the company's business – but the aspect of the annual financial report that seems to have stirred up the most interest is not in the substance of the details reported, but rather in their framing.</p>
<p>Specifically, during the results presentation, Sony senior vice president Naomi Matsuoka discussed the growth of operating income in the Games &amp; Network Services division which houses PlayStation by mentioning a shift in internal strategic thinking – away from unit sales and hardware attach rate, and towards metrics of time spent on the console and its services.</p>
<p>In framing the business in this way, the company sparked off an admittedly predictable storm in the commentariat, who are hair-trigger primed to expect the worst from companies in terms of live-service and monetisation strategies when they hear terms like this.</p>
<p>In this instance, though, I think the concerns whipped up by Sony's statements missed the mark by quite a margin. People are understandably worried that a shift away from looking at unit sales and towards measuring engagement time instead will create a set of perverse incentives for Sony that will erode its interest in selling monolithic games that don't have a service component, for example – which would certainly be a great loss, since that's arguably the thing that Sony does best, and its first-party output in that category has been the solid backbone of PlayStation for more than a decade.</p>
<blockquote><p>Unit sales no longer capture the PlayStation business in its totality</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, Sony wasn't really making a forward-looking statement about strategy here, so much as explaining a historic change.</p>
<p>The shift in thinking happened around the transition from PS3 to PS4, with attach rate being the holy grail of console success metrics up to the PS3 era, and minutes of engagement replacing it from that point onwards. In other words, the lion's share of Sony's "golden era" of first-party studio output has come during the time when the company was already chasing engagement rather than attach rate, to no apparent detriment.</p>
<p>Stepping back from the controversy caused by the comments and considering them on their own merits, it's hard to argue that engagement time shouldn't be considered a vital indicator for PlayStation.</p>
<p>It's not like software unit sales aren't still important – the company reports those every quarter as one of the headline figures for the gaming division – but unit sales no longer capture the PlayStation business in its totality, since there are now all sorts of ways people could be interacting with PlayStation software and services without actually buying a game in the traditional sense.</p>
<p>At some point quite a few years ago, the company realised that it achieved better growth overall if it focused on that metric rather than just chasing unit sales; this isn't new, it's just that it hasn't been focused on to quite the same extent in the company's financial results before now.</p>
<p>Sony has essentially been thinking about its business like this since the PS4 era, then, and while its current interest in service-based games definitely fits that focus – driven in no small part, I think, by the extent to which Genshin Impact has been the biggest third-party driver for the platform in recent years – there's no suggestion that it doesn't think games like God of War or Spider-Man also fit with this paradigm, or that games like that aren't still the core driver for Sony's first-party line-up in the future.</p>
<p>It's just that the paradigm is a bit broader now; it includes games people interact with for years on end (like the aforementioned Genshin Impact, or Fortnite, or Bungie's Destiny), and ways of accessing games that don't involve a direct purchase, like PS Plus subscriptions.</p>
<p>In some regards, the broader understanding of the PlayStation business suggested by a time-based rather than unit-based metric is reminiscent, in a funhouse mirror kind of way, of the ambitions of the Kutaragi-era PlayStation business.</p>
<p>In that era, Sony harboured far-from-secret ambitions to make PlayStation into the central hub for a household's media and entertainment – a device that far exceeded the bounds of simply playing games, and that directly challenged the then-nascent dominance of the home computer in those areas.</p>
<p>This was, more or less, the exact reason why Microsoft felt compelled to enter the console market in the first place, throwing the company's weight behind the quite maverick Xbox project in an attempt to ensure that Sony didn't gain a lead in what both companies assumed would be the battle for the future of consumer electronics.</p>
<p>They were both wrong, because smartphones ultimately pulled the rug out from underneath that entire vision of the future, but the ambition of that era still lingers to some degree – even if its most obvious recent emanation was the disastrous attempt to make the Xbox One into some kind of TV-watching powerhouse device.</p>
<p>Sony's focus now is dramatically narrower and more realistic. The PlayStation is still first, foremost, and almost exclusively a gaming device in the company's current thinking – but the definition of gaming has broadened considerably in the intervening years.</p>
<p>Sony now sees PlayStation as the core of the home entertainment experience once again, not because the console has become the hub device for all sorts of other media consumption, but because it sees gaming taking increasing time from other mediums and thus PlayStation having the potential to take time from other platforms.</p>

 </a>
<figcaption>The PlayStatin Portal makes far more sense if you think about the objective being to maximise engagement time</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In this mode of thinking, tracking time spent across PlayStation software and services – including, increasingly, PlayStation games and services on other hardware platforms – is the only way to really measure success. Part of that vision for the expansion of gaming absolutely involves service-based games and online games that bring players back regularly, spurring steady revenue streams as they do so, but that's only one aspect.</p>
<p>"Pillar" games that sell the platform are another – an equally if not more important aspect. What's really interesting, though, is how many of Sony's decisions on hardware and services start to make more sense when considered in the context of increasing engagement time.</p>
<p>Being time-focused rather than unit-focused also expresses itself in terms of lowering barriers to access and removing friction in players' engagement. For example, the incredible amount of work Sony put into ensuring that the PS5's SSD would be as fast as possible makes more sense when you see it fuelled by a desire to reduce friction to a minimum.</p>
<blockquote><p>Sony's focus now is narrower and more realistic. The PlayStation is almost exclusively a gaming device in the company's current thinking – but the definition of gaming has broadened in the intervening years</p></blockquote>
<p>Eliminating load delays as much as possible means letting people quickly dive into a game and play for a bit when they have just a little free time, whereas tediously long load delays would likely push them to find something else to fill their time instead.</p>
<p>Similarly, the PS Portal device – a beautiful piece of hardware that many people, myself included, tend to view as a solution in search of a problem – makes far more sense if you think about the objective being to remove barriers (like someone else using the living room TV) and maximise engagement time.</p>
<p>All the same, we can't pretend that an excessive focus on minutes played – rather than units sold – lacks potential downsides. The whole reason why people reacted so negatively to Sony's framing is because we've all had far too many experiences of low-quality live service games in recent years, which stand as a grim testament to the fact that the temptation to juice engagement and revenue numbers with loot boxes and copy-pasted grind is ever-present, and even great developers can sometimes fall down that hole.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the engagement-focused paradigm Sony is talking about is the one it's followed through more than a decade of incredibly high quality first party game output – and from a service and hardware engineering standpoint, reducing friction and barriers to access is a worthy goal in itself, whether that's through hardware tweaks or through new service offerings (the fantastic PS4 hits catalogue that Sony made available to new PS5 owners springs to mind here as a service clearly designed to increase engagement on the new platform).</p>
<p>The risk of turning the monetisation dial up too high on these efforts will never go away; but a general organisational focus on making hardware, software, and services that people want to spend more and more time on isn't a bad thing by any means.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/is-xbox-game-pass-out-of-steam<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>From its very inception, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/xbox-and-microsoft-winning-e3-2019-and-maybe-next-generation-of-gaming">Xbox Game Pass sounded like a fantastical business model</a> and a dream come true for hardcore game enthusiasts. After all, who wouldn't want access to hundreds of games at a fraction of the cost? Even Microsoft seemed to wholeheartedly embrace Game Pass, though it almost certainly costs them a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/ps5-xbox-series-x-game-pass">pretty penny to maintain the catalogue</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-smaller-games-comment-hi-fi-rush">recent events would suggest</a> that Microsoft has dug themselves into a hole of sorts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first issue is that Microsoft has to keep people hooked onto Game Pass for months in order to make money. This would necessitate more games, which would in turn require more subscriptions, and so on and so forth.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/call-of-duty-mw3-snoop.jpg?itok=n_CSJzeK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/call-of-duty-mw3-snoop.jpg?itok=LyL80srs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>On second thought, maybe this skin alone is worth billions of dollars</figcaption></figure><p>To be fair, Microsoft appears to be handling this matter relatively well. As of February 2024, there are supposedly&nbsp;<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/02/15/xbox-promise-bring-more-games-to-more-players/">about 34 million Xbox Game Pass subscribers</a>. If accurate, this figure shows that about <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/2022/01/18/microsoft-to-acquire-activision-blizzard-to-bring-the-joy-and-community-of-gaming-to-everyone-across-every-device/">10 million new subscribers joined up over the past two years</a>.</p>

<p>Therefore, we can safely assume that Game Pass can bring in an absolute upper limit of approximately $6 billion in revenue per year. Actual income would undoubtedly be far lower though as it's hard to imagine that AAA games from EA and Ubisoft, among others, would be cheap.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Xbox Game Pass and the Activision Blizzard sized hole</h2>

<p>The second, more pressing problem is that during those two years, Microsoft <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-activision-blizzard-merger-finalized">spent a mind blowing $75.4 billion to purchase Activision Blizzard</a>. Needless to say, Game Pass isn't going to recoup those billions on its own any time soon, especially now that Microsoft has to foot the game development bill for all of its new first-party studios as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In theory, it's not an issue of if Xbox can make back that $75.4 billion but rather when. They certainly have the talent at their disposal and the resources, not to mention dozens of well-known IPs. Game Pass also gives them the unique ability to keep people continuously engaged with a reserve force of third-party games, which have thus far kept the program afloat.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In reality, Xbox's first-party studios haven't exactly met consumer expectations, and it's not a recent phenomenon. <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/halo-infinite-review"><em>Halo Infinite</em></a> might be the most prolific example in that the core gameplay was almost universally praised, yet ultimately hampered by the dreadful post-launch support.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Xbox's other IPs haven't really stepped up to the spotlight either. It's been five years since the last main <em>Gears </em>entry, the <em>Perfect Dark </em>reboot is nowhere to be found, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/forza-motorsport-review-heavy-metal-mercy"><em>Forza Motorsport</em></a>&nbsp;was stuck in second gear, and Rare is seemingly shackled to <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/sea-of-thieves"><em>Sea of Thieves</em></a>. The only company that seems to be flourishing creatively is Obsidian as their recent games have been both varied and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/pentiment-review">relatively well received</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hi-fi-rush-meeting.jpg?itok=Z7AsDCo8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hi-fi-rush-meeting.jpg?itok=NaFuNNBT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This is <em>probably </em>not how Tango Gamework's workers found out that they got fired</figcaption></figure><h2>Xbox Game Pass Without the Xbox Games</h2>

<p>To make matters worse, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-shutdown">Microsoft recently closed some of their studios as well</a>. On May 7, Arkane Austin, Alpha Dog Studios, Tango Gameworks, and Roundhouse Games shut down. Of these four companies, it seems like the workers at Roundhouse Games fared the best as they are supposedly being integrated into ZeniMax Online Studios to work on <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/elder-scrolls-online"><em>The Elder Scrolls Online</em></a>.</p>

<p>The workers at the other three studios weren't as fortunate. Alpha Dog Studios was the smallest of the three and was exclusively a mobile game developer. Arkane Austin was responsible for <em>Prey </em>and <em>Redfall</em>, though most of the workers who developed <em>Prey </em>had already left by the time <em>Redfall </em>launched.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/prey-gloo-gun_0.jpg?itok=qpktpft2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/prey-gloo-gun_0.jpg?itok=KJu3Ehqz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>In retrospect, a <em>Prey </em>sequel would've been a good way to show off current-gen consoles.</figcaption></figure><p>While you can argue that the fate of Alpha Dog Studios and Arkane Austin was driven by practicality given their track record, Tango Gamework's closure was highly controversial and for good reason. Tango was the developer of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/review/evil-within-review-too-many-cooks"><em>The Evil Within</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/evil-within-2-review-evil-never-felt-so-good"><em>The Evil Within 2</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/ghostwire-tokyo"><em>Ghostwire: Tokyo</em></a> and most notably, <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em>.&nbsp;With such a selection of games, you'd think that Tango Gameworks was a match made in heaven for Xbox.</p>

<p>Indeed, it's hard to imagine a more perfect game for Game Pass than <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em>. Even if it wasn't the best-selling game of all time, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/hi-fi-rush-review"><em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> was a very unique game with great art direction, fantastic music, and novel gameplay mechanics</a>. Most importantly, the story wasn't oppressively long, ideal for programs like Game Pass where you might have a huge backlog to work through.</p>

<p>The worst part is that Tango Gameworks' closure will undoubtedly cause other developers to have second thoughts. The entire assumed purpose of partnering with Microsoft is for the relative financial stability to pursue more creative games. These possibly niche games are then able to reach a larger audience via Game Pass, where everyone wins.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/plague-tale-requiem-corridor_0.jpg?itok=eK_nGTFP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/plague-tale-requiem-corridor_0.jpg?itok=UqfAc8qj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If it weren't for Xbox Game Pass, would games like <em>A Plague Tale: Requiem</em> be as popular?</figcaption></figure><p>If <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> wasn't enough to save Tango Gameworks' workers, then what's next? Will <em>Hellblade 2</em> cause Ninja Theory to meet the same fate years down the line? Is Double Fine at risk because <em>Psychonauts </em>isn't making piles of money?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thus, the permanent and insoluble contradictions between art and capitalism have been brought to the forefront. Microsoft clearly desires a monopoly in all but name, inevitably causing stagnation and decay. How else would you describe the relatively tepid state of Xbox when they have a trillion-dollar company backing them and dozens upon dozens of studios and IPs to draw from?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Better yet, we should probably be asking what kind of savings can possibly come from firing a few hundred talented people when billions were just spent on the largest acquisition in gaming history. This is living proof that the interests of capitalists and workers are diametrically opposed, no matter how many crumbs fall from the table of the capitalists to the workers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Again, there's no real doubt that Microsoft can make back $75.4 billion eventually. Yet Microsoft's recent moves give the impression that they feel like they're not going to make that money back fast enough. There's no other reasonable or publicly available explanation as to why Tango Gameworks of all studios would be cut loose. If anything, it just makes Xbox look confused and directionless at best, sustained to an embarrassing degree by their third-party Game Pass partnerships.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24158466/afterlove-ep-fahmi-memory-pikselnesia<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="A1TvCA">Indonesian indie game studio Piknelsia was in the middle of development on its rhythm-based visual novel <em>Afterlove EP</em> when it received the devastating news: <a href="https://sea.ign.com/sea-indie-games/183524/news/coffee-talk-creator-mohammad-fahmi-passes-away-at-32">Mohammad Fahmi</a>, the studio’s founder and creative director, had died. “When it happened, I remember our character artist, Soyatu, called me around 2 AM in the morning and said, ‘Is Fahmi joking about death again? This time it’s not funny, please tell me that this is not true!’” <em>Afterlove EP</em> game producer Ivor Dwitomo told Polygon.</p>
<p id="Zw2bBQ"><em>Afterlove EP</em> was put on hold indefinitely while the team grieved the loss of their coworker and friend. “No work happened on <em>Afterlove EP</em> during that time, but then we came together, talked about the game’s development, and we all agreed to continue <em>Afterlove EP</em> no matter what,” Dwitomo said. The game is about love and death, set in Jakarta, he said — and Fahmi had outlined a clear vision for the game. The rest of the team wanted to deliver that vision.</p>
<div id="OLfxkw"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u0dSiS5Iay4?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="SlRmdU">Fahmi, the acclaimed creator of Toge Productions’ <em>Coffee Talk</em>, passed away in March 2022. <em>Coffee Talk</em>, released in 2020, is a visual novel and coffee shop simulator centered around a barista working in a fantasy version of Seattle. It’s a game that perfectly evokes the atmosphere of a coffee shop on a rainy day — with some light fantasy elements thrown in. <em>Afterlove EP</em> has a different but still distinct sense of place; it’s set in Jakarta, Indonesia, where Fahmi grew up. The story pulls these three genres together (visual novel, dating sim, and rhythm game), focusing on Rama, a young musician whose girlfriend has just died. </p>
<p id="4fTprt">“With <em>Afterlove EP</em>, Fahmi really wanted to show a slice of life of what it is like to be young and living in the places that he himself grew up and lived in,” Dwitomo said. Game director and programmer Dany added: “And we hope that they will enjoy getting to know our home through the locations and vibe of the characters you meet, whilst if you’re from or know Jakarta, you might find yourself nostalgic for some of the spots we chose to recreate in the game.”</p>

<p id="gCGRWz">Fahmi was very deliberate with his vision for <em>Afterlove EP</em>, and had extensively outlined the game and its characters with lead narrative director Galuh Elsa, who also goes by Sasha. The story and its characters were all in place, Dwitomo said, and the team at Pikselnesia was just beginning to put things in place.</p>
<p id="zBRIWB">“Our big objective as a team after Fahmi passed away has always been to keep the outline aligned with his vision whilst creating all of the content in the game — especially when writing the dialogue and script,” Dwitomo said. “We brought in extra help with the writing and narrative design because there was a lot of actual writing to do. But because Sasha worked so closely on the story outline, characters, and the overall vision with Fahmi, she has been able to be the keeper of all of it and guide the writers to help them stay true to that.”</p>

<p id="YOHNDF">Editing and adjusting the game introduced another layer of difficulty. “Fahmi chose to become part of <em>Afterlove EP</em> for a reason and I don’t want to betray that,” Dwitomo said.</p>
<p id="nJjSjX">“The biggest challenge has been staying true to his vision whilst still being prepared to make changes because, of course, Fahmi would also have made changes and had new ideas as we went on with development,” Dany said. “So we have had to think about what he would do and whether things are in line with his central vision.”</p>
<p id="rjUnPb">Pikselnesia is still working on <em>Afterlove EP</em>, but the studio just <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1599780/Afterlove_EP/">published a demo</a> as part of publisher Fellow Traveller’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/ludonarracon">LudoNarraCon</a>. And the game’s expected to be released this year on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X. </p>
<p id="tGBxGO">“This game is our homage to Fahmi,” Dany said. “Having a game that he designed, envisioned, and worked so hard on and [releasing it] to the world is our best way to do that.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/05/17/2k-will-reveal-the-next-iteration-of-one-of-its-biggest-and-most-beloved-franchises<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>2K will reveal the next iteration of one of its biggest franchises at Summer Game Fest. Fans online are already speculating what it could be, considering some of 2K's biggest franchises are prime for a new game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As for when to expect this new game, the official SGF X (formerly Twitter) account says it will be announced on June 7, during the <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/03/13/this-years-summer-game-fest-streams-live-on-june-7">Summer Game Fest</a> livestream that begins at 2 p.m. PT/5 p.m. ET. That's less than a month away so we don't have to speculate too long on what this mystery iteration could be.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While there are plenty of 2K franchises that fit the bill, our eyes are on three franchises: Borderlands, Mafia, and BioShock.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The last mainline Borderlands entry – Borderlands 3 – hit PlayStation, Xbox, and PC in 2019, and with the <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/gamer-culture/2024/02/21/the-borderlands-movies-first-trailer-looks-as-ridiculous-as-the-games#:~:text=Borderlands%20hits%20theaters%20on%20August%209.&amp;text=Marcus%20is%20an%20avid%20gamer,cartoons%20and%20obscure%20childhood%20references.">live-action&nbsp;<em>Borderlands&nbsp;</em>movie hitting theaters this August</a>, a new game would make sense. However, we did just get <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/new-tales-from-the-borderlands/forgettable-story-unforgettable-characters">New Tales From The Borderlands</a> in 2022, if you're looking for something to play through in that universe.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the Mafia front, the last mainline entry was <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/games/mafia_iii/b/xboxone/archive/2016/10/12/mafia-iii-review.aspx">Mafia III</a> in 2016, although 2K released <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/mafia-definitive-edition/mafia-definitive-edition-review-loyal-to-a-fault">Mafia: Definitive Edition</a> – a remake – in 2020. And <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/08/29/the-next-mafia-game-is-in-development">we know the next Mafia game is in development</a>, too, so it might be time for an announcement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>BioShock has been dormant since <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/games/bioshock_infinite/b/pc/archive/2013/03/25/enjoying-the-view-from-above.aspx">BioShock Infinite</a> in 2013, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/product/bioshock-the-collection">unless you count the 2016 remasters</a>, and we know <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2019/12/09/2k-announces-new-studio-for-the-next-bioshock">2K created Cloud Chamber in 2019</a> to work on the next entry in the franchise. It's been almost five years since then, so SGF seems like a great moment to announce the next BioShock. Speaking of, here's <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/01/03/what-we-want-from-bioshock-4">what we want in a BioShock 4</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>SGF returns to Los Angeles next month, with the live showcase happening on June 7. For more, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/05/16/summer-game-fest-to-have-more-than-55-studios-and-publishers-including-playstation">check out some of the studios, publishers, and partners to be featured during the event</a>, and then check out&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/05/08/the-2024-summer-gaming-showcase-schedule"><em>Game Informer's&nbsp;</em>summer gaming showcase schedule</a>.&nbsp;</p>
