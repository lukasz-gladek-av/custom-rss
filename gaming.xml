            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/disney-lorcana-d23-event-reveals-oswald-pixar-and-rescue-rangers-cards<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This past weekend, Disney held its D23 fan event. It is a major event where The Walt Disney Company reveals its upcoming slate of projects and attractions; everything from new theme park rides to the latest wave of Marvel movies. During the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/disney-lorcana" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Disney Lorcana</em></a> D23 event, they announced their plans for the next two years of their card game.</p>
<h2>The Disney Lorcana D23 Event Announcements</h2>
<p>Every announcement at the <em>Disney Lorcana</em> D23 live event has been collected into a single post on the <a href="https://d23.com/disney-lorcana-deals-out-a-winning-hand-of-big-news/">D23 website</a>.Senior Brand Manager and Disney Lorcana Co-Designer Ryan Miller opened the event remarking on the game's launch, referring to it as "a roller-coaster on a rodeo."</p>

To date, more than 1 billion cards have been sold, that is 131,000 cards sold every hour. The <em>Disney Lorcana</em> <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/disney-lorcana-companion-app-launched-by-ravensburger" rel="noopener" target="_blank">companion app</a> has been downloaded over 400,000 times, and more than 76,000 organized play events have been held worldwide.</p>
<p>The <em>Disney Lorcana</em> D23 event also delves into the game's creative process. This included behind-the-scenes material showcasing the creation of a single Disney Lorcana card.</p>
<p>Last but not least, several new events and cards were announced for Disney Lorcana. Four major regional events are scheduled for the remainder of 2024 in Las Vegas, Nevada, Toronto, Canada, Birmingham, England, and Seattle Washington.&nbsp;Several new <em>Disney Lorcana</em> championships have also been announced:</p>
<ul><li>In December, a European Disney Lorcana Championship will be held at the Disneyland Paris Resort.</li>
<li>In January, a&nbsp;North American Championship will be held at Disneyland Resort</li>
<li>In 2025, a World Championship will be held at Disney World, with the grand prize being a one-of-a-kind golden card featuring Mickey Mouse as the Brave Little Tailor.</li>
</ul><p>Later this year, players can enjoy cards based on Oswald The Lucky Rabbit and <em>Chip 'N Dale Rescue Rangers. </em>As for dark fantasy fans, cards based on <em>The Black Cauldron</em> will arrive in 2025.</p>
<p>Lastly, 2026 will see the release of an official Pocahontas card, and a set of cards based on the stories, characters, and songs by Pixar.</p>

We said ‘Let’s use what they’ve done and build on top of it,’ rather than going our own way.”<br></p><p>The Ubisoft producer added that all of the teams working on various <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>games are “part of the brand” and it’s important that all the studios are talking to each other to avoid “redoing work.” </p><p>“Making games is difficult, it takes a lot of time and passion, and you want to avoid doing the same things but differently,” said Onnée. </p><p>“You want to build on top of work and improve on it. We have a lot of discussions with other teams to make sure if we’re doing similar things, we can collaborate and so if they want to do something afterward, we can take that into account. That’s what we do with our new Anvil pipeline, which is the tech teams working together. When we build new features, we make sure those features are available for all projects.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-wipe-event-nothing-new/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/first-escape-from-tarkov-wipe-event-is-nothing-new.951360/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-wipe-event-nothing-new/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										<p>The first Escape from Tarkov wipe event has kicked off and is in full force worldwide. It’s nothing new, though – it’s something we’ve seen before, and it’s expected that it’ll be joined by other, typical pre-wipe events in due course. The event started after Battlestate Games had posted an image on socials showcasing in-game characters hefting around bags of concrete, and that was enough to give the game away.</p>
<p>For this first event, players will be able to level up their Hideout for nothing more than bottles of Pevko beer. Also, skill levels are climbing at an accelerated rate, which means that players will be able to hit max levels in a fraction of the time as wipe draws ever closer.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Wipe Soon?</h2>
<p>The next Tarkov wipe is on the horizon, and it has been a long time coming. This is officially the longest gap we’ve ever had between wipes at more than 225 days, and players are tired, to say the least. It has been a rocky few months for the Escape from Tarkov universe. First, there was the drama surrounding the release of Tarkov Arena, and then the reveal of The Unheard Edition threw the entire ecosystem into disarray. From the problems with incessant cheating to rampant instability, it has been a hard time to call yourslef a Tarkov fan of late.</p>
<p>But all that’s going to be pushed aside now that the first pre-wipe event has kicked off. It means that players are potentially days away from the all-important wipe that resets everyone’s account and brings hundreds of thousands of players back into the game. Plenty of changes and additions will be coming with the 0.15 patch that’ll come in alongside the wipe, too.</p>
<p>For now, players can take part in this basic event.</p>
<p>https://x.com/tarkov/status/1822928618072236049</p>
<p>To level up your Hideout as quickly as possible, you’ll need to collect Pevko beers. Fortunately, any enemy designated as a ‘Boss’ is now guaranteed to drop them, so you can farm them quite easily. Also, as you adventure across Norvinsk slaying these tougher-than-normal characters, you’ll find that your skill levels are climbing at an eye-watering pace, turning you into a super soldier in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>As stressed, it’s the first pre-wipe event in Tarkov – we can expect much more to come in the next few days.</p>

		<p>It feels weird to not have the Olympics buzzing on my TV, much like the cicadas buzzing outside. (The cicadas, meanwhile, have not left yet.) In fact, Rob and I were so distraught over the endless sports being over that we decided to record a podcast waxing nostalgic over and event that literally concluded over the weekend. Alas. We do plan to watch the paralympicsthis month, so if you have recommendations on athletes to keep track of, events that are particularly interesting, let us know! (P.S. We are aware we've been pretty sports-centric recently.)</p><p>-pk, who cannot f'ing wait for <em>Alien: Romulus</em> later this week</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>MONDAY: </strong>Rob and I have been watching <em>a lot</em> of Olympics the past two weeks, and supercharged by the way the men's and women's basketball teams finished, we decided to double dip on Sports!. (Yes, we talk a little Caleb Williams, too, but we are <em>really really really really</em> trying to play it cool.)</li><li><strong>TUESDAY: </strong>We'll record an episode of HOA early with Janet, talking about Janet's office-to-studio transition, and how it's got someone like me considering a similar pivot this year. You'll hear that episode next week, but during the day, <em>Remap</em>'s football geniuses will join forces to check out the new Madden, in which us playing it <em>really really really</em> cool about Caleb Williams will suddenly be thrust into the spotlight, as we try to win with the Bears.) I think we're also going to spin the wheel to determine the next My Turn episode. If Sports! editing gets gone early, Cado will release it on Tuesday, otherwise...</li><li><strong>WEDNESDAY:</strong> ...Sports! will be released today. We're ditching the days between release. In the past, we dropped Sports! episodes on the main feed a few days later, timed to the Sunday NFL schedule, but it feels weird. The bonus you get for being a paid sub, like Remap Radio, is the podcast without ads. Cado and Rob will also take to the streams to continue motorsport managing.</li><li><strong>THURSDAY: </strong>There will, hopefully, be a letter series that drop sometime this week, but as of this writing, I have not responded to Rob's prompt quite yet. Stay tuned, though. In the meantime, we'll be recording a new Remap Radio.</li><li><strong>FRIDAY:</strong> Remap Radio goes live, amidst my push to finish <em>Dragon's Dogma 2</em>.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-deep-dive-trailer/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stalker-2-team-releases-35-minute-%E2%80%98deep-dive%E2%80%99-trailer.951330/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-deep-dive-trailer/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										<p>GSC Game World has just given fans worldwide the best look at Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl&nbsp;<strong>ever</strong>. In an extended 35-minute walkthrough, the team guides players through various elements of this post-apocalyptic FPS title, which has been developing for over a decade. Outside of the recent leaks that showcased several minutes of rough gameplay, this is the longest and strongest look we’ve had at Stalker 2 since it was announced more than ten years ago.</p>
<p>Recently, the team at GSC Game World revealed yet another delay for the highly anticipated open-world game. In an announcement that went hand-in-hand with a tongue-in-cheek trailer poking fun at all the postponements, it was revealed that the launch of Stalker 2 will be pushed back two months to November 20, 2024.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Everything You’d Want to Know</h2>
<p>Stalker 2 has been coming for a long time, but there’s still a little longer to wait. If it runs well on launch, it’ll be a very well-received game, as some trends have surfaced this year, such as the rampant popularity of the Fallout television series, that have left gamers worldwide <strong>hungry&nbsp;</strong>for a solid post-apocalyptic adventure. Given that it has been several years since the last major Stalker release, it’ll also be a boon for fans of the franchise.</p>
<p>Several key details have been revealed in the massive gameplay walkthrough published today by GSC Game World:</p>
<p><iframe title="S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 Heart of Chornobyl - Developer Deep Dive" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jRLJ3lV-_V8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Firstly, it’s stressed just how wide, open, and diverse ‘The Zone’ will be in Heart of Chornobyl. It’s a staggering world that features&nbsp;<strong>twenty regions</strong>, each of which offers unique elements that encourage open exploration. With that being said, the team has constructed the game from the ground up to give a sense of loneliness and apprehension as the player explores, fully unaware of what might be lingering around the corner.</p>
<p>Despite Stalker 2 being a solid competitor to games like Fallout, there’s no ‘traditional’ levelling system in the game, which restricts the more RPG-focused elements some players might have been hoping for. It’s still Stalker at heart, though – and that means that you’ll still have those survival elements and some resource management to handle.</p>
<p>For instance, you need to manage your inventory to ensure you’re not carrying too much weight. Instead of a typical levelling system, Stalker 2 will unfold like Metro Exodus, with the player needing to explore and dig in all the game’s nooks and crannies to unlock attachments, weapons, equipment, and upgrades.</p>
<p>With a dynamic faction system, a whole host of nasties to battle, a massive open-world map, and countless opportunities to take on side quests and other assorted missions, Stalker 2 looks like the kind of game that you’ll pour&nbsp;<strong>hours&nbsp;</strong>upon&nbsp;<strong>hours&nbsp;</strong>into.</p>

                <p>Nacon's upcoming Terminator game, Terminator: Survivors, will potentially bring the future war to life in a way that gamers have never seen before. But Judgment Day is going to have to wait. Nacon has announced that the game has been pushed back from its PC release date on October 24. Instead, both the PC and console versions of Terminator: Survivors will now be released in 2025.</p><p>Marco Ponte, Nacom's CEO and creative director, released a statement online that explains why the studio felt it needed more time to work on the game.</p><p>"This deferral of the game's release was a tough decision to make, however we believe that this additional time will enable us to ensure that our vision of the post-apocalyptic world of Terminator meets the expected level of quality," said Ponte. "On behalf of the Nacon Studio Milan team, I would like to thank all the players and fans of the franchise for their enthusiastic reception of Terminator: Survivors. We are extremely proud to have this opportunity to work on such an iconic franchise as Terminator, and are eager to reveal more of it to you. Thank you all for support… We’ll be back."</p><p>While the Terminator continuity has been mangled by the last two movies in the franchise, Terminator: Survivors is taking its cues from the first two films. The title is an open-world game set four years after Judgment Day, as humanity is still scrambling after Skynet's attempt to wipe them out. Gamers can play solo or join other players in co-op as they look for resources to build a base and mount an offensive against the machines.</p><p>Naturally, Skynet won't be taking that lying down, and numerous Terminators from the films will be featured in the game.</p>

            <p>
Terminator: Survivors, the open-world Terminator game from Rims Racing developer Nacon Studio Milan, has been delayed, with publisher Nacon having opted to move its previously announced Steam early access launch from this October until sometime in 2025.
</p>
<p>
Terminator: Survivors was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/terminator-resistance-developer-making-new-robocop-game">teased</a> back in 2022, but it wasn't until this February that Nacon <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nacons-open-world-terminator-survivors-heading-to-steam-early-access-in-october">gave it a name</a> and shared first details. It sees players, cast as the titular survivors of humanity's near-extinction on Judgment Day, attempting to "reestablish some semblance of society in a world that seems hell-bent on eliminating... the last vestiges of mankind."
</p>
<p>

More specifically, players - either working solo or co-operatively with up to three friends - must roam Terminator: Survivors' hazardous post-apocalyptic open-world in search of materials, resources, information, and other survivors as they set about establishing a base of operations - all while fending off Skynet's machines and rival factions hunting for the same resources.

<p>
Terminator: Survivors was originally due to launch into <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2617340/Terminator_Survivors/">Steam early access</a> on 24th October, but Nacon has now <a href="https://x.com/SurviveTheT800/status/1823011706836029701">announced a delay</a> on social media. "To realise our vision, and to make sure to deliver the game that fits your expectations," the company wrote, "we need some additional time. Thus we will be pushing the launch to 2025."
</p>
<p>
"We know that this will be a disappointment to many," it continued, "but we want to do right by this universe, its fans, and our community. In the long term we believe this is the right call. We are grateful for your understanding."
</p>
<p>
As previously announced, Terminator: Survivors' Steam early access launch will be followed by a PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S release "at a later date".

<p>Players will be free to roam the large and realistic open world of the real Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, transformed by the fictional Chernobylite material. They will get to create and develop their own hero, with attributes and skills affecting combat effectiveness and the conversation style.</p>
<p>The developers claim the sequel will feature an advanced melee combat system, in addition to a diverse arsenal of firearms. Stealth or calling on others for help are other options available. Each of the main character's buddies is a potential teacher, ready to share their knowledge and skills. Assemble your team and discover the unique strengths and abilities they bring to the table.</p>
<p>Planewalking allows you to change the build and equipment on the fly. Moreover, players are free to develop more than one character skill set. Base expansion is also important, with players able to craft valuable items and upgrade their weapons every day. Assigning tasks to NPCs ensures they will take care of your equipment and supplies.</p>
<p>Throughout Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone, players will fight for influence and negotiate with the game's factions. The Exclusion Zone is a battlefield that changes daily and reacts to your actions.&nbsp; Perhaps the biggest addition is online co-op. Dedicated missions are reportedly embedded in the single player campaign, allowing players to interact with each other in various ways.</p>
<p>We'll keep a close eye on the development of this promising sequel. Stay tuned for more information as the release draws near.</p>

Sony is slashing prices across various games, DLCs, and even some in-game currency. Odds are if you’ve had a game you’ve been eyeing for a while, it might be fairly cheap at the moment. If you’re looking for a fun cooperative game to play with a friend, a lover, or a family member, there are a few cheap, quick games for you two to finish in a night or two on your PS5 through PS4 backwards compatibility. Here are a few co-op games on sale to play on your couch with your player 2.<br></p></div><div><p>While cooperative marriage counseling platformer <em>It Takes Two </em>was the game that got developer Hazelight the most recognition when it won Game of the Year<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/it-takes-two-wins-game-of-the-year-at-the-2021-game-awa-1848067354&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/it-takes-two-wins-game-of-the-year-at-the-2021-game-awa-1848067354"> at the 2021 Game Awards</a></span>, before that, the team released <em>A Way Out</em>. This cooperative action game has to be played with a friend, and you only have to buy it once if you’re playing online, as you can join a friend’s session without owning a copy of the game. It stars two criminals who break out of prison, and the roller coaster ride of cooperative antics doesn’t end there. <em>A Way Out </em>is the kind of co-op game that requires you to communicate, coordinate, and move in a synchronized fashion. Whether it’s climbing back to back through a small space, or one person moving around the world while another talks to an NPC, or playing a game of Connect Four, <em>A Way Out </em>is all about two players working like two arms on one unit, and it makes for a really compelling, sometimes meaningfully frustrating experience to play with a friend. It’s currently <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0006-CUSA07995_00-HAZELIGHTAWAYOUT&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0006-CUSA07995_00-HAZELIGHTAWAYOUT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$5.99 as part of the Summer Sale</a></span>.<br></p></div><div><p>I loved the original <em>Unravel</em> when it launched in 2016, and the sequel takes all the original yarn-based metaphors about the threads that connect people and makes them literal by tethering two yarn-based heroes together. <em>Unravel Two </em>can be played alone, but the gimmick the puzzle-platformer utilizes this time around is that it adds a second “Yarny” character to the mix and ties both heroes together. This means you’ll be navigating gorgeous, sidescrolling environments while also dragging each other across the screen. Sometimes it doesn’t quite feel like it’s made for two people, as it can be completed by swapping back and forth between your two Yarnies, but there’s something special about finishing it alongside a friend, sitting together on the couch for local co-op. <em>Unravel Two </em>is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0006-CUSA10483_00-COLDWOODPIKE0000&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0006-CUSA10483_00-COLDWOODPIKE0000" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">running for $4.99</a></span> during the remainder of the Summer Sale.<br></p></div><div><p>Berzerk Studio’s <em>Just Shapes &amp; Beats </em>is still a staple at plenty of gaming conventions years after it launched in 2018 because it’s such an easy pick-up-and-play experience to dive into with friends. The bullet hell/rhythm game hybrid has you and your friends control small shapes plopped into a visualization of some banger EDM tracks, all while trying to avoid the chaotic obstacles that spawn to the rhythm and melody of the music. I’ve picked up <em>Just Shapes &amp; Beats </em>with friends and colleagues at many a PAX and PlayStation Experience, and I imagine it’s just as much of a hectic hoot with a friend or two on the couch.

In the hour and 46-minute video, Maximilian detailed the mod and its changes in comparison to the game’s original release. </p><p>“The only way you can play other people online with these balance changes is if the other person also has it,” Maximilian said in the video. </p><p>While the mod is still a ways away from being complete, a beta for the game is available to download on <a href="https://gamebanana.com/mods/534185" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>GameBanana</u></a>. Detailed in the mod’s patch notes are character gameplay changes and a feedback submission form for players to report bugs they encounter. Once the mod is complete, it will be free to download. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">There has been alot of confusion of how to install the Balance beta for <a href="https://twitter.com/MVCI_Beyond?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@MVCI_Beyond</a> .

Since starting the project, Maximilian has enlisted the help of Unreal engineer and technical artist <a href="https://x.com/erebuswolf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Erebus</a> as lead technical developer and Hearthstone proucer Barrett Womack as the mod's creative producer. At the time, Maximilian revealed that the guiding principle for the mod was to attract players "who adduced their eyes" to Capcom's crossover fight. </p><p>“This is the most active game dev I’ve ever done and it isn’t just me. It’s a lot of people. The budget of this project already at three months has well-passed five figures. It’s one of the most expensive things I’ve ever done,” Maximillian said. “This is a mod that is going to be completely free for everybody that bought MvC: I. We have no plan to sell this. We have no plans to turn it into a product in any way. All it’s going to be is that if you like MvC: I, try it out. Our version one should be available at the end of this year.” </p><p>Isaiah Colbert is a freelance writer for IGN.

Harrington suggested that, while the ending wasn't perfect, the team didn't have the energy to make it any better.</p><p>"I think if there was any fault with the end of Thrones, is that we were all so f**king tired, we couldn't have gone on longer," he said. Harrington, alongside co-stars Emilia Clarke, Maisie Williams, and more, spent the better part of a decade in their roles, from 2011 to 2019.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>8 Shows to Watch if You Liked Game of Thrones</h3></div></output><p>"I understand some people thought it was rushed and I might agree with them," Harrington continued. "But I’m not sure there was any alternative. I look at pictures of me in that final season and I look exhausted. I look spent. I didn't have another season in me.</p><p>"Everyone is entitled to their opinion. I think there were mistakes made, story wise, towards the end maybe.

                <p dir="ltr">Activision has officially confirmed Call of Duty's crossover with the upcoming reboot of The Crow. The operator bundle was previously speculated for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii/" data-ref-id="5000-597446">Modern Warfare 3</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone/" data-ref-id="5000-572198">Warzone</a> after leaks surfaced, and the Season 5 roadmap contained <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-fans-believe-bill-skarsgards-the-crow-is-coming-to-the-game/1100-6525097/">a "classified" silhouette</a> that looked suspiciously like Bill Skarsgard's take on The Crow.</p><p dir="ltr">The Call of Duty teaser clip shown below doesn't reveal the face of the new The Crow operator, but the voiceover included definitely sounds like the actor Bill Skarsgard. The operator bundle arrives to Call of Duty on August 22, which is just a day before the theatrical release of the Lionsgate film on August 23.</p><p dir="ltr">Season 5 of Call of Duty is currently in full swing with a WWE crossover, featuring operators for wrestling superstars Rhea Ripley, Cody Rhodes, and Rey Mysterio. The midseason "Reloaded" update will likely arrive to MW3 and Warzone on August 21.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the future of Call of Duty, the new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2024-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6523361/">Black Ops 6</a> game releases on October 25. More information about the game's multiplayer and Zombies mode will be revealed during Activision's Call of Duty: Next event on August 28. So far, one Zombies map and storyline was revealed, and here's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-zombies-gameplay-reveal-and-everything-we-know/1100-6525644/">everything you need to know about Black Ops 6's Zombies mode</a>.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">The Witcher is back, apparently. At least, Geralt of Rivia will seemingly appear in The Witcher 4, as the voice actor behind the character has mentioned the White Wolf will show up in the game codenamed Polaris.</p><p dir="ltr">Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/the-witcher-4-wont-focus-on-geralt-but-his-voice-actor-says-hell-at-least-be-a-part-of-the-rpg-sequel/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>, Geralt voice actor Doug Cockle opened up about The Witcher 4 in a video with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkl5T0pMFb4&amp;t=9s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fall Damage on YouTube</a>. "Witcher 4 has been announced. I can't say anything about it," Cockle said. "What we know is that Geralt will be part of the game. We just don't know how much, and the game won't focus on Geralt, so it's not about him this time."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkl5T0pMFb4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="9">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vkl5T0pMFb4?start=9" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">As for whom the game is about, Cockle claims to not know. He then appears to backtrack a bit, saying, "I have not seen any script yet. I couldn't tell you if I did. This is the thing, so I could be lying through my teeth.

More specifically, Nowakowski said to expect "new gameplay elements and new mechanics" that weren't a part of the original trilogy starring Geralt.</p><p dir="ltr">Currently, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-has-more-than-400-people-working-on-it-full-production-begins-this-year/1100-6522263/" data-ref-id="1100-6522263">The Witcher 4 has over 400 people working on the game</a>, meaning the majority of CD Projekt Red.

The plan is for the code to benefit studios and players, and tackle longstanding issues like loot boxes without being the "moral police."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Loot boxes and overall and child safety have been repeated concerns for the medium, and the hope is that an ethics code would address them. The ESRB and other regulators can only do so much, and Hodent wants the code to benefit studios and players in specific, everlasting ways.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I want to be constructive," she explained.
