			<p>Taking the medieval sandbox simulation of <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/mount-blade">Mount &amp; Blade</a> from the sprawling continent of Calradia to the high seas wasn’t the sort of pivot we had anticipated, but that’s exactly what Bannerlord’s first major expansion, War Sails, brings to Mount &amp; Blade 2. In tandem with a new Nordic-inspired playable faction – the imaginatively named Nords – comes a web of new systems and maritime mechanics that greatly expands Bannerlord’s naval gameplay.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord - War Sails - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_cHCArYAehU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This isn’t the first time developer <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/taleworlds-entertainment">TaleWorlds Entertainment</a> has tried to implement sea battles in its flagship series though previous attempts have been surface level at best with the modding community also taking a punt here and there. War Sails offers far more, however, introducing a whole new dimension to what is already a dense simulation known to hook players for hours on end. With that said, just how well executed is Mount &amp; Blade 2: Bannerlord’s hotly-anticipated expansion, and how does it enhance the core game, if at all?</p>


<p>The first thing you’ll notice upon booting <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/11/22/mount-blade-2-bannerlord-review/">Bannerlord</a> after installing the DLC is a new start-up screen allowing you to select either the base version of the game (complete with your existing save data) or War Sails. It makes sense to separate the two as War Sails features its own campaign, an updated map, and the removal of online multiplayer.</p>
<p>One of the biggest improvements between Mount &amp; Blade: Warband and Bannerlord was the inclusion of narrative elements that helped enrich Calradia and its factions by introducing a more traditional RPG-like quest system instead of relying on players to stitch together moments of emergent storytelling. Although some series purists will prefer dropping straight into sandbox mode, the War Sails campaign offers a more immersive way to learn about Bannerlord’s naval warfare and ship management systems.</p>

<p>It begins in a similar fashion to the base game, casting players as a lone venturer, separated from their family. However, instead of heading inland to discover the fate of their loved ones, War Sails folds this key plotline into its own swashbuckling saga that has you taken under the wing of Nord sea captain in his hunt for the menacing Sea Hounds.</p>
<p>While we can certainly appreciate the effort that goes into writing a new story – complete with fully voiced dialogue – the exposition in War Sails tends to drag on. Bannerlord may be a much better looking game than its forebears, but investing in characters who are barely animated during conversations is a big ask, even if they do have some interesting tidbits of lore to share. After a few story missions I found myself skipping through most of the dialogue so I could get to the meat of the expansion: learning how to use ships.</p>

<p>As it turns out, there’s not a great deal to get your head around. Traversing the campaign map by sea is pretty simple – with one click you can go from point A to B, though you’ll need to be aware of enemy factions, as well as opportunistic corsairs, who will attempt to engage you in combat. Doing so will transport you to a self-contained battlefield where ships go head-to-head in simulated naval battles. However, where Mount &amp; Blade has always set itself apart from other strategy games is giving players direct command of their armies while also fighting amongst the rank and file.</p>
<p>Naval battles should introduce an exciting new way to play Bannerlord but, in truth, they all tend to follow the same tedious pattern as crews slowly engage and exchange volleys of missile fire before preparing to board. Throwing hooks and reeling in their target vessel, troops will quickly assemble rope bridges, pathing the way for confusingly frantic flurries of melee combat that only end when one side has been wiped out entirely.</p>
<p>You’ll quickly learn how to pilot your own ship, the simple controls allowing you to easily position yourself while raising/lowering the sails to adjust your speed, as well as setting all, half, or none of your crew to man the oars. Having fewer rowers will greatly reduce your mobility though it will increase the number of troops pelting nearby enemies with missile fire. Inevitably – unless trying your absolute hardest to avoid boarding actions – naval battles end with ships being drawn together in an awkward cluster and a messy albeit decisive mass brawl. This frames Bannerlord’s combat in its least enjoyable form: swinging and thrust in tight spaces where it’s difficult to make friend from foe. Overall, naval warfare lacks any kind of pleasing tactical variety though ship upgrades such as ballistas and better rams will at least make those opening moments of each sea battle a little more exciting. Thankfully, there’s always the option to simulate these skirmishes without needing to see each one played out in real-time.</p>

<p>What else does War Sails offer? As touched on before, Bannerlord’s existing Calradia map has been modified to accommodate for the expansion’s naval focus. Rivers and coastlines have morphed to allow for more opportunities to travel via ship with many cities now outfitted with ports where players can lay anchor, trade goods, and manage their fleet. There’s also a new Nord-controlled island to the north that makes for an ideal starting point from which to launch an invasion upon the mainland. As for the Nords themselves, like any faction they have their own network of cities, towns, and settlements, daubed with a Viking-esque aesthetic.</p>
<p>War Sails also adds three new maritime skills to Bannerlord’s existing lineup. These include Mariner, Boatswain, and Shipmaster, which each influence aspects such as sea combat prowess, fleet management, logistics, navigation, and ship upgrades. The requirements for levelling up these skills can be ambiguous and time consuming, though they do reward players who want to pursue a sea-based playstyle as well as those looking to enhance their land armies with naval capabilities.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		There are some interesting ideas in War Sails but there’s a good reason why naval warfare was never a core part of the Bannerlord package. Sea battles just aren’t that appealing, lacking any kind of rewarding strategic depth or enjoyability. However, for those wanting a fresh way of tackling the campaign map, War Sails introduces new tactical opportunities and a layer of ship management some Bannerlord players will find themselves engrossed in. In short, this isn’t a must-buy expansion and for new players we’d recommend sticking with the base game.	</p></div>

<p>ARC Raiders Update 1.11.0 patch notes reveal that Stella Montis is going to get even more intense as lighting has been lowered in several areas. </p>



<p>Embark Studios has several announcements for ARC Raiders players today. We were informed earlier that the game has surpassed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-is-offering-a-free-gift-for-crossing-12-million-copies-sold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">12 million copies sold</a>, and they are providing the community with a free gift to celebrate. Now, new patch notes reveal nerfs to certain items as well as other changes to their PvP-heavy map. </p>







<h2 id="h-what-s-new-in-arc-raiders-update-1-11-0-stella-montis-lighting-change-kettle-and-trigger-nade-nerfs">What’s New in ARC Raiders Update 1.11.0? Stella Montis Lighting Change, Kettle and Trigger Nade Nerfs</h2>



<p>Starting with the biggest one, right at the very bottom of the ARC Raiders Update 1.11.0 patch notes, players will see that a new change will be taking place in Stella Montis Night Raid. Stella Montis was already a PvP-heavy map with low lighting and angry Raiders thirsty for blood. Now, the lighting has been reduced in some areas, making the use of flashlights and listening even more essential. The change could lead to more sneaky tactics, such as camping in the dark and ambushing opponents. </p>



<p>Moreover, the Kettle’s fire rate has been reduced from 600 to 450, as the previous fire rate was only realistically reachable by players using Macros. The Trigger ‘Nade has been nerfed as well, as it was dominating PvP encounters and players were preferring it over the other grenades. The nerf will reduce its use as a “trigger-in-air” grenade while retaining its use as a sticky bomb, with the delay being increased from 0.7 seconds to 1.5 seconds. Lastly, a key card exploit that allowed players to keep room keys after using them has been fixed.  </p>



<h2 id="h-complete-arc-raiders-update-1-11-0-patch-notes">Complete ARC Raiders Update 1.11.0 Patch Notes </h2>



<ul>
<li>Kettle
<ul>
<li>Dev note: Reduced fire rate from 600 to 450. The previous fire rate was only realistically reachable by players using macros, which creates an unfair dynamic that favours using 3rd party software.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Trigger ‘Nade
<ul>
<li>Dev note: Trigger ‘Nade currently dominates PVP encounters, and players favour picking it over all our other grenades. This nerf aims to make it less usable as a “trigger-in-air” grenade, whilst keeping its usefulness as a sticky bomb. Damage falloff has been rebalanced to concentrate the damage closer to the center of the explosion, and deal less damage further away. The delay between triggering the grenade and it detonating, has been increased from 0.7s to 1.5s, giving players more time to react, and making it harder to time the detonation in air.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Fixed a key card exploit that allowed players to keep room keys after using them.</li>



<li>Lighting has been lowered in some areas on Stella Montis Night Raid making flashlights and listening more relevant.</li>
</ul>



<p>ARC Raiders update 1.11.0 patch notes were released on their <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/patch-notes-1-11-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website</a> today. </p>

			<p>This morning, <strong>CAPCOM</strong> <a href="https://x.com/RE_Games/status/2010895134653837413" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that a new <strong>Resident Evil Showcase</strong> will air this <strong>Thursday, January 15</strong>, at 2 PM Pacific Time/5 PM Eastern Time/10 PM GMT/11 PM CET.</p>



<p>The stream will, of course, focus on <strong>Resident Evil Requiem</strong>, which is now just a month and a half away from its scheduled <strong>February 27</strong> launch date. However, there are hints that some other game may briefly appear, too. The official website says:</p>



<p><em>Don't miss the 12-minute Resident Evil Showcase special, featuring all the latest info on Resident Evil Requiem! Airing January 15, 2026!</em></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The date and time of the event may change without prior notice.</em></li>



<li><em>Some of the games included in the show aren't suitable for children.</em></li>



<li><em>This content will be age restricted. Age verification will be required to view this content.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Fans are hoping this means CAPCOM may take the opportunity and announce <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong> ports of the <strong>Resident Evil 2 and/or 4 remake</strong>. Resident Evil 7, Resident Evil Village, and Requiem are already scheduled to hit the latest Nintendo console on February 27, 2026. Of course, this could also be standard phrasing that the publisher reuses for its showcase announcements without much consideration for whether the event will actually feature one or more games. </p>



<p>The 12-minute running time would definitely be pretty tight, with most of it undoubtedly reserved for Requiem. Even more unlikely is any announcement of the next rumored remakes, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-next-resident-evil-remakes-code-veronica-2027-zero-2028/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Code: Veronica (2027) and Resident Evil Zero (2028)</a></strong>, which will have to wait until after the new entry has launched.</p>



<p>Anyway, the publisher invited fans to stick around on the Capcom USA Twitch channel after the end of the Resident Evil showcase for a discussion with guests Bawkbasoup and JenIsOnline, followed by a giveaway of a Resident Evil 4 Collector's Edition. </p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a> developers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-have-been-accused-of-union-busting-after-the-firing-of-more-than-30-staff-members">fired by Rockstar</a> last year on the charge of leaking information about the upcoming game have been denied interim relief, as they and their allies at the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain begin <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/iwgb-union-file-legal-claims-against-rockstar-due-to-gta-6-maker-allegedly-refusing-to-negotiate-over-firings">their legal case</a> against the company for alleged union-busting. </p>
<p>Interim relief is a legal mechanism whereby dismissed employees get short-term emergency financial help from their employer. The IWGB <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-continue-to-claim-firings-were-about-preventing-gta-6-leaks-as-union-push-to-get-devs-interim-relief">requested</a> last week that a UK employment tribunal grant interim relief to 31 fired Rockstar employees. Had the request been granted, the ousted workers would have been put back on Rockstar’s payroll and had any cancelled work visas reinstated.</p>
<p>Naturally, Rockstar are interpreting the rejection as supporting their case that the workers were fired for sharing info about GTA 6 and other unannounced projects over Discord, rather than because they were trying to unionise. A spokesperson has told IGN that the judge’s decision “is consistent with Rockstar’s position throughout.”</p>
<p>The IWGB, meanwhile, argue that obtaining interim relief was always going to be “an incredibly high bar to meet”, and that the setback “does nothing to dampen our hopes of winning justice when the full hearing takes place”. They call attention to employment judge Frances Eccles’s ruling that “there was no evidence of the respondent having suffered any adverse consequences as a result of these postings” [on Discord].</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rockstar-says-we-stand-by-our-course-of-action-as-judge-rejects-fired-gta-6-developers-application-for-interim-relief">IGN</a> and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-12/fired-rockstar-employees-denied-pay-by-uk-judge">Bloomberg</a>, the hearing includes a little more from either side about what exactly happened on the union organiser Discord channel in question, though this is just a preliminary procedure - the bulk of claims and evidence are to follow when the case goes to court.</p>
<p>According to the ruling from Eccles, over half of the roughly 350 members of the Discord were members of the IWGB, but some were no longer employed by Rockstar. One of the channel’s members is said to have written articles about video games, including one about Rockstar and GTA.</p>
<p>To give some background on that latter allegation, Rockstar <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-developer-rockstar-claims-fired-employees-were-dismissed-for-leaking-specific-game-features-from-upcoming-and-unannounced-titles-not-because-they-were-trying-to-unionize">“indicated” to IGN</a> back in December that one member of the Discord was a game journalist, while another was an employee of a rival developer. Rockstar has claimed that moderators were not aware of the identities of every member of the channel, creating a security risk.</p>
<p>IWGB communications officer Jake Thomas has countered that all members of the Discord were either union staff or officials or Rockstar employees, with moderators removing members after learning that they had left the company. Thomas did, however, concede that one union official present in the channel had previously written "a couple of articles for a paper, but is a game worker and union rep and was in the group in that capacity."</p><p>Rockstar have yet to say much about the nature of the “confidential information” allegedly being shared, though IGN report that it’s a mixture of “specific game features, comments on the overall progress of GTA 6 development, timelines to launch, and company IT security protocols” – all details Rockstar believe could damage parent company Take-Two Interactive’s share price, if they were made public. Some of these claims have been corroborated by other sources. In November, an anonymous Rockstar insider <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-fired-unionising-gta-6-devs-following-discord-chat-about-new-company-slack-policy-claims-report">claimed to People Make Games</a> that the firings followed a discussion of changes to the company’s internal Slack policy.</p>
<p>Judge Eccles also notes in her ruling about interim relief that, besides the 31 people let go in the UK, Rockstar dismissed three employees in Canada who were not members of the union. As such, she argues that their union membership could not have been a factor in their dismissal.</p>
<p>The fired developers are represented by Lord John Hendy KC – who, yes, is an actual Lord in the House of Lords. Among other things, he argued in the hearing that no information had actually been leaked to the press and public, and that it is not in itself “gross misconduct” (as Rockstar has previously stated) to share confidential information in a group containing external third parties.</p>
<p>The IWGB have released a statement in response to the tribunal ruling. It claims that the hearing has revealed “that many procedural guidelines were broken in the process of firing these employees, including there being no disciplinary meetings, no chance for appeal until six weeks later, and no evidence of an investigation. Comments relied on by Rockstar’s lawyers were obtained without the knowledge of employees using Discord, described by the claimants as 'covert monitoring.'”</p><p>The IWGB also argue that “[r]ather than focusing their case on evidence that Rockstar acted fairly and reasonably in their decision to fire 31 people on the spot, the argument resided largely on legal technicalities, with Rockstar's lawyers declaring that it doesn’t matter if the dismissals were unfair, or if the leadership that dismissed them acted with malice.”</p>
<p>The dismissal of the Rockstar workers has sparked protest action outside <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/as-rockstar-accuse-fired-staff-of-leaking-secrets-unions-launch-street-protests-against-publisher-take-two">Take-Two Interactive’s offices in London</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ah-shit-here-we-go-again-gta-6-developers-speak-from-the-picket-line-about-rockstar-north-union-busting">Rockstar North’s headquarters in Edinburgh</a>. It has also been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-this-from-happening-again-uk-politician-calls-out-rockstar-over-gta-6-developer-firings">raised in Parliament</a>, with prime minister Keir Starmer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-firings-are-a-deeply-concerning-case-thatll-be-looked-into-says-uk-prime-minister-keir-starmer">calling it “a deeply concerning case”</a>.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Much has been written about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-review">Stellar Blade</a>'s handling of its lead female character, the culture war surrounding it, and <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/gaming-news/stellar-blade-cuts-unintentional-reference-to-racial-slur-3750534">developer Shift Up's several eyebrow-raising missteps</a> as the game broke through into mainstream consciousness. Regardless, the PS5 title was a big success and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stellar-blade-developer-confirms-sequel-plans">a sequel is now in development</a>. Before we even get a first look at it, however, a new storm appears to be brewing.</p>
<p>AI, generative or not, is the talk of town, and by town I mean the entire games industry. As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/change-of-mind-larian-says-it-will-not-use-gen-ai-at-all-in-relation-to-divinity-concept-art">Larian tries to toy with gen-AI while not using the tech for final assets</a> and <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-it-s-cancerous-manor-lords-publisher-hooded-horse-wants-to-avoid-genai-like-the-plague">publishers like Hooded Horse unequivocally dunk on studios using it</a>, the debate refuses to go away. 2026 may be defined by the widespread adoption or rejection of AI tools, and hopefully, by people finally figuring out the difference between tools that have been around for a while and the controversial gen-AI. The well has already been poisoned, sadly.</p>
<p>Shift Up CEO and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a> director Hyung-tae Kim is bullish on the whole package, it seems. During a national briefing on South Korea’s 2026 Economic Growth Strategy, the developer claimed it's "an essential tool for going up against large competitors like China on a global level." <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/stellar-blade-director-says-using-ai-will-be-essential-for-competing-with-overwhelming-manpower-of-china-and-us-developers/">Automaton</a> reported on (and translated) the news first shared by <a href="https://www.gamemeca.com/view.php?gid=1770030">GameMeca</a>.</p>
<p>Anyone who's been paying attention to the games industry for the last few years is well aware of China's increasingly large presence, with behemoths like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-review">Black Myth: Wukong</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/chinese-action-rpg-where-winds-meet-reaches-two-million-players-in-just-24-hours-of-global-release">Where Winds Meet</a> making waves and rising to compete against the Japanese and Western giants that have typically dominated the market. Meanwhile, South Korea has started to exit the MMO-oriented creative trends and begun to punch above its weight with triple-A projects. It comes as no surprise to see more and more developers in the country betting on AI (even if it's not of the <em>generative</em> kind) as its ambitions grow larger, too.</p><p>Kim "argues that widespread use of AI will not result in people losing their jobs, because competing with major industries like China and the US will require not only utilizing all available manpower, but also making everyone proficient in AI." Press X to doubt, as immediately, he stated one person could "perform the work of 100 people" with the assistance of these tools.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether the adoption of AI assistance into the general pipeline really will make games bigger, better, or more profitable for publishers, but either way, it seems like the conversation around this topic - and the consequences of its general usage - will not go away any time soon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>A few hours ago, publisher <strong>Nexon</strong> and developer <strong>Embark Studios</strong> announced that the third-person extraction shooter game <strong>ARC Raiders</strong> has now sold <strong>more than 12.4 million units</strong> to date since its launch on <strong>October 30, 2025</strong>. The announcement confirms Alinea Analytics' latest estimates, <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-estimated-to-have-sold-12-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which had already indicated last week</a> that the game had surpassed 12 million copies. Moreover, the game registered around 960,000 concurrent players this month, not far from the impressive threshold of one million concurrent users (presumably across all platforms).</p>



<p>It is yet another confirmation, if needed, that ARC Raiders is incredibly good at maintaining its momentum so far, <a href="https://wccftech.com/people-have-to-take-step-back-understand-ai-can-be-big-help-developers-benefit-players-says-arc-raiders-boss/https://wccftech.com/people-have-to-take-step-back-understand-ai-can-be-big-help-developers-benefit-players-says-arc-raiders-boss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>despite the AI voices controversy</strong></a>. Of course, the game's live service run has just started. Anyway, as a thank-you gesture for all the support, Embark is giving away a <strong>Gilded Pickaxe Raider Tool</strong> to everyone who logged into the game at least once since launch till today at <strong>23:59 Central European Time</strong>.</p>



<p>The press release included the usual celebratory statements from Nexon and Embark. Junghun Lee, President and CEO of Nexon, stated:</p>



<p><em>We are incredibly pleased with the strong retention and enduring enthusiasm players in all major markets worldwide have shown for ARC Raiders. As pleased as we were with the October launch, reaching more than 12.4 million units and setting a record with 960,000 concurrent users in January demonstrates the potential for ARC Raiders to become another pillar in Nexon’s portfolio of blockbuster franchises. Embark Studios has delivered exactly what players worldwide have expected from the game, a fresh, highly differentiated experience in a massive global game genre. ARC Raiders’ success is a clear affirmation of Nexon Group’s goal of expanding our global footprint with horizontal growth from all-new games that capture and grow massive game communities in every major market and on multiple platforms.</em></p>



<p>Patrick Söderlund, Founder and CEO of Embark Studios, added:</p>



<p><em>Hitting 12.4 million units is a huge landmark—and it wouldn’t have happened without our players. The community of raiders has been part of this journey from the start, and their ideas and enthusiasm continue to guide where the game goes next.</em></p>



<p>ARC Raiders has earned the <strong>Best Multiplayer Game</strong> prize <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-winners-full-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at The Game Awards 2025</a> and the <strong>Most Innovative Gameplay</strong> prize <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-steam-2025-goty-award-goes-to-hollow-knight-silksong-beating-clair-obscur-expedition-33/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at the Steam Awards 2025</a>. It's also well-positioned to win <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-multiplayer-games-of-2025-the-power-of-togetherness/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wccftech's Best Multiplayer Game award from the community</a></strong>, although voting hasn't closed yet.</p>

		<p>Capcom may have spoiled their own surprise in a safety message for the new Resident Evil Showcase, which will be happening on 15 January 2026 at 10:00 PM (UTC) – which is 10.00PM GMT in case you were wondering.</p>
<p>The official announcement over on <a href="https://www.residentevil.com/showcase/en-uk/">residentevil.com</a> advises that you “Don’t miss the 12-minute Resident Evil Showcase special, featuring all the latest info on Resident Evil Requiem!”. That is to be expected as it is the next game in the series launching on 27th February 2026.</p>


<p>However, in the usual warnings for minors, the website also states, “This content will be age-restricted. Age verification will be required to view this content. Some of the games included in the show aren’t suitable for children.”</p>
<p>Did you spot it? <em>Games</em>. Plural. So that’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/resident-evil-9-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> and at least one other title.&nbsp; However, this may not be a new title, as it is heavily rumoured that Capcom will be releasing previous Resident Evil games on Switch 2 on the same day that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/resident-evil-9-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> launches.&nbsp; A few years ago, rumours circulated about a Resident Evil Zero remake for 2027 and a Resident Evil Code: Veronica remake for 2028, but no further information has been heard about those since.</p>
<p><iframe title="Teaser Trailer - Resident Evil Showcase | 15 January 2026" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iBQXWfHPFvE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In case you had forgotten, Resident Evil is also heading back to the big screen with the franchise getting a reboot this September. The movie will not feature any characters from the games and will be an original story set in the Resident Evil universe.</p>
<p>“It takes place in the world of the games,” Cregger explained to the<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnKTQ2Xenbs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">&nbsp;Double Toasted podcast</a>. “But most importantly the journey you’ll have as a viewer of watching this movie is going to be similar to the journey you have as a player when you play these games. And what that means is it follows one protagonist from point A to point B as they just descend deeper and deeper and deeper into Hell.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders just keeps on growing, hitting a new milestone in 2026 of over 12 million copies sold, and the devs are offering a free gift to players to celebrate the occasion. </p>



<p>Embark Studios’ ARC Raiders is definitely one of the most popular releases in 2025, and is still going strong into the new year. The player base also includes a dedicated bunch, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/one-million-arc-raiders-players-wiped-accounts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1 million completing their first Expedition Project</a>. Now, you can grab a free gift for helping the game reach this milestone. </p>











<p>As revealed through the official ARC Raiders <a href="https://x.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/2010985172632797620" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter), the developers have confirmed that they have seen “over 12 million Raiders ascend from Speranza to raid the Rust Belt.” The dev team had crafted a special gift to celebrate hitting 10 million players, and this free thank-you gift is a Gilded Pickaxe Raider Tool. Any player who has logged in since launch until January 13, 23:59 CET, will receive this gift once the latest update is released. </p>



<p>Since its release, ARC Raiders has slowly and steadily cemented its position as one of the best extraction shooters ever released. <span>Last week, a&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-sales-estimate-hits-12-million/" target="_blank">sales estimate</a>&nbsp;for the</span> game was released, stating that the title had already surpassed 12 million units across Steam, PlayStation, and Xbox. This seemingly helped Embark Studios rake in a whopping $350 million and reach a daily active user count of 3.2 million. </p>







<p>In other news, ARC Raiders players are complaining about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-bans-false-block-banned/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">false account blocks and bans</a>. Additionally, we recently caught a glimpse of what ARC Raiders might have looked like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-first-person-works-well-new-clip/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">if it were a first-person shooter</a>.

            <title><![CDATA[Fired Rockstar Devs Denied Pay While Legal Battle Goes On]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fired-rockstar-devs-denied-pay-legal-battle/</link>
            <guid>1404184</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a new report, it has been revealed that a UK judge has outright <strong>denied </strong>the 31 fired Rockstar employees interim pay while they tussle with the firm and Take-Two over what they claim was an unfair dismissal. Last year, 31 employees in the United Kingdom were fired from Rockstar Games in one sweep, with the gaming titan claiming that they were leaking confidential information.</p>



<p>Following the sweep, it emerged that Rockstar may have been fighting back against unionization, targeting employees who joined the IWGB union in the United Kingdom. Rockstar has categorically denied these claims.</p>







<h2 id="h-rockstar-s-dismissed-devs-won-t-get-pay">Rockstar’s Dismissed Devs Won’t Get Pay</h2>



<p>In a recent <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-12/fired-rockstar-employees-denied-pay-by-uk-judge" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg report</a>, it was stated that the UK’s Judge Frances Eccles had <strong>denied </strong>a plea for interim pay for the 31 former Rockstar Games developers. This interim pay would have allowed these employees to jump back on the company’s payroll while the situation with the mass dismissal was being handled through legal channels.</p>



<p>It was stated by the judge that the fired employees could not demonstrate their case enough to have a ‘pretty good chance of success’ at proving they were dismissed in a union-busting effort.</p>



<p>The judge wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>In all the circumstances, the tribunal was unable to conclude that it appears likely that the tribunal will find that the principal reason for the claimants’ dismissal was their membership of the IWGB</em>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This means that it’s <strong>unlikely </strong>that the dismissed employees will have the court weigh in their favor over the union-busting allegations. It’s another angle of support for Rockstar’s suggestion that the employees were leaking confidential information.</p>



<p>Days ago, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-devs-fired-over-leaks-sent-to-influencers-rockstar-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rockstar claimed</a> that the employees were dismissed because they were leaking information about ‘upcoming and unannounced titles’ to influencers on social channels, including a Discord server.</p>



<p>That server has become the biggest point of contention. The company explained that <strong>25 non-Rockstar employees</strong>, including former workers, competing developers, and even <strong>a video game journalist, </strong>were in that server. This gave them unimpeded access to critical information about Grand Theft Auto 6 and other games.</p>



<p>The court’s ruling now locks these former employees out of any pay while they attempt to resolve the situation with Rockstar Games.</p>

Out of the box, the JC400 synced quickly to my Switch 2 console, and I haven't experienced any connection issues or increased input latency compared to other Bluetooth controllers.</p><p>As shown in the image above, the console slides into place. A sheet of soft felt covers the back of the console cradle to prevent scratches. It already feels secure on its own, but there are two locking switches that can be flipped on the back to prevent the console from moving during accidental drops. After locking the switches, the console doesn't budge at all--even if you flip it upside down and shake it toward the ground.</p><p>If you liked the Hori Split Pad Pro for the original Switch, the JC400 feels similar. The more traditional form factor will probably feel large at first, but it's certainly more comfortable than the Joy-Con 2 without a grip case.</p><p>The one notable downside to the JC400 is that the shell, face buttons, and D-pad feel too plasticky. On the other hand, the full-size Hall Effect sticks are smooth and precise, and the larger triggers and shoulder buttons are nice bonuses. The two built-in back buttons are conveniently located and offer solid feedback.</p><p>The back buttons and several other settings can be customized directly on the controller. Four menu buttons are located on the back: The M button remaps MR/ML (back buttons); the light button dims/brightens the joystick rings; SL deactivates the the back buttons; and SR can be used to program macros/input sequences of up to 21 button presses.</p><p>You can cycle through five rumble intensities by pressing the vibration button on the front. Also on the front is a Turbo function with support for three different speeds and a fully automatic setting.</p><p>The JC400 charges via USB-C and can run for up to 10 hours. The controller blocks the bottom USB-C port on the Switch 2, but the top port is accessible, so you can charge your console and play simultaneously. You can also store up to four Nintendo Switch 2 game cards in the dedicated slots running across the top.</p></div>                      </div><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4634484-jc400.png" data-ref-id="1300-4634484" data-ratio="0.41" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4634484-jc400.png" data-ref-id="1300-4634484"></a><figcaption>Nintendo Switch 2 JC400 Bluetooth controller for Nintendo Switch 2</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4634484-jc400.png"></figure><p>Additional adjustments can be made by syncing the JC400 to a free iOS and Android app called KeyLinker. Since this is an app used by a bunch of different controllers from various brands, it doesn't offer as nice of an experience as proprietary customization suites. Nonetheless, it gets the job done, allowing you to tinker with stick sensitivity, create dead zones, remap all inputs, switch between the three RGB lightning modes, and adjust the six-axis motion controls.</p><hr><h3><a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FGP8CBQ7,B0D8JJRCJN,B0FT34CLXF&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GameSir Bluetooth Mobile Controllers Deals</a></h3><p>As mentioned, GameSir's Galileo G8 Plus and X5s controllers for iOS and Android also work for Nintendo Switch 2 as well as the original Switch.

It will be priced at <strong>$69.99 USD</strong> (<em>or your regional equivalent</em>) and Sega notes how it will feature the "full base game" on the cartridge.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> launches next month on the Switch 2, and as we get closer to this anticipated release, Capcom has announced it will be airing a Resident Evil Showcase this week on <strong>15th January 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>It promises to feature "brand new gameplay and news" about the upcoming entry starring Grace Ashcroft and Leon Kennedy. Of course, if there are any other surprises revealed, we'll be sure to let you know when the news drops.</p>
<p>Capcom also notes how it will feature a "post-show" discussion on the <a href="https://youtu.be/VXQveAdzC74">Capcom USA YouTube channel</a> after the main showcase, featuring Twitch partner guests and a giveaway of a Resident Evil 4 Collector's Edition. It's worth noting there will be "no new information" during this segment.</p>
<p>This announcement follows a short trailer for Resident Evil Requiem surfacing at CES 2026 last week (it was actually featured during NVIDIA'S PC showcase of the title). Apart from Requiem, Capcom previously confirmed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-7-biohazard-gold-edition">Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-village-gold-edition">Resident Evil Village</a> will also be heading to the Switch 2 on 27th February 2026.</p>
<p>To start the new year off, Capcom is currently offering some deals on the Nintendo eShop in select locations - with sales on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ace_attorney_investigations_collection">Ace Attorney</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess">Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mega-man-dual-override">Mega Man</a> and more.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/gta-online-charlie-kirk-killing-assassination-missions-rockstar-deleting-censor-block-2000659038</link>
            <guid>1404088</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Rockstar Games seems to be playing cat-and-mouse with some <a href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-online-the-kotaku-review-1844188338"><em>Grand Theft Auto Online</em></a> players who are using newly added tools to recreate the assassination of Charlie Kirk in the extremely popular online open-world crime simulator.</p> <p>In September of last year, right-wing commentator <a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-kirk-shooter-helldivers-bullet-engraving-2000625439">Charlie Kirk was shot in the neck and killed</a> during a public appearance at a college in Utah. In the weeks that followed, many people, <a href="https://kotaku.com/disney-announces-jimmy-kimmel-return-tuesday-boycott-back-abc-not-canceled-2000627662">including Jimmy Kimmel,</a> found themselves in trouble for commenting or joking about it. <a href="https://kotaku.com/ready-or-not-community-manager-fired-for-responding-to-charlie-kirk-assassination-with-nothing-was-lost-2000627182">Some even lost their jobs</a>. Then, in December, right before the new year, Rockstar added a mission creator to<em> GTA Online,</em> letting players make their own solo missions. <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@cinemascrubs/video/7582722056542784799">And it didn’t take long for</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1143251116647159/posts/1673819406923658/">some creators to start recreating Kirk’s killing in <em>GTA Online</em></a>, leading to an ongoing situation where it seems Rockstar is trying (and failing) to stop these assassination-themed missions from spreading.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Rockstar Games has added the term "Charlie Kirk" to the profanity filter in GTA Online after someone created this mission: <a href="https://t.co/oEubYl6TG6">pic.twitter.com/oEubYl6TG6</a></p> <p>— GTA 6 Info (@GTASixInfo) <a href="https://twitter.com/GTASixInfo/status/2010798891269243103?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 12, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>On January 12, <a href="https://x.com/gtasixinfo/status/2010798891269243103?s=46">the Twitter account GTA 6Info posted</a> a clip of what appears to be a user-created <em>GTA Online</em>&nbsp;mission called “We Are Charlie Kirk” that features the player being tasked with killing a man standing outside behind various props in a location that looks like a college campus. Once the man is killed, the mission is completed. GTA 6Info also claimed in the tweet that because of this mission, Rockstar Games has now added “Charlie Kirk” to <em>GTA Online’</em>s profanity filter. The tweet went viral, but it’s unclear if Rockstar did, in fact, add Kirk’s name to any such filter and if that particular mission is the reason.</p>

 <p><em>Kotaku</em> has contacted Rockstar Games for more information.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000659042" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000659042"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000659042">©Rockstar Games / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>However, while <em>Kotaku</em> can’t confirm the specific claim in that tweet, it can verify that if you try to search for “Charlie Kirk” on the official custom jobs site for<em> GTA Online</em>, you’ll be greeted with an error regardless of which platform you pick. This also happens if you try to search for a slur or other vulgar term blocked by Rockstar. You can still search for <a href="https://socialclub.rockstargames.com/jobs/Charlie/?dateRangeCreated=last7&amp;platform=ps5&amp;sort=likes&amp;title=gtav">Charlie</a> or <a href="https://socialclub.rockstargames.com/jobs/Kirk/?dateRangeCreated=last7&amp;platform=ps5&amp;sort=likes&amp;title=gtav">Kirk separately</a>, and doing so will reveal that previously shared Kirk-themed maps, like the one from that viral video, seem to have been removed from <em>GTA Onlin</em>e sometime between December 10, when the mission creator tool was added to the game, and today. Players appear to be using “Charlie Pink” or mashing his first and last names together to try and get around what appear to be Rockstar’s attempt to make it much harder to find and share these missions.</p>

 <p>The question now is whether Rockstar Games will continue to play cat-and-mouse with creators trying to build and share recreations of Kirk’s murder.&nbsp; And if so, for how long will this trend continue in the live-service game? If I know the internet, Rockstar has a hard job ahead of it, especially as rumors of a banned topic spread online and entice more creators to try their luck at getting around any possible filters. <a href="https://kotaku.com/nba-2k26-charlie-kirk-character-creator-neck-tattoo-2000629891">We saw something like this happen in<em> NBA 2K26 </em>last year,</a> with players using the in-game creator tools to create bloody characters referencing the killing.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Now More Than Ever, It Is Imperative That Tim Sweeney Log Off]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/tim-sweeney-x-ai-csam-epic-games-fortnite/</link>
            <guid>1404058</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Last year, following Tim Sweeney’s full-throated endorsement of racist, conspiratorial tweets from Elon Musk, we <a href="https://aftermath.site/tim-sweeney-epic-ceo-elon-musk-brainworms/"><u>implored the Epic Games CEO to log off</u></a>. Now, in the somehow already worse year of 2026, we feel the need to urgently reiterate that message.</p><p>At the tail end of last week, Sweeney decided to once again swing to the rescue of the richest man on the planet by quote-retweeting an article headlined “U.S. Senators Ask Apple and Google to Remove X and Grok Apps Over Sexualized Image Generation” with <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/2009732745140871463?s=20&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>the following bit of commentary</u></a>:&nbsp;</p><blockquote>“Reason #42 for open platforms: to shut down every politician’s incessant demands to all gatekeepers to censor all of their political opponents. All major AIs have documented instances of going off the rails; all major AI companies make their best efforts to combat this; none are perfect. Politicians demanding gatekeepers selectively crush the one that's their political opponent's company is basic crony capitalism.”</blockquote><p>This prompted more than a few raised eyebrows, seeing as one could – sans much or really any mental gymnastics – infer that Sweeney was defending Musk and co’s recent decision to implement AI tools that <a href="https://www.404media.co/groks-ai-csam-shitshow/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>allow X/Twitter users to generate pornographic imagery of minors</u></a>. Or at least that he was minimizing the harm those tools <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/474563/grok-x-ai-bikini-deepfake-liability-section-230?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">have caused and continue to cause</a>. PC Gamer <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/epic-games-ceo-tim-sweeney-argues-banning-twitter-over-its-ability-to-ai-generate-pornographic-images-of-minors-is-just-gatekeepers-attempting-to-censor-all-of-their-political-opponents/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>published a piece</u></a> suggesting as much and also rightly pointing out the hypocrisy of Sweeney taking such a nauseating stance while overseeing a store that <a href="https://aftermath.site/horses-steam-epic-games-store-banned/"><u>couldn’t stomach <em>Horses</em></u></a>, a <a href="https://aftermath.site/horses-indie-game-banned-steam-epic-review-impressions-santa-ragione/"><u>tame art game</u></a> that sparked a bewildering panic around nonexistent sexual content involving a minor.&nbsp;</p><p>Over the weekend, Sweeney, a billionaire with at least a billion better things to be doing, logged on perhaps harder than ever to <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/2010497254495342610?ref=aftermath.site"><u>call PC Gamer’s article “a vile lie.”</u></a>&nbsp;</p><p>“I criticized a government official for pressuring Apple and Google to block a speech app owned by their political opponent,” he wrote, “deplatforming 500,000,000 users on the pretense of stopping a small number of users from distributing disgusting content.”&nbsp;</p><p>Where to begin. First and foremost, hosting pornographic material involving minors is a crime to the extent that, as Chris pointed out <a href="https://aftermath.site/podcasts/aftermath-hours-podcast-ai-bubble-2026-predictions/"><u>on Aftermath Hours last week</u></a>, X users could be implicated by downloading the app. And even if you agree with Sweeney’s techno-libertarian stance that lawmakers should have no power here, there must be <em>some kind</em> of consequence for creating history’s most powerful child porn engine. Otherwise, as we have seen time and time again specifically from billionaires like Musk, wealthy assholes will simply do whatever they please if it suits their vainglorious desires.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s worth noting that legal and financial constraints <em>have </em>caused Musk to fold in the past – for example in 2018 when he essentially committed fraud by claiming on Twitter that he’d secured funding to take Tesla private, at which point the SEC offered him a deal that’d force him to step down as chairman, which he rejected, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200623023744/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/27/business/elon-musk-sec-lawsuit-tesla.html"><u>then sued him</u></a>, causing him to <a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2018-226?ref=aftermath.site"><u>accept the deal</u></a>. Now, however, Musk <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91472488/why-elon-musk-is-laughing-off-groks-flood-of-deepfake-ai-porn?ref=aftermath.site"><u>owns the regulators</u></a>, making consequential US government intervention a far less likely proposition. But this gives up the game as to what billionaires like Musk and Sweeney really want: Not a lawless land in which openness and innovation thrive, but one where the laws bend to and serve their specific wills.</p><p>Beyond that, if we’re really choosing to die on this hill, we must consider the matter of intent: OpenAI, as much of a stain on what remains of society as it is, at least has <a href="https://openai.com/policies/usage-policies/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>a policy</u></a> stating that its services "must never be used to exploit, endanger, or sexualize anyone under 18 years old." (Granted, other companies with similar policies, like Microsoft, have previously <a href="https://www.404media.co/microsoft-closes-loophole-that-created-ai-porn-of-taylor-swift/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>struggled with deepfake porn</u></a>, and OpenAI’s <a href="https://gizmodo.com/chatgpts-adult-mode-is-coming-in-2026-2000698677?ref=aftermath.site"><u>forthcoming “adult mode”</u></a> will almost certainly prove to be a disaster.) X, for its part, has referred members of the press to <a href="https://x.com/safety/status/2007648212421587223?ref=aftermath.site"><u>a tweet from earlier this month</u></a> in which it said that “Anyone using or prompting Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content.” Thus far, however, the results speak for themselves. It is clear that X did not implement rigorous safeguards before releasing this feature, and now – instead of taking the whole thing offline until it’s in better shape – the company is <a href="https://www.404media.co/x-premium-grok-paywall-images-ai-generator/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>attempting to monetize it</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>I’d be remiss if I didn’t also point to <a href="https://aftermath.site/fortnite-app-store-return/"><u>Sweeney’s own history</u></a> where deplatforming users is concerned. As Nathan Brown, writer of the <a href="https://newsletter.hitpoints.co/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>HitPoints newsletter</u></a>, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hitpoints.bsky.social/post/3mc7oud4ph22q?ref=aftermath.site"><u>put it</u></a>: “[All of this] from a guy who deplatformed tens of millions of his own users so he could pressure Apple and Google to change what he considered an immoral policy.” But then, said policy happened to cost Sweeney money, obviously making it a far more urgent matter than something that stands to enable pedophiles while endangering, traumatizing, and embarrassing countless children, as well as numerous adults (mostly women).&nbsp;Meanwhile, thanks to the recent addition of microtransactions on Sweeney's platform, a user-generated game popular with millions of younger players <a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-steal-the-brainrot-gambling-vbucks-2000658885?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">now includes real-money gambling</a>. </p><p>Sweeney, like every other tantrum-throwing tech baby irreparably brain-poisoned by a mixture of obscene wealth and an app where people are sometimes a little mean to them, needs to log off. He needed to do it yesterday – and also all the days before. But hey, the sun will rise again tomorrow. There is still hope, dim though it might be.</p><h2 id="recommended">Recommended</h2><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/tim-sweeney-epic-ceo-elon-musk-brainworms/"><div><p>Log Off, Tim Sweeney - Aftermath</p><p>Again, if I had $5 billion you would never see or hear from me ever again</p><p><span>Luke Plunkett</span></p></div></a></figure>

It’s a matchmaking tactic that has set the Arc Raiders community ablaze since the company <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-dev-confirms-it-recently-added-aggression-based-matchmaking-but-its-not-a-full-science"><u>announced its implementation</u></a> earlier this month. While some of the more aggressive fans aren’t sure how they feel about being linked up with other bloodthirsty Raiders, gentler players are using ABMM to find lobbies where player-vs.-player violence is practically off-limits.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">The type of lobby you get after not shooting someone for 20 games <a href="https://t.co/TAYzsiEd6e" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/TAYzsiEd6e</a></p>— Arc Raiders Intel (@ArcRaidersIntel) <a href="https://twitter.com/ArcRaidersIntel/status/2010455941330927874?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 11, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Multiple players have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1qapdfr/comment/nz5gfoy/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>shared stories online</u></a> about finding friendly lobbies that see Raiders cooperate with one another by evenly sharing loot after taking down a Matriarch. Some runs have even been said to result in a group dance party.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Took down a matriarch and everyone shared the loot equally and then danced together at extract,” one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1qapdfr/comment/nz4vog4/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>player explained</u></a>. “After a week of pure PvP this is like a whole new world.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Lately I’ve been running into nothing but friendly players," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1qapdfr/comment/nz57uka/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another added</a>.

While players do their best to use ABMM to land them in friendly lobbies, some have begun <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1pyca5k/comment/nwhn724/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">offering advice</a> to those who would prefer to avoid PvP but can't quite crack the code. There are even some fans discussing their hope for official support for strictly peaceful lobbies, but for those who prefer to rummage for loot in Stella Montis with a hint of paranoia, ABMM can be manipulated in the other direction, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those who keep the safety on when looking for rusted gears and light bulbs with friends may have some luck balancing their lobbies with both friendly and aggressive players if they don’t exclusively stick to PvE combat. With enough trial and error, a few fans say they've had luck tweaking matchmaking to add just a dash of mischief.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I enjoy both lobbies,” one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1qapdfr/comment/nz4xgok/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Reddit user commented</u></a>. “PvE for making new friends and looting properly. PvP with my mate terrorising the whole lobby and losing all the good weapons we brought [because] someone outplays us with a big smile on our faces and having a great time.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Embark has been clear: ABMM isn’t a science. The aggression-based matchmaking tool is also likely still being tweaked as Arc Raiders rides <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-is-officially-a-hit-with-over-4-million-copies-sold-and-a-peak-concurrent-player-count-of-700000-across-all-platforms">success</a> through its third month since launching for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X | S October 30. Still, it’s proven to be at least somewhat useful for those looking to avoid PvP, and the tension that comes with it, as much as possible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While players argue over whether ABMM is right for Arc Raiders, Embark seems to have made up its mind. For the Stockholm-based game developer, Arc Raiders is better off without doubling down on competitive gameplay mechanics like leaderboards, with CEO Patrick Söderlund explaining in a recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=QKpGyvRhpr7r-Cdw&amp;v=vY3u7wOmm4w&amp;feature=youtu.be" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>GamesBeat</u></a> interview that “<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-isnt-about-shooting-other-players-arc-raiders-dev-explains-why-it-wont-add-additional-pvp-mechanics-like-leaderboards"><u>the game isn't about shooting other players</u></a>.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You can do that if you want to,” he added, “but the ethos of the game has never been to go in and shoot players. It's a part that we use to craft tension.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Arc Raiders community is still deciphering its favorite way to experience the evolving extraction shooter.

"Even after barreling through the campaign in a couple of days, I still couldn't stop myself from going back for more," wrote critic Richard Wakeling. "Ninja Gaiden 4 is a brutal menagerie of excessive blood spray, gratifying weapons, and gloriously stylish action. It banishes the sour memories of Ninja Gaiden 3 and has me pining for more character-action games, serving as a wistful reminder that games like Ninja Gaiden, Devil May Cry, and Bayonetta ruled the roost before the recent proliferation of Souls-likes."</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/NINJA-GAIDEN-Ragebound-Playstation-5/dp/B0FD4NMM41?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ninja Gaiden Ragebound</a> on PS5 is down to its lowest price ever at Amazon, now available for $31.12 (was $40).

			<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3435450/Hardest/">Hardest</a></strong> is a free rock-paper-scissors game on Steam that was released in 2025 and made by indie developer <strong>Eero Laine</strong> under the studio name <strong>Rakuel</strong>. It's one of many games on Steam that includes a disclaimer towards the bottom of its page indicating it was made with generative AI tools, and on<strong> January 30, 2026</strong>, Laine plans to delete the game from Steam because his girlfriend of one month made him realize that "<em>AI is bad</em>," and now wants nothing to do with the game he made using <strong>GenAI</strong>.</p>



<p>Laine explains how he made the game through GenAI tools he had access to through university, and while the tools at first seemed 'free' for him to use without repercussions, he explains that he now understands more of the larger picture of what it means to use AI and GenAI tools from an economic and environmental standpoint.</p>



<p>"<em>This game will be deleted at 30.1</em>," Laine begins in a post on the game's Steam page. "<em>I made this game during the summer in [a] couple months and thought to use AI because in university there is so much brainwashing on students and all the tools are given for free, so I could generate unlimited images for free and so.</em>" </p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AI-Is-Bad.png"></a><figcaption><em>Eero Laine used this image as the heading for the post to announce the game's removal. Image credit: Eero Laine</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>"<em>But I have realized the AI is not actually free, and it has a major effect on the economy and environment. Some AI companies can use this game just existing as a reason to get more investment for their AI companies, that benefit no one, but rather suck resrouces from the economy from hard working people.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>I coded everything myself, so I can in the future make a new game with real assets if I feel like it, but the game existing in its current form is a disgrace to all game makers and players. Ethically only logical reason is to delete the game from Steam. The girl I've been dating for a month made me realize this. Thank you, Eero Laine</em>."</p>



<p>GenAI has been, and will continue to be, a controversial topic in video games. On one side, we have people like Eero Laine and indie publisher Hooded Horses, who are entirely against GenAI, <a href="https://wccftech.com/publisher-hooded-horse-added-no-fing-ai-assets-to-its-contracts-calls-genai-cancerous/">with the latter even adding a "<em>no f***ing AI assets" </em>clause to the contracts of games they decide to publish</a>. Starfinder: Afterlight developers Epictellers Entertainment told Wccftech, <a href="https://wccftech.com/theres-no-point-using-ai-for-any-creative-endeavor-says-game-developer/">"<em>there's no point in using AI for any creative endeavor</em>,"</a> and developers are even going out of their way to make it clear that they<a href="https://wccftech.com/nexon-ceo-claims-we-should-assume-every-game-company-now-using-ai-game-devs-say-no/"> not only don't use GenAI tools, but have no intention of ever using GenAI tools</a>.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, there are companies like <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/amidst-arc-raiders-success-embarks-use-of-gen-ai-voices-bubbles-over-even-epics-ceo-joins-the-fray/">Embark Studios</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-will-refrain-from-using-genai-tools-to-develop-concept-art-will-use-it-elsewhere/">Larian Studios</a></strong> that have been more open about their GenAI use and support, and plenty of others who <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-ceo-tim-sweeney-doesnt-think-digital-game-stores-should-have-generative-ai-tags/">believe that GenAI will become part of a game developer's toolset as much as anything else is</a>.</p>



<p>Whatever side of the aisle you sit on, it's clear that for Eero Laine, once his girlfriend pointed out some of the big negatives that go along with the current state of GenAI (<a href="https://wccftech.com/micron-exclusive-why-consumers-have-gotten-the-memory-shortage-narrative-all-wrong/">not to mention what's happening with RAM prices</a>), they could no longer support the tech, no matter how small their support may have been. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>An indie developer behind a <em>Balatro</em>-looking <a href="https://kotaku.com/divinity-gen-ai-larian-bg3-reddit-ama-2000658429">AI-generated</a> roguelike card game that launched in 2025 has announced that he is deleting the game from Steam after a girl he’s been dating for a bit helped him realize it was a “disgrace to all game makers.”</p> <p>On January 10, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3435450/view/525364745339929910">the store page for indie card game <em>Hardest</em> on Steam posted a surprising update</a>. According to developer Eero Laine, he’ll be removing <em>Hardest</em> completely from the Steam store on January 30. According to the update, <em>Hardest</em> was made in Summer 2025 using free tools provided by the developer’s university, and according to him, at the time, he didn’t realize the effect that AI tech can have on people’s jobs and the environment. <em>Hardest</em> was released on Steam in July 2025 and is free to play.</p> <p><wbr>“I made [<em>Hardest</em>] during the summer in couple months [sic] and thought to use AI because in university there is so much brainwashing on students and all the tools are given for free, so I could generate unlimited images for free,” said the developer on Steam in a post titled AI Is Bad. “But I have realized the AI is not actually free, and it has a major effect on the economy and environment. Some AI companies can use this game just existing as a reason the get more investment for their AI companies[sic], that benefit no one, but rather suck resources from the economy from hard working people.”</p> <p>According to Laine, he coded “everything” himself in <em>Hardest</em>, so in the future, he might try to build a new game with “real assets” using his past non-AI code. Laine concluded the Steam update with:&nbsp;<wbr>“But the game existing in its current form is a disgrace to all game makers and players. Ethically only logical reason is to delete the game from Steam. The girl I’ve been dating for a month made me realize this.”</p> <p>I’m not 100 percent sure, but I think this might be the first time someone has deleted a game from Steam because their new partner convinced them it was a disgrace and should be removed from the planet. Harsh, but in the case of <a href="https://kotaku.com/ai-generated-rpg-pixel-art-viral-elder-scrolls-daggerfall-2000616694">AI-generated</a> slop, accurate. Kudos to that young woman for doing some good work. And I hope Laine’s next game is great and not filled with ugly AI-generated art.&nbsp;<wbr><wbr></p>

Isn't it funny that we don't have a definitive reason as to why we dream? We have ideas, theories, like that they're the brain moving memories from short-term to long-term storage. But why the hell can they get so weird? And worse, scary. This feels like the central question at the heart of Mama's Sleeping Angels, an upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lethal-company">Lethal Company</a>-esque procedurally generated dream-exploration game where you're having a sleepover with friends and must feed a goddess within her dream.
</p>
<p>
The core "friendslop" structure is still in Mama's Sleeping Angels somewhere amongst the effervescent dream/nightmarescape. You can play by yourself, or with up to three friends. There are different maps to explore, themed around things like the suburbs, all procedurally generated. You must find items and return them to your spawn point to progress. It's just the donkey brains madness of it all that almost forces me to look away from my screen.

There is a texture to these dreamworlds that feels like a dirty needle poking right out of the ground, a collection of digital, mechanical, brutalist viscera so, not grotesque, just unfathomably in your face and loud. A cute flip phone sits in the top right of your screen, acting as your flashlight, but also your tool to analyse the items you are tasked with finding, unlocking memories and more about this strange plane.
</p><p>
This goddess, mother, is oh so hungry, and you have to feed her the items you find, the equivalent of selling off loot in Lethal Company. You'll come across baffling, almost imperceptible enemies that you can fend off with weapons that range from chainsaws to guns so grimey you can feel them on your keyboard. It is a Y2K smorgasbord for the zillenialpha generations that is as equally janky, and difficult to control, as it is mesmerizing. There's so much more going on here that I haven't begun to understand, like how you can saw off your own head and lop it into a grinder, or this one weird clown creature that taunts you behind a set of bars, but perhaps that's all for another time.
</p>
<p>
Right now there's no more precise a release date than Q1, 2026, but you too can try it out in a demo on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2918310/Mamas_Sleeping_Angels/">Steam</a> (if you're prepared to legitimately, probably have some weird dreams anyway).
