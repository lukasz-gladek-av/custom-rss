            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Tamagotchi Plaza Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 1 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157237/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>Back in the mid-to-late '90s, Tamagotchi virtual pets were a <em>massive</em> fad, with kids around the world eagerly raising and interacting with cutesy animals on their tiny pea-green screens. Though the fad inevitably died out, Tamagotchi continued to exist in various forms across the next couple of decades, including a handful of video games developed mostly for portable consoles.</p>
<p>Of these, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/tamagotchi_connection_corner_shop">Corner Shop</a> games on the DS and 3DS proved especially popular, and the new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tamagotchi-plaza-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Tamagotchi Plaza</a> acts as a sort of spiritual successor to them. Though it’s interesting and vaguely entertaining at first, Tamagotchi Plaza unfortunately reveals all too quickly that its limp collection of drab minigames has little value to offer the player.</p>
<p>Tamagotchi Plaza breaks the fourth wall and begins its plot with the player being abducted by Prince Tamahiko in his UFO and spirited away from Earth to Tamagotchi Planet. Despite a brief apology, you’re then thrust into the role of the chair for the Tamahiko Town development committee, which has been given the task of improving various aspects of the town to strengthen its bid to host the coveted Tamagotchi Fest. After appointing a vice-chair (who acts as your avatar), you then send them across town to work in the various shops and begin building everything up.</p>
<figure><a title="Tamagotchi Plaza Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 2 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157225/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>As far as plot goes, this is about as paper-thin as it gets, but the narrative here does a great job of setting an effective, cosy atmosphere through the interactions with the various residents. Everyone is so kind and supportive, you're almost inclined to forget that you were abducted and forced into labouring for this strange consumerist society.</p>
<p>Gameplay in Tamagotchi Plaza centres around a collection of minigame shops where you conduct various services, such as dentistry or pool service, for the residents and collect money while being rated on your performance. Over time (and after enough highly-rated performances), you can invest the money earned into the plaza itself to improve its visual aesthetics or into the shops to expand their selection of activities. On paper, it sounds like a good enough deal, granting a diverse selection of minigames to play at your own pace and slowly develop mastery in.</p>
<figure><a title="Tamagotchi Plaza Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 3 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157235/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The problem with all of this is… well, the minigames just aren’t that <em>good</em>. As opposed to something like the forgotten gem <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/nintendo_land">Nintendo Land</a>, which offered a series of brief but rich experiences, Tamagotchi Plaza's are largely dull and shallow affairs. For example, manning a shift at the ‘night pool’ involves you mixing drinks and giving towels to various pool patrons. When a request comes through, you simply select the correct drink ingredients from a small menu and give it to them.</p>
<p>Most minigames are similar in how they quickly show themselves to be mindless busywork—there’s no real sense of urgency or skill involved in doing whatever basic task. And though shop upgrades will help to make each respective minigame a <em>little</em> more complicated, you’re still ultimately grinding through mindless activities and being rewarded regardless of how poorly you perform. Even the Switch 2 exclusive shops, which utilise its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-all-mouse-mode-compatible-games">Mouse Mode</a>, fail to do much to make the pointer gimmick fun or interesting.</p>
<p>Adding insult to injury, the minigames are also sometimes just obtuse enough that it takes trial and error to even understand what you’re supposed to do. One shop tasks you with serving guests afternoon tea, but the menu of items to put together their order gives no indication or description of what makes its various items distinct, leading to frustrating sequences where you pick something that <em>looks ‘</em>sweet’ only for the guest to turn up their nose at it. Not all minigames are this annoying, but some basic directions upfront would be helpful to signal the objective.</p>
<figure><a title="Tamagotchi Plaza Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 4 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157238/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In its favour, Tamagotchi Plaza at least runs quite smoothly and looks great. The cutesy characters have a charming innocence to their designs, while the overall friendly, colourful, welcoming aesthetics of the plaza and various shops make navigating it a joy. Plus, fun little touches like a smartphone that you can use to explore texts with the locals and parse character profiles via the apps add a bit to the immersion. All of this runs at a consistent 60fps, rounding out the visual experience and making this <em>look</em> like a game that’s much better than it actually is.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Tamagotchi Plaza is a dull, vapid, and utterly unsatisfying minigame collection that rapidly overstays its welcome. Though charming and visually competent, the underlying gameplay is undercooked, unrewarding, and shallow with its ‘free mobile game’-like design.</p>
<p>There may be a valid case here for playing with very young children for some very light and simple entertainment, but even then, the price tag is comically high for the shallowness and quantity of content you’re getting. I’d suggest you steer clear; it’s worth neither your time nor your money.</p></section>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/steel-hunters">Steel Hunters</a>, a free-to-play mech shooter from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/world-of-tanks">World of Tanks</a> devs Wargaming, was only revealed last December. An early access release in April this year followed that Keighley Awards cameo, and just three months on, the game's been given a shutdown date.</p>
<p>It's not quite a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/concord">Concord</a>-level speedrun from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hero-shooter-concord-taken-offline-as-sony-say-its-initial-launch-didnt-land-the-way-wed-intended">the live-service cradle to the live-service grave</a>, but it's still a pretty quick one.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Today we share difficult news: we've made the decision to sunset Steel Hunters," Wargaming wrote in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1691340/view/527598784391155504?l=english">an update post</a> on Steam, "You've given us so much passion and support but unfortunately we've come to the conclusion that continuing development is not sustainable. We know this isn't the news anyone wanted to hear and we genuinely share in your disappointment."</p>
<p>Wargaming will be keeping the game's servers running for three more months, meaning they'll shut down around October 8th. Between now and then, the devs will be rolling out stuff like custom game support, a game mode that has every mech unlocked so folks can try out any they fancy, and a "farewell tournament" organised via the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/steelhunters">game's Discord server</a>.</p>
<p>Our Edwin <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/world-of-tanks-creators-reveal-steel-hunters-which-isnt-quite-world-of-mechs">saw a bit of Steel Hunters</a> while he was at the Game Awards, and wrote the following:</p>
<blockquote>I can’t say I’m blown away by what I’ve seen of Steel Hunters. It’s a cobbling together of genres and sci-fi archetypes that already feels like it’s going to ride principally on the association with World Of Tanks. It seems sturdily-made, however, and I’m kind of charmed by Wargaming’s ridiculous insistence on having their very own word for co-op teamwork – "Duo Symbiosis".</blockquote>
<p>Here's hoping the devs and players who made and were digging Steel Hunters can enjoy these final few months with the game.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steel-hunters-the-mech-shooter-from-world-of-tanks-devs-gets-a-shutdown-date-just-three-months-after-releasing-in-early-access]]></content:encoded>

		<p><em>Remember when you’d walk into a local music, book, or video store and there’d be an adorable section where the employees would recommend what they were interested in that month?&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>Welcome to our little version of it, called Remap Recommends.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>It's a chance for the staff at Remap to let you know what they've been playing, reading, listening to, or watching.</em></p><hr><h3 id="patrick-recommends-bad-influence-the-dark-side-of-kidfluencing">Patrick Recommends: <em>Bad Influence: The Dark Side of Kidfluencing</em></h3><figure><figcaption><span>Naturally, every kid would think it'd be cool to be popular on YouTube.</span></figcaption></figure><p>For many parents, the basic question in front of them is: should I share photos of my children online? OK, that’s not a basic question. Does sharing them to Facebook, so aunts and uncles can see them, despite the ills of Facebook, count? But let’s handwave those issues and boil it down to whether or not you are simply going to share digital album photos via text message, or, as most do, use private social accounts.</p><p>My children, however, did not ask to be the children of a journalist. Nor did I anticipate that becoming a parent would suddenly create a rich resource of ideas to report on, which is why I ended up starting off <a href="https://www.crossplay.news/?ref=remapradio.com"><em>Crossplay</em></a> in the wake of <em>Waypoint</em>’s implosion. I found myself asking questions about screen time, video games, and technology that I couldn’t find good answers for online, so I ultimately decided the best way to answer them was for me to answer them myself.</p><p>But I also set rules for myself. I don’t use their names. (Instead, I refer to them as oldest/youngest or their ages.) I generally do not publish pictures, and if a picture is unavoidable in order to explain what’s going on, their faces are blurred. I’ll share personal stories, but if it feels <em>too</em> personal, especially with my oldest, then that one is kept inside the family. I’ve slipped up here and there, but in general, I’m trying to use our experiences without <em>exploiting</em> them.&nbsp;</p><p>To me, I’m walking a fine line. But in watching <em>Bad Influence: The Dark Side of Kidfluencing</em>, you witness a bunch of parents and deeply exploited children springing past any semblance of a line. Watch and scream as a bunch of parents convince themselves what their kids are doing, what they’re <em>allowing</em> their kids to do, is both safe and creatively worthy endeavour. It has nothing to do with all the money it’s bringing in for everyone, while the algorithm consumes.</p><p>But even in my line of work, I can see how you can start convincing yourself “well, that’s okay,” because it’s true that the more personal you get, the more people respond. ("Personal" posts drive more subs.) It’s a combination of the parasocial and the algorithm, but in my most charitable moments, I can see how people climb a ladder that ends in exploitation, rather than executing malice in search of profit.</p><p>I don’t think it’s a perfect documentary and lets the parents off the hook, but it’s a worthwhile look at what’s happening on places like YouTube. It’s an extreme example, perhaps, but when you start walking backwards, you start seeing versions of this behavior all over the place, in which parents use their children if not for profit, then <em>attention</em>.</p><hr><h3 id="rob-recommends-baseball">Rob Recommends: Baseball?</h3><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@punttim?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Tim Gouw</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p>Every year I fall in love with the baseball playoffs and think, “I should watch more regular season games.” And every year I make it a few weeks into the season before I go, “Actually, the hell with that.” Except this year, I’m <em>loving </em>America’s pastime.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Live-service game development has become the ultimate gamble for any publisher. If you get a hit, you’re set—money will pour in for as long as you can surf the wave. If you miss, countless millions are lost forever. Most of them miss. The latest game to spectacularly fail to be a long-running cash cow is <em>Steel Hunters</em>, the extraction shooter released into Early Access just three months ago by <em>World of Tanks</em> creators Wargaming. It’ll be gone for good by October.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195618" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Unboxing The Baldur’s Gate 3 Collector’s Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="376" data-playlist="195618,196358,196626" data-current="195618"><div><p>Unboxing The Baldur’s Gate 3 Collector’s Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Properly revealed <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2024-trailers-announcements-world-premieres-1851720032/slides/23&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2024-trailers-announcements-world-premieres-1851720032/slides/23">during last December’s Game Awards</a></span>, <em>Steel Hunters</em> looked like it was going to be a spectacular mech combat game, with heavy <em>Transformers</em> vibes. Sure, it’s a terrible title, but it matches the utilitarian naming conventions of Wargaming, renowned for <em>World of Tanks </em>and <em>World of Warplanes</em>. The early footage looked incredible, and everyone loves a stompy robot online shooter, so given Wargaming’s history of enormous success it seemed like a reasonably safe bet.</p><p>But nope. Since <em>Steel Hunters</em> launched into Early Access April 2, it peaked at fewer than 4,500 players, and hasn’t managed over 1,000 concurrent players since April 18. And let’s stress: this is a free-to-play game, that hadn’t even added in-app purchases. At the time of writing, this free, live-service PvPvE shooter has 34 players online. Its peak so far in July is 138. It is a <em>colossal</em> flop.</p><p>Of the nearly 4,000 reviews on Steam, just 58 percent are positive, meaning <em>Steel Hunters</em> sits very firmly in the doomed Mixed territory. And while judgement is usually reserved when it comes to Early Access games, players had less reason to hope for significant change given the Steam page statement that the current build “represents a polished foundation of <em>Steel Hunters. </em>It includes the core gameplay mechanics, maps, Hunters, and progression system that provide a strong starting point for players.”</p><p>However, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1691340?emclan=103582791474864271&amp;emgid=527598784391155504&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1691340?emclan=103582791474864271&amp;emgid=527598784391155504" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an update added to Steam</a></span> July 8 explained that the game is not going to last. Titled “Sunsetting,” it begins, “Today we share difficult news.”</p><p>Addressing presumably the couple of hundred people still playing, Wargaming explains, “we’ve made the decision to sunset <em>Steel Hunters</em>. You’ve given us so much passion and support but unfortunately we’ve come to the conclusion that continuing development is not sustainable. We know this isn’t the news anyone wanted to hear and we genuinely share in your disappointment.”</p><p>It’s not being immediately switched off, however. Servers will remain online for another 90 days, and there are even plans to roll out custom game support, as well as unlocking all the game’s Hunters for people to play as—including some that were obviously intended to be added later.</p><p>If it had been hoped that the announcement might cause a rush return of players to make the most of the closing months, that’s been dashed. There were fewer players Tuesday than Monday. </p><p>The game itself is said to be fine.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Lunar Software has given an update on the ongoing development of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/routine">Routine</a>, the long-awaited retro-futuristic sci-fi horror game. As part of this,<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/606160/view/503954252358484700"> they’ve shared some new screenshots</a> of the game to whet your appetites once more, as well as some news about the soundtrack and Mick Gordon’s involvement.</p>
<p>We’ll start with the bad news, which is that Mick Gordon is no longer composing for the game. “In July 2024 Mick made the difficult decision to leave the project because of conflicts in his schedule,” the team writes. But all is not lost. “During his time with us, Mick created many outstanding audio assets that will be featured in the final game and provided invaluable audio direction for ROUTINE. These contributions will now be implemented by a new audio designer and team.”</p>


<p>On to the good-ish news. Writing together as a three-person team, Lunar’s Aaron, Jemma and Pete say:</p>
<p>“We know it’s been a while since our last update. Working on ROUTINE has always been a huge undertaking for a team of our size and because of that, felt it was important to keep our heads down and focus entirely on finishing ROUTINE. But we are aware of the interest in our work and we are sorry for any frustration that this may have caused.</p>



<p>“In short, ROUTINE is still very much in active development, and we are beginning to approach the finish line for the game. We’ve learned a lot from past experiences, one of those is not to commit to a release window before we’re absolutely sure we can hit it. However, we’re confident that we’ll be able to share more news on that front soon.”</p>
<p>We actually got to see a little snippet of gameplay recently when visiting Raw Fury, with the message being that the game was coming towards its final stages.</p>

		
		

<p>Until their next update, which hopefully won’t be quite so far away, they have a few screenshots to share from Union Plaza. This is a struggling tourist attraction on the Moon with the Living Quarters, Arcade and Mall all featured. It was within this Mall that we saw our gameplay snippet, using a strange video cassette gun to reveal secret messages, using dark light splatter to detect fingers on an interactive panel, and more. It was just a brief demo, though.</p>
<p>Since its first announcement in 2013, Lunar Software has been beavering away for over a decade to flesh out an immersive world to scare the heck out of you. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/06/09/routine-sci-fi-horror-game-re-revealed-with-a-creepy-new-trailer/">The last update we had for the game was way back in 2022</a>, where a re-reveal trailer featured during Summer Game Fest.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-enhances-xenoblade-chronicles-series-image-quality-and-performance-but-patches-are-still-very-much-needed.1239108/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Playing the Xenoblade Chronicles series on Nintendo Switch 2 seems to be the way to enjoy Monolith Soft's excellent RPGs at their best, but the system's backward compatibility feature's image quality and performance improvements are still not enough to make them truly shine.</p>



<p>A new analysis shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NinWRTV">Nintendo World Report </a>on YouTube takes a look at how all the entries in the series run on Nintendo Swicth 2, starting with Xenoblade Chronicles X Definitive Edition, the game that runs the best on the original Switch. On the new generation system, the remaster of the Wii U entry in the series maxes out the dynamic resolution range seen on the Switch, running at locked 1080p and 720p resolutions in docked and handheld modes, respectively, with solid image quality.</p>



<p>Things are much different in Xenoblade Chronicles 2. While the second entry in the series remains one of the most impressive Switch games ever, thanks to its advanced visual features like high quality character models and post-processing and the volumetric sea of clouds, these features came at a heavy cost in terms of resolution and framerate, which are very low on the original Switch. On Nintendo Switch 2, the game fares a little better, as it runs at locked 720p and 576p resolutions, the maximum possible resolution in the game's dynamic resolution ranges, in docked and handheld modes, but still with the same TAA solution and sharpening filter, which heavily impact image quality. The game's expansion fares a little better thanks to the less aggressive sharpening filter, but resolutions remain low. Performance, at least, becomes more solid with a locked 30 FPS framerate. Xenoblade Chronicles Definitive Edition on Nintendo Switch 2 fares not too differently from its sequel,  with locked 720p and 576p resolutions, and slightly better image quality thanks to the absence of the infamous sharpening filter.,</p>



<p>Better tailored to the capabilities of the original Nintendo Switch, Xenoblade Chronicles 3's image quality was considerably better than its predecessor's, also thanks to improved temporal upscaling. On Nintendo Switch 2, the third entry in the series runs at docked 720p resolution, but only at 480p resolution in handheld mode, which makes sense considering how this resolution scaled to 720p and 1080p, but ends up making the game's handheld mode on Switch 2 the worst out of all entries in the series.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>While even these minor improvements are welcome, there's no denying that dedicated Nintendo Switch 2 patches would be quite welcome to make the Xenoblade Chronicles series shine on the system. Hopefully, they will receive the same treatment as other Switch games, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-increases-resolution-six-times-splatoon-3/">Splatoon 3</a>, which has been massively improved on the new system with a resolution boost of up to six times.</p>

            <p>I'm a month late on this, but since we don't appear to have written about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kenshi">Kenshi</a> for about six years, I figured this was worth highlighting. Chris Hunt and Natalie Mikkelson of Lo-Fi Games recently put out a video chatting about Kenshi 2, their approach to design and, uh, their shared hatred for fondue. It's a lovely, unadorned look at game development, with Hunt and Mikkelson talking through how they basically learned to do everything on the fly, from Kenshi's beginnings to Lo-Fi Games's current size of 30 people.</p>

<p>Hunt describes Kenshi as about "a sort of philosophical idealism that you can overcome anything if you keep working hard, and improving, and training. And that's how I would love the world to be."</p>
<p>As for Kenshi 2, Hunt shares some bits and pieces we've already heard. The map will be around twice the size, but the game will be set in the same area as Kenshi, just 1000 years before. "The same location, but very different," says Hunt. "Different civilisations, different factions. You'll get a preview of the old empire and how things were."</p>
<p>"The whole point of travelling is that you go somewhere with a different culture," Hunt continues. "Different rules of survival, different dangers. It makes you want to travel. See what's out there".</p>
<p>They're later asked if the hundreds of hours Kenshi's players frequently spend with the game surprised them.</p>
<p>"I feel like my work now is more geared towards people playing it for that long", says Mikkelson. "So you're trying to make things not repeatable. So I find, for Kenshi 2, we're more aware now of people spending that amount of time, so we can try and adapt to it. So that people can play it that long, and it doesn't repeat and stuff."</p>
<p>"Yeah, I mean, I designed the game to be addictive like that," says Hunt. "But addictive in a good way. You can have evil addiction and good addiction. Evil is like, a typical free-to-play, 'maximise engagement' type of mentality from the designer. My type of addiction is, you're addicted because you're having fun. You're encountering problems and challenges. And even when you're away from the game, you're thinking of this challenge. Maybe you're at work and you're thinking 'how am I gonna get my guy back from those slavers?"</p>

<p>Which I found a little funny in a sort of "no, this is the <em>healthy crack</em>, you cretin," way, but then again Kenshi <em>is</em> very cheap <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/233860/Kenshi/">on Steam at the moment</a>. </p>
<p>As for why they're not showing much work-in-progress for Kenshi 2, Hunt says that keeping things quiet for as long as possible just makes development easier. "Once a game goes into the public eye, you get pressure, certain obligations and potential problems". This way, they can change things, make mistakes, go back on things. "Things aren't always made in the order that looks best for marketing," Hunt says, adding that a lot of the game is basic models right now, since that gives them the flexibility to change things.</p>
<p>"If we've said too much, that weakens our impact," says Mikkelson. "At the end of the day, we want to make more games. We need to do things properly and be patient, so that we succeed. Kenshi is a game about exploration and discovery. At least with my work, I don't want to say anything about it, because it ruins the whole player's experience of discovering that for themselves."</p>
<p>"Even once we're fully showing the game, a lot of our best stuff, we'll be holding it back," says Hunt. "There's a lot of stuff I consider spoilers that maybe a normal company wouldn't."</p>
<p>They're also asked at one point to choose between Kenshi's robot companion <a href="https://kenshi.fandom.com/wiki/Agnu">Agnu</a> and Fondue. As in, melted cheese dip. Just as a concept. They are not fans. "I really like cheese but…" says Mikkelson. "Yeah, it shouldn't be liquid" adds Hunt.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lo-fi-games-know-youve-spent-a-billion-hours-with-kenshi-so-theyre-working-on-making-the-sequels-discoveries-even-less-predictable]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The soundtrack for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</a> includes only 10 tracks from the original two games, after Tony Hawk himself wanted to emphasise music discovery.</p>
<p>The full soundtrack was <a href="https://www.tonyhawkthegame.com/uk/en/blog/2025/06/tony-hawk-pro-skater-three-four-full-soundtrack">revealed at the start of June</a> by publisher Activision, but ahead of the game's full release this week, reviews have criticised changes to the soundtrack and its lack of songs from the original games.</p>
<p>Out of the 69 songs across both Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 and 4, only 10 from the original games have been included. Instead, in some instances, a different song from the same artist has been used - the remainder are new to the series.</p>

<p>Those 10 returning songs are:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Faction - Skate &amp; Destroy</li>
<li>Gang Starr - Mass Appeal</li>
<li>JFA - Beach Blanket Bongout</li>
<li>RUN-D.M.C. - My Adidas</li>
<li>Motörhead - Ace of Spades</li>
<li>Del the Funky Homosapien - If You Must</li>
<li>AFI - The Boy Who Destroyed the World</li>
<li>Adolescents - Amoeba</li>
<li>CKY - 96 Quite Bitter Beings</li>
<li>Bodyjar - Not the Same</li>
</ol>
<p>One major reason for not including certain songs may be licensing issues.</p>
<p>However, in the same blog post revealing the soundtrack, Christopher Wilson, VP of production at Activision Publishing stated: "We wanted to keep the feel of the original games but also introduce new artists and songs."</p>
<p>He added: "Throughout the project, Tony added tracks and suggested using different songs from artists that were featured on the original games.</p>
<p>"The soundtrack is meant to be a love letter to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</a> franchise, skateboarding in general, and be an opportunity to showcase music that falls outside of the mainstream."</p>
<p>Wilson's comments <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/it-was-tony-hawks-choice-to-pick-some-different-songs-by-the-same-artists-in-pro-skater-34-remake">mirror those of Hawk himself</a>, who previously stated on an Instagram post it was his choice "to pick some different songs by the same artists featured in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3">THPS3</a>+4 OST".</p>
<p>"I'm hoping that discovery is half the fun, and a big reason that these soundtracks resonated in the first place," he said. "So listen and enjoy the ride."</p>
<p>Still, the soundtracks to all the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater games are iconic, reflecting the musical tastes of the early 00s. The changes have left some fans disappointed, in response to reviews by critics.</p>
<p>Also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawk-reportedly-intervened-to-get-bam-margera-in-pro-skater-3-4-remake-after-activision-said-no">returning for Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 is skater Bam Margera</a>, after Hawk intervened.</p>
<p>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 will be released on 11th July across Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PS4, PS5, Switch, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>, and PC (Steam, Battle.net, Microsoft).

            <link>https://wccftech.com/dungeons-dragons-group-franchise-model-dan-ayoub/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dungeons-dragons-group-shifts-to-%E2%80%98franchise-model%E2%80%99-internally-will-be-led-by-ex-halo-veteran.1239081/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A few hours ago, we learned that the Dungeons &amp; Dragons group within Wizards of the Coast would shift to a 'franchise model' internally, where everything about the beloved fantasy IP sits under the same roof. The news was <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7348517655173054464/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared on LinkedIn</a> by Dan Ayoub, a game industry veteran who spent a long time at Microsoft working on the Halo franchise, from Halo: Reach to Halo: Infinite. He left in 2021 to become Vice President at Certain Affinity, though that didn't last long, as he <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-halo-wars-head-dan-ayoub-wizards-of-the-coast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">moved again to Wizards of the Coast in 2022</a>, first as VP/Head of Studios and then as Senior VP of Digital Games. Now, Ayoub has been promoted to head the whole Dungeons &amp; Dragons franchise:</p>



<p><em>So, what happened today? We shifted our structure internally and D&amp;D moved to a full franchise model, meaning everything: books, video games, film, and TV – everything touching the franchise lives under one roof. The impact here cannot be overstated; this is massive for D&amp;D and will allow a strong, coordinated, and well-funded approach for the franchise, and most importantly, for us, the fans.</em></p>



<p><em>Finally, in a moment that doubtlessly has my childhood self doing cartwheels (and okay, maybe some old man cartwheels too), I've been asked to lead this new group! As of today, I am thrilled, humbled, and somewhat freaked out to be leading the Dungeons &amp; Dragons franchise for Wizards of the Coast.</em></p>



<p>Ayoub mentioned film and TV, but there are <a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-dragons-is-getting-another-videogame-while-hasbro-wont-finance-any-more-film-adaptations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no publicly known plans to create a sequel to Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves</a>, which only barely recouped its budget, and work on the TV series that was going to air on Paramount+ has been paused.</p>



<p>Wizards of the Coast does have plenty of Dungeons &amp; Dragons games in the works, though:</p>



<ul>
<li>The digital fantasy tabletop adventure game <a href="https://wccftech.com/demeo-x-dungeons-dragons-battlemarked-launches-in-late-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Demeo x DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS: Battlemarked</a>, out in late 2025;</li>



<li>Project Baxter, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-and-dragons-co-op-game-in-development-at-starbreeze-for-2026-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a co-op game in development at Starbreeze</a> and scheduled to launch next year;</li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">A little bit of Mario Kart trivia for you — what is the one Nintendo track you can't play anywhere but the series' smartphone spin-off <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-kart-tour">Mario Kart Tour</a>?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The answer is Piranha Plant Pipeline, a fun, waterslide-esque level set within the bowels of various Mushroom Kingdom warp pipes that for some reason never got ported over into Switch entry Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mario Kart Tour's lengthy track roster is a mix of classic tracks and new courses that also arrived in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe as part of the game's Booster Course Pass. These included Squeaky Clean Sprint, a level partially set in a toilet, and Sky-High Sundae, which was immediately brought back for Switch 2 as part of Mario Kart World's open-world map.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For unknown reasons, Piranha Plant Pipeline never made the jump to Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and because of Mario Kart Tour's rotating track selection it is only rarely playable. Indeed, Nintendo celebrated the track's return with a post <a href="https://twitter.com/mariokarttourEN/status/1942826049639006482?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1942826049639006482%7Ctwgr%5E81d207006539890989a8031d8157fbf376b45753%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fpublish.twitter.com%2F%3Furl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FmariokarttourEN%2Fstatus%2F1942826049639006482" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">today</a> on X/Twitter, while <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/mario-kart-tour-grants-access-to-a-track-unplayable-anywhere-else" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nintendo Life</a> notes that the course's reappearance now marks only the third time it has ever been playable, and its first appearance this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Well hello Piranha Plant Pipeline," one fan wrote. "Missed you so much."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you want to try out what may be Mario Kart's rarest track, you have until 22nd July to do it, before Piranha Plant Pipeline goes back in Nintendo's content vault. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Could we ever see it return in another Mario Kart game? Much will likely depend on Nintendo's plans to keep <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> fresh over the coming years — something the company is currently keeping schtum on. Fans strongly suspect that Nintendo will at some point detail a post-launch content roadmap for its hugely-popular Switch 2 launch title, though Nintendo is yet to say anything of how it may keep its racer refreshed over the coming generation. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">The Pipe Tour starts today and it features Piranha Plant Pipeline! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MarioKartTour?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#MarioKartTour</a> <a href="https://t.co/6X76J0X7w0" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/6X76J0X7w0</a></p>— Mario Kart Tour (@mariokarttourEN) <a href="https://twitter.com/mariokarttourEN/status/1942826049639006482?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 9, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, Nintendo's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-fans-upset-over-mario-kart-world-patch-that-makes-a-big-change-to-online-play-thanks-i-hate-it">only major update to Mario Kart World so far has been its unpopular move to further limit the chances of racing on the franchise's standard looped courses</a>, rather than so-called open-world 'intermission tracks'.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Nintendo wrapped up launching new content for Mario Kart Tour back in 2023, the game remains playable on iPhone and Android devices. Originally launched in 2019, Mario Kart Tour made millions for Nintendo, though its gacha-style system for unlocking characters and karts was heavily criticised, and was later removed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo smartphone has a mixed track record on keeping its smartphone games online, with several notable titles such as Miitomo, Draglia Lost and Dr. Mario World no longer playable. The original free-to-play version of Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp was shutdown, meanwhile, but replaced with a pricey paid-for alternative. Should Mario Kart Tour ever get retired, Piranha Plant Pipeline will disappear forever with it — so maybe give it a go now, while you can.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-by-daylight">Dead by Daylight</a> is ready to stick a rusty knife into its distended fleshsack of horror IP collaborations yet again, this time resulting in The Walking Dead splattering wetly onto its gore-soaked floor. We already knew the collaboration was coming, of course, but with its public test build now live, developer Behaviour Interactive has finally detailed exactly what's involved.
</p>
<p>
Dead by Daylight's The Walking Dead collaboration introduces two new survivors, bringing three new perks apiece: Rick Grimes - the man with more hat than personality (until he gave away his hat) - and formidable zombie slayer (plus pointy sword fan) Michonne Grimes.
</p>
<p>
Rick comes with the Apocalyptic Ingenuity perk, which enables him to turn broken pallets into fragile pallets after interacting with a certain number of chests, plus the Come and Get Me perk, which causes Rick to scream, alerting the killer to his aura, but prevents injured or dying survivors from leaving scratch marks or blood trails within a certain radius. Additionally, there's the Toughen Up teamwork perk, which reduces Rick's grunts of pain, scratch marks, and pools of blood when another survivor pallet-stuns or blinds the killer while he's injured.

<p>
As for Michonne, her Conviction perk lets her recover immediately after healing a survivor while downed, but Broken is then applied, downing her again after a certain length of time. Last Stand, meanwhile, is a once-per-trial perk that lets Michonne fast-vault and stun the killer after she's been in its terror radius for a set amount of time. As for her Throw Down teamwork perk, it gives Endurance to other survivors and lets them see the killer's aura briefly when she pallet-stun or blinds the killer. You'll find a few more specifics - alongside details of other updates and enhancements - in Behaviour Interactive's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/381210/view/538857783458533234?l=english">9.1.0 patch notes</a>.
</p>
<p>
Dead by Daylight's The Walking Dead collaboration - which arrives sandwiched between its previously announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-by-daylight-celebrates-ninth-anniversary-with-five-nights-at-freddys-and-the-witcher-collaborations">Five Nights at Freddy's and The Witcher collaborations</a> - can be played right now via the game's public test build on PC, but Behaviour notes Michonne Grimes won't be included due to "known technical issues". Expect these to be resolved, the studio says, in time for update 9.1.0's full release across all platforms on 29th July. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q9aM9Ch97U8">La jiggy jar jar doo</a>.

			<p>A new Stellar Blade mod now available for download brings significant visual improvements by introducing ray-traced global illumination to the game.</p>



<p>The mod, developed by Atlas813 and now available for download from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stellarblade/mods/1227?tab=description">Nexus Mods</a>, doesn't require any paid shared or third party assets so users don't need anything else other than ReShade to use it. Besides introducing RTGI with proper light bouncing and diffuse lights, the mod introduces ambient light correction, a sharpening effect that only sharpens close objects, among other features that introduce significant visual improvements as highlighted by the comparison screenshots below taken at 1080p resolution, max settings, and NVIDIA DLSS Quality.</p>

            <p>Former <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> game director Vinit Agarwal has announced he is off to Japan to start his own studio.</p>
<p>Agarwal was at Naughty Dog for a decade, before he departed the company in January of this year. During his time at the studio, he worked on both the Uncharted and The Last of Us series. Most recently, he was director of Naughty Dog's cancelled standalone The Last of Us online multiplayer.</p>

<p>Sharing a "couple of life updates" on <a href="https://x.com/vinixkun/status/1942603344746537024">social media last night</a>, Agarwal said: "Moving to Japan tomorrow. Also forming a game studio - more on that soon!"</p>
<p>While the developer did not share any further specifics on exactly what he will be working on when his new studio takes shape, in an <a href="https://x.com/vinixkun/status/1930309271683772464">earlier exchange on social media</a> Agarwal said he would continue to make multiplayer games following The Last of Us online's cancellation, as that is what he is "passionate about".</p>
<p>Naughty Dog's multiplayer game was initially planned to be part of The Last of Us Part 2, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-confirms-the-last-of-us-2-wont-have-multiplayer-after-all">in 2019 the studio announced its sequel would release as a solo experience</a>, with a multiplayer aspect planned to arrive at a later date. However, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-says-the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-needs-more-time">following word the studio needed more time on the project</a>, Naughty Dog ultimately <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-online-officially-cancelled-by-naughty-dog">cancelled The Last of Us' online multiplayer release in 2023</a>. At this time, the developer said it didn't want to become a "solely live service games studio".</p>
<p>Agarwal subsequently announced he was <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vinit-agarwal-47b3213_todays-my-last-day-naughty-dog-grateful-activity-7283634874274476032-KhfY/">leaving Naughty Dog in January of this year</a>. Sharing an update on LinkedIn, Agarwal said he was grateful for his decade at the studio, but the time had come for a "new adventure" and to make "something of [his] own". The former studio director then thanked his colleagues and mentors, namechecking Robert Cogburn, Erin Daly, Bruce Straley, Neil Druckmann and Evan Wells. Of those named, only Druckmann remains at Naughty Dog now.</p>

<p>Druckmann himself is currently working on Naughty Dog's all new game, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, having <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/neil-druckmann-steps-away-from-hbos-the-last-of-us-tv-adaptation">recently stepped back from The Last of Us TV adaptation to focus on the studio</a>.

<p>Earlier this year, the star of Naughty Dog's upcoming game said she'd received preparation for the role - and specifically the online reaction to it - from Druckmann himself, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-2-online-backlash-prompted-naughty-dogs-next-star-to-get-bootcamp-ing-from-neil-druckmann">following the online abuse previously kicked up around The Last of Us Part 2</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/former-uncharted-and-the-last-of-us-game-designer-starting-new-studio]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Turns out you don't need to be fans of the beautiful game to make a great video game of it or play it.</p>

            <p>If you're a fan of football games, you'll know they're likely a familiar affair at this point. A continuous river of annual releases, slight upgrades, and the prioritisation of simulating a real game of footy over anything too drastic. This might even be a bit of a stretch, with the majority of football fans starting and ending with EA Sports FC.</p>
<p>Enter Rematch, which has proven <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rematch-kicks-off-first-week-with-impressive-sales-and-player-milestones">exceptionally popular</a> since its release last month. The game managed to find a gap between the big-budget defenders and snuck in a shot on goal. CEO of developer Sloclap, Pierre Tarno, told Eurogamer that this current sports game ecosystem offered the perfect opportunity to tap into a vast community.</p>

<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="Rematch - Official Launch Trailer" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GEq40b0Mi3A?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

<p>Although it turns out, not necessarily football fans! Eurogamer is home to some big fans of Sloclap's moreish sports game, but even we can't deny that the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/for-the-love-of-ibrahimovic-rematch-players-learn-to-pass-before-i-become-the-very-thing-i-hate">Rematch players are sometimes infuriating</a>, which now is a lot easier to understand. Tarno claims: "There was a space, clearly. I do think however that our fans go further than those of sports games. In fact, we see via data, currently the core audience of Rematch lean towards those who play online competitive games rather than those who are fans of football."</p>
<p>This is true of the developers themselves, too. It may surprise you that even the developers at Slapclap aren't a collective of football fanatics. Tarno would go on to explain: "Loads of people in the team don't really care about football at all. But quite early on in the project, team mates who weren't super convinced by it - [after] when we ran internal tournaments - told me 'I get it now. I don't give a s**t about football, but this really struck something in me.' The dynamics, the team play, I think those are what make it interesting for players even if they don't like or play football games."</p>
<p>Tarno's reasoning for why the Rematch community has broken out this way is a simple one: "First of all I think it's something that's going to evolve. I think the main reason is the main portion of our untapped audience are players who are not as savvy about games, are perhaps not hardcore gamers, and are as such less aware of new releases. They may not inform themselves as much as core gamers who follow the news, monitor new releases, and will jump on games as they come out."</p>
<p>It's this ocean of sports fans that Slowclap aims to dive into through Rematch. Doing so, however, will take time: "They play FIFA, but they don't read Eurogamer. Maybe they play FIFA <em>and</em> Call of Duty! But they're just waiting for their annual release. To reach them it's about word of mouth, continuing to communicate, and keep rolling out updates."</p>
<p>As with all competitive games, the play styles in fashion change over time, new players become more familiar with the mechanics and a more established audience is cemented for the longhaul. Maybe, if we get our wish, goalies will stop trying to flick the ball over their head from inside their own area. We can hope.</p>

			<p>In the annals of mascot platformers, Gex goes largely forgotten. Behind the colossi of Mario, Sonic and even the second string of Crash and Spyro, the lecherous gecko ends up alongside the likes of Bubsy the Bob Cat in prestige. Unlike that feline protagonist, however, Gex has starred in some decent games. The relatively long-awaited Limited Run collection of the Gex Trilogy is the perfect way to try these titles on modern consoles. That being said, this is very much a time capsule of the late 90s context of the games with all that entails – good and bad.</p>
<p><iframe title="Gex Trilogy | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7voeA0cKjB8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Before going on to look at each of the three games individually, it’s worth taking a moment to consider the package as a whole. Limited Run are at pains to state that this is not a remake or remaster but instead uses their own Carbon Engine to present fully authentic versions of each game, albeit with quality of life improvements such as widescreen and analogue controls for 2 and 3. Saving is also improved, but does need to be done manually so make sure you don’t rely on the modern convenience of autosave. These are welcome improvements, but the end result is more like emulation than anything more involved and this has garnered some negative responses from buyers and fans. I knew this was the case going in and so am judging the collection based on what it is rather than any great Gexpectations. That being said, the lack of the Game Boy and N64 versions being included in the bundle is disappointing when compared to the likes of the<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/08/30/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-the-cowabunga-collection-review/"> Turtles Cowabunga Collection</a>.</p>


<p>There are a range of Gextras (Limited Run’s pun, though one I thoroughly approve of) included such as trailers, artwork, and a soundtrack player. These are nice inclusions, but feel a little clunky – the music player in particular is difficult to use. A better alternative would have been a separate soundtrack download as is the case with many collector’s editions. Looking back at the print and TV ads for the games is certainly illuminating in a nostalgic way and sets the scene for the lad’s mag and celebrity culture they were written to cater to.</p>


<p>With the context set, let’s turn to the games. First up is the 2D original Gex which is a landmark title having first been released on the 3D0 in 1995. Billed as the first 32-bit platformer it certainly turned heads back in the day, but not far enough to rescue a doomed system. Pretty soon after it was ported to PlayStation and the Sega Saturn, and it’s the former version that’s included here.</p>
<p>All that history in min,d I should probably talk about the game itself, but it’s honestly awful. Floaty controls, an overly large sprite and confusing level design all combine to make a title that is difficult to enjoy. If you do try it in order to experience the full series then at least there is a rewind function similar to most emulation programs (familiar if you’ve used the Switch Online systems) to help make it past some of the most frustrating and annoying sections. Trust me, you’ll be using this a lot.</p>

<p>With that Gextremely annoying first title out of the way things take a turn for the better. Gex: Enter the Gecko is a very traditional 3D platformer which clearly takes a great deal of influence from the likes of Mario 64 and especially Rare collectathons. Both PAL and NTSC versions are included in the package and I opted to play the European titles for the Gexclusive voice acting. The second game features the silky tones of legendary lothario Leslie Philips which makes for some entertaining incongruities as he quotes now dated cultural references such as “It’s like I’ve woken up in Boy George’s pants!”</p>
<p>Traversal through the game takes the familiar route of a hub world with portals to levels in which multiple objectives can be completed. Doing so unlocks remotes which in turn open up more levels and boss battles. While you don’t need to collect every remote to finish the game there is an Gextra ending scene in each game if you do so apparently (although they seemed to play for me without having done so). Every level also has Gexclusive collectables and gathering enough also awards a remote. As you work through the game you’ll visit a range of worlds inspired by TV and film including classic horror, kung fu movies and Looney Tunes cartoons. Gex has different costumes for each world, but these are entirely cosmetic in this title aside from a memorable boss fight where Gex gets to act out your T-Gex fantasies and fight as a kaiju.</p>

<p>The third game in the trilogy, Gex 3: Deep Cover Gecko, takes all the mechanics and systems from the second and improves on them. The hub world makes another appearance, although this time it’s a secret agent base for Gex who is now voiced by Danny John Jules of Red Dwarf fame. While the more modern voice acting is a much better fit for the sassy lizard, there are still the same dated references and parts that have not aged well. Chief among these is the inclusion of a Baywatch babe as Agent Xtra – Marliece Andrada, also known for the epic Playboy babes of Baywatch. Her appearances are mostly restricted to cringey video calls in which Gex gets to make some of the most inappropriate lines this side of an 80s Bond movie. The ending of the game famously suggests an altercation between the two heroes that the Angry Video Game Nerd was not Gexpecting. A Wild West level in which Gex rides a donkey also includes a caricature of the lizard as a Gexican that wouldn’t pass the sniff test nowadays.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		The Gex Trilogy is a good window into the history of gaming and the 3D games are still fun collectathon platformers, albeit with all the camera and control issues of the originals, and the awful 2D original I never want to play again. I would have liked to see a more Gexpansive remaster, and the result may not be entirely Gexceptional, but offers enough Gexperience to give you the kind of Gexual healing that only true nostalgia can provide.	</p></div>
