<p>While speaking on a panel at GDC, Pocketpair’s John Buckley, who leads the Pocketpair Publishing arm of the firm, took a deep dive into the rampant and overwhelming success of Palworld. In January 2024, Palworld – which was dubbed ‘Pokémon with guns’ – was released to the open market, going on to secure <strong>25 million players </strong>in a single month.</p>



<p>To this day, Pocketpair still has no idea how or why Palworld was such a roaring success, as Buckley revealed at GDC.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-things-started-to-get-weird">‘Things Started To Get Weird’</h2>



<p>On the panel at the Game Developer’s Conference, John ‘Bucky’ Buckley reeled off his impression of the release of Palworld, which took place a little more than a year ago:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We quickly go over a million wishlists within the first year, so we knew that something was happening, and it kept going.</p>



<p>2023 was when things got really weird – we rose to number three on Steam wishlists, then we hit a crazy peak around November 2023. People always ask us, ‘Why? What happened? How did you get so much attention?’ But we don’t know. If we knew how to do it, we’d do it again, but we have no idea what happened.</p>



<p>Within this first week, we hit this disgusting number that makes me feel sick when I see it.</p>



<p>Why did we get this many players? I don’t know, please don’t ask me. I know someone will ask me after, but I promise you we don’t know the answer.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>(thanks to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival/we-hit-this-disgusting-number-that-makes-me-feel-sick-palworld-devs-dont-know-why-their-survival-game-was-so-successful-if-we-knew-how-to-do-it-wed-do-it-again/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a> for the quote)</em></p>



<p>Palworld became one of the best-selling games in history, shattering player count records and skyrocketing up the charts on social and streaming platforms worldwide. It was an overnight sensation, and it became the talk of the town mere hours after hitting the market.</p>



<p>Pocketpair could barely handle the weight – and Epic Games struggled as well. The popularity of the game brought servers offline, struggling under the stress of the sheer volume of people trying to play the game.</p>



<p>While the player count has understandably petered off by now, Palworld remains a popular title that’s being updated by Pocketpair all the time. It wasn’t exactly a flash in the pan.</p>



<p>It’s tough to understand exactly why Palworld was such a success. Perhaps it’s the disbelief that it was ‘allowed’ to exist or the sheer inanity of the concept that pulled players in. Pocketpair doesn’t know, and I don’t know either.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-veteran-jason-blundell-is-founding-a-new-playstation-studio-called-dark-outlaw-games/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Former Call of Duty veteran Jason Blundell has revealed that he's leading the foundation of a brand new PlayStation development team called Dark Outlaw Games. As some of you might remember, Blundell left Treyarch in 2020 after&nbsp;<span>working on the first four Black Ops games. A year later, he&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> Deviation Games</span>, with the backing of Sony, albeit in an external capacity. Fast-forward another fifteen months or so and Blundell <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-deviation-games-loses-jason-blundell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">left Deviation Games</a>, too, not long before the studio closed down.</p>
<p>This time, Dark Outlaw Games is being structured inside PlayStation Studios, as Blundell said <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LY37_Cenui4&amp;t=4729s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on The Jeff Gerstmann Show</a>:</p>
<p>I<em>'ve had the amazing opportunity to create a new studio within PlayStation Studios for Sony. The studio is called Dark Outlaw Games, and we have been working away in the shadows for a while. When we got something to talk about, we'll step out into the light, but you know the story for me is always about the game, not about the studio. The reason why we're not doing a fanfare or shout about it from the rooftops is like, let's get something, right? But yeah, Dark Outlaw Games. It's such a privilege to be able to do it with Sony as a new first-party studio. Sony doesn't set up first-party studios all the time. To have that privilege is humbling; it's really nice. I'm really excited.</em></p>
<p><em>We're keeping it kind of low key. We have been going for a little bit of time now. Not gonna really comment about what we're doing exactly, but we're getting the team to gel, getting the ideas clicking and testing those. You know I'm a programmer at heart, so let's test those assumptions. Is it working? Again, we're trying to hit that escape velocity. But again, being asked to do something like this... I get the studio head and director. I'm just gonna keep that side. I got an executive producer this time. But yeah, it's very exciting, and I love the fact that still, at this point in my career, I'm given these opportunities.&nbsp;It's always that desire to, again, you want to put that one extra disc on the wall if you will. Can we bring something to an audience and excite them and get some new IPs? That makes me jump out of bed every morning. We'll be working tirelessly to get that ready.</em></p>
<p>Dark Outlaw Games is based in Los Angeles. For the time being, the studio appears to be relatively small, at least judging by LinkedIn. However, it's likely to staff up in the coming years. Given the average triple-A development time, we might have to wait until 2027 or 2028 before we get to see something concrete.</p>

<p>Ark: Survival Ascended, the controversial upgrade of the 2015 survival game, is getting a major expansion in November titled ‘Lost Colony’. It’s the first expansion designed specifically for the evolved version of the game, and it’s laying the foundations for the eventual release of Ark 2, which still doesn’t have a date.</p>



<p>It was mentioned by Studio Wildcard, the developer behind the Ark ecosystem, that Lost Colony will ‘connect the storylines of Ark’s Extinction and Genesis expansions and lead into the events of Ark 2.’</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-connections">Connections</h2>



<p>The link between Ark: Survival Ascended and Ark 2 is front and centre in Lost Colony, which features the vocal talents of Auli’i Cravalho, of Moana fame. She represents Meeka, a character revealed in the 2022 trailer for Ark 2, which also starred Vin Diesel. </p>



<p>To kick off 2025, Studio Wildcard revealed <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2399830/view/526457668016013820" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a two-year roadmap</a> for Ark: Survival Ascended that runs until December 2026. It’s relatively safe to assume that Ark 2 won’t be released before then, but if the later updates for Survival Ascended aren’t all that meaningful, perhaps Studio Wildcard could manage with a skeleton crew working on the ‘old game’.</p>



<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3583650/ARK_Lost_Colony/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Lost Colony</a> looks like a unique expansion at first blush. It’s fused with anime-style cutscene pieced together by MAPPA, a Japanese studio famed for the likes of Attack on Titan and Chainsaw Man. It’s being dubbed a ‘massive canonical expansion pack’ that’ll ease players into the impending world of Ark 2.</p>



<p>Players will get to explore Arat Prime, a frozen wasteland while battling their way through new enemies, exclusive ability trees, and fresh building systems. </p>



<p>Are you looking forward to Lost Colony and the release of Ark 2? Let me know in the comments.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/months-add-escape-from-tarkov-gun/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/it-can-take-months-to-add-a-new-gun-to-escape-from-tarkov-developer-reveals.1137381/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/months-add-escape-from-tarkov-gun/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a recent interview with Epic Games around Escape from Tarkov Arena, Battlestate Games’ Nikita Buyanov explained just how long it takes to develop a single weapon for the popular extraction shooter series. Escape from Tarkov has been on the market for almost a decade, and in that time, it has amassed a staggering arsenal of weaponry, but it’s not all that easy to add <strong>more</strong>.</p>



<p>Typically, new weapons will be introduced with major updates to the game – otherwise known as ‘wipes’. The weapons, Buyanov says, can take <strong>several months </strong>to be designed, created, coded, and balanced in Escape from Tarkov, and by association, Arena.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-putting-in-the-effort">Putting in the Effort</h2>



<p>In the discussion <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/fr/news/escape-from-tarkov-arena-interview-nikita-buyanov" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with Epic Games</a>, Buyanov, who heads the studio at Battlestate Games, explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s a long and complex process that requires many iterations. We have a large team of game designers and testers who constantly check and refine the balance. We also carefully listen to feedback from our community. Many people are passionate about&nbsp;<em>Tarkov</em>&nbsp;and eagerly share their comments and impressions with us.</p>



<p>It’s a very slow and meticulous process.</p>



<p>To fully implement a single weapon in the game, with textures, animations, and all the details, takes about two to three months. It depends on the specific weapon. The fastest one we ever made took about a month, but we already had the animations ready. However, for example, belt-fed machine guns <strong>take an average of four months</strong> to complete.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He stressed that the team has a perfectionist attitude towards new weapons because they’re all ‘gun nerds’:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We shoot real firearms very often. This is especially helpful for our programmers who work on the gameplay mechanics.</p>



<p>When you fire a real weapon, you hear it, smell the gunpowder, feel the weight, and experience the recoil, something in your mind shifts, and you start approaching weapon creation in the game with much greater attention to detail.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Fans of the extraction shooter might not agree with the perfectionist claims, but the weapons in Escape from Tarkov are being adjusted and balanced all the time in a bid to keep as many people as possible happy. Every time a major update surfaces, it seems a new meta emerges, and that’s often by design.</p>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows will be released this week, ushering in a new generation of Ubisoft’s open-world flagship franchise. In the run-up to the game’s release, the title (and Ubisoft itself) has been criticised numerous times for historical inaccuracy and faced intense backlash from ‘anti-woke’ grifters. </p>



<p>It was recently claimed by sources speaking to a French outlet that Ubisoft has prepared an anti-harassment plan, and that lawyers stand at the ready to pursue anyone attacking the company’s employees on social media.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-preparing-for-the-inevitable">Preparing for the Inevitable</h2>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows has already faced mass blowback, which has almost always been related to Yasuke, the African samurai representing one-half of the game’s dual protagonist operating model.</p>



<p>Ubisoft is no stranger to facing aggression online at the hands of keyboard warriors, but the chatter around Assassin’s Creed Shadows has been much more volatile than with any other game in the series.</p>



<p>In the report from <a href="https://www.bfmtv.com/tech/gaming/assassin-s-creed-shadows-pour-ubisoft-il-s-agit-de-sortir-de-l-ombre-ou-d-y-plonger-un-peu-plus_AV-202503170023.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">BFMTV</a>, it was claimed by unnamed Ubisoft employees that an anti-harassment plan has been presented to the CSE in Canada – the Communications Security Establishment:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s an initiative from Canada. There’s a team that monitors networks and acts quickly in the event of a targeted attack. Unlike what we’ve had before, this is serious.</p>



<p>Messages posted by internet users on X, Reddit, or even videos on YouTube will be closely monitored by a dedicated unit in order to respond quickly to the slightest problem. </p>



<p><strong>Lawyers are already ready</strong> to file complaints in the event of proven harassment.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Another claim stressed that Ubisoft has ordered a social media blackout of sorts, advising employees to <strong>not mention </strong>that they work at the company online to avoid harassment.</p>



<p>In a statement handed to <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/assassins-creed-shadows/ubisoft-anti-harassment-plan" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PCGamesN</a>, Ubisoft’s representatives backed up the initiative to keep employees safe but didn’t mention the specific plan:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Our stance has always been that team members’ social media channels are their own. Our top priority is the safety of our employees, including online, which is why, as a standard practice across Ubisoft, we offer guidance on navigating social media, digital safety, and support for team members’ well-being. </p>



<p>We also share resources to help prevent and protect against online harassment, something our teams have unfortunately faced.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows will be released worldwide on March 20. Stay tuned, because later today, my full review of the game will go live and you can get my full impression.</p>

Pre-orders will open in June. <span id="more-950673"></span></p><p>The expansion will feature “numerous cinema-grade” anime story sequences produced by Japanese animation studio MAPPA (known for Jujutsu Kaisen, Attack on Titan, Chainsaw Man), as well as the voice talents of Academy Award winner Michelle Yeoh (<em>Everything Everywhere All At Once</em>) reprising her A<em>RK: The Animated Series</em> role as Mei Yin, Madeleine Madden (<em>Wheel of Time</em>) as Helena Walker, Auli’i Cravalho (<em>Moana</em>) as Meeka, and other to-be-announced, fan-favorite characters voiced and depicted for the first time in-game.</p><p>Here is an overview of the content, via its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3583650/ARK_Lost_Colony/" target="_blank">Steam page</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Confront the demons of Arat Prime—birthplace of the ARKs—in <em>ARK: Survival Ascended</em>‘s first massive canonical expansion pack, <em>ARK: Lost Colony</em>! Starring Michelle Yeoh as Mei Yin in cinematic anime sequences by legendary Japanese studio MAPPA, the epic new story of <em>ARK: Lost Colony</em> bridges the gap from <em>ARK: Extinction</em> to <em>ARK: Genesis</em> and into the world of <em><a title="Games > ARK II [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/ark-ii">ARK II</a></em>. As you follow in Mei Yin’s footsteps through an intense journey into the heart of darkness, you’ll unlock powerful “Lost” character ability trees, befriend exotic tames, craft “Cursed” tiers of gear, and master advanced new building systems!</p><p>But beware, the frozen wastes of Arat Prime are not devoid of intelligent life; on the contrary, the city has become a war-torn battleground between twisted Element-powered ‘factions’ seeking to undo what was accomplished at the end of <em>ARK: Extinction</em>. Together with generations of heroes, you’ll unite the past and the future of <em>ARK</em>!</p></blockquote><p><em>ARK: Survival Ascended</em> is available now in Early Access for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [9,070 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [6,894 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [22,631 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2399830/ARK_Survival_Ascended/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p><!-- AD: content -->

Now, in March 2025, the domain "kotaku.com.au" is once again active, but sadly/predictably, in the worst way imaginable.</p><p>Rather than bring back the team behind the video games-oriented site, or even relaunching a hollowed-out version of the same idea, the new website is home to "The Kotaku Times", one of the saddest examples of domain-parking and SEO exploitation I've ever seen. There's the outline of a website there, but none of it is by or for human beings.</p><figure><figcaption>It will not surprise you to find that the zombie site there now does not really cover...any what it says it covers</figcaption></figure><p>OK, so. First, "Kotaku" isn't a real word! It was a kinda-racist name dreamt up by Gawker Media over 20 years ago; it makes no sense outside its original context, so it's already obvious this website only exists to try to skim off old backlinks and searches. Second, this isn't even a video games website, it's a shell posting SEO garbage like "Best Hair Bonnets for Sleeping in 2025" and "How to Create a Winning Business Plan: Step-by-Step Guide".</p><figure></figure><p>Third, every byline is by the same author, "Damian O'Gallagher",<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/damian-o-gallagher/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> someone who I am not convinced exists</a> despite claiming to have been a freelance writer for a decade, and could just be a cover for whatever AI slop is throwing all these unrelated, garbage articles together, which even when they're talking about specific video games are full of AI-generated images. All of which sucks, but also makes sense when you see<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/harrisonlavery/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the domain is now registered to an Australia "SEO Specialist"</a>.</p><p>Seeing a beloved website close down was bad enough. Seeing its domain brought back as this shambling corpse of a website, the dead internet in all its rotting glory, is even worse.</p><p>(Thanks<a href="https://web-cdn.bsky.app/profile/vook64.bsky.social/post/3lkkhz45urc2p" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Vooks</a>)</p><figure></figure></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/monster-hunter-movie"><h3>That Live Action Monster Hunter Movie Kinda Rips</h3></a><p>Who would’ve thought Paul W.S.

            <p>
Well here's a story I wasn't expecting to write when I got up this morning: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zenless-zone-zero-tier-list-best-characters">Zenless Zone Zero</a>'s notorious jiggle physics have struck again, only not like <em>that</em>. Eagle-eyed fans have discovered that, following the gacha game's latest update, its ambient cats now stroll gamely about the place with their testicles wiggling majestically from side to side.
</p>
<p>
Zenless Zone Zero's new 1.6 update - AKA Among the Forgotten Ruins - launched last week, with its <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/en-us/news/154662">various additions</a> including "enhancements to pedestrian behaviour in Lumina Square to make it more dynamic and diverse". Only, it turns out pedestrian behaviour wasn't the only thing that had suddenly been enhanced to become a lot more "dynamic".
</p>
<p>
Fans were surprised enough when HoYoverse decided it was going to <a href="https://www.hoyolab.com/article/30609455">bless every in-game feline with large round testicles</a> last summer. And now the developer - which very much appears to live by the motto, "If it <em>can</em> jiggle, it <em>will</em> jiggle" (see also <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a>'s Tartaglia and his quivering crotch) - has taken things to their perhaps inevitable conclusion.
</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="546"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ZZZ_Official/comments/1j9as1j/they_added_jiggle_physics_to_cats_balls/">They added jiggle physics to cat’s balls 🌚</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Cold_Mundane/">u/Cold_Mundane</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ZZZ_Official/">ZZZ_Official</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

"They added jiggle physics to cat's balls", one fan <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ZZZ_Official/comments/1j9as1j/they_added_jiggle_physics_to_cats_balls/">declared on Zenless Zone Zero's official subreddit</a>, before chucking in a side-eye moon-face emoji and a 22-second video highlighting the discovery by aggressively zooming in on a passing cat's independently swinging bollocks and situationally adjacent butthole. Is this really news?, you may well be asking yourself around about now. To which I respond by laughing maniacally and then evaporating into thin air.
</p>
<p>
Alongside Zenless Zone Zero's anatomical enhancements, last week's 1.6 update introduced new characters, a new area, and new events. Less positively, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/two-zenless-zone-zero-actors-lose-jobs-over-ai-dispute-without-notice-finding-out-alongside-players">recast two voice actors</a> - who both discovered the change when its patch notes went live.

                <p>Fortnite's roster of streamers who have skins in the item shop just got a little bigger with <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/not-clixbait-clix-joins-the-fortnite-icon-series" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the addition of Cody "Clix" Conrod</a>, who, at 19 years old, will be one of the youngest people ever to have a Fortnite skin based on them. Along with the new Clix skin, there will be a full slate of Clix-related cosmetics and, in a first for this sort of thing, a Clix-themed remix of an existing skin.</p><p>Clix, for those who aren't familiar, made a name for himself by earning a spot in the Fortnite World Cup in 2019 when he was just 14 years old. And while he continues to compete at the highest levels, he's also become a popular streamer and personality, which is how he's landed his very own Fortnite skin.</p><p>Clix's slate of cosmetics will include a single skin that comes with two distinctive styles based on <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/1977965-fernanfloo-dresses-up-my-wifes-funeral" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a meme you probably know</a> even if he's new to you--one in which he's sporting a t-shirt and pajama pants, and another in which he's wearing a suit and tie. In addition to the skin, Clix's set includes two back blings, two emotes, a wrap, and a pickaxe.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4460449-clixiconseries-clixmeme.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4460449" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4460449-clixiconseries-clixmeme.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4460449"></a><figcaption>Me at my aunt's wedding vs. me when the Fortnite item shop resets.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4460449-clixiconseries-clixmeme.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4460443-clixfortniteskin.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4460442-clixiconseries-clixykeyesbackbling.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4460441-clixiconseries-sparxoutfit.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4460440-clixiconseries-clixcosmetics.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4460439-clixiconseries-dr3aminspray.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4460443,1300-4460442,1300-4460441,1300-4460440,1300-4460439" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1757/17577455/4460443-clixfortniteskin.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1757/17577455/4460442-clixiconseries-clixykeyesbackbling.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1757/17577455/4460441-clixiconseries-sparxoutfit.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1757/17577455/4460440-clixiconseries-clixcosmetics.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1757/17577455/4460439-clixiconseries-dr3aminspray.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4460443-clixfortniteskin.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4460442-clixiconseries-clixykeyesbackbling.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4460441-clixiconseries-sparxoutfit.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4460440-clixiconseries-clixcosmetics.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4460439-clixiconseries-dr3aminspray.jpg"></figure><p>There's also a new Clix-themed version of the Sparkplug skin called Sparx. Everything listed here will be sold in the item shop starting March 22, both individually (including the back blings) and as part of one large bundle that includes all of it.</p><p>As is customary for this sort of thing, Fortnite will offer players the chance to unlock the whole set of cosmetics for free by participating in the Clix Icon Cup, a battle royale trios (builds only) tournament taking place on March 21--those in the top tier of performers for each region will earn the full bundle. But in an unusual move, there's also a consolation prize for those who just miss out: the next-best tier of performers will get the Sparx outflit. Anyone who earns at least 8 points in the tournament will get a spray.</p><p>Clix will become the person born most recently to have a Fortnite skin, dethroning The Kid Laroi, who was also 19 when he got a skin in 2023. But here's a fun fact: Kyle "Bugha" Giersdorf got his Fortnite skin when he was 18, making him the youngest to ever earn that honor.</p>

			<p>In just a few hours, Fallout 76 will be updated with the long-anticipated <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-ghoul-experience-detailed-by-bethesda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">option to choose a Ghoul as your playable character</a>, featuring 30 Ghoul-dedicated Perk Cards and an all-new mechanics called the Feral Meter. As you might remember, Bethesda Game Studios first <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-gets-skyline-valley-map-expansion-today-caravan-outposts-in-fall-2024-playable-ghouls-in-early-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that this was coming over nine months ago, leaving players a long time to salivate over the opportunity.</p>
<p>The wait is almost over, though, and to tide you over in these last few hours, we have an exclusive interview with Creative Director Jon Rush and Senior Producer Bill Lacoste. In this conversation, we dived into the specifics of playing as Ghouls, the origins of the feature, and the potential balance issues, and we even asked a few general questions about Fallout 76 and its future. Keep scrolling to read the full transcript. By the way, players will have the chance to get a level 50 character boost when this patch launches in case they want to make the Ghoul right away as an alternate character.</p>

<p><strong>The big news is obviously the new playable race, the Ghoul. When was the first time that you discussed this possibility within the team? Was it before the Amazon Prime TV show, which obviously made it very popular thanks to the character played by Walton Goggins, or later?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bill Lacoste:</strong> Yeah, I get what you're saying. I think all of us secretly have always wanted to play as a ghoul in the Wasteland. This is a kind of idea that's been floating around for a while, but we really only put pen to paper on it last year and started executing on it. It just so happened that the show really kind of helped that grow. The popularity of The Ghoul made it a much more impressive and also recognizable feature that players wanted to engage in.</p>
<p>We started off going through this process of understanding what it would be like as a player to be a Ghoul in the Wasteland. Some of the things we started off with were basically that this wasn't going to be a very simplified system of just like, hey, let's give players a disguise or some mask or whatever it is that they can run around and look like a Ghoul.</p>
<p>We didn't want that to be the case. We wanted to actually present a new way to play Fallout 76, and that's what the Ghoul brings with it. As you've seen, we've got Legendary perks and regular perks (there are 30 total across both groups) available only to Ghouls, and a wide range of loadouts.</p>
<p>Those systems affect typical gameplay. But this idea of wanting to play as Ghoul, I think it has been something on players' minds for a really long time, even our own minds. We started executing it last year and we are right around the corner from getting this out for players to engage with.</p>
<p><strong>As you said, of course, there are quite a few differences from playing a regular human. Did you consider giving your Ghoul different reactions when going through the main Fallout 76 story&nbsp;via dialogue or something like that? If not, is it maybe something that could come in the future, possibly?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jon Rush:</strong> For existing content, no, there was not a desire to go back and touch existing content. For future content, absolutely. Ghouls will be taken into consideration for current content. What's going to be taken into consideration is also how the different factions react to Ghouls. If you're a Ghoul and you go to Fort Atlas and visit the Brotherhood of Steel, it's not going to be a very warm welcome.</p>
<p><strong>Can you discuss the disguise system and how it evolved internally? I also read some comments saying it may be a bit too complex. How do you feel about it? Are you going to tweak it further?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jon Rush: </strong>The sole requirement of being a Ghoul is that you're level 50. So, if you are a level 50 player who hasn't done some of the main story content in Fallout 76 and you decide to become a Ghoul, let's say you haven't done the Fort Atlas Brotherhood of Steel stuff, you're not going to be able to do that now, right? The disguise system was a way to allow players to be able to still do that content. There's a Ghoul who can apply a disguise to your character for a cost, and while that disguise is applied, you can go and do quests like that that maybe you couldn't have as a Ghoul. You can interface with the Brotherhood of Steel and you're disguised enough to where they're not really worried about or even thinking about if you're a ghoul.</p>
<p>When you're done with that, you can't take the disguise off yourself. This is administered by a specialist, so you have to go back to that same person and that same NPC will take the disguise off, returning you back to your normal Ghoul form. That's essentially how it works. It's to enable players to be able to do content that they may have missed out on and not regret their choice of becoming a Ghoul because they can't do it.</p>
<p><strong>Are you going to add any kind of variations to the mask?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jon Rush:</strong> Yeah, possibly.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'There are a lot of penalties that you will incur as you continue to allow that feral meter to drop. Now, however, once you are fully feral, you also get a pretty big increase to your melee damage. So there are positives and negatives there, but as a Ghoul, you are going to have to manage that feral meter with chems more often than you would as a human with hunger and thirst.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>On some level, I'd say, with all the perks and radiation healing you, it almost sounds like it's going to be better as a player to play as a Ghoul. How are you going to balance that? Are you a bit worried that a lot of players will just turn into Ghouls and never look back? How are you going to approach it from a balancing standpoint?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jon Rush:</strong> It depends on how the player wants to play. If you're in Power Armor, you're at a real disadvantage because Ghouls benefit from having radiation. So, if you're a player who wants to play in Power Armor, you would probably want to rethink playing a Ghoul in that sense.</p>
<p>If you're somebody who wants to try to fulfill other roles within groups or on your own, depending on how you spec your loadout, then a Ghoul might be more appealing. So, yes, the balance is tricky, and I'm sure it'll be ongoing even after release. But I think for the first stab at it in the initial release, we've got a lot of good data off of our time on PTS, and I think players are gonna have a lot of options to play with, not necessarily 'I'm at a disadvantage because I'm not a ghoul'. In some cases, yes, and in some cases, no. It's kind of the whole part of the balance.</p>
<p><strong>Bill Lacoste: </strong>Yeah, and I think specifically about the feral meter, what we have for the Ghoul is very similar to the older hunger and thirst system that we had for original humans in that it was subtractive, meaning now what you have as a human is additive. You don't really have to eat or drink, as a human, you don't get those negative penalties like you normally would originally.</p>
<p>But as a Ghoul, when the feral meter starts to drain, there's going to be specific thresholds where you will actually incur some penalties. Some of those will be to your Charisma in some cases, especially at higher levels, you'll have hit points, action points, and also endurance penalties as well.</p>
<p>So, there are a lot of penalties that you will incur as you continue to allow that feral meter to drop. Now, however, once you are fully feral, you also get a pretty big increase to your melee damage. So there are positives and negatives there, but as a Ghoul, you are going to have to manage that feral meter with chems more often than you would as a human with hunger and thirst.</p>
<p><strong>With the new mods, especially the four-star legendary mods and the other changes, potentially fine-tuning the perks if you play as a Ghoul now, how are you going to address that potential for power creep?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jon Rush:</strong> There might be some, but, you know, it's very much in line with plans that we have for our in-game content in the game. I think Gleaming Depths is a nice glimpse of what our plans are in that regard. So, if you think you're powerful now, just wait. We'll change your mind.</p>
<p><strong>All right. Now that you've mentioned it, you <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-gleaming-depths-update-now-available-adding-biggest-boss-yet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> the Gleaming Depths update late last year when you introduced raids for the first time in Fallout 76. What was the community's reaction to it? Of course, the big question is, do you plan to add anymore like that in the future?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jon Rush: </strong>Our community had a really positive reaction to it. We saw that there was a need. Our in-game players, those with character levels of 200+, were looking for something more challenging. Gleaming Depths was kind of our first offering, providing them with a more challenging in-game specific experience where they get in-game specific rewards. It was met really well. I think it's kind of emboldened us for future roadmap decisions. I'm not going to discuss any of that here today, but you could definitely tell players like that sort of content.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'I think it's kind of emboldened us for future roadmap decisions. I'm not going to discuss any of that here today, but you could definitely tell players like that sort of content.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Yeah, I definitely do as well. I played a lot of Fallout 76, but it's been mostly kind of solo.&nbsp;I also enjoy playing MMOs with friends, grouping for dungeons and raids. So, more of that content, personally, would be great. It's very interesting content for me. On another note, do you have anything planned for PvP at all? I know right now the game is mostly just PvE-focused for the most part, but are you considering any more PVP content or features?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jon Rush: </strong>Well, seeing how our players play and how they want to play the game, I do recognize that we have some players who are really into PVP games. It seems that the vast majority of our players just are not. They want to help one another; they&nbsp;want to group up with one another and adventure together. Efforts to sort of spur PVP initiatives along in the game have been kind of met with really middling results. So, as far as future Fallout 76 updates that are PVP-centric, I'm not going to rule out the possibility and say absolutely not, but it's not really what our players want.</p>
<p><strong>Bill Lacoste: </strong>Just to expand on what Jon said, at the very beginning, we did have a lot of PVP elements in the game and we found out that people were just helping each other. So it's like, hey, we've given you this element here to engage with each other and all you're doing is helping each other. You're not actually attacking each other, which was kind of funny to see. It was pretty good data to kind of parse through and take a look at and see how the community was treating each other, and I think that just expands into what we have today. It's just a fun, loving, good community of folks who are willing to help each other get through this game. It's really fun to see.</p>
<p>Like Jon said, I don't think we would ever rule it out, but for now, the main focus for our players is doing more content, but also having additional ways to play the game and different ways to play the game, and that's kind of what we're focused on.</p>
<p><strong>Some players feel that the trade system is a bit unsafe. It has some potential for players to get scammed. Is that something you feel is an issue and something that you could improve upon?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bill Lacoste: </strong>Yeah, it's something we're actually looking at right now because the current system is a one-way trade system, which doesn't really do what we expected it to do. We are looking at that, and we hope to have some updates for players in the future on how we're improving that system.</p>
<p><strong>Jon Rush: </strong>In the meantime, the wasteland is a dangerous place. Be&nbsp;careful who to trust.</p>
<p><strong>Alright. I don't know if you look much at the PC modding Fallout 76 community. There are several PC mods that players use. Aside from the visuals, but also for quality of life improvements. I wonder if maybe you have thought about potentially adding any of those features to the game. For example, the most important one, from my point of view, would be text chat, which <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/151" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there is a mod for</a>, but it only works, of course, with other players that have the mod installed. Personally,&nbsp;again, coming from an MMO player background, it's something that I love as a way to interact with the community.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bill Lacoste: </strong>We have some accessibility features that we've added recently with text-to-speech and speech-to-text. That's going to be expanded further in the future, but for us, there's also the safety issue and there is the element of needing to make sure that we are protecting players that are in the game when those things happen, because we want to make sure that people are safe from abuse both from text and from audio. When we build those systems, there are a lot more things that we have to go through in terms of legalities and also just protection of players so that they can report and our CS team can actually engage.</p>
<p>So, you know, outside the community, you all don't usually have to worry about those things, but when we have to build it out, we do. At the end of the day, we just want to make sure that what we're providing to players in terms of those features and systems is going to be beneficial to them but also provides them protection. It's just an unfortunate part of online games sometimes. Most of the people in Fallout 76 are great, but&nbsp;every now and then, you get somebody who comes in and is just trying to troll people and get in the way of them having fun. If that's gonna happen, we need to make sure that we have protections in place for folks so that we can action them when they're being out of line.</p>
<p><strong>Can you talk about Big Bloom and how it has become a new seasonal event?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jon Rush: </strong>Yeah. Our seasonal events are always really popular with our players, but what we had come to notice was we were having to repeat some seasonal events more and more throughout the year, largely to cover gaps in our seasonal event roster. Something we had noticed was that we were missing kind of really like a really solid Springtime event to sort of supersede Meat Week, which comes later in the Summer. so a nice springtime theming, that's how Big Bloom came about with the sort of springtime theming and we'll be running it at that time every year.</p>
<p><strong>When it comes to Season 20 'Glow of the Ghoul', what's the thing that you're most excited about for players to see?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jon Rush: </strong>I think players are going to like the goo tub or the spa filled with goo. That's&nbsp;kind of fun!</p>
<p><strong>Would you consider making fast travel to other player camps free or cheaper at least?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bill Lacoste: </strong>No.</p>
<p><strong>Jon Rush: </strong>Yeah, probably not. They can spend them.</p>
<p><strong>Bill Lacoste: </strong>If you're in a team, you can fast travel to your friends, even if they're not at their camp as well. There's a lot of ways for players to navigate around the map at a pretty cheap cost anyway. As you know, players run around in this game at 40,000 caps, most of the time, anyway. There's no real reason to adjust that for any time in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Not long ago, you expanded the Fallout 76 map with Skyline Valley last year. That was the first time, I think, since the release. Do you think any more map expansion could be coming, or would you just go back to creating separate world spaces like you've done as well?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jon Rush: </strong>Possibly. We would like to use that map expansion as kind of a continuation of our Appalachia story, so if there's more story we want to tell and it needs a new region, we know the players received it really well. They like getting the new stories, they like having the new space to build and tell their own stories with their friends through adventuring and whatnot, so it's definitely a possibility.</p>
<p><strong>Before closing, I wanted to ask how the game is doing right now. I know that around a year ago, especially with the popularity of the TV show, <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-breaks-1-million-players-in-a-day-whole-franchise-nearly-hits-5-million-players-in-a-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there was a big increase in the player base</a>. Are you able to share whether that's still happening and also maybe how that affects the team's ongoing efforts to support Fallout 76 in the future?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jon Rush: </strong>The game continues to be a success. We definitely saw a lot of success last year with the release of the show and the show kind of casting a bit of a spotlight on all the Fallout IP. So, there were people hopping into Fallout 3, 4, 76. 76 is still thriving, it's still growing. We have more ideas than we could possibly ever do and have no plans to stop. We're going to continue supporting this game, continue supporting our players and telling the story. There's never been a better time to adventure with your friends in the wasteland.</p>
<p><strong>From a technical perspective, would it be too onerous to add crossplay and potentially make it one big community, as several online games have been doing lately?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jon Rush: </strong>We've had discussions about crossplay in the past. There's a lot of technical limitations with that. I wouldn't rule it out, but I wouldn't be waiting around for it, either.</p>
<p><strong>A couple of months ago, you <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-wont-get-crazy-with-cross-overs-for-fallout-tv-season-2-the-devs-wont-overdo-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> there could be more crossovers with the second season of the Amazon TV series, but nothing too crazy, right? It doesn't seem like you want to push heavily on that.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jon Rush: </strong>Well, it's a little tricky because Fallout 76 exists the furthest back in the timeline, and the show is the furthest ahead, so a crossover is kind of hard to do because of the huge time difference. Where there's an opportunity to do that, possibly. We've had discussions about it. Maybe some of that's coming, maybe it's not. You'll have to stay tuned and&nbsp;find out for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/monster-hunter-movie<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For the past five years, I was under the impression that the live-action Monster Hunter movie never came out. I merely laughed after watching its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dK5Z-N3g9f8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trailer</a>, thinking it was another audacious project by the director-actor duo of Paul W.S. Anderson and Milla Jovovich that vanished into oblivion. I did not hear a single comment from people who enjoy criticizing live-action video game adaptations on social media, so I assumed we collectively imagined it. Last week, Hulu gave me a double whammy, revealing that the live-action film was released in 2020 and is <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/539910/monster-hunter-movie-watch-streaming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">streaming on its platform</a> just in time for gamers diving into <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-monster-hunter-wilds-streamlined" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em></a> to rubberneck at it. Like a crab in a barrel, I persuaded my partner (who has been enjoying <em>Wilds</em> as her first MonHun game) to watch it with me this weekend, expecting a shitty movie.</p><p>Moments into <em>Monster Hunter</em>, I had the niggling feeling the movie wasn’t trying to be a movie. Follow me here: I think <em>Monster Hunter</em> was made to be a feature film ad that entices both general audiences and <em>Call of Duty </em>players into giving the Capcom series a whirl. Knowing that <em>Monster Hunter:</em> <em>World </em>and <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 4</em> were released at opposite ends of 2018,&nbsp; and that the film released a month after <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War </em>feels purposely marketed to court <em>CoD Blops</em> normies, and the film does a lot of work to show how much cooler hunting monster is compared to mindlessly shooting things with a gun.&nbsp;</p><p>Case in point: After copy-pasting the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPuJC8i5djs&amp;pp=ygUlbW9uc3RlciBodW50ZXIgd29ybGQgb3BlbmluZyBjdXRzY2VuZQ%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opening cutscene of <em>Monster Hunter: World</em></a>, the movie cuts away from shipwrecked MonHun-looking characters combating an ambush to a bland scene where a bunch of modern-day military guys drive around in their humvees. As if aping the painfully dull and patriotic directorial style of Michael Bay’s <em>Transformer </em>trilogy, we see the group, lead by Milla Jovovich’s Artemis, rapper T.I.’s Link, and Megan Good’s Dash singing military chants before a storm teleports them into another world. Almost immediately, the group’s machine guns and grenades prove futile against titular monsters like <a href="https://monsterhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Diablos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Diablos</a> and <a href="https://monsterhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Nerscylla" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nerscylla</a>, and all but Milla are killed off. Good’s Dash, true to her name, dies in the most unceremonious matter in the film’s early going, continuing her trend of never being the final girl in any movie she’s randomly starred in. However, the funniest death goes to T.I., who awkwardly yells about his tummy hurting before a bunch of spiders scatter out of his armpit, leading him to cry, “YOU GOTTA GO!” to Milla before getting ripped in half. From here on, Milla runs into action movie star Tony Jaa, who plays the stand-in character for <em>MonHun</em>, and the $60 million ad truly begins.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>A friendship forged through a Hershey's product placement. <span></span><span>© Capcom/Sony Pictures</span></figcaption></figure><p>In contrast to Jovovich and Anderson’s past works with the<em> Resident Evil</em> films, which would’ve been unoffensive romps had they not had the zombie shooter’s name attached to them, <em>Monster Hunter</em> nails the whole onboarding process and appeal of the game it's based on. After witnessing Jaa and Jovovich become friends thanks to a Hershey’s chocolate bar, we see the pair overcome each other's language barrier and get in sync, setting traps and working together to capture and slay monsters. We see them use each other as bait to lure monsters into <em>Home Alone</em> traps, harvest said monsters to upgrade their armor and concoct poison attachments for weapons, and lab combo strings and grapple hook techniques. We even see their raiding party (which includes Ron Pearlman wearing a lousy wig that makes him look like the Cowardly Lion from <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>) go to shit when they challenge a Rathalos without a gameplan. If anything, what the film lacked in compelling character writing it more than made up for in encouraging cross-talk between my partner and I talking about the film not quite nailing Rathalos’ weakness, how she should use the bow and arrow more, and how the bone saw sword rips. My partner, with all of a week of <em>Wilds</em> under her belt, whispered, “They need an Alma in their life” after their epic fail.&nbsp;</p><p>The saving grace of this unabashed advertisement of a film was that it did not skimp on making its CGI monsters look fucking sick. Each creature has a <em>Land of the Lost</em> mix of claymation-meets-CGI while scratching Godzilla fans' itch to give them as much screentime as the boring humans. The film’s finale, pulling a reverse isekai by having the big bad Rathalos follow Milla through the dimension portal and tear military tanks and heli-carriers to shreds, did something for me carnally as a kaiju sicko. Had the film left well enough alone by omitting its shitty reshoot sequel-bait ending, the film would’ve been a solid C+ experience. I can confidently tell you that we’re never getting <em>Monster Hunter</em> <em>2</em>: <em>Electric Boogaloo</em>, no matter how enticing that final shot of the Gore Magala was.&nbsp;</p><p>Make no mistake: <em>Monster Hunter</em> is not a competent film with bells and whistles like compelling characters and a story woven into the connective tissue of its CGI monster fights. It is, however, a serviceable 100-minute feature film Super Bowl that’ll make you want to pick up the game. &nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/kotaku-australia-dead-inside-do-not-enter"><h3>Kotaku.com.au Would Have Been Better Off Dead</h3></a><p>A 404 would have been preferable to whatever this is</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/kotick-kotaku-gizmodo"><h3>Report: Bobby Kotick Files Defamation Suit Against Gizmodo And Kotaku</h3></a><p>The suit is over details in a pair of articles about Kotick's rumored interest in buying TikTok</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The new drop of experimental art cards are all about furry companions: cats and dogs. In fact, these two drops are part of a competition.</p>



<p>According to the official <a href="https://secretlair.wizards.com/us/chaosvault#filter-product-1151172|sort-availability_wotc,featured" rel="nofollow">store page</a>, the newest Chaos Vault Secret Lair contains two drops. One drop is called Cats Are Better Dogs. The other is called Dogs Are Better Than Cats. Both drops contain alternative artwork of the same five cards, but showcasing the preferred animal of choice.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/chaos-vault-secret-lair-cat-escape-to-the-wilds.jpg?itok=-MP_cwyL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/chaos-vault-secret-lair-cat-escape-to-the-wilds.jpg?itok=wDtHbJl_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Both drops contain cat and dog-themed versions of the following cards:</p>

<ul><li>Escape to the Wilds</li>
	<li>Rip Apart</li>
	<li>Titanic Ultimatum</li>
	<li>Arcane Signet</li>
	<li>Basilisk Collar</li>
</ul><p>Here is where the competition comes into play for this Chaos Vault Secret Lair. Whichever drop sells more, dogs or cats, will determine a unique Secret Lair drop in 2026. If dogs sell more, the next drop is all dogs. If cats sell more, the next drop is all cats.</p>

<p>At time of writing, it seems that cats may have it. Both the cat and dog drops of the Chaos Vault Secret Lair were available in non-foil (MSRP $29.99) and foil (MSRP $39.99). But the cat foil drop has sold out. Unless new supply comes in or the dog lovers pick up the pace, one of 2026's Secret Lair drops may be full of claws, tuna treats, and hairballs.</p>

<p>This is the third Chaos Vault Secret Lair dropped by Wizards of the Coast. These spin-off drops are for more creative, or esoteric artwork that may not fit other Secret Lairs. The other two Chaos Vault drops included <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/latest-secret-lair-chaos-vault-previews-psychedelic-land-cards" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">psychedelic land cards</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-announces-their-first-chaos-vault-drop-for-magic-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">intricate art deco signage</a> This is in contrast with recent Secret Lairs containing crossovers with <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/spongebob-secret-lair-brings-iconic-cartoon-to-magic-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Spongebob Squarepants</a> and Hatsune Miku,</p>

As translated by Google, one anonymous employee commented, “There’s a team that monitors networks and acts quickly in the event of a targeted attack,” going on to say that Reddit threads, YouTube videos, and other mentions of the game are monitored for potential abuse. “Unlike what we’ve had before, this is serious.”</p><p>Ubisoft did not directly confirm or deny the reporting when asked about the situation. “Our stance has always been that team members’ social media channels are their own,” a spokesperson for the publisher told <em>Kotaku</em> in an email. “Our top priority is the safety of our employees, including online, which is why, as a standard practice across Ubisoft, we offer guidance on navigating social media, digital safety, and support for team members’ well-being. We also share resources to help prevent and protect against online harassment, something our teams have unfortunately faced.”<br></p><p>Ubisoft has taken varying approaches to the culture war noise around <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> over the last nine months as its impending release has become more and more of an apparent make-or-break moment for the company. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/E1e8T9q8rjZ4arsPNT1Xd/ceo-yves-guillemot-on-ubisofts-upcoming-portfolio-the-future-of-assassins-creed&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/E1e8T9q8rjZ4arsPNT1Xd/ceo-yves-guillemot-on-ubisofts-upcoming-portfolio-the-future-of-assassins-creed" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Last June</a></span>, CEO Yves Guillemot condemned attacks targeting his staff “in the strongest possible terms” and called on others in the industry to do so as well.

And now MK is returning to the big screen, as Warner Bros. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/first-look-at-johnny-cage-shao-khan-and-kitana-in-mortal-kombat-2-movie">gears up for the release of Mortal Kombat 2</a>, a sequel to 2021's surprisingly solid reboot.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In light of all these big developments in the MK world, we thought now would be the perfect time to look back at the franchise's long, colorful and occasionally baffling history in film and TV. Check out our slideshow below or scroll down for a closer look at all the Mortal Kombat adaptations and how closely (or not) they followed the source material.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Mortal Kombat's Bizarre History of Movie and TV Adaptations</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Mortal Kombat (1995)</h2><a href="https://oyster.ignimgs.com/wordpress/stg.ign.com/2020/04/01.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The original Mortal Kombat movie is widely regarded as one of the best video game adaptations to date. Which, granted, is a very dubious honor. Even so, the movie still stands as a solid example of how to bring the series to life in live-action. It presents a reasonably faithful retelling of the original game's extremely barebones storyline, while drawing in elements of Mortal Kombat II and some of the backstory from the tie-in comics. Like many adaptations, it positions Liu Kang (Robin Chou) as the central hero destined to defeat the soul-stealing Shang Tsung (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa). For purists, the movie's biggest sin is simply that it doesn't replicate the violence of the games, opting instead for a more pedestrian PG-13 approach.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What the movie does capture, however, is that essential undercurrent of camp and zaniness that goes hand-in-hand with the gratuitous violence. Mortal Kombat the movie definitely isn't guilty of taking itself too seriously. It's also the movie that introduced the world to The Immortals' "Techno Syndrome," the most iconic video game music this side of the Super Mario Bros. theme.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Mortal Kombat: The Journey Begins (1995)</h2><a href="https://oyster.ignimgs.com/wordpress/stg.ign.com/2020/04/02.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">There's some pretty stiff competition when it comes to deciding the worst Mortal Kombat adaptation ever made, but this direct-to-video release may just take the top honor. Released ahead of the live-action film and ostensibly a prequel to said film, The Journey Begins sets about fleshing out the origin stories of various MK icons. But the connective tissue is dubious at best. And as dated as the CGI in the live-action movie may be, it's state-of-the-art compared to the archaic, sub-Playstation quality 3D fight scenes in The Journey Begins. Hardcore fans may want to watch this one out of sheer, morbid curiosity (especially since it's included as a bonus feature on the Mortal Kombat Blu-ray), but don't expect it to actually enhance your enjoyment of the games or the movies.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm (1996)</h2><a href="https://oyster.ignimgs.com/wordpress/stg.ign.com/2020/04/03.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The '80s and '90s TV landscape was littered with attempts to translate adults-only pop culture properties into kid-friendly cartoons. Case in point - RoboCop: The Animated Series, Rambo: The Force of Freedom and Toxic Crusaders. We honestly have to respect Kenner's moxie for deciding to cut out the middleman and directly market Terminator 2 and Aliens toys to kids without even waiting for cartoons.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm, USA Network threw its razor-edged hat into the ring. This short-lived series aired on the network's Action Extreme Team block in 1996. Somewhat bafflingly, it attempts to serve as a continuation of both the 1995 movie and the Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 video game, though the all-ages approach basically renders that moot. Defenders of the Realm simplifies the complex series of alliances and rivalries that define the MK mythos, instead featuring a team of heroes led by Raiden and Nighthawk tasked with defending Earthrealm from Shao Kahn's interdimensional invaders.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Defenders of the Realm does make one notable addition to the franchise, however. The series was actually the first to introduce Quan Chi before his roles in Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero and Mortal Kombat 4.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Mortal Kombat: Annihilation (1997)</h2><a href="https://oyster.ignimgs.com/wordpress/stg.ign.com/2020/04/04.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">If the first Mortal Kombat movie is among the best attempts at adapting a video game to film, its sequel is easily among the worst. It's not necessarily that Annihilation plays fast and loose with the source material. It introduces a number of popular characters like Shao Kahn (Brian Thompson), Jax (Lynn Williams) and Sindel (Musetta Vandel), along with familiar MK elements like Animalities, the death of Johnny Cage and Kuai Liang taking up his brother's mantle as Sub-Zero. The problem is that the movie fails to string any of that together into a coherent and interesting story. There's not much internal logic to what happens or which characters appear.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But even if the plot lived up to the first movie, Annihilation is plagued with lousy effects, underwhelming fight scenes, and actors who would seemingly rather be anywhere else. It's telling that, apart from Chou's Liu Kang, nearly all the returning characters were recast for the sequel. But if nothing else, at least the soundtrack is pretty good.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Mortal Kombat: Conquest (1998)</h2><a href="https://oyster.ignimgs.com/wordpress/stg.ign.com/2020/04/05.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">While Annihilation basically destroyed Mortal Kombat's big-screen prospects for the next two decades, that didn't stop TNT from airing a live-action TV series in 1998. Mortal Kombat: Conquest serves as a prequel to the movies, taking place 500 years before the era of Liu Kang. Instead, Conquest revolves around Liu's ancestor Kung Lao (Paolo Montalbán), a warrior monk tasked with training a new generation of fighters to defend Earthrealm. While many of the series' supporting characters are new creations, many MK fan-favorites show up over the course of Conquest's one and only season.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The best that can be said for Conquest is that it was ahead of its time. The prequel premise is strong, and it's certainly a better offshoot of the 1995 film than Annihilation. But even at the time, it was difficult to ignore the lousy wire-fu fight scenes and generally bad special effects. It's hard not to wonder what might have been if Conquest had come along a decade or two later.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Mortal Kombat: Rebirth (2010)</h2><a href="https://oyster.ignimgs.com/wordpress/stg.ign.com/2020/04/06.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Outside of the games themselves, the MK franchise largely went dormant in the '00s. It wasn't until filmmaker Kevin Tancharoen took the initiative and put together a short, unauthorized Mortal Kombat movie that the ball started rolling again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Though produced on a very low budget and not sanctioned by Warner Bros. or Mortal Kombat's creators, Tancharoen's short film Mortal Kombat: Rebirth is a surprisingly professional adaptation. Rebirth is unique in that it downplays the franchise's supernatural trappings, instead casting Scorpion (Ian Anthony Dale) as an assassin working with Captain Jackson Briggs (Michael Jai White) and Sonya Blade (Jeri Ryan) to bring down Shang Tsung's criminal empire and get revenge on his nemesis, Sub-Zero.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tancharoen intended for Rebirth to serve as a proof-of-concept for a possible movie reboot. He sort of got his wish as he was given the reins of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/01/24/new-mortal-kombat-series-officially-announced">the live-action web series Mortal Kombat: Legacy</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Mortal Kombat: Legacy (2011)</h2><a href="https://oyster.ignimgs.com/wordpress/stg.ign.com/2020/04/07.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Tancharoen returned to the MK franchise the following year, this time with the actual approval of Warner Bros. and a greenlight for a full season of live-action webisodes exclusive to Machinima. Legacy doesn't follow the new continuity established in Rebirth, though Dale, White and Ryan all returned to reprise their roles for Season 1. Instead, Legacy acts as a prequel to the original game, with each Season 1 episode fleshing out the backstory for a different Kombatant.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/09/28/mortal-kombat-legacy-season-2-review">Season 2 proved to be a fairly steep departure</a>, with Legacy shifting to a more narrative-driven approach while bringing in a number of new characters and recasting many existing roles. One bonus of that revamp is that Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa was able to reprise the role of Shang Tsung (paving the way for him to make the jump over to the games<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/06/19/mortal-kombat-11-shang-tsung-dlc-review"> in the form of Mortal Kombat 11 DLC</a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As inconsistent as it is in terms of tone and plot, Legacy shows the potential in a more earnest take on the MK mythology. It also looks surprisingly robust for a free-to-watch web series.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Mortal Kombat Legends: Scorpion's Revenge (2020)</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Mortal Kombat returned to the animated realm in 2020, in what proved to be a vastly better adaptation than either The Journey Begins or Defenders of the Realm. It helps that Mortal Kombat Legends: Scorpion's Revenge is aimed squarely at adults. In fact, this direct-to-video release is actually the first R-rated Mortal Kombat movie.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Scorpion's Revenge is an adaptation of the original game's storyline, but with a twist. Rather than framing the movie around the heroic Liu Kang, we'll see the fateful tournament from Scorpion's point of view. The movie explores the character's tragic origin story and the beginnings of his feud with Sub-Zero.

The new movie isn't connected to previous projects, but instead serves as a complete reboot. Star Mehcad Brooks (who plays Jax) <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-movie-aiming-for-grounded-realism-alongside-crazy-fatalities">describes it as having "grounded realism"</a> despite retaining the Fatalities and other violent trappings of the games. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/08/22/mortal-kombat-movie-cast-characters-2021-reboot">Here's a full breakdown of the Mortal Kombat reboot's cast.</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The reboot <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-to-watch-mortal-kombat-2021">hit theaters and HBO Max simultaneously</a> in April 2021.

In addition to returning favorites like Hiroyuki Sanada as Scorpion, Ludi Lin as Liu Kang, Mehcad Brooks as Jax, and Jessica McNamee as Sonya Blade, the film will also introduce Karl Urban’s Johnny Cage, Martyn Ford’s Shao Kahn, Damoin Herriman's Quan Chi, and Adeline Rudolph’s Kitana. We recently got <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/first-look-at-johnny-cage-shao-khan-and-kitana-in-mortal-kombat-2-movie">a closer look at several of the cast members</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At this point, there seems little doubt that Mortal Kombat 2 will be a better sequel than Mortal Kombat: Annihilation was, but that's not exactly a high bar to cross. The question is whether the sequel can continue the momentum generated by the original and pave the way for even more of the proposed sequels. There's plenty of fight left in this franchise yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Note: this article was originally published on 04/09/2020 and updated on 03/17/2025 with the latest news about the Mortal Kombat franchise.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jesse is a mild-mannered staff writer for IGN.

On March 1 at WWE’s Elimination Chamber, Cena rocked the wrestling world, and likely gave a generation of pre-teens a glimpse of the disappointment they can expect in adulthood, by selling his soul to The Rock and brutally turning on Cody Rhodes with the grimmest look he’s ever sported in his entire career. Yes, John Cena is a heel. Today, he made his first public appearance as a bad guy on WWE Raw to the shock, awe, and disgust of the entire wrestling world. Including one small child nearly brought to tears.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Since the heel turn that will live in infamy, the derided superstar has been leaving a trail of messages on X (formerly known as Twitter) leading us to the eventual unveiling of his new, evil persona. He’s educated supporters and haters alike on the discipline it takes to make uncomfortable choices for the greater good, reduced any criticism of him to a reflection of the critics’ failings, and essentially told us that, in due time, history will vindicate his decisions. Less than 12 hours before his first televised appearance since Elimination Chamber, Cena took to X to send one last cryptic message before the Evil Cena era begins:</p><figure id="" data-id="63809bde3d4c6869e1f7d0dd06d2cf68" data-recommend-id="image://63809bde3d4c6869e1f7d0dd06d2cf68" data-format="png" data-width="1007" data-height="395" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="John Cena's final tweet before public appearance" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="John Cena's final tweet before public appearance" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->X</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="63809bde3d4c6869e1f7d0dd06d2cf68" data-recommend-id="image://63809bde3d4c6869e1f7d0dd06d2cf68" data-format="png" data-width="1007" data-height="395" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="John Cena's final tweet before public appearance" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>At Raw, live from Belgium, Cena’s theme music was the same, but it was accompanied by a chorus of fans yelling “John Cena sucks” to the tune of “the time is now,” before the arena was flooded with a wave of boos.

He’s a human being.

<p>Within the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/more-esports-organizations-are-flocking-towards-marvel-rivals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fledgling pro Marvel Rivals scene</a>, almost all of the pro players play on mouse and keyboard, but one of the best Vanguard players is dominating with a controller in their hands. This rising superstar on the sticks is already playing, and winning matches for a massive esports organization, and showing all the controller players out there that a pro dream is possible for them.</p>



<h2 id="h-meet-ttk-the-marvel-rivals-vanguard-star-playing-on-controller">Meet TTK, the Marvel Rivals Vanguard Star Playing on Controller</h2>



<p>On March 13th, 2025, the 100 Thieves organization officially entered Marvel Rivals, signing a stack of insanely talented newcomers that had been playing under the name Mutants. At the Vanguard position, this 100T roster features Eric “TTK” Arraiga, and the “TopTierKid” is a menace on Magneto and Doctor Strange. And if it wasn’t obvious already, he’s dominating on controller.</p>



<p>In early February, prior to signing with 100T, TTK <a href="https://x.com/TTKIsAvailable/status/1887285537637101796" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a> to be the first player to reach the number one player rank on two platforms at the same time. He backed this claim up withs screenshots showing himself at the number on spot on both PC and Xbox, with 313 combined competitive wins between the two platforms. According to fellow 100T teammate Vincent “Vinnie” Scarantine, it was one of the best controller-wielding pro players of all-time, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/formal-coming-back-to-cod-scump/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OpTic legend Matthew “FormaL” Piper</a>, that put in a good word at 100T about the roster. TTK’s play also drew attention from content creator star TimTheTatman, who spectated him on stream and covered him in a video that garnered more than 528K views.</p>

<iframe title="SPECTATING THE NEW #1 PLAYER IN MARVEL RIVALS" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pE7hO_RRJ28?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Fast forward to the 100T roster’s first week of pro play, and the team is already making a case to be considered the best in North America. They are 5-0 and have only dropped two maps, and they’re the number one seed in the playoffs of the NA Marvel Rivals Invitational. During their wins against the likes of Sentinels and FlyQuest, TTK is out-damaging the opposing tanks, and even some of the Duelists on the scoreboard with Magneto and Doctor Strange.</p>



<p>As Marvel Rivals’ pro scene continues to grow, could more controller players reach the upper echelon? Let us know in the comments or on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <p>
Call of Duty veteran Jason Blundell has confirmed previous reports he's heading up a new PlayStation first-party studio, revealing it to be named Dark Outlaw Games.
</p>
<p>
Blundell <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-zombies-overlord-jason-blundell-exits-treyarch">departed Call of Duty developer Treyarch</a> - where he'd served as studio co-head, as well as game director on Call of Duty's Zombies mode - in 2020, and was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ex-call-of-duty-black-ops-devs-are-making-a-brand-new-ip-for-playstation">announced to have co-founded a new studio,</a> the Sony-back Deviation Games, the following year.
</p>
<p>
However, Deviation reportedly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/deviation-games-reportedly-lays-off-dozens-following-a-difficult-situation">ran into a "difficult situation"</a> in 2023, resulting in almost 90 layoffs, and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-studio-deviation-games-has-closed-down">studio eventually shut its doors</a> last March. But just a few months later, it was reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-deviation-games-devs-form-new-sony-studio">Blundell was forming a new PlayStation first-party studio</a> from the ashes of Deviation, with "a lot of" former Deviation employees joining him to work on an undisclosed new IP.
</p>
<p>
There's been little additional word since then, but now Blundell has confirmed the reports in an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LY37_Cenui4">interview with journalist Jeff Gerstmann</a>, announcing his new team's name in the process. "I've had the amazing opportunity to create a new studio within PlayStation Studios for Sony," he revealed. "The studio is called Dark Outlaw [Games and we've] been working away in the shadows for a while, and when we've got something to talk about, we'll step out into the light."
</p>
<p>
"But you know the story for me is about the game, not about the studio," he continued, "so the reason why we're not doing a fanfare or shout about it from the rooftops is like, let's get something, right?". Dark Outlaw is still "staffing up", according to Blundell, but the nature of its first project remains under wraps. "Not gonna really comment about what we're doing exactly," he told Gerstmann, "but [it's currently about] getting the team to gel, getting the ideas clicking right... let's test those assumptions, and you know, is it working?"
</p>
<p>
Confirmation of Dark Outlaw Games' existence and its mysterious new project comes amid a major shake-up at PlayStation Studios as Sony continues to shift away from the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plans-to-launch-more-than-10-live-service-games-before-march-2026">live-service strategy announced by former PlayStation boss Jim Ryan</a> in 2022. Since 2023, Sony has pulled the plug on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-online-officially-cancelled-by-naughty-dog">Naughty Dog's multiplayer The Last of Us game</a>, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-studio-firesprite-has-been-shedding-talent-amidst-accusations-of-toxic-culture-staff-say">Twisted Metal project at the Firesprite</a>, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/footage-of-insomniacs-seemingly-canceled-live-service-spider-man-the-great-web-appears-online">live-service Spider-Man game</a> from Insomniac, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">sci-fi shooter Concord following its lacklustre launch</a>. Additionally, this January brought reports Sony had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-including-one-based-on-god-of-war-report">also cancelled a God of War live-service game and a project by Days Gone developer Bend Studio</a>.
