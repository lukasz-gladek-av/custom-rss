            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It was recently confirmed that Amazon’s New World: Aeternum will be shut down next year, going offline forever and locking players out of the game they might have loved for a good while. The MMORPG was released in September 2021, soaring to epic player counts, but it quickly dwindled and the ever-marching progress of time saw the game fall out of favor <strong>fast</strong>.</p>



<p>Following the announcement that New World: Aeternum will be taken offline in 2027, an unlikely figure stood up and offered $25 million to keep the game alive, because ‘games should never die.’</p>



<h2 id="h-will-facepunch-keep-new-world-aeternum-alive">Will Facepunch Keep New World: Aeternum Alive?</h2>



<p>On <a href="https://x.com/Alistair_McF/status/2011894052128768316" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, Alistair McFarlane, the director of Rust and COO at Facepunch Studios, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>25m, final offer Amazon Games</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Followed by a statement:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Games should never die.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The original post was made in response to a Facepunch employee joking that they’d asked ‘Ali’ to buy New World for them, but he told them to f*** off. This line is enough to make users doubt the validity of McFarlane’s messages, but who knows? We’ve seen stranger things.</p>



<p>As the comments unfolded, McFarlane explained when asked what Amazon should do for the players:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>As with everything we do at Facepunch, empower the community. Give them control, make servers publicly hostable. A game will live forever in the hands of a dedicated community.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In October 2025, Amazon <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-world-development-cancelled-amazon-layoffs/">issued layoffs and ended</a> any more development on New World: Aeternum, and on January 15, it was revealed that the game would be taken <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-world-aeternum-to-be-taken-offline-next-year/">offline forever</a> in 2027.</p>



<p>This has been a major point of contention in the gaming space for the longest time. It surfaced most recently (and prolifically) with Ubisoft’s The Crew being pulled offline, a situation that spawned <strong>a court case</strong>, raised by disgruntled fans.</p>



<p>For the last few years, the concept of online-only games ending development has been a major debate, with many claiming that games should <strong>never, ever </strong>go offline.</p>



<p>It seems highly unlikely that Facepunch Studios will acquire New World: Aeternum, but what do you think? Do you think it’s up to <strong>other studios </strong>to keep games alive when they’re shut down by their creators?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Apex Legends Global Series is gearing up for another ambitious season, now that the ALGS Championship 2026 has wrapped. Electronic Arts has unveiled the full ALGS Year 6 roadmap, outlining a <strong>packed </strong>competitive calendar bursting with international events and structural changes.</p>



<p>At the heart of the announcement sits a renewed commitment to that perspective of global competition. This year, the three-event international LAN circuit returns, giving teams around the world more chances to make their name heard.</p>







<h2 id="h-algs-year-6-roadmap-is-bigger-than-ever">ALGS Year 6 Roadmap is Bigger Than Ever</h2>



<p>The season kicks off early with the Online Open, with qualifiers set to run from February 28 to March 23. Following that, the first Pro League Split will take place in April, running until June. The Challenger Circuit Split arrives in April and runs through to early June, spread across <strong>four </strong>circuits.</p>



<p>The first major LAN date to mark in your book is the Split 1 Playoffs at the 2026 Esports World Cup in Riyadh from July 7 to 11. </p>



<p>In the latter half of 2026, we’ll get the second round start, with the Pro League Qualifier taking place in late July, followed by the Pro League Split 2 in August to October. The second Challenger Circuit Split arrives in August and runs to October, and then the <strong>big events start unfolding</strong>.</p>



<p>Las Vegas plays host to the Split 2 Playoffs from October 29 to November 1, and the LCQ from November 20 to 22.</p>



<p>The ALGS Year 6 season comes to a close in Sapporo, Japan, from January 28 to 31, 2027. That’s when the Apex Legends Global Series Championship 2027 will take place, putting a cap on a bold season.</p>



<p>Electronic Arts has established a massive <strong>$7 million global prize pool </strong>for Year 6 of Apex Legends’ esports ecosystem, including $2 million reserved for each international event.</p>



<p>It was revealed that competitive integrity is becoming an increasing focus of the team this season. Legend bans will now be extended into the Challenger Circuit realm, ensuring the utmost consistency across all tiers of competition. Teams will face stricter roster rules, tighter transfer windows, and more control around Championship Points.</p>

<p>Former Sega producer reveals "funny" Mario &amp; Sonic demand</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="8b2e4b1167916"><a title="Mario and Sonic" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8b2e4b1167916/mario-and-sonic.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: SEGA, Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Developers who have worked with Nintendo's intellectual properties have often shared stories about odd requests and demands from the video game giant. With this in mind, the latest story to surface comes from former Sega of Japan producer, Ryoichi Hasegawa.</p>
<p>During a chat with <a href="https://www.arcadeattack.co.uk/sega-of-japan-ryoichi-hasegawa-interview/">Arcade Attack Retro Gaming Network</a> recently, <a href="https://segaretro.org/Ryoichi_Hasegawa">the Sega legend</a> (who was at the company between 1992-98 and 2007-12) retold a "funny story" about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_and_sonic_at_the_olympic_games_tokyo_2020">Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games</a> and a certain demand Nintendo apparently made at the time. Here it is in full:</p><div><figure data-videoid="rD2-TWrSjpI" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rD2-TWrSjpI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytrD2-TWrSjpI" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rD2-TWrSjpI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rD2-TWrSjpI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed31c928nlhrpo&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Ryoichi Hasegawa:</strong> There was one funny story...There was artwork of Mario and Sonic, and you know, other characters standing on the field. And those artworks were used for the package, the instruction manual cover, and the cartridge label, and things like that...There was one small error and Sonic's foot was in front of Mario's foot, and Nintendo demanded us to change the priority".</p>
<p><strong>Arcade Attack:</strong> So, what? Mario had to be slightly ahead? Oh, for goodness sake.</p>
<p><strong>Hasegawa</strong>: (nods) Yes...I still remember that.</p>
<p><strong>Aracde Attack:</strong> And you did change it, I take it?</p>
<p><strong>Hasegawa:</strong> Of course, of course, we were like 'oh my god' we have to change it, or there will be no deal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, it's not the first time we've heard stories like this from third-party developers about Nintendo, and Nintendo is well-known for being extremely protective of its IP. As for the Sonic &amp; Mario at the Olympic Games series, based on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/07/rumour-mario-and-sonic-at-the-olympic-games-finished">some rumours a few years ago</a>, it might not be returning.</p>

<p>Kouji Okada, co-founder of Atlas, is signed on to a game project for the first time in 18 years.</p>



<p>Kouji Okada has 40 years of experience in the video game industry. He’s best known for co-founding Atlus and his work on the Shin Megami Tensei and Persona titles. Now, he is slated to return to produce a new “school life RPG” being developed by Compile Heart.</p>







<p>Compile Heart announced on Thursday, January 15, that they were working on the new game and promised to deliver more information two weeks later, on January 29.</p>



<figure></figure>







<h2 id="h-other-jrpg-veterans-are-working-on-the-game-alongside-kouji-okada">Other JRPG Veterans Are Working on the Game Alongside Kouji Okada</h2>



<p>Not only is Okada signed on to produce the game, but Tadashi Satomi, one of the original writers in the Persona series, is linked to the project as well. Additionally, Tsukasa Masuko, one of the composers for the early Shin Megami Tensei titles, is on board.</p>



<p>A teaser trailer was uploaded to YouTube in Japanese. There were old-school anime sci-fi visuals, imagery of DNA, and a close-up of a character’s eye, before a visual of junk characters sitting at tables, making panicked motions, as shrieking sounds of despair briefly played in the background.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>After leaving Atlus, Kouji Okada worked on a handful of games with Gaia studio, including Folklore on the Sony PlayStation 3. The Persona franchise remains the cornerstone of Atlus.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Kurt Kuhlmann spent two decades working at Bethesda on several games in the Elder Scrolls and Fallout franchises, as well as Starfield. Now, he’s opening up about his vision for the 6th Elder Scrolls game and the potential role the delay in that game’s development played in his leaving the studio.</p>



<p>Kurt Kuhlmann is known as an Elder Scrolls loremaster specifically because of his longevity at the studio and the many games he’s working on. He hoped to be given the lead design role on Elder Scrolls 6. </p>







<p>However, the studio chose someone else, and that person has yet to be publicly named. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-elder-scrolls/bethesdas-former-elder-scrolls-loremaster-on-why-he-left-starfields-communication-breakdowns-and-how-he-wanted-the-elder-scrolls-6-to-be-the-empire-strikes-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Speaking with PC Gamer, </a>Kuhlmann claimed that Todd Howard promised him the lead design role in the forthcoming game, but the project kept being pushed off to focus on other releases and ultimately never came to fruition.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“After Fallout 4, we didn’t go to TES6, we made Fallout 76, and then even then, we didn’t make TES6, we made Starfield, which became this extremely long project compared to other ones. So from my point of view, I’ve been waiting like 11 years to be the lead on TES6,” he says. “Bruce [Nesmith] and I had been the co-leads on Skyrim. I think most people would call it a successful project, so I thought that it wasn’t unreasonable for me to think that I could be a successful lead on TES6. It wasn’t just my expectation—I had been told that that was going to happen.</p>
</blockquote>











<p>Speaking a little on his vision for the game’s storyline and direction, Kuhlmann notes that he drew inspiration from the second Star Wars film, The Empire Strikes Back.</p>



<p>He’d wanted The Thalmor to be the villains that would end up conquering the day by the end of the campaign, paving the way for the next entrant in the series. To him, this was a welcome diversion from the typical storytelling Bethesda relies on.</p>



<p>Bethesda is currently working on Fallout 5, and the team hopes you play the game for many hours, potentially 600. Still, there is no release window for that game at this time. Todd Howard recently said that most employees are engaged with work on Elder Scrolls 6, while also claiming that Fallout is the game they’re working on the most.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>GOG’s Managing Director, Maciej Gołębiewski, has opened up about the current state of the gaming industry and the rise of always-online games, noting that it’s essential to discuss preservation and what a proper end-of-life cycle looks like in the current industry.</p>



<p>As more multiplayer games adopt always-online models, players are increasingly facing the reality that servers do not remain online forever. When games fail to meet developer expectations, some are shut down abruptly, even while they still have active communities. EA <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/anthem-servers-to-be-shut-down-in-january/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recently took Anthem’s servers offline</a> seven years after launch, and the company stated in its FAQ that because the game was designed to require an online connection, it is no longer playable.</p>



<h2 id="h-gog-s-managing-director-expresses-concern">GOG’s Managing Director Expresses Concern</h2>



<p>Digital storefront GOG is very dedicated to game preservation and launched a program in 2024 to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gog-launches-game-preservation-program/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">preserve classic titles.</a> Now, GOG’s Maciej Gołębiewski is weighing in on what preservation looks like in the modern age of always-online games, telling <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-weighs-complicated-riddle-of-multiplayer-game-preservation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer </a>that he’s afraid there may be fewer games for gamers to play in the future because of the expectation of maintaining servers for decades.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“If we put too many barriers on game creators and what the end-of-life cycle looks like, we might get fewer games,” he said, “because people will be scared of ‘okay now I need to put up the funds to create it, promote it, and then upkeep it for 10 years, 20 years, because the regulator said so’. That might in turn cause there to be fewer cool games for gamers. I don’t have the perfect answer yet, but it’s good that the discussion is taking place.”</p>
</blockquote>







<p>In one example of an attempt to address this problem, The Crew 2 recently received an update that introduced a hybrid mode and enabled offline play, hopefully ensuring long-term access to the game. Learn more about that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-crew-2-gets-offline-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/review/steelseries-arctis-nova-7x-gen-2-review-a-smart-refresh/</link>

						<h5>SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7X Gen 2 for Xbox</h5><p><span>October 2025</span>
					</p></div></div>			
			<p><strong>SteelSeries</strong> has a habit of releasing headsets that don’t try to reinvent the wheel every generation, but instead quietly tighten the bolts. The original <strong>Nova 7</strong> was already one of the safer picks in the mid‑range segment. With the <strong>Arctis Nova 7X Gen 2</strong>, SteelSeries aims to refine rather than overhaul: longer battery life, proper simultaneous dual‑wireless support, and a bit more polish in both software and daily use.</p>



<p>The Nova 7X Gen 2 <strong>sits in that sweet spot between price, versatility, and comfort</strong>. And while it’s not a dramatic generational leap, <strong>the changes it brings are meaningful in ways you feel every day you use it</strong>.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PXL_20260108_114701316-1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-design-amp-features">Design &amp; Features</h2>



<p>At first glance, the Nova 7X Gen 2 looks virtually identical to its predecessor. SteelSeries keeps the familiar matte-black design, the metal headband, and the elastic ski‑goggle strap that provides its signature comfort. The earcups use the same breathable AirWeave material that avoids heat buildup, and the entire package feels lightweight but not fragile.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2035/08/PXL_20260108_114718620-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The Arctis Nova 7X Gen 2 with USB-C dongle</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>What <em>is</em> new is the improved dual‑wireless implementation. <strong>The headset can now run 2.4 GHz audio and Bluetooth simultaneously</strong>, not just on a “switch between them” basis. This is great for anyone who runs Discord mobile, takes calls during matches, or likes streaming music while gaming without muting the game audio. SteelSeries also expands its software ecosystem with better Sonar EQ controls and a companion mobile app, making on‑the‑fly adjustments far less of a chore.</p>



<p>One thing that caught me off guard: the button layout. After years of using other headsets (including SteelSeries’ own models), it took genuine muscle‑memory rewiring to accept that the power button sits on the right earcup and the volume wheel on the left. It’s not wrong, just <em>different</em> — and the first few days, I found myself reaching for the wrong side more often than I’d like to admit.</p>



<p>A more objective downside is the wide USB‑C dongle, which can block neighboring ports depending on your setup. It’s a known complaint across multiple reviews, and one I ran into as well.</p>



<h2 id="h-comfort">Comfort</h2>



<p>Comfort remains one of SteelSeries’ strongest pillars, and the Nova 7X Gen 2 stays firmly in that tradition. The headband suspension system evenly distributes pressure across the top of your head, and despite the metal frame, <strong>the headset never feels heavy or fatiguing</strong>. The breathable AirWeave cushions avoid heat buildup, and the clamping force sits in that ideal middle ground — secure, but never tight.</p>

<p>As I’ve mentioned <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/steelseries-arctis-nova-5x-wireless-first-class/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in previous reviews</a>, <strong>the SteelSeries headsets are among the few headsets that don’t give me strain on my head after prolonged use</strong>. Even after long sessions across several evenings, the Nova 7X Gen 2 <strong>remained as comfortable as when I first put it on</strong>, which is more than I can say for most mid‑range wireless headsets.</p>



<h2 id="h-sound-amp-microphone">Sound &amp; Microphone</h2>



<p>The Nova 7X Gen 2 sticks to SteelSeries’ typical tuning: clean mids, clear positional cues, and a balanced low end that avoids the muddy, over‑boosted bass found in some competitors. Out of the box, the treble can lean a bit sharp at times, but this is easily smoothed out using Sonar EQ profiles. For competitive gaming, <strong>the directional audio is trustworthy and consistent</strong>. You don’t get the hyper‑detailed imaging of SteelSeries’ own Nova Pro line, but at this price, the performance is excellent.</p>



<p>The retractable boom mic works well for party chat and everyday use, but it isn’t a standout feature. Voices sound slightly thin and lack warmth, matching what many reviewers have noted. It gets the job done and remains reliable, but <strong>don’t expect broadcast clarity or deep vocal richness</strong>. There’s no active noise cancellation on the headset, so microphone performance relies heavily on SteelSeries’ software filters.</p>



<h2 id="h-battery-life">Battery Life</h2>



<p>Battery improvements are one of the most tangible Gen 2 upgrades. <strong>SteelSeries rates the Nova 7X Gen 2 for 50+ hours, and real‑world use backs this up</strong>. Even with Bluetooth and 2.4 GHz running at the same time, I went several days without charging. Fast charging via USB‑C is another welcome convenience: about <strong>15 minutes on the cable nets you several hours of gameplay</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-compatibility">Compatibility</h2>



<p>SteelSeries’ model segmentation can still be confusing, but here’s the part that really matters: the Xbox version is the one you want if you own multiple platforms. Just like previous SteelSeries headsets, the Nova 7X Gen 2 works on both Xbox and PlayStation, while the PlayStation version does not work on Xbox. That means anyone gaming across both ecosystems should choose the Xbox model to avoid limitations.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PXL_20260108_114752522-1.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The wireless USB-C transmitter with USB and Xbox modes</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Beyond consoles, the 7X Gen 2 <strong>works flawlessly on PC, Switch (via dongle), and mobile via Bluetooth</strong>. Switching between devices is quick, and simultaneous Bluetooth + 2.4 GHz support makes it easy to mix audio sources without juggling buttons or transmitters.</p>

						<section>
				<p>The SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7X Gen 2 isn’t a revolutionary step forward, but it delivers exactly the upgrades that improve daily use: stronger battery life, true dual‑wireless, robust software support, and the same exceptional comfort the series is known for. The mic and dongle quirks keep it from being flawless, but as a well-rounded mid‑range wireless headset — especially for Xbox players, and especially if you also own a PlayStation — it’s hard to beat.</p>

            <p>Earlier this week, Capcom pulled back the (rotting) curtain on the latest instalment of its storied horror series, Resident Evil. And while we learned a bit more about Resident Evil Requiem's story and how it plays out, some fans were surprised that we didn't get a collector's edition (CE) reveal.</p>
<p>Like many publishers, Capcom usually goes all-in on pricey, limited-edition collector's editions, but in this case, almost all of the additional goodies for Requiem's deluxe version are digital, leaving some fans <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/residentevil/comments/1qdz2bw/finally_an_end_to_the_overpriced_collector/">wondering if we've seen the end of "overpriced" physical collector editions</a>.</p>

<p>With little more than a month to go to release, it seems unlikely Capcom's holding off on the announcement, particularly as the official figurines we usually see in CEs have popped up for sale, separately, elsewhere, breaking a decade-old tradition. And rather than a CE, Capcom revealed two one-sixth-scale figurines of <a href="https://www.hlj.com/1-6-scale-capcom-figure-builder-creators-model-resident-evil-requiem-leon-s-kennedy-cap13730">Leon</a> and <a href="https://www.hlj.com/1-6-scale-capcom-figure-builder-creators-model-resident-evil-requiem-grace-ashcroft-cap13731">Grace</a>, retailing for around £150 each.</p>
<p>In case you're wondering, Requiem's physical Deluxe Edition comes with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Premium Stellbook (including the game)</li>
<li>A limited edition lenticular card</li>
<li>Digital code for 5 costumes</li>
<li>Digital code for 4 weapon skins</li>
<li>Digital code for 2 Charms</li>
<li>Digital code for filters</li>
<li>Digital code for bonus Audio Pack</li>
<li>Digital code for Files.</li>
</ul>
<p>A Digital Deluxe Edition is also available, albeit without the card and steelbook case. There's also a Requiem-styled <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> controller available, and - also for Switch - the Resident Evil Generation Pack, which bundles together Resident Evil 7 and its DLC, Village and DLC, and Requiem. There's also amiibo coming in the summer, and all pre-orders get the bonus Grace costume, Apocalypse.</p><p>Leaker Dusk Golem, who has previously leaked correct (and some not-so-correct) details about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-the-short-message">Silent Hill: The Short Message</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-village">Resident Evil Village</a> ahead of time, posits the issue could be connected to the costs of getting items into the US.</p>
<p>"I think as much as some people don't want to hear it, Donald Trump and his unpredictable wishy-washy tariffs are what has actively lead [sic] to Resident Evil Requiem not really having a Collector's Edition like they usually do," they <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/2011929965789659453">posted</a> after the showcase.</p>
<p>Resident Evil Requiem is due to be released across <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-7-re-engine-resi-switch-2">PC, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series X/S</a> on 27th February. Director, Koshi Nakanishi, who also helmed previous series entry <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-7-biohazard">Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</a>, said it will be "an experience with an emotional range unlike any other Resident Evil title to date".</p>
<p>Nakanishi was talking during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-requiem-an-experience-with-an-emotional-range-unlike-any-other-series-entry-to-date-and-um-janitor-zombies">this week's Resident Evil broadcast</a>, which gave us all another look at Requiem's gameplay, including how the sections between Grace and Leon differ. Grace's gameplay will have a much stronger slant on horror, while things will be more action-focused when we are in Leon's shoes.</p>
<p>Alex has been hands-on with Resident Evil Requiem already, admitting that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-played-resident-evil-9-and-they-heard-me-scream-in-the-booth-next-door">even the relatively small chunk he played made him scream so loudly that those in the booth next door heard him</a>.</p>

<p>The fixes include tweaks to the world and environment, NPCs, creatures, crafting, farming, audio and visual effects, UI, customisation, combat, balance, commands, and more.</p>

<figcaption>Here's an official look at Hytale's robust creative tools.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavNidH3wnc" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Notably, dinosaurs and other NPCs have been added to populate the underground jungles, albeit with "placeholder behaviours" while the team works on them. These new NPCs require a change to the environment in the biome, so you're advised to generate new unexplored areas if you'd like to drop by and say hello.</p>
<p>You can also expect "proper atmospheric effects and creature spawns" in the Devastated Lands sewers, volcanic environmental effects beneath volcanoes, and the invisible filler block between the bench in the Forgotten Temple has been removed.</p>
<p>All NPCs should have knockback resistance, and fire-themed NPCs should, quite rightly, be immune to fire damage (even if, for now, they'll still look like they're <em>catching</em> fire). Skeletons no longer drown, Kweebecs are now immune to cactus or brambles damage, and livestock should no longer climb atop the chicken coop. You'll also find that cautious wildlife predators like the Fox will no longer attack unless you attack them first.</p><p>You should now find it easier to locate the Backpack, as well as its upgrades, as the base backpack no longer requires a Tier 2 Workbench. Mercifully, it now takes fewer than 10 seconds to transform your hides into Leather now.</p>
<p>There's more – much more! – so head on over to the <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2026/1/hytale-patch-notes-update-1">official website</a> for the full rundown.</p>
<p>"This week's early access release feels like a splendid start; a flexible, well-featured - and already enjoyable - foundation with plenty of polish and attention to detail," Matt wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hytales-early-access-launch-isnt-quite-ready-to-step-out-of-minecrafts-shadow-but-im-still-having-a-blast">Eurogamer's Hytale preview</a>.</p>
<p>"And beyond what Hypixel is currently cooking up itself, the studio's offering substantial support for modding and other creative avenues as it looks to foster the sort of community that's served Minecraft so well. So yes, only a day in and Hytale shows lots of promise - and with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/long-awaited-minecraft-a-like-hytale-has-already-sold-enough-to-fund-the-next-two-years-of-development-and-its-not-even-out-yet">next two years of funding already secured</a>, the once seemingly doomed game could be looking at a very bright future."</p>

            <p>Valve has amended its guidance on AI disclosure and clarified that while developers using "AI-powered tools" for "efficiency gains" is not the focus of its policy, they must still disclose if generative AI is used in their games.</p>
<p>Now, as spotted by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/simoncarless_interestingly-pc-video-game-platform-steam-activity-7417944215675908096-OGNg/">GameDiscoverCo,</a> Valve has now amended its AI policy, making it clearer that studios that use "AI powered tools" such as code helpers may not have to disclose if there are no genAI assets like music, artwork, narrative design, or localisation in the content that "ships with [their] game".</p>
<p>"We are aware that many modern games development environments have AI powered tools built into them," the developer disclosure page now reads. "Efficiency gains through the use of these tools is not the focus of this section. Instead, it is concerned with the use of AI in creating content that ships with your game, and is consumed by players. This includes content such as artwork, sound narrative, localisation, etc."</p>
<p>Developers are then asked to indicate Yes or No to the question: "Does this game use generative artificial intelligence to generate content for the game, either pre-rendered or live-generated? This includes the game itself, the store page, and any Steam community assets or marketing materials."</p><p>Quite what qualifies as an "efficiency gain" and what doesn't remains to be seen, but ultimately, game makers publishing on Steam are still required to tell players if they use AI to generate any content, or its Steam-flavoured marketing materials.</p>
<p>"This feels like a really thoughtful middle ground that actually makes sense for developers," <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:ugcPost:7417944214812106752?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28ugcPost%3A7417944214812106752%2C7417947262959513600%29&amp;dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287417947262959513600%2Curn%3Ali%3AugcPost%3A7417944214812106752%29">said</a> one commenter. "The way they've separated efficiency tools from actual content generation shows they understand how teams actually work. It's refreshing to see a platform think through the nuances instead of just blanket policies, and putting players first in these decisions feels like the right call."</p>
<p>Towards the end of last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-boss-tim-sweeney-says-steam-ai-disclosures-make-no-sense">Epic Games' Tim Sweeney criticised Valve's requirement to disclose generative AI</a>, saying "Steam and all digital marketplaces need to drop the 'Made with AI' label. It doesn't matter any more."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-blasts-past-42-million-concurrent-users-as-its-sustained-growth-continues">Valve's platform recently crossed the 42 million barrier</a>, setting a new record.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[A cute frog game that remixes Nintendo’s best]]></title>
            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/860917/big-hops-review-pc-nintendo-switch-ps5</link>
            <guid>1409062</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>While playing <em>Big Hops</em>, a new 3D platformer starring an adorable frog, I kept feeling like I was breaking the game — and, like with <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em>, breaking it is kind of the point.</p><p>In <em>Big Hops</em>, you play as a frog named Hop. Early on, Hop is taken away from his home, and he works to get back by collecting airship parts from a few different areas, each with its own cute animal characters and storylines. Because he’s a frog, the primary way you interact with things is by slinging his tongue. You can use it to grab pots to toss and break them for coins, as a grappling hook to reach new areas, and to snag foods with special powers you can find littered throughout the game’s colorful, cartoony worlds.</p><p>With the combination of the tongue, Hop’s <em>Super Mario</em>-like jumps, dives, and wall runs, and a <em>Zelda</em>-like stamina meter for climbing walls, you can easily slingshot around the world and climb dizzying heights. But those special foods are what <em>really</em> let you get creative. A mushroom turns into a bounce pad to help you climb higher. A thrown apple becomes a grappling point on a wall. Tossing a cactus turns it into a tightrope you can use to cross chasms. (Technically, they’re not all foods — one is an oil ball, one is a bomb rock — but you get the idea.)</p><p>Best of all, you can store multiple foods at once in Hop’s backpack. By bringing the right foods to the right problem, you can come up with your own solutions to platforming sections, even surpassing the intended solutions. With one tricky wall-running challenge, I kept falling <em>just</em> short of the goal. But when I accidentally landed on a wall near the end, I deployed a flying fruit that I could grapple onto so I could get to the final platform. I can’t wait to see what tricks speedrunners come up with.</p><p>In addition to the main objectives, there are also little purple dots scattered everywhere that you can pick up. (There were almost always some tucked in hidden corners or atop some perilously high cliff.) Collect enough dots, and you can earn trinkets to put on your backpack that give you special perks, like pointing out where the dots are on your compass or reducing how much stamina you use while climbing. You can also find and identify bugs, which are cute and can also help you earn even more bonuses. There are flower petals you can slurp up to help customize Hop’s outfits. A blueprint that I picked up turned into a railgun that could shoot tightropes over huge gaps. And since there are no enemies wandering around, you really get to focus on exploring and platforming — though there are a handful of boss “fights” that I didn’t find too challenging.</p><p>It all creates a virtuous cycle that encourages your own solutions to basically everything in the game and rewards you for finding them. If you’re a fan of 3D Nintendo games — which was a <em>lot</em> of what I played growing up — you’ll find plenty to love with <em>Big Hops</em>. There are dedicated platforming rooms that reminded me of the secret areas in <em>Super Mario Sunshine</em>, one area is filled with gravity shifts like I remember from <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em>, and at one point I realized an intricate sewer area wouldn’t feel out of place as a <em>Zelda</em> dungeon.</p><p><em>Big Hops</em>’ influences are obvious, but the way that it builds on them is what makes the game special.</p><p><sup>Big Hops<em> is available now on Nintendo Switch, PS5, and PC.</em></sup></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/860917/big-hops-review-pc-nintendo-switch-ps5]]></content:encoded>
