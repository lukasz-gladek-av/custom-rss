            <p>Everyone, stretch your hamstrings. Leg-having simulator <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baby-steps">Baby Steps</a> got a release date during last night's PlayStation State of Play. As shown in the trailer below, the game is not so much a "walking sim" as a "walking badly sim". But hey, that's what you get from the makers of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/getting-over-it">Getting Over It</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ape-out">Ape Out</a>. It was also revealed that the "hero" of the game is in dire need of the bathroom.</p>

<p>It's due out September 8th, say the developers. Baby Steps was delayed last year, alongside enough other games to warrant a satirical <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/devolver-have-delayed-baby-steps-skate-story-stick-it-to-the-stickman-into-2025">"Best Delayed Games" awards show</a> from publishers Devolver. That's okay, it's still one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-50-most-anticipated-pc-games-of-2025">most anticipated games</a> of this year.</p>
<p>You play as Nate, an "unemployed failson" who is one day magically thrust into the wilderness and must learn to use his actual legs to actually walk on the actual ground. What! I could muse about this being a tale of overcoming learned helplessness, or a story about facing down crippling social anxiety, or a comic commentary on humanity's habit of cognitive offloading - giving all mental effort to machinery. But then, I'd be doing the work for you. Just play the game and analyse it yourself, for heaven's sake.</p>
<p>Getting Over It was a silly meditation on difficulty and perseverance disguised as a game that streamers would love because it allowed them to scream a lot. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE6Tr5QUeyI">Matt had a go</a>, and then <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHwgeFwH9To">I had a go</a>, and then I gave up because I had other things to do and I hate being bad at things. I did not get over it.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/05/ratatan-the-spiritual-successor-to-patapon-launches-its-first-public-demo-today/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Yes, I know there’s something going on today with Nintendo, and Switches, and Mario Kart, and a bunch of other things BUT let me direct you to the other most exciting news of the day which is that Ratatan, the spiritual successor to the beloved Patapon series, is launching <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3449820/Ratatan_Demo/">its first public demo</a> today, June 5th, at noon BST. Given that the series relies on timing, perhaps they should have picked another day? Still, if you’re not about to fill your house with the noises of blue shells going up plumbers’ bottoms, perhaps you’d like to fill it with the crazy sounds of creatures blowing trumpets to direct their pals to attack giant monsters. Doesn’t that sound good?</p>
<p><iframe title="Ratatan Official Gameplay Trailer!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/okG0R8r_G8Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>It’ll only sound good if you get the timing right, as Ratatan, like Patapon before it, is a rhythm action game, that has you pressing buttons in time to the music and beat to direct your diminutive army to attack, retreat, defend and run. It sounds simple, and in theory, it is, but as compelling gaming goes, few things have you reaching the same level of zen as Patapon does., If Ratatan can achieve that same trick, we’re in for a treat.</p>
<p>Ratatan pulls in some of that lovely modern roguelike progression, so you can assume that you’ll be levelling up, growing your team’s abilities and adding new troops and weaponry to your army while failing or dying a few times along the way. In fairness, that sounds a lot like the progression from the original Patapon games, but I don’t think I ever thought of them as roguelikes…</p>
<p>The side-scrolling 2D action can be enjoyed by up to four players in co-op, which sounds chaotic. I have little idea how that’s going to work, but the listing for the game says that there can be up to 100 characters on screen, so maybe, you’re just all there?</p>

<p>There’s not long to wait, as you can get ready to download the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3449820/Ratatan_Demo/">demo on Steam</a> now, with a later link coming for Nintendo Switch (and presumably Nintendo Switch 2 as well).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-remastered-your-own-personal-rideable-rowboat-mod-sailing-around-cyrodiil-as-magical-mariner<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Horses are overrated. Yeah, I said it. No offence to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/could-the-witcher-4s-kelpie-be-the-best-video-game-horse-yet-we-asked-an-expert">any horse experts</a> out there. They’re a bit of an unnecessary purchase in Elder Scrolls games in my experience. </p>
<p>But how else am I supposed to travel? Ah, of course, by boat. I looked at Nexus Mods this morning and spotted that a modder has saved my poor feet by managing to get fully-functional rowboats working in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">Oblivion Remastered</a>, so I can sail around Cyrodiil as a magical mariner.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/4273?tab=description">Row Your Boat</a> does what it says on the tin, provided you count it as 'rowing' if you're doing it via a spell rather than actual manual labour. Drawing inspiration from some <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/3575">classic</a> <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/6690">Oblivion</a> mods, Tyler ‘Dactyl’ Hallada’s created a means to buy a usable rowboat that you can summon and use to sail the waterways of the Imperial province, merrily waving to all the poor landlubbers you pass and praying that you don’t spring a leak.</p>
<p>As you can see demoed in the showcase video below, the boat’s controlled by casting a special row spell while standing up or crouched to move forwards and backwards, with the direction you’re looking acting as the steering. One you’re up to speed, you can also basically set it in cruise control so it’ll keep carving along while your character’s free to take in the scenery and rest their arms.</p>

<p>Hallada’s implemented stuff like “dynamic collision detection” and “realistic wave simulation” to make things feel more authentically boaty, and added a handy in-game manual in case you get stuck. You can also purchase upgrades for the boat, in the form of a storage chest, working lamp, and a rope ladder to make boarding easier.</p>
<p>It’s worth bearing in mind that the mod’s pretty hardware-intensive right now, with its creator writing: “You may experience some performance impact, especially with a weak CPU. This mod is pushing the limits of the script engine. I’ve spent a lot of time to reduce the performance impact and minimise script execution when the boat is not in use. I personally don’t notice an FPS impact but your mileage may vary.” There's also a list of known issues on the mod page that's worth scanning through.</p>
<p>If you fancy taking to the seas, you’ll need to grab <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/32">UE4SS</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/1272">TesSyncMapInjector</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/1966">MagicLoader 2</a>, the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/282">Oblivion Remastered Script Extender</a>, and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/473">NL-Tag Remover</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Today's the day. After months and years of speculation about what Nintendo's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> will be, today, it releases in the wild.

    <p>If you know where the SD card slot on the Switch 2 is, this might seem obvious, but trust me when I say we have plenty of data to show that a lot of people couldn't find it on the OG Switch. So, if you are struggling to locate the slot on the Switch 2, it's under the kickstand.

    <p>I am sitting at my desk, twitching like an anxious meerkat because I really, <em>really</em> want my Switch 2 to arrive. One small sound from outside, and I look up and out of the window, hoping it is that glorious DPD van pulling up outside my front door. So far, though, it hasn't been. Boo :( </p>
<p>I live in the wilds of Scotland, and Matt has joked the delivery driver is probably still trying to work out how to get to my house. I really hope they figure it out soon...</p>

    <p>Anyone good with screen protector woes? I applied a tempered glass protector, and it seemed to go perfectly, but then this spot never filled in properly. Is this a "get a new protector" situation? Anyone managed to fix this before? You are my only hope Eurogamer readers.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/05/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>I never played the original Fantasy Life on the Nintendo 3DS, so I jumped into Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time completely unaware of what I would be signing up for. As my customised character was tossed through a time portal to an ancient island, I gradually found my feet, settling into a quaint life-sim fuelled by a choice from over a dozen job-altering Life selections. This was plenty interesting, but by the time I got used to that loop, I was whisked through another portal and dropped onto an entire other island where the entire ebb and flow of the game completely changed.</p>
<p><iframe title="FANTASY LIFE i: The Girl Who Steals Time – Final Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0ABhNnsO4Fw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>From a life sim, the game first morphed into a sort of top-down Breath of the Wild style adventure through a massive map full of dungeons and monsters. And then two more times, the game pulls a rug out from under you that you didn’t even realise was there, layering in Animal Crossing style town and home customisation, before also adding a massive helping of roguelite dungeon crawling for good measure.</p>



<p>Many games struggle to make just one of these concepts work as a full experience – but Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time manages to pack all of these together into an endlessly addictive sprawl of life simulation and RPG adventure that is bursting at the seams with exciting stuff to do.</p>

<p>As the dust settles, and you finally get to the core of what Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time is, you’re given access to multiple maps that each house various NPCs, bosses, resources, gathering spots, fishing hubs, and more. You’re thrust into a sprawling story of time travel and fantastical adventuring that guides you across these various lands, but I quickly found all my own personal motivations for exploration and adventure.</p>

<p>The biggest of these were my Lives – unique character classes across a spectrum of fighting, crafting, and gathering that let you perform different actions depending on which Life you equip. I started out as a Blacksmith, but soon needed ore to craft a new sword. Swapping to the Miner Life let me gather that ore myself, and once the sword was made, I could become a Paladin and use it to fight off monsters, gathering their parts to use as an Alchemist to brew potions, and on and on down an endless web of activities. Each Life has unique quests, a sprawling skill tree, and special gear to gather.</p>

<p>At times, the grind to advance these Lives or create a particularly rare item can be a little exhausting on your own. As you fight bosses and explore dungeons, though, you’ll rescue characters who can become members of your party and help you fight, gather, fish, and more. I loved this system, but I do wish the companion characters were a bit more interactive. Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time skews so far tonally toward Stardew Valley or Animal Crossing that you’d expect to be able to bond with or even romance these characters, but they’re mostly there to act as extra bodies in your quest for experience and items.</p>
<p>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time sometimes apes the homework of Animal Crossing and Breath of the Wild a little too directly, but when you wander into the ever-changing roguelike dungeon, it’s unlike anything else out there. Each room of the dungeon, rather than simply tasking you to fight a daunting boss or horde of enemies, will require you to accomplish various Life-related tasks before your time-limit of exploration hits. One room might trap you in a fishing tug-of-war with a massive underwater beast, while another has you racing to gather every vegetable. There are proper battles mixed in as well, but the way these zones re-contextualise your tranquil Life activities into tense and speedy challenges is such a delight.</p>

<p>I only wish it was more rewarding to experience these delights with friends. Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time supports multiplayer, but your activities are limited not just in scope, but in time as well. You aren’t able to fully progress quests together or do anything in your custom settlement besides look around. If you decide to go into the open world together to gather materials and fight bosses, you’re forced to end the session after just 30 minutes. This is a game where co-op progress is constantly gated or held up, making it impossible to lose hours with a loved one the way you can lose that time by yourself.</p>

<p>It's coming out February 24th next year. The ocean-exploring game is set on a flooded earth on which "deadly plastification threatens to kill all living things". It mostly looks like an adventure of gathering resources, meeting strange new folk, and possibly killing them. </p>
<p>The catch is that you're always following in the wake of another player, whose own choices colour how people will react to you. In the trailer above we see Souls-esque phantoms of other adventurers affecting the player's world. They might have taken some loot you wanted, or maybe they threw a dude into the toxic water and now you've got to deal with the poor sick fella afterwards. It's basically a "choices matter" game, but someone else is doing the choosing. That said, other players may also be following you.</p>
<p>"Each person who plays is recorded, their choices are saved, and you can follow them along your journey! A friend? A streamer? The choice is yours!" say developers Digixart. "You will feel the impact from the consequences of the one you follow and must deal with them! It’s up to you to cooperate... or to make some waves!"</p>
<p>Okay, calm down please, marketing copy. No need for all those exclams. Anyway, there were a lot of choices to make in Road 96 too, the previous singleplayer game by Digixart. It was well-liked by Alice B (RPS in peace). "This political road trip is rendered an exciting and entertaining time by its cast and the deliberately piecemeal nature of its storytelling, rather than the story itself," she said in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/road-96-review">her review</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>One of the most interesting surprise announcements from <a href="https://wccftech.com/everything-shown-at-the-june-2025-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">yesterday's State of Play</a> is Sea of Remnants. Developed by Joker Studio, primarily known for the asymmetrical multiplayer survival horror game Identity V, and published by NetEase Games, the game is described as a free-to-play ocean adventure roleplaying game scheduled to launch in 2026 for PC (Steam), PlayStation 5, iOS, and Android.</p>
<p>Sylar Pan, Product Lead at Joker Studio, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>Sea of Remnants places the world’s fate directly in the players’ hands. With more than 300 characters to interact with—whether as allies, enemies, or something in between—every action can trigger surprising and far-reaching consequences. We’re excited to see the stories players will create when they finally set sail.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Sea of Remnants | Anchors Aweigh, Capt'n -  Gameplay Trailer | Get ready for PlayStation!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/02YOz0N51ME?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The premise of Sea of Remnants is quite peculiar. Players will take the role of puppet-looking sailors who have lost all their memories and embark on a journey alongside a mysterious girl across vast seas and uncharted islands to a city slowly awakening to its secrets.</p>
<p>During their travels, players can recruit a crew of unique puppetfolk allies, customize their ships with modular upgrades, and assemble specialized teams for exploration and turn-based battles. Every decision, whether sparing enemies or seizing opportunities, will have dramatic consequences for the world. As rival factions react to each choice and the cityscape of Orbtopia evolves in response, no two captains will experience the same journey.</p>
<p>Interestingly, while land combat is turn-based, naval fights take place in real time, with positioning and timing playing a crucial role in the outcome. As mentioned by the developer in the above statement, there will be over 300 non-player characters to interact with, each featuring distinct designs and personalities as well as their own allegiances. Players can befriend, provoke, or remove them. When in Orbtopia, players will even find leisure activities such as mahjong, and life skills such as hotspot cooking and fishing.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3633680/Sea_of_Remnants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam page</a> of Sea of Remnants already includes the minimum and recommended requirements.</p>

		<p>We got to get an early start on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> last night, booting up our Nintendo Switch 2 and diving into the new generation open world kart racer from the very start.</p>
<p>We’d absolutely recommend watching this on as high a resolution TV or screen as possible, as the stream is available in full 4K to show off the game at its highest fidelity.</p>
<p><iframe title="Watch us play Mario Kart World &amp; Switch 2!" width="780" height="585" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IVLByZfnbiY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>We sample a bit of the Grand Prix mode (where I drive really, really poorly), before hopping into a Knockout Tour, some of the open world Free Roam mode, and then wrapped things up just ahead of the PlayStation State of Play stream.</p>
<p>We’ll likely be streaming more of what we’re playing on Nintendo Switch 2 over the coming days on YouTube, so make sure to like, subscribe, click the bell icon and the usual things to get notifications. And obviously keep your eyes peeled for our full reviews of the Switch 2 launch titles.</p>

			<p>During <a href="https://wccftech.com/everything-shown-at-the-june-2025-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">yesterday's State of Play livestream</a>, KONAMI aired a new Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater gameplay trailer. The footage shows off Snake's various stealth and disguise options before moving to more direct fight scenes against a few of the game's bosses. Before the end, the developers also offered a glimpse at the returning Snake vs Monkey minigame, which will be available on PC and PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>Following years of rumors telling of a Metal Gear Solid 3 remake, KONAMI finally <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-mgs3-remake-original-trilogy-returning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater in May 2023. This new version is being made with the help of Virtuos, which has also worked with Bethesda on the recently released <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered.</a></p>
<p>Last year, it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-hasnt-been-messed-with-says-konami-console-graphics-modes-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that the narrative would remain exactly the same as in the original. At the same time, the developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-gameplay-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">admitted</a> that the control scheme had to be updated to modern standards.</p>
<p>Players can opt for the newly added, more modern control style. These intuitive controls allow them to focus entirely on the game. Alternatively, it is also possible to stick with the classic control style for those who desire the full-blown nostalgia effect.</p>

<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is powered by Unreal Engine 5 technology, which brings a massive visual improvement over the original game. The developers said that characters are rendered with such detail that you can see facial wrinkles and pores, as well as separate eye and iris movements, allowing for rich and expressive facial animations.</p>

The game is out <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-releases-august-28-on-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-and-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on August 28</a> for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

        <p>Dice Legends is a fair bit more interesting than that name suggests</p>

            <p>I haven't yet decided whether the loot tortoise in roguelike deckbuilder <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dice-legends">Dice Legends</a> looks satisfied or exhausted. Both make sense to me. "He's grown used to this, but still isn't thrilled about it," offered my sister. I would not be thrilled either. Imagine being aware of Pratchett's world turtle and knowing you're a glorified ATM by comparison.</p>
<p>"A roguelike deckbuilder, Nic?", you exclaim with mock interest. "Well, kick me down a well and break out the Vimto we've had mouldering in the cellar since the nineties, the last decade in which anyone consumed or thought about Vimto. Haven't had one of those since the time I went to collect the post forty five seconds ago. Also, the post was two flyers, each advertising a roguelike deckbuilder". I will not argue with your sage industry analysis, friend, although this one does have a couple of notables that may make the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3112170/Dice_Legends/">Steam demo</a> an intriguing prospect.</p>

<p>It's got lovely pixel art, for one, although thoughtful art direction isn't too surprising. Dice Legends is the latest project from CD Project alum Rafał Jaki, co-creator of The Witcher 3's Gwent minigame and showrunner on Cyberpunk: Edgerunners.</p>
<p>It's also got a tabletop twist on traditional card flinging. Each of the three playable heroes uses a different type of dice (D6, D8, or the haughty D12 - also known in some circles as 'the shape bastard'), and you'll use these to roll a dice pool to activate cards. Some cards need a number within a certain range but will still have the same effect. Others scale up with your dice results. Otherwise, it's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slay-the-spire">Slay The Spire</a> at its very core. Attack, build up shield to defend against telegraphed damage, apply debuffs, and conquer nodes on an overworld map.</p>
<p>Additionally, the soundtrack is pure Bardcore. It is certified <em>jaunty</em> up in here. Is Dice Legends a 'fifth page on the Nintendo Eshop sale'-ass name for a game? Yes. But I think it's good time nonetheless. This one's out in the third quarter of the year, to use the language of my most hated enemies, the year quarterers.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-state-of-play-june-2025-recap<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last night, Sony held its State of Play <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-state-of-play-summer-2025-confirmed" rel="nofollow">presentation</a> for June 2025, and it was chock-full of announcements, news about already-announced games, and other surprises. Here's everything that was announced during the show!</p>

<hr><h2><em>Lumines Arise&nbsp;</em>is an all-new puzzler coming later this year</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lumines-arise-playstation-state-of-play-june-2025.jpg?itok=eUWLMrvS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lumines-arise-playstation-state-of-play-june-2025.jpg?itok=QCnw9ywE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A new&nbsp;<em>Lumines&nbsp;</em>game is on the way.</figcaption></figure><p>First up, we got a look at a new puzzle game in the&nbsp;<em>Lumines&nbsp;</em>series, which is coming to PS5 later this year (and also to PlayStation VR2, if that matters to ya). It'll pack in 30 stages across a number of new backdrops, plus more of the music you know and love.</p>

<h2>Hey, Capcom's&nbsp;<em>Pragmata&nbsp;</em>isn't dead</h2>




<p>Capcom stepped up next to reveal a new trailer for sci-fi adventure&nbsp;<em>Pragmata</em>, which has been missing in action <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pragmata-thrusts-you-into-strange-new-earth" rel="nofollow">for quite some time</a>, prompting some to believe it was dead. Turns out it isn't, and its rather unique-looking gameplay has you controlling two characters at once. This one launches in 2026.</p>

<h2><em>Romeo Is a Dead Man&nbsp;</em>looks very, very Suda51</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/romeo-is-a-dead-man-playstation-state-of-play-2025.jpg?itok=8X6Wdx6h 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/romeo-is-a-dead-man-playstation-state-of-play-2025.jpg?itok=BvHNR3P1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Romeo Is a Dead Man&nbsp;</em>is a characteristically Suda51 game.</figcaption></figure><p>Grasshopper Manufacture's&nbsp;<em>Romeo Is a Dead Man&nbsp;</em>was next on the slate, and it looks like exactly what you'd expect from a Grasshopper game. It's an action title with exactly the kind of over-the-top aesthetic you've come to love from the studio and its founder, and it's coming next year.</p>

<h2><em>Silent Hill f&nbsp;</em>launches on September 25th</h2>

<p>Konami revealed the release date for its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-f-officially-revealed-konami" rel="nofollow">upcoming psychological horror game</a>&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f</em>, which will be launching on September 25th. That release date holds true not only for PS5, but also for PC and Xbox, so don't worry if you're not a PS5 owner.</p>

<h2>A new&nbsp;<em>Bloodstained&nbsp;</em>game is coming</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bloodstained-the-scarlet-engagement-playstation-state-of-play-june-2025.jpg?itok=oyZ4HlOj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bloodstained-the-scarlet-engagement-playstation-state-of-play-june-2025.jpg?itok=0EFdev1f 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Bloodstained: The Scarlet Engagement&nbsp;</em>returns to the Metroidvania stylings of&nbsp;<em>Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Next, a brand new game in the&nbsp;<em>Bloodstained&nbsp;</em>series,&nbsp;<em>Bloodstained: The Scarlet Engagement</em>, was announced for 2026, and unlike the old-school&nbsp;<em>Curse of the Moon&nbsp;</em>spinoff series, this one's a true blue Metroidvania. You'll be switching between two characters,&nbsp;<em>Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin</em>-style, to explore a new castle.</p>

<h2><em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger&nbsp;</em>gets a release date</h2>

<p>If you've been excited to check out the next game in the&nbsp;<em>Digimon Story&nbsp;</em>series, you're in luck.&nbsp;<em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger&nbsp;</em>launches on October 3rd, and we got some more info about its story, characters, and customization elements as well.</p>

<h2><em>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles&nbsp;</em>revives a strategy classic</h2>




<p>In a similar vein to 2022's&nbsp;<em>Tactics Ogre: Reborn</em>, a remastered version of&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy Tactics&nbsp;</em>was announced during the State of Play June 2025 show. It'll boast improved visuals, quality-of-life improvements, and fully voiced dialogue when it launches on September 30th.</p>

<h2>Release date sizzle reel</h2>

<p>Next, we got release dates for some games that have already been revealed. Here's a list of the new release dates we got!</p>

<ul><li><em>Baby Steps&nbsp;</em>(<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/baby-steps-bennett-foddy" rel="nofollow">from Bennett Foddy and Devolver Digital</a>): September 8th</li>
	<li><em>Hirogami&nbsp;</em>(origami platformer from Bandai Namco): September 3rd</li>
	<li><em>Everybody's Golf Hot Shots&nbsp;</em>(golfing sim from Bandai Namco): September 5th</li>
	<li><em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound&nbsp;</em>(action-packed 2D platformer): July 31st</li>
	<li><em>Cairn&nbsp;</em>(climbing game from the&nbsp;<em>Haven&nbsp;</em>devs): November 5th</li>
</ul><h2><em>Mortal Kombat Legacy Kollection&nbsp;</em>brings retro fighting thrills this year</h2>

<p>Next up, Digital Eclipse revealed&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat Legacy Kollection</em>, a package containing (or perhaps that should be "kontaining") many old-school&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat&nbsp;</em>games. Eight have been announced so far, and more reveals are on the way before release later this year.</p>

<h2>Project Defiant is a wireless fight stick made by Sony</h2>

<p>If you're into your fighting game peripherals, you may want to take a look at Project Defiant, a wireless fight stick created by Sony. It's got the signature PS5 look to it, but built into a classic fighting peripheral design. This one is coming next year.</p>

<h2><em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater&nbsp;</em>shows off its boss battles</h2>

<p>Boss battles have always been the cornerstones of a&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear&nbsp;</em>game, and&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater&nbsp;</em>is no exception. Konami's upcoming remake looks like it'll faithfully recreate Snake's battles against the Cobra Unit when it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-gear-solid-delta-release-date-leak-playstation" rel="nofollow">arrives in August</a>.</p>

<h2><i>Nioh 3&nbsp;</i>announced for next year, limited-time demo available now</h2>




<p>That's right: there's going to be a new&nbsp;<em>Nioh&nbsp;</em>game, and what's more, you can try it out right now.&nbsp;<em>Nioh 3&nbsp;</em>is coming to PS5 next year, offering a choice between two distinct combat styles. A limited-time demo can be downloaded right now on the PlayStation Store.</p>

<h2><em>Thief&nbsp;</em>is back...in VR form</h2>

<p>Next was perhaps one of the cruelest teases of the entire State of Play show. The venerable&nbsp;<em>Thief&nbsp;</em>franchise is back, but&nbsp;<em>Thief VR: Legacy of Shadow&nbsp;</em>is, as you've probably come to realize, a VR-exclusive game. It comes to PS VR2 later this year.</p>

<h2><em>Tides of Tomorrow&nbsp;</em>is a colorful-looking adventure from the&nbsp;<em>Road 96</em>&nbsp;devs</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tides-of-tomorrow-playstation-state-of-play-june-2025.jpg?itok=SziQv_NQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tides-of-tomorrow-playstation-state-of-play-june-2025.jpg?itok=5OSFFtmj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Tides of Tomorrow&nbsp;</em>is an asynchronous multiplayer game from&nbsp;<em>Road 96&nbsp;</em>developer DigixArt.</figcaption></figure><p>DigixArt, the studio behind&nbsp;<em>Road 96</em>, appeared next to show off&nbsp;<em>Tides of Tomorrow</em>, its colorful adventure with an "intriguing asynchronous multiplayer" element that shows you not only your choices, but a previous player's choices as well. It's coming in February.</p>

<h2><em>Astro Bot&nbsp;</em>is getting new challenge levels</h2>

<p>Team Asobi head Nicolas Doucet took to the virtual stage next to reveal that beloved platformer&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot&nbsp;</em>is getting five new challenge levels later this month, and you'll be able to rescue new PlayStation-inspired bots as well.</p>

<h2><em>Sea of Remnants&nbsp;</em>is a new pirate RPG coming next year</h2>




<p>If, like many, Ubisoft's&nbsp;<em>Skull and Bones&nbsp;</em>didn't do anything to quell your desire for pirate adventure,&nbsp;<em>Sea of Remnants&nbsp;</em>could well do the trick. It's a stylized puppetry-inspired pirate RPG coming sometime next year.</p>

<h2><em>Sword of the Sea&nbsp;</em>is the&nbsp;<em>Journey&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>The Pathless&nbsp;</em>artist's next adventure</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sword-of-the-sea-playstation-state-of-play-june-2025.jpg?itok=bDWQyvox 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sword-of-the-sea-playstation-state-of-play-june-2025.jpg?itok=R73wxomm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll never guess who's behind this one.</figcaption></figure><p>The first few seconds of the trailer for&nbsp;<em>Sword of the Sea&nbsp;</em>pretty much gave away who was behind it. This one comes from Matt Nava, the artist behind&nbsp;<em>Journey&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Abzu</em>, and it's coming on August 19th, with a day one PS Plus Extra release lined up.</p>

<h2>More games are heading to PS Plus</h2>

<p>As well as&nbsp;<em>Sword of the Sea</em>, Sony also revealed during the showcase that the PS2 version of classic immersive sim&nbsp;<em>Deus Ex</em>, as well as racers&nbsp;<em>Twisted Metal 3&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>4</em>, are coming to the Classics Catalog in June and July. Not only that, but&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>3</em>, as well as&nbsp;<em>Myst&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Riven</em>, are also coming to the service.</p>

<h2>IO Interactive shows off a little bit of&nbsp;<em>007 First Light</em></h2>

<p>Next, it was IO Interactive's turn to show off <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/io-interactive-007-first-light" rel="nofollow">upcoming&nbsp;<em>James Bond&nbsp;</em>adventure&nbsp;<em>007 First Light</em></a>, and it looks...well, like a&nbsp;<em>James Bond&nbsp;</em>game, shockingly enough. This one's coming next year, and we'll get more info about it in the coming days.</p>

<h2><em>Ghost of Yotei&nbsp;</em>is getting a gameplay deep dive in July</h2>

<p>A very brief clip of&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yotei&nbsp;</em>was shown next, and Sony says a gameplay "deep dive" is coming in July, so we'll get to learn more about the game then. This one is launching in October, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ghost-of-yotei-release-date" rel="nofollow">as previously revealed</a>.</p>

<h2><em>Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls&nbsp;</em>is an anime-inspired fighter coming next year</h2>




<p>Finally, we got a reveal trailer for&nbsp;<em>Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls</em>, a gorgeous-looking anime fighter from&nbsp;<em>Guilty Gear&nbsp;</em>developer Arc System Works. The game will feature Marvel mainstays like Captain America, Spider-Man, and Storm, and it's coming next year.</p>

<hr><p>That's everything we got to see during this year's Sony State of Play show! Hopefully, we'll be learning more about some of these rather exciting-looking games in the coming months.</p>

What I'm here to discuss is a note left at the end of the announcement by writer Yasumi Matsuno, which reads:</p><blockquote><div><p>Nearly 30 years ago, the collapse of Japan's bubble economy engulfed the nation's financial institutions in mountains of bad debt, triggering a wave of corporate bankruptcies, a sudden and extreme rise in unemployment rates, and stagnation of Japanese society as a whole. It was an era when many were robbed of hope, when dreams were measured by their price tag.</p><p>Against this historical backdrop, I crafted a story. It was the story of Ramza, a young man who fought tirelessly against the entrenched social class system. It was the story of Delita, who sought to take advantage of this confusion and despair to advance his own social position. It was a story of a peculiar destiny, in which friendship and betrayal intertwine.</p><p>And now, in 2025--a time when inequality and division are still deeply rooted in our society--I offer this story once again.</p><p>The will to resist is in your hands.</p><p>YASUMI MATSUNO - ORIGINAL SCRIPT, SCENARIO WRITER AND EDITOR</p></div><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Hell yeah dude. </p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/neightreign-is-good-but-lumpy-counter-intuitive-and-experimental"><h3>Nightreign is Uneven And Counter-Intuitive.

We’re excited to see the stories players will create when they finally set sail.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via NetEase Games:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p><em>Sea of Remnants</em> invites players into a visually captivating world, where they assume the role of a puppet-like sailor who has lost all their memories. Alongside a mysterious girl, players will voyage across vast seas, uncharted islands and a city slowly awakening to its secrets. Through open-world exploration, intense naval combat and dynamic interactions with a cast of over 300 eccentric characters, players will uncover the truth behind their forgotten identity and shape the fate of the world around them.</p><p>On this sprawling journey, players can recruit a crew of unique puppetfolk allies, customize their ships with modular upgrades, and build specialized teams for exploration and turn-based battles. Every decision—whether sparing enemies or seizing opportunities—will unleash dramatic ripple effects across the world. With rival factions reacting to each choice and Orbtopia’s cityscape evolving in response, no two captains will share the same story.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

Once that happens, the next batch of copies from Amazon likely won't have the poster inside.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FBZLRLLV,B0FBZYSJXM&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Preorder Amazon Exclusive Edition for:</a></strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FBZYSJXM?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo Switch</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FBZLRLLV?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PlayStation 5</a></li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4507314-finalfantasytacticsamazonpreorder.png" data-ref-id="1300-4507314" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4507314-finalfantasytacticsamazonpreorder.png" data-ref-id="1300-4507314"></a><figcaption>Final Fantasy Tactics - Amazon Exclusive Edition</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4507314-finalfantasytacticsamazonpreorder.png"></figure><p>While the physical edition is only available for PS5 and Nintendo Switch, Final Fantasy Tactics will also launch digitally on PC (Steam), Xbox Series X|S, PS4, and Switch 2.

Additionally, release-day delivery is not guaranteed. Square Enix charges <em>high </em>prices for faster shipping speeds. Two-day shipping is $35, and overnighting the game at launch would cost you $55--so you'd pay more for shipping than the cost of the item itself.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://na.store.square-enix-games.com/final-fantasy-tactics---the-ivalice-chronicles" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/na.store.square-enix-games.com\/final-fantasy-tactics---the-ivalice-chronicles&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://na.store.square-enix-games.com/final-fantasy-tactics---the-ivalice-chronicles">Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles Collector's Box</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://na.store.square-enix-games.com/final-fantasy-tactics---the-ivalice-chronicles" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/na.store.square-enix-games.com\/final-fantasy-tactics---the-ivalice-chronicles&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://na.store.square-enix-games.com/final-fantasy-tactics---the-ivalice-chronicles">$200 (no game) | $250 with the game</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles is getting a jam-packed Collector's Box that looks appropriately lavish for this all-time classic.</p><p>Here's what you get with the Collector's Box:</p><ul><li><strong>Special Art Box:</strong> Shown above, the box holding all of the merch has intricate character art against a decorative depiction of Ivalice in the background. Square Enix printed the artwork on matte-textured art paper.</li><li><strong>Ramza Beoulve Figure (Akademy Version):</strong> It's unclear how tall this figure is, but it is described as a "figure," not a statue. That said, it does come with a base stand. Overall, this looks like a high-quality figure with vibrant colors and impressive attention to detail.</li><li><strong>Mini Chocobo Plush Set:</strong> Adorable miniature plushies of the standard yellow Chocobo, Black Chocobo, and Red Chocobo. Each plush has an elastic loop, so you can connect it to a backpack or even your belt (if you're especially cool).</li><li><strong>Zodiac Stones Acrylic Magnet Set:</strong> All 12 Zodiac stones as acrylic magnets.</li><li><strong>Outlying Church Pop-Up Diorama:</strong> A pop-up 3D display of the Outlying Church from the game. If you compare it to in-game screenshots, it looks like an faithful recreation.</li><li><strong>Art Prints: </strong>Printed on glossy polypropylene (plastic) sheets, the three pieces of framable artwork feature: Ramza, a world map of Ivalice, and the key art that's used for the standard edition of the remaster.</li></ul><p>The Collector's Box is available on its own for $200 or bundled with game for $250. If you choose the latter, the game will be packaged separately. This just means that the Collector's Box is the same regardless of which choice you make, and the box, as shown above, doesn't have a Nintendo Switch or PS5 logo on it. Since physical editions aren't available for Xbox, PS4, or PC, a universal Collector's Box makes sense.</p><p>Square Enix's store page doesn't explicitly state that the Collector's Box is exclusive to its own storefront. If it is available elsewhere, it'd be wise to buy it at a major US retailer. <strong>Standard shipping costs $20</strong> from the Square Enix Store to the US. Two-day and overnight shipping is offered, but these options cost $49 and $69, respectively. Not nice.</p><p>You can check out all of the collectibles in the image below.</p></div>                      </div>   </div><figure data-align="center" data-size="large"

			<p>While <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-gameplay-deep-dive-announced-for-july-2025/">Ghost of Yotei</a> might've been a game players expected to see in during today's State of Play, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/astro-bot-celebrated-platformer/">Astro Bot</a> was definitely not what people would've expected.</p>
<p>Team Asobi studio head Nicolas Doucet briefly appeared during the presentation to announce that five new levels will be added to <a href="https://wccftech.com/all-winners-at-the-game-awards-2024-astro-bot-game-of-the-year/">The Game Awards 2024 GOTY winner</a> on July 10, 2025, and that a new version of the limited-edition Astro Bot DualSense controller will be launching sometime later this year.</p>
<p>This latest batch of levels brings the total for the game over 90, and like most of the levels Team Asobi has released for Astro Bot post-launch, they're meant to provide a little extra challenge for the platformer fans who want it.</p>
<p>All together, they are the Vicious Void levels, and Team Asobi revealed the names for four of the five, and a sneak peek that the Ghost of Yotei protagonist, Atsu, has been added to the game as a new bot to collect.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Regarding the new version of the controller, it pretty much looks exactly the same as the old one, except the eyes are made to look like the Astro-persona inside your controller is smiling. The rest of the color layout, and everything about it, seems to be exactly the same.</p>
<p>Now that Astro Bot has more than 90 levels, and that we're starting to come up on the one-year anniversary from the game's launch, it's possible that this is one of, if not the last batch of DLC levels Team Asobi releases, before moving on to whatever its next project will be.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/04/astro-bot-five-new-vicious-void-galaxy-levels-special-bots-launch-this-july/">PlayStation Blog</a> post for the update, Doucet wrote "<em>It has been a real delight to continue offering you, our valued fans, an extended Astro Bot experience at no additional cost</em>," which doesn't exactly have the ring of Team Asobi wanting to slow down soon. We'll see what the anniversary brings, and if we get more clarification on what Team Asobi's future looks like, then.</p>
