                <p dir="ltr">Earlier this month, Skybound and QuarterUp announced that Rex Splode would be joining Mark Invincible, Atom Eve, and more on the playable roster for Invincible Vs.--the 3v3 tag-team fighting game coming next year. Today, during Robert Kirkman's panel at San Diego Comic-Con, the Invincible creator announced another new fighter for the game, and this one is a little more beastly.</p><p dir="ltr">Battle Beast--the fearsome warrior who travels the Invincible universe looking for a fighter to give him a glorious death--is the latest entrant into the Invincible Vs roster. The reveal trailer for the giant showed off some of his smashing moveset--including one attack where he smashed his club into Bulletproof so hard, it knocked off his head and limbs.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Invincible VS - Battle Beast Character Gameplay Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Battle Beast becomes the sixth confirmed fighter for Invincible Vs., joining the previously mentioned Invincible, Atom Eve, Bulletproof, and Rex Splode, as well as the Viltrumite Thula. Two other Viltrumites, Lucen and Omni-Man, did feature in the game's initial reveal trailer in June, but neither have been officially confirmed as playable characters.</p><p dir="ltr">Invincible Vs. was announced during the Xbox Showcase in early June, with Skybound also announcing the creation of its development studio Quarter Up. Quarter Up is made up of industry veterans from Activision, Riot Games, Xbox, and more, and it was founded by Mike Willette, who previously worked on the Killer Instinct 2013 reboot for Xbox--as a developer and as the voice of the announcer.</p><p dir="ltr">Invincible VS is set to launch in 2026 for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>

She is the next person to take on the Avatar title after Korra in the previous series, but the title is not one of honor at this point in history, as it has marked the new hero as a destroyer of worlds. The official synopsis is as follows:</p><p>“A young Earthbender discovers she’s the new Avatar after Korra – but in this dangerous era, that title marks her as humanity’s destroyer, not its savior. Hunted by both human and spirit enemies, she and her long-lost twin must uncover their mysterious origins and save the Seven Havens before civilization’s last strongholds collapse.”</p><p>The image shown at Comic Con has the new Avatar front and center, alongside a feline companion and another character named Jae, who is described as Pavi’s mentor.</p><figure id="" data-id="d4a14144c3c29c07df60b36107e118fd" data-recommend-id="image://d4a14144c3c29c07df60b36107e118fd" data-format="jpg" data-width="3441" data-height="1933" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Pavi, Jae, and a feline companion look over a desert." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Pavi, Jae, and a feline companion look over a desert." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nickelodeon</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d4a14144c3c29c07df60b36107e118fd" data-recommend-id="image://d4a14144c3c29c07df60b36107e118fd" data-format="jpg" data-width="3441" data-height="1933" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Pavi, Jae, and a feline companion look over a desert." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Seven Havens</em> will premiere in 2027 on Nickelodeon and span 26 episodes across two seasons.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/gamefound-acquires-indiegogo-greatly-expanding-tabletop-crowdfunding-platform</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gamefound-acquires-indiegogo-greatly-expanding-the-tabletop-crowdfunding-platform.1252797/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Gamefound has acquired the crowdfunding platform, Indiegogo. This is a major change for Indiegogo, which was one of the earliest pioneers of crowdfunding platforms. This acquisition will lead to new features and improvements, as well as new conveniences for users.</p>

<h2>The Gamefound Indiegogo Acquisition</h2>

<p>In an official <a href="https://gamefound.com/en/blog/post/gamefound-acquires-indiegogo" rel="nofollow">blog post</a>, Gamefound discussed the changes that would be coming to both platforms as a result of the acquisition. First, much like Roll20 and Demiplane's acquisition, you will be able to log in to Gamefound using either your Indiegogo or Gamefound credentials. In addition, Indiegogo will be adopting Gamefound's business terms and policies, which are generally friendlier to the end user.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gamefound-indiegogo-campaign-metrics.jpg?itok=SgV_nrJJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gamefound-indiegogo-campaign-metrics.jpg?itok=nxWZIjNB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The latter is especially impressive since Gamefound provides plenty of methods and options for users to launch and support different tabletop projects. Campaigns include both pre-launch and late pledges. The platform provides integrated tax tools, providing more transparent prices for various regional taxes and national tariffs. Lastly, users have access to stretch pay and direct currency exchange.</p>

<p>“It’s time for crowdfunding to be a forward-facing industry again,” said Julie dePontbriand, CEO of Indiegogo. “Gamefound’s technology is unrivaled, and we’re thrilled to bring it to Indiegogo’s diverse community. Together, we’re making crowdfunding more innovative, creator-friendly, and exciting than ever before.”</p>

<p>These changes aside, not much will change for either platform. Gamefound is still dedicated to providing a platform for tabletop crowdfunding projects. It has been their mission statement since it was founded in 2016, and that is still their focus. Their track record speaks for itself with successes like board game adaptations of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/cyberpunk-2077-board-game-campaign-raises-over-1-million-in-one-day" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/helldivers-2-board-game-fully-funded-in-12-minutes-on-gamefound" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Helldivers 2</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/blasphemous-board-game-brings-penitence-to-gamefound" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Blasphemous</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/hearts-of-iron-board-game-reaches-gamefound-success-in-13-minutes" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Hearts of Iron</em></a>.</p>

<p>As for Indiegogo, it will continue as a platform for various tech and arts projects. Projects as diverse as Steam Deck competitors or board game projects like the original <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/steamforged-games-announces-street-masters-champion-edition" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Street Masters</em></a> board game. The difference now is that the platform's userbase of about 38 million will be enjoying some quality-of-life improvements.</p>

VShojo CEO Justin “Gunrun” Ignacio <a href="https://x.com/VShojo/status/1948442574722924778">made the announcement today on X, writing</a>, “I take full responsibility for the decisions that led us to this point.”</p><p>Earlier this week, VShojo came under fire as Ironmouse, the agency’s top-performing VTuber, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/712627/ironmouse-leaves-vshojo-vtuber-twitch-youtube">announced she was leaving the company</a> over a missing $500,000 charity donation and her own unpaid funds. Her departure triggered a mass exodus of VShojo talent, with 12 of the company’s 13 creators officially announcing their own split from the company and some also claiming unpaid wages as their reason. Ignacio’s announcement alluded to VShojo’s financial difficulties.</p><p>“We raised around $11 million to pursue a bold, talent-first approach in VTubing,” the statement reads. “However, despite all our efforts, the business failed to generate the revenue we needed to sustain that model, and eventually, we ran out of money.”</p><p>Ignacio also admitted that the funds raised by Ironmouse and intended for the Immune Deficiency Foundation had been spent by the company: “Additionally I acknowledge that some of the money spent by the company was raised in connection with talent activity which I later learned was intended for a charitable initiative.” Ignacio went on to write that he was confident that he’d be able to raise enough money to cover those costs. “We were unsuccessful in our fundraising efforts.”</p><p>Here’s the statement in full.</p><div><blockquote><p>VShojo has failed, and I’ve mismanaged the company into the situation you’re all witnessing.</p><p>So today I am sharing the difficult news that VShojo is shutting down, and I take full responsibility for the decisions that led us to this point.</p><p>I’ve been doing everything I can to fundraise and right the ship these past few months, but despite my efforts, we are in a worse position, and those I care about are now paying the price.</p><p>Over the past few years, we raised around $11 million to pursue a bold, talent-first approach in VTubing, prioritizing creators and community over short-term profits, to achieve long-term sustainability. Our funding went directly to our creators through generous splits, debut investments, infrastructure, concerts, events, and staffing, all designed to support them. We also wanted talent to own their IP, which we knew was a unique creator-first approach for an agency. However, despite all our efforts, the business failed to generate the revenue we needed to sustain that model, and eventually, we ran out of money.</p><p>Additionally, I acknowledge that some of the money spent by the company was raised in connection with talent activity, which I later learned was intended for a charitable initiative. At the time, we were working hard to raise additional investment capital to cover our costs, and I firmly believed, based on the information available to us, that we would be able to do so and cover all expenses. We were unsuccessful in our fundraising efforts. I made the decision to pursue funding, and I own its consequences.</p><p>I am deeply sorry to all the talents, staff, friends, and community members who believed in our brand. You did not deserve this.</p></blockquote></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/713343/vshojo-shutting-down-ironmouse-missing-charity-donations]]></content:encoded>

This PMC will be a part of the game’s multiplayer mode, too. Despite the trailer being all about the campaign, it’s clear that this time around EA and series creator DICE—which is part of a larger group of teams working on <em>BF6 </em>known as Battlefield Studios—are aiming for a grounded, contemporary military sim. This is unlike recent <em>Battlefield</em> entries like <em>BF2042</em> and <em>BFV</em>, which either focused on the past or the future. This is good. <em>Battlefield 3 </em>and <em>4 </em>are probably the best games in the series. I just hope that after launch, <em>BF6</em> avoids becoming an IP slop shop like <em>Call of Duty </em>and other big shooters have.</p><p>These days, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/crossover-skins-destiny-2-witcher-halo-rainbow-six-bad-1851039973?_gl=1*52m3rn*_ga*NjgyMDU5NjUzLjE3NTAwODIwMTA.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTMzODI0MDkkbzY3JGcwJHQxNzUzMzgyNDA5JGo2MCRsMCRoMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/crossover-skins-destiny-2-witcher-halo-rainbow-six-bad-1851039973?_gl=1*52m3rn*_ga*NjgyMDU5NjUzLjE3NTAwODIwMTA.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTMzODI0MDkkbzY3JGcwJHQxNzUzMzgyNDA5JGo2MCRsMCRoMA..">it seems like every major live-service shooter is filled with crossover skins</a></span>. I’ve been playing <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> recently, after its big update, and was shocked and horrified to be killed by a person dressed as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zRanYrbVBA&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zRanYrbVBA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rick from <em>Rick &amp; Morty </em>during a match</a></span>. Later, I killed Master Chief and Lara Croft. The gritty, tactical aesthetic Ubisoft had spent years creating was ruined and the game felt like a joke. </p><p>A similar thing has happened to <em>Call of Duty,</em> which continues to introduce sillier and weirder skins, including <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjaKA57mnu8&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjaKA57mnu8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beavis and Butthead</a></span>. Even <em>Destiny </em>has decided to ruin what was one of the most unique and interesting sci-fi universes in decades by shoving <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-destiny-2-renegades-trailer-release-date-1851779376&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-destiny-2-renegades-trailer-release-date-1851779376"><em>Ghostbusters</em>,<em> Star Wars</em></a></span><em>, </em>and more into the game. </p><p>Look, I get it. <em>Fortnite </em>makes a lot of money. And it relies heavily on IP crossover skins with various movies, TV shows, and other games. The thing is, <em>Fortnite </em>has always been a weird cartoon playground that felt more like a toybox than a real world. So I don’t mind the Predator, Peter Griffin, Hatsune Miku, and Godzilla hanging out together. It’s a horrible, but impressive, pop culture nightmare. And it doesn’t need to be copied by every other live-service game around. </p><p>My hope for <em>Battlefield 6</em> is that EA realizes the opportunity they have with this new game. Every one of your competitors, big and small, has made a deal with the devil and added crossover cosmetics and goofy skins in the pursuit of <em>Fortnite</em>-like profits.</p><figure id="" data-id="1d66d7459ba3cee8a05db231907939e3" data-recommend-id="image://1d66d7459ba3cee8a05db231907939e3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Activision / Paramount</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1d66d7459ba3cee8a05db231907939e3" data-recommend-id="image://1d66d7459ba3cee8a05db231907939e3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>And EA and Battlefield Studios have a chance here to go in a different direction. To take a different path with <em>Battlefield 6</em> and its cosmetics. </p><p>Don’t ruin the game’s aesthetic and grounded tone by adding Spider-Man or whatever; instead, focus on adding content that fits within the universe and doesn’t distract during battles. Add more camo options. More tactical vests and goggles. New weapon attachments and boots. It might not be as flashy as, say, adding The Thing from <em>Fantastic Four</em> into the game, but it will preserve <em>BF6</em>'s tone and look. </p><p>I think if EA goes this route, it could differentiate this new <em>Battlefield </em>game from the upcoming <em>Call of Duty</em> and all the other free-to-play live-service shooters out there in 2025. And these days, that could be the key to building a large and loyal audience. Better yet, it means I won’t have to get picked off by someone dressed as Batman or Darth Vader while trying to capture an objective. Doesn’t that sound nice? Imagine a game with a distinct and consistent art style. It’s not impossible. It could happen. And I hope EA and Battlefield Studios realize that and keep the slop out. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-crossover-skins-rick-morty-call-of-duty-1851786919]]></content:encoded>

Between its Lego Mario line of toys and more recent models like an NES or Bowser, the Nintendo-specific Lego sets are plentiful enough that they take up huge sections of the aisle in toy stores. Today, the two announced their latest collaboration: a replica of Nintendo's first handheld, the Game Boy.</p><p>The set is aimed towards nostalgic adults, coming with an 18+ age recommendation. It doesn't light up, and it's (perhaps obviously) not a playable system, but the buttons are designed to be pressed, with a realistic tactile feel. The model comes with two game cartridges – Super Mario Land and The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening – which can be inserted just as you would into the real handheld. It also comes with swappable screens to simulate each game, along with a third option showing the Nintendo logo.</p><p>Take a look for yourself at the photo gallery below.</p><p>The Lego set will retail for $59.99 in the United States. It launches October 1 of this year, but you can preorder one at regular Lego retailers (like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DX3J6MT7?tag=ignlego-20&amp;ascsubtag=070hgOr7WJvqG6SJWg1FAAQ">Amazon</a>) starting today.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/07/24/a-lego-game-boy-replica-comes-out-this-october]]></content:encoded>

<p>Accompanying the short tribute video of the voice actor's many roles in the Pokémon anime — where Carter played Professor Oak, Gary Oak, Meowth, and Team Rocket's James — along with the below message:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>In addition to his voice work, James provided over 700 episodes of scripts for the animated series, shaping the stories that defined generations of fans. From the very first episode to the final journeys, James brought warmth, humor, and unforgettable charm to the world of Pokémon. His talent gave life to some of our most beloved characters, and his legacy will continue to reach the hearts of Trainers everywhere.</p>
<p>James’s voice will always be part of our adventure. Our thoughts and condolences are with his family and friends."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Carter recorded voice lines for over 700 episodes of the anime, but retired from voice acting in 2023 after being diagnosed with throat cancer.</p>
<p>The video ends on a rather poignant moment from the anime where Meowth and a Glameow are riding a boat while looking at the moon.</p></section>

      <div><p>As Critical Role's San Diego Comic-Con panel continued, they debuted footage from the upcoming Season 4 of <em>The Legend of Vox Machina</em> alongside a release window, and the confirmation that the fifth season has been greenlit, but that it will also be the last.</p>

<p>In addition to this announcement, a short clip was played from the upcoming season highlighting Vox Machina's plan to rob the Cobalt Soul with the help of Taryon Darrington. This is the first time we've seen Taryon and his construct companion, Doty, in motion for <em>The Legend of Vox Machina</em>.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Executive Producers and Critical Role Co-Founders Sam Riegel and Travis Willingham had the following to say on the announcement of the final season of <em>The Legend of Vox Machina.</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"It's so rare for any television series to get to tell a complete story, beginning to end, exactly as it was envisioned, we're so grateful to our fans, the critters, our partners at Prime Video, and the original Kickstarter backers for bringing this show to life, and turning the numbskulls of Vox Machina into animation legends."</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>What's next after <em>The Legend Of Vox Machina</em>?</h2>

<p>This wasn't the only piece of Critical Role animation news at the San Diego Comic-Con panel as a teaser animation and release date for the first season of <em>The Mighty Nein</em> was also announced.</p>

<p>Additionally, even though there is no specific announcement, fans of Critical Role are waiting with bated breath for any potential announcements of animated adaptations of their third campaign, Bells Hells, and any of the spin-off series like Calamity or Downfall.</p>

We were unsuccessful in our fundraising efforts.

But Ignacio says the “business failed to generate the revenue we needed to sustain that model.”</p><p>Ironmouse, who did not reveal the details of her breakup with VShojo, which she said would involve legal action, was not the only Vtuber to cut ties with the agency this week. On July 22, every member of its roster said they were either going independent or taking a break from streaming for a while. Some of the VTubers said they hadn’t been paid in months. It remains unclear how much money VShojo owes them and whether that money&nbsp;will ever be paid. </p><p>While the agency is now shutting down, and the $515,000 it was supposed to pay to the Immune Deficiency Foundation may never materialize, a fresh fundraiser Ironmouse recently announced has already <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/ironmouse/status/1948360664956784828&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/ironmouse/status/1948360664956784828" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">raised over $1 million more for the organization</a></span>.

The sequel was co-written by Druckmann and Halley Gross. The duo, alongside Craig Mazin, most recently penned the scripts for the final two episodes of The Last of Us Season 2 for HBO.</p><p>This will probably be a fascinating book to pore over and have by your side during your next playthrough. But it might be of even greater interest to aspiring game writers. Scripts, like many areas of game development, aren't talked about by developers or publishers. Unless you work in the industry, chances are you've never had access to a script for a AAA game until now.</p></div>                      </div><p>The fact that this book exists at all is honestly pretty remarkable--unprecedented, even. We couldn't find a single other full video game script in book format. The closest published example we thought of was <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Skyrim-Library-Volumes-III-Box/dp/1783293233?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Skyrim Library</a>, a three-volume series compiling all of the written lore found in The Elder Scrolls V.</p><p>The reality is that many AAA games simply wouldn't make sense to release in book format from a financial perspective. Games with choice-based dialogue trees, branching paths, open worlds, and hundreds of NPCs, and enormous lists of side content would simply require far too many pages across multiple books.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4537894-thelastofusgames.png" data-ref-id="1300-4537894" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4537894-thelastofusgames.png" data-ref-id="1300-4537894"></a><figcaption>The Last of Us series for PlayStation 5</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4537894-thelastofusgames.png"></figure><p>The Last of Us, on the other hand, sets up particularly well for this format. No other game has been described as cinematic or referred to as an "interactive movie" as frequently as The Last of Us. Heck, many of the scenes in HBO's adaptation are pulled straight from the game, no interpretation required.</p><hr><p>The Last of Us doesn't have choice-based dialogue, branching paths, or a sprawling open world to explore. The gameplay experience in the first game is essentially scripted. The sequel is more dynamic, granting players more freedom to approach combat encounters and puzzles in different ways. But much like Naughty Dog's Uncharted 4, the "open" set pieces are still fundamentally linear.</p><p>This doesn't mean that the scripts will read just like a screenplay or teleplay. There are still lots of interactive components to the worlds of each game that will naturally be found amidst conversations between Joel and Ellie. All of the text that fills the space between lines of dialogue should be illuminating. Chances are fans will glean new insights from the text.</p><p>Screenplays, which are typically 90-120 pages, aren't published nearly as often as they once were, but occasionally we see teleplay collections for popular TV shows. HBO's The Last of Us adaptation isn't one of them--at least not yet--but HBO has recent experience publishing scriptbooks for its shows.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ironmouse-raises-1-million-for-immune-deficiency-foundation-after-leaving-vtuber-agency-over-claims-that-it-owed-500-000-update.1252725/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Earlier this week, Ironmouse, a Vtuber who <a href="https://aftermath.site/ironmouse-twitch-subscriber-record-kai-cenat-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">briefly held the record for most Twitch subscriptions of all time</a>, shocked the streaming world by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwLbGcUMy6g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcing her exit from VShojo</a>, a major North American Vtuber agency that rose to prominence alongside her. The reason? She felt she’d been “misled” and that she was “owed a significant amount of funds,” including a whopping $500,000 meant for the Immune Deficiency Foundation, for which she’d raised money during the 2024 marathon that broke Twitch’s subscriber record. Now, one mass exodus later, she’s raised more than double that amount.</p><p>Like other agencies, VShojo is meant to provide Vtubers with resources to aid in marketing, opportunities, creation of virtual avatars, and things of the like. VShojo is notable for a couple reasons: 1) It was the first major North American agency in a scene previously dominated by Japanese organizations, and 2) It bills itself as “talent-first,” and unlike many in the space, grants creators under its umbrella IP rights to their Vtuber character (others keep the character if a creator quits or gets fired). Fans were shocked, then, to hear claims that VShojo, the good guy in <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/the-vtuber-industry-corporatization-labor-and-kawaii/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a sea of supposed swindlers</a>, was leaving its biggest names high and dry.</p><p>"I don’t think people outside Vtubing understand how crazy this is," an extraterrestrial-themed Vtuber who goes by the handle Serotina <a href="https://x.com/SerotinaVT/status/1947664070573703476" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote on Twitter</a>. "VShojo had one of the best reputations of the big corps. The talents always spoke SO highly of VShojo, and many indies aspired to join them, like that was the dream. It’s so unbelievable how hard they fumbled."</p><p>Ironmouse had extra motivation to depart the agency with which she’d become semi-synonymous: She <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2022/04/20/twitch-ironmouse-vtuber-subathon-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suffers from a chronic illness</a> called common variable immune deficiency, or CVID, which leaves her highly susceptible to infection. The money she’s made from streaming has allowed her access to better healthcare, but she remains largely homebound. Helping others in similar situations by raising money for the Immune Deficiency Foundation – which provided her aid when she was “lonely,” “terrified,” and “confused” during the darkest doldrums of her own health decline – is her main cause.&nbsp;</p><p>“The Immune Deficiency Foundation means the world to me. [Streamer friend Connor "CDawgVA" Colquhoun] and I have both spent a ton of energy, time, and resources raising money for charity, and we're both so proud to say that we've raised nearly $4 million for charity,” Ironmouse said in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwLbGcUMy6g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a video</a> explaining why she left VShojo. “The thing that hurts me the most is that the Immune Deficiency Foundation, which is the most important charity to me and also the reason why I’m here today, is owed over half a million dollars from VShojo. … I really want to tell you everything, but unfortunately right now I have been instructed by my attorney to wait for more of the legal procedure to unfold. So one day I will be able to tell you the full story. But for now, I just need to let you know that I will no longer be a part of VShojo.”</p><p>Aftermath reached out to VShojo and the Immune Deficiency Foundation for more details, but did not receive a response as of this publishing.</p><p>Ironmouse’s announcement triggered a cascade of departures; as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/712627/ironmouse-leaves-vshojo-vtuber-twitch-youtube" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Verge</a> notes, 12 of the 13 Vtubers listed on VShojo’s website have cut ties with the agency in the three days since she posted her video. Others, like fellow massively popular Vtuber Kson, also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBxw80mZoWI&amp;t=236s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a> that VShojo owed her a “significant” amount of money.</p><p>Before long, freelance artists who’d helped contribute to VShojo projects came out of the woodwork to say that the agency <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/niya.rest/post/3luiyoe5uus2c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ghosted them</a> and <a href="https://x.com/RimaEvenstar/status/1947477389732200857" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">failed to pay them on time</a> – or, in some cases, <a href="https://x.com/shirobeats_/status/1947722359848554706" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at all</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>"Nowhere near what Mouse is going through, but for the past [around a] year VShojo has been habitually late in paying me for commissions, sometimes leaving thousands of dollars of my invoices unpaid for months at a time,” a Vtuber composer who goes by the handle StarlightDaryl <a href="https://x.com/StarlightDaryl/status/1947469018211967090" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote on Twitter</a>, noting that they did eventually receive what they were owed, but only thanks to the efforts of creators and their managers. “I tried to be patient, but knowing they were stealing charity money from Mousey while this was all happening makes me SICK to my stomach."&nbsp;</p><p>Ironmouse <a href="https://x.com/ironmouse/status/1947709495888806001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said on Twitter</a> that she planned to ensure that all other artists who’d been left waiting would be similarly compensated.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/vortoxy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vortoxy</a>, who provides freelance video production services in the Vtuber space, broke down their experience with VShojo.</p><p>"Once the project had been completed they asked me to fill out an invoice, and we agreed that payment would be sent 30 business days later,” Vortoxy told Aftermath. “In my case, I think my payment was sent about 53 or 54 business days later. Once the 30 days had passed, I figured it wouldn't hurt to ask the status of my payment, and often I was met with a message along the lines of ‘let me check with finances’ and then crickets for some time. I think I had asked about three times before I had finally received payment from them. I don't think I've had the worst case by any means, but it seemed a little ridiculous to me that I had to hunt down a payment of $500 from a company of their status."</p><p>Vortoxy added, however, that this wasn’t the first time they’d had to chase down a payment from an agency revealed to be in the throes of money-related woes.&nbsp;</p><p>"Oddly enough, it's been almost a year to the date when MSM Talent was also exposed for owing their Vtuber talents money,” Vortoxy said. “Similar to VShojo, they were an agency who provided backend support to various big indie creators in the space. I worked with them for just shy of a year and never received a single payment for the various projects I did for them until the very end, when a large group of creators were demanding the money they were owed."</p><p>Ultimately, they believe that VShojo is not exactly an outlier in this regard.</p><p>"I honestly do think there is a larger industry issue plaguing the scene,” Vortoxy said. “I have various other freelance creative friends in this space who also have told me their own horror stories of working with different Vtuber corporations or large creators; it's not uncommon. But ultimately I want to emphasize that there's still a lot of good people in this space. I've worked with dozens of Vtubers, both indie and corporate, as well as various companies in this space, and a large majority of the time payment is delivered on time."&nbsp;</p><p>Ironmouse, by most accounts, has done her best to make things right. In addition to saying she will help artists get paid, she’s also hosting <a href="https://tiltify.com/@ironmouse/ironmouse" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a Tiltify fundraiser for the Immune Deficiency Foundation</a>, with funds going directly to the organization rather than through an intermediary like VShojo. In <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nathangrayson.bsky.social/post/3lulddzojws2b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just a day</a>, her community raised over $500,000 to cover what VShojo owed. The total now sits at nearly $1.2 million.</p><p>"I don't really have words that can properly express how I feel," Ironmouse <a href="https://x.com/ironmouse/status/1947883998497083855" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote on Twitter</a>. "I feel like saying thank you to everyone is not enough. But thank you all so much for your kindness. My heart is so full it feels like it's going to explode. You all are truly amazing. I'm gonna go cry now."&nbsp;</p><p>With so many Vtubers leaving, VShojo’s future is unclear. But given the reputation of Vtuber agencies large and small for exerting control and, increasingly, failing to provide sufficient benefits in return, some, like <a href="https://x.com/ElaraVtuber" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heavy metal elf and news commentary Vtuber Elara</a>, believe VShojo’s fall could herald a sea change. Indie Vtubers, she believes, are the future.</p><p>“There is a myriad of reasons some Vtubers choose to go corporate,” she told Aftermath. “However the landscape has evolved quite a bit, and I believe we will see the decline of corporate Vtubing as a whole.”</p><p><strong>Update 7/24/25:</strong> VShojo has shut down.</p><p>"VShojo has failed, and I've mismanaged the company into the situation you're all witnessing," CEO Justin "Gunrun" Ignacio said in <a href="https://x.com/VShojo/status/1948442574722924778" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a statement posted to Twitter</a>. "So today I am sharing the difficult news that VShojo is shutting down, and I take full responsibility for the decisions that led us to this point."</p><p>Ignacio said that VShojo raised $11 million to pursue "pursue a bold, talent-first approach in VTubing, prioritizing creators and community over short-term profits, to achieve long-term sustainability," but that ultimately, "we ran out of money."</p><p>He also seemingly took responsibility for misspending the money Ironmouse raised during her 2024 marathon stream.</p><p>"I acknowledge that some of the money spent by the company was raised in connection with talent activity, which I later learned was intended for a charitable initiative," Ignacio wrote. "At the time, we were working hard to raise additional investment capital to cover our costs, and I firmly believed, based on the information available to us, that we would be able to do so and cover all expenses. We were unsuccessful in our fundraising efforts. I made the decision to pursue funding, and I own its consequences."</p><p>"I am deeply sorry to all the talents, staff, friends, and community members who believed in our brand," he concluded. "You did not deserve this."</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/lollipop-chainsaw-game-reboot-anime-woke-nonsense-dei-back-in-my-day"><h3>Let’s All Read A Shitty Video Game Press Release Together</h3></a><p>'The development process will prioritize staying true to the distinctive tone and spirit of the original work, without...'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ridge-racer-4-zine-magazine"><h3>Riiiiidddgggeeee Raaaaccceerrrr Ziiiinnnneeeee</h3></a><p>'A tribute to Namco's Ridge Racer Type 4, the vibiest racing game of all time'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/vice-waypoint-stories-resignations-editor"><h3>This Was Inevitable</h3></a><p>Waypoint 2.0's ordeal is the story of games media in 2025</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/ironmouse-leaves-vshojo-immune-deficiency-foundation-money]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today at San Diego Comic-Con, Critical Role and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1183ce14-1675-44b1-af00-4d7855d7f06c" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/chris-prynoski-talks-drunkards-druggies-and-delinquents-how-420-joke-became" rel="nofollow">Titmouse </a>announced the release date for the first season of <em>The Mighty Nein</em>. An animated TV show based on Critical Role's second streamed campaign focusing on the seven members of <em>The Mighty Nein</em>. The announcement of a <em>Mighty Nein</em> TV show came in early 2023 after reaching success with the first few season of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a49b5305-f71e-4b04-a989-6db6823aa8cc" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/critical-role-and-legend-of-vox-machina-s3-cast-discuss-changing-story" rel="nofollow"><em>The Legend of Vox Machina</em></a>, a similarly animated show based on the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3579fb91-ffa9-4c99-a750-de9f92ba642f" href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> group's first campaign.</p>

<p>The release date for <em>The Mighty Nein</em> on Prime Video will be November 19th. It will be releasing in more than 240 countries and territories worldwide. Alongside the release date announcement, a short sequence from the show was also released showing the majority of the player characters being interrogated. Here we get to see at a glance what each of the characters is about with Beau the monk showing off her guns, Nott the Goblin intoxicated and (poorly) flirting with her interrogator, and Jester being absolutely chaotic.</p>


<p>The description of the show provided reads as:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>The Mighty Nein</em> follows a group of fugitives and outcasts, bound by secrets and scars. But when a powerful arcane relic known as "The Beacon" falls into dangerous hands, they must learn to work together to save the realm and stop reality itself from unraveling.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In addition to the short clip fans were also treated to artwork of the full party of <em>The Mighty Nein</em> including our first look at Yasha, played by Ashley Johnson (The Last of Us Part II).</p>

<p>Interestingly, Mark Strong was credited in an episode of <em>The Legend of Vox Machina</em> for a single episode as an Assembly Mage, this will likely develop into a larger role as Trent Ikithon, a recurring foe for <em>The Mighty Nein.</em></p>

                <p>In June, Capcom announced a second fan-art contest for Street Fighter 6, where artists could submit entries for a chance to have their art inserted into the game for use in the "Here Comes A New Challenger" screen. A winner was chosen for each of the 26 current roster members, but the winning entry for newcomer Kimberly has stirred up some controversy--namely, allegations that the artwork broke the contest's strict "no AI-generated images" policy.</p><p dir="ltr">Via <a href="https://kotaku.com/street-fighter-6-kimberly-ai-art-contest-lilithascends-1851786882" rel="nofollow ">Kotaku</a>, an X user named "hoodratt20xx" put together a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/e/2PACX-1vRuYXWbOATa7jxlopgSXwR41pEHKB14zA0oJYjCnPWYwjuzBSRpBOgAEFyLtGZoNdZqMJHDO6KOiWs3/pub" rel="nofollow ">comprehensive Google Doc</a> of what they think are telltale signs of AI use in the winning Kimberly entry as well as entries for other characters.

                <p>After similar pressure was placed on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steams-updated-guidelines-allow-banks-to-enforce-standards-on-adult-only-content/1100-6533253/" data-ref-id="1100-6533253">Steam</a> just last week, another storefront, Itch.io, has followed suit and culled the vast majority of its adult and sexual content. It cites the efforts of the organization Collective Shout, the same group that also went after Steam, as the primary reason for the removal of said games.</p><p>Rumblings of these removals picked up late on July 23, when creators started noticing that games with NSFW tags had been "shadowbanned" on the platform, while some others noted that their games had been entirely pulled. In the early hours of July 24, Itch.io shared a <a href="https://itch.io/updates/update-on-nsfw-content" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a> confirming the removals and clarifying the circumstances that led to the sweeping changes.</p><p>The statement begins, "We have 'deindexed' all adult NSFW content from our browse and search pages. We understand this action is sudden and disruptive, and we are truly sorry for the frustration and confusion caused by this change."</p><p>It continues, "Recently, we came under scrutiny from our payment processors regarding the nature of some content hosted in Itch.io. Due to a game titled No Mercy, which was temporarily available on Itch.io before being banned back in April, the organization Collective Shout launched a campaign against Steam and Itch.io, directing concerns to our payment processors about the nature of certain content found on both platforms."</p><p>In both situations, Collective Shout seemingly organized against the storefronts by pressuring their payment processors. Earlier this month, the group penned an <a href="https://www.collectiveshout.org/open-letter-to-payment-processors" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">open letter</a> to these companies accusing them of selling games with sexual-abuse material for profit.</p><p>Itch.io's statement suggests that the "situation developed rapidly" and that the company could not realistically have provided advanced notice to affected creators. It also goes on to say that the company is undergoing a "comprehensive audit of content" to make sure that the content on the store is in compliance with terms that will now be set by its payment processors. Moving forward, the pages that had been "deindexed" will remain as such throughout this audit and all future content tagged as NSFW on the platform will have to undergo further verification.</p><p>These changes come as a blow to Itch.io, which has developed a positive reputation among independent developers in recent years as a bastion for adult and queer content including games and zines. Additionally, the platform has famously implemented a "pay what you want" model that has enabled creators to make more profit and raise money for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/no-ice-in-california-bundle-raises-defense-funds-with-560-games-for-10/1100-6533022/" data-ref-id="1100-6533022">charity and humanitarian work</a>.</p><p>In response to Itch.io's sweeping changes though, many of its creators and loudest proponents are currently scrambling and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/magicariot.com/post/3luoubs5gu22s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">weighing their futures</a> on the platform, as well as <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/sjklapecki.itch.io/post/3luohh5kf4s2d" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">organizing against payment processors</a> to push back on bans they feel are unfairly broad.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Ubisoft has revealed the launch date for Assassin’s Creed Shadows' first story expansion. It also detailed other significant updates coming as part of the summer stretch of its <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/30/assassins-creed-shadows-year-1-roadmap-includes-story-expansion-parkour-improvements-new">Year 1 content roadmap</a>.</p><p>Claws of the Awaji, the game’s first big story DLC, is launching on September 16. Set after the conclusion of Shadow’s events (meaning you need to beat the game to unlock it), it centers on Naoe tackling a fresh slate of foes on the new island setting of Awaji. The expansion is touted to feature over 10 hours of content and will be free to players who pre-ordered Shadows. It is unclear how much Claws of Awaji will cost to purchase standalone.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9pIOSHHyhm4?rel=0&amp;controls=0"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9pIOSHHyhm4?rel=0&amp;controls=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>New Game Plus arrives in an update next week on July 29. The mode resets story and objective board progression, but allows players to retain their character level, gear, skill points, knowledge rank, and Hideout progression in a fresh campaign. When starting New Game Plus, players have the option of restarting the story from the very beginning or skipping the prologue and starting when Naoe first acquires the Hideout.</p><p>In terms of progression, the July update also raises the level cap from 60 to 80. New Knowledge Ranks, Mastery, and Knowledge Skill ranks will also be introduced. The Hideout will receive new upgrades, including those for Heiji’s Forge. July 29 will also add Project 3, adding new resources, data files, and exclusive Animus-themed rewards.</p>

<figure><a title="Trails Beyond the Horizon" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/780e82d554eac/trails-beyond-the-horizon.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: NIS America</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-heroes-trails-beyond-the-horizon">Trails Beyond the Horizon</a> has secured a firm release date on Switch 1 and 2, and with the latter console being more powerful, fans should be excited for what will hopefully be a smoother, more-polished release for the latest entry in the Trails series.</p>
<p>However, ever since the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/trails-beyond-the-horizon-slips-to-early-2026-but-its-also-coming-to-switch-2">Switch 2 version's announcement back in June</a>, there's been controversy surrounding it as publisher NIS America confirmed it would be a Game-Key Card release.</p>
<p>So, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/never-in-my-wildest-dreams-would-i-have-expected-this-falcom-president-talks-20-years-of-trails-in-our-big-interview">after our interview with Falcom President Toshihiro Kondo</a> — where representatives of NIS America were present — we asked about why the publisher decided to go with a Game-Key Card release, rather than a full physical version.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067yovlgt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>In a follow-up email, a representative from NIS America responded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We decided to release this title as a Game-Key Card on the Nintendo Switch 2 as we believed it was the most beneficial option for our customers."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We want to clarify that, as far as we can tell, a Japanese Switch 2 release hasn't been confirmed for the game yet. As such, this 'physical' version is only confirmed for the West. Another Falcom game, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ys-x-proud-nordics">Ys X: Proud Nordics</a> — which is currently <em>only</em> confirmed for Japan — is also a Game-Key Card release on Switch 2, though that is being handled by Clouded Leopard Entertainment</p>
<p>Regardless, the above response isn't the answer anyone was looking for, and many have taken to social media to criticise. Especially when the <a href="https://store.nisamerica.com/products/the-legend-of-heroes-trails-beyond-the-horizon?variant=42117184127024">special edition of the Switch 2 release is $10 more expensive than any other version</a>, including the PS5 release.</p>
<p>We've asked NIS America to confirm whether there will be an upgrade path for those who want to buy the full physical Switch 1 release and will update this article when we receive a response.</p>
<figure><a title="Trails Beyond the Horizon Switch 2 Special Edition" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7e119d950bc95/trails-beyond-the-horizon-switch-2-special-edition.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: NIS America</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Game-Key Card releases have gone down like a lead balloon in general, with many refusing to buy them as they're not true physical games — as Nintendo puts it, the cartridge in the box is <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68415/~/nintendo-switch%26nbsp%3B2-game-key-card-overview">"your "key" to downloading the full game to your system via the internet".</a></p>
<p>You only need to connect to the internet the first time you boot up the game, but you will need to pop the Game-Key Card into the Switch 2 to play the game, despite the fact the game isn't on the cartridge.</p>
<p>The Switch 1 version is a full physical, but we have no details on whether there will be the ability to transfer save data between the Switch 1 and 2 versions, <em>or</em> whether there will be an upgrade path for those who want to buy the physical Switch 1 version.</p>
<p>Some publishers, such as Marvelous and CD Projekt Red, have stuck to full physical releases, but many third-party Switch 2 games — like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/bravely-default-flying-fairy-hd-remaster">Bravely Default</a>, and even future releases such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake">Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD Remake</a> — are all Game-Key Cards.</p>
<p><em>Let us know what you think of NIS's decision to make Trails Beyond the Horizon a Game-Key Card release in the comments</em>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i-wish-the-d-d-dragon-delves-adventure-anthology-delved-deeper-into-dragons.1252629/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">As someone who has loved dragons for longer than I can remember, including rocking dragon button-up shirts in high school as my “style” and theming my son’s bedroom around the scaled creatures, I was happy as a wyrm and his hoard when Wizards revealed they were releasing Dragon Delves: Adventure Anthology for Dungeons &amp; Dragons. This collection puts front and center one of the namesakes of the TTRPG, featuring 10 adventures, while also highlighting the legacy of the creatures in this long-running franchise. After peeling back the pages and seeing what it has to offer, I find this book to be a fine addition to my shelf, but I wish it went further to really give these mythical creatures the celebration they deserve.</p><div catalogid="95c08acb-b2b8-42d6-9e49-69e7fa2c79c4" id="225650"><div id="225650" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dragon Delves (D&amp;D Adventure Anthology)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Dragon Delves is a collection of 10 short adventures, each one focused around chromatic (Green, Red, Blue, White, Black) or Metallic (Gold, Silver, Brass, Bronze, Copper) dragons that can be dropped into your existing campaigns or played back-to-back in a campaign that takes players from novice level 1 heroes up to level 12. It would have been nice if the designers offered some manner or tips, or recommendations for GMs to adjust the included quests for higher levels, but worst case, you could always just choose higher level enemies of a similar style, young dragons instead of wyrmlings, for example, to raise the challenge.  There is a good variety of quests in this anthology, from solving mysteries behind corruption, sentient bags of holding, or uncovering forgotten verses of a song, but all of them will, at some point, have you and your party cross paths with a dragon. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">All but one really hit for me. The one that didn't is the Gold Dragon’s adventure, “Baker’s Doesn't,” which involves a golden dragon named Briochebane that bakes bread, and has the party dealing with animated candy creations and visiting places like Candied Apple Orchards and Taffy Factories. Outlandish and silly in TTRPGs isn’t an automatic turn-off for me. Hell, in my own homebrew campaign, the party encountered an island of sentient vegetables and took a cauliflower puppy back with them. But in the scheme of Dragon Delves, this quest just doesn’t feel like it belongs among quests like “Death at Sunset” or “Shivering Death”. That said, its whimsical nature could be perfect for a little jaunt in the Feywild or to add a bit of levity to your campaign after an emotionally-packed couple of sessions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This book's real strength is how easy it makes it to drop the adventures into a campaign. Each of the 10 stories has been designed to last only one or two sessions, with the first page of each one providing simple and clear directions on where these can be dropped in, the level of characters it is for, the general plot points, how to prepare, and what state blocks you will need.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This book's real strength is how easy it makes it to drop the adventures into a campaign.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">For example, the Silver Dragon’s “The Will of Orcus” adventure states, “It can take place anywhere there are mountains and settlements,” and is for level 4 characters. All of those important bits of information you need can be gleaned from just a quick glance. As a GM, the faster I can get the info, the better, and I think the layout and design are wonderfully done here in Dragon Delves (and honestly, all of the updated <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-dungeons-and-dragons-books">2025 5th edition books</a>). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">One thing of note, while this anthology contains the details of the adventures, it does <em>not</em> have any stat blocks for the creatures, so whoever is running these will also need the Monster Manual (<a href="https://zdcs.link/QObWlM?object_uuid=450dc3bd-3d44-47f6-b69a-cf14e99c5ce7&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">see it at Amazon</a>) – either 5th Edition book will suffice. The fact that this book doesn’t contain any unique stat blocks is a bit of a bummer. I would have loved to have blocks for each of the 10 dragons that are the focus of each one, which would give them something slightly unique or tweaked from their stock counterparts in the Monster Manual. Also, where are my updated gem dragons at, Wizards?!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to the quests, this book also showcases how the visuals and designs of each dragon have evolved over the course of Dungeons &amp; Dragons' nearly five-decade-long lifespan. I appreciate the two-page spread of artwork, but when I heard that this book would also showcase the history of the dragon types, I expected more. I would have loved to see blurbs from Wizards’ designers on how, if any, the approach and gameplay design of the various types have shifted or changed over the years. How has Wizards approached its stat blocks, or despite “dragons” being in the franchise's name, why is the team as reserved in showcasing or highlighting them? Much of this art I could obtain simply by searching Google; give me the information or material that has been hoarded away in the Wizards’ vaults. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether they are spewing acid, lightning, or breathing the more traditional fire, dragons have been, and always will be, really, really cool. There is a reason that these scaled creatures have become so closely ingrained and intertwined with the fantasy genre. Dragon Delves: Adventure Anthology gives players some relatively quick outings to enjoy and drop into their story whenever parties have a hankering for some dragon goodness. That said, this book never reached the heights of excitement I had imagined when I first heard about it. The fact that it relies solely on the basic stat blocks from the Monster Manual and there aren’t any fun adventures for higher-level parties is a bit disappointing. The fact that Tiamat, arguably the most recognizable dragon in Dungeons &amp; Dragons, is absent is also a strange omission.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dragon Devles comes off more as a great introductory package for dragons, and for newer or younger players just <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-to-play-dungeons-and-dragons">learning how to play D&amp;D</a>, it's a fun collection of quick stories. But for more experienced players, or those hoping for setups for big confrontations with some ancient dragons, you may want to look elsewhere. Personally, I was hoping for and expecting more, but hopefully this anthology just marks the beginning of more dragon-centric books and campaigns to come.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em> Scott White is a freelance contributor to IGN, assisting with tabletop games and guide coverage.

The drop to the next layer is hidden in a building that DK can actually clip into under the right circumstances. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIvPjCDwvLU" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This video</a> shows the trick in action, but it essentially involves hanging from a pipe close to a barred window into the building, and rapidly entering and exiting Photo Mode to get DK to clip through the bars and into the room with the hole. This works regardless of whether DK has Pauline or not, which means DK and Odd Rock can journey to the next layer together without progressing the story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately for Odd Rock lovers out there, you can't actually progress the game much farther this way. The next sublayer is a boss fight arena, and while you can collect a few Banandium Gems in there with Odd Rock's support, the boss won't actually spawn if you don't have Pauline with you. Weirdly, you will hear a bit of Pauline's (not Odd Rock's) dialogue as you approach the arena, but with no boss to fight there's also no way to manifest the big hole in the ground that leads to the next main layer. So you're soft locked until you go back and properly get Pauline.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Donkey Kong Bananza Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, knowing how fast speedrunners work at breaking these things, I wouldn't be surprised if we hear about them solving this new problem sometime soon and doing something that results in some crazy no-Pauline tricks, or maybe even ways to skip Odd Rock entirely. After all, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom runners <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-speedrunner-finds-a-way-to-play-as-link">figured out how to play as Link instead of Zelda</a>.

As our reviewer said, "Donkey Kong Bananza is a truly groundbreaking 3D platformer, with satisfying movement, powerful abilities, impressive destructible environments, and clever challenges that all come together in complete harmony to create Nintendo’s first Switch 2 masterpiece."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you, like us, can't get enough of Bananza, we have plenty of walkthroughs to aid your journey underground, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/donkey-kong-bananza/Banandium_Gems_(Banana_Locations)">Banandium Gem locations</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/donkey-kong-bananza/Essential_Tips_to_Get_Started">starter tips and tricks</a>, and a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/donkey-kong-bananza/Walkthrough">full walkthrough</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Though EA website suggests October 10 launch.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The official <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> official reveal trailer has debuted in a cacophony of explosions, but wrapped up without providing the game's release date. Instead, today's look simply ended with word of a <em>further </em>reveal next week — this time of the game's multiplayer modes — on July 31.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, for Battlefield fans, today's big reveal provided some welcome reassurance that series staples such as large-scale destruction and vehicle-based combat featuring planes, trucks and tanks would once again return. We also got to see at least three helicopters crash in under three minutes. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But today's trailer did not include confirmation of the game's now-leaked release date. As IGN reported this morning, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-will-release-in-october-for-80-leak-suggests-and-theres-an-open-beta-coming-too">Battlefield 6 is widely-expected to arrive on October 10</a> — something that eagle-eyed fans have now seen is backed up by the game's own <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/game-disclaimers" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">terms and conditions on EA's website</a>, which note that date as when the game's pre-launch offers will end. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Instead, today's trailer was focused on Battlefield 6's campaign. Picking up on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-campaign-teaser-shows-nato-under-attack-and-includes-the-return-of-the-series-classic-theme">yesterday's tease of a new global mercenary group, Pax Armata</a>, which has threatened the world and targeted NATO, this fresh trailer saw the US fighting back amid attacks on its own soil. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"For the Pax Armata mercenaries who are watching now, I have a message," the US president states, after nervously stepping up to the White House podium. "It's over."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After a lengthy development and an array of development studios working on the project, it was intriguing to see Battlefield 6's first proper trailer begin with a nervous-sounding US leader behind the microphone. For him, as with EA itself, this is something of a big moment. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/24/867-battlefield-6-official-reveal-trailer-00-01-46-1753371781562.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">A character that looks very similar to actor Tony Curran. Image credit: EA</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Quick shots of warfare across an array of countries follow, including explosions around New York's Brooklyn Bridge, dozens of soldiers leaving a mountainous airbase, fighter jets flying over snow-capped peaks, and tanks rolling out across a desert.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans of Battlefield's big destructive setpieces get to see a huge dam being exploded, Brooklyn Bridge being exploded, and a skyscraper being exploded. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also a few quick shots of a character that looks to be played by Daredevil and Doctor Who actor Tony Curran. He looks grizzled, angry, and holds a knife. I think he's a bad guy?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In recent months, footage of Battlefield 6 from various closed playtests has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/psa-early-battlefield-6-footage-seems-to-have-leaked-online">started leaking online,</a> showing the game's modern setting, various firefights, destructible environments, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-the-improvements-and-features-revealed-by-the-battlefield-6-gameplay-leaks">quality of life improvements</a>, and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-battlefield-leak-reveals-extremely-brief-look-at-the-start-of-a-battle-royale-match-as-ea-issues-takedowns">start of a battle royale match</a>. Presumably we'll get to see more of all this next week — and maybe even official confirmation of that release date.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
