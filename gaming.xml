                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a>'s major 11.2 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-the-war-withins-ghosts-of-karesh-update-is-the-tbc-sequel-we-didnt-know-we-needed/1100-6532500/" data-ref-id="1100-6532500">Ghosts of K'aresh update</a> will add a highly-requested feature fans have been waiting years for–the ability to lean.</p><p dir="ltr">Yes, as spotted by <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/news/new-lean-emote-on-patch-11-2-ptr-377340" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wowhead</a>, the /lean emote is finally being added to Blizzard's MMORPG. It's the first major emote addition since 2008, when a large list of emotes were added as part of the game's Wrath of the Lich King expansion.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CE8zcDHcMA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2CE8zcDHcMA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Lean is something players, and particularly roleplayers, have wanted for quite some time, as the ability for NPC characters to lean against terrain was added during 2018's Battle for Azeroth expansion. In 11.2, characters can use the lean emote to prop up against a wall and give off that oh-so-important mysterious adventurer vibe or practice being a mime and just lean in mid-air against nothing at all.</p><p dir="ltr">When compared to all the major new content coming with the Ghosts of K'aresh update, including a new upgradeable artifact cloak, the Ecological Succession world activity, and an encounter against a Stormwind city-sized raid boss (the biggest boss in WoW's history, according to Blizzard), the addition of a new emote doesn't sound like a big deal. It is, however, a major win for the game's roleplayers, a community within WoW that Blizzard has stated (like in this <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-at-20-is-the-same-and-increasingly-unrecognizable-and-thats-by-design/1100-6527983/" data-ref-id="1100-6527983">interview about WoW's 20th anniversary</a>) it is looking to do more for. Maybe players will get fully-animated hugs or high-fives next?</p><p dir="ltr">While it's the first time in a long time Blizzard has added an emote, it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-patch-9-1-5-will-remove-or-change-a-long-list-of-crude-emotes/1100-6496685/" data-ref-id="1100-6496685">changed or removed some emotes entirely in 2021</a> in the wake of a state of California lawsuit that was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-blizzard-will-pay-54-million-to-california-after-settling-lawsuit/1100-6520018/" data-ref-id="1100-6520018">later settled</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard, however, took various steps in its games while the lawsuit was still ongoing to make its communities more welcoming, including in WoW. Emotes like /kick, /moan, /rear, /smell and others were removed entirely, while some, like /drool and /whistle, were made so they could no longer target specific players.</p><p dir="ltr">The new lean emote is just one of Ghosts of K'aresh's new social features, as the update will also add <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-next-major-update-will-add-one-of-dark-souls-most-innovative-features/1100-6532496/" data-ref-id="1100-6532496">Dark Souls'-like asynchronous multiplayer functions</a> to WoW's endgame Delves. WoW's 11.2 update does not yet have a release date and isn't yet available for testing on the game's public test realm, but players are already theorizing based on datamining that a new Void-themed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-players-are-convinced-a-new-way-to-play-demon-hunter-is-coming-soon/1100-6532569/" data-ref-id="1100-6532569">Demon Hunter specialization</a> could be coming soon.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>I'm here to tell you that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-world/">Mario Kart World</a>'s free-roam mode is great when there isn't someone yapping in your ear about how "bad" and "empty" it is.</p><p dir="ltr">Since its release a few weeks ago alongside the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-review-its-a-switch-too/1100-6532411/">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, the latest installment in the vaunted kart-racing series has had a few more ups and downs than expected. For all the praise the game has accrued--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mario-kart-world-review/1900-6418371/">it received a 9 from GameSpot's Steve Watts</a>--Mario Kart World has also gotten its fair share of knocks and detractors, and a great deal of the criticism that's been aimed at it recently has centered on its free-roam mode. Those criticisms claim that the mode (and the world it makes available to players) is largely barren and what activities do fill it are lackluster.</p><p dir="ltr">For the uninitiated, Mario Kart World's free-roam mode drops players onto the large interconnected roadways of the newest game. If a player wanted to, they could drive from Acorn Heights, the northernmost track in the game, all the way down to Dino Dino Jungle at the southern tip of the continent. All the while, they can zoom past Toads in cars, buses, and trucks on the highways that connect these courses to one another. Along the way, there are even P-Switches that toggle challenges and races, warp pipes that transport players to hidden rooms, collectable Peach medallions in out-of-the-way spots, and stickers to collect to garnish your player profile. It's simple, uncomplicated, and nice. The mode is exactly what it's been billed as, and I cannot really understand the heat it's getting.</p><p dir="ltr">While I've been basking in all free-roam has to offer, I'll be the first to admit that there isn't much else going on here. Challenges can often be pretty mindless, and while some can exasperate, most are over in a flash. The rewards for finding Peach medallions and question block panels are trivial and insignificant in the grand scheme of the game. Roaming around freely can feel like the gaming equivalent of consuming empty calories, and I recognize how this chafes against the expectations of players being dropped into a huge in-game world in 2025. But I think the fact that Mario Kart World's free-roam does away with the excess and frills is precisely the point of the mode, and it does my head in that there is an audience out there that isn't connecting with it because they want something else. This isn't the next Forza Horizon game, whose map will be dotted with countless side activities and missions for the player to do. It's Mario Kart World, and it's doing things its own way.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4518313-img_1392.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4518313" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4518313-img_1392.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4518313"></a><figcaption>Mario Kart World's free-roam mode features Rosalina's tour bus company and more.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4518313-img_1392.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">I think there's a clear distinction between the notion of a video game with a "free-roam" mode, which is what's on offer in Mario Kart World, and an "open-world" game, a phrase that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-is-not-an-open-world-game-nintendo-says/1100-6532034/">Nintendo has explicitly stated it avoided</a> invoking throughout the game's development. The latter is a game like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild or Cyberpunk 2077, which are entirely different experiences you can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-nintendo-switch-2-games/2900-6618/">also get on the Switch 2</a>. Hell, if we want to pit Mario Kart World against a proper open-world racing game, look no further than Forza Horizon 5. There are hundreds of other examples that you could find to fit that mold across gaming's history, but that won't change the core argument here: Mario Kart World is not an open-world game, and we're better off leaving it that way than arguing for it to become something it was never meant to be.</p><p dir="ltr">I say this because I've relished the quiet nights that I've squeezed out of Mario Kart World's free-roam mode. I've never taken a proper road trip, but I imagine the ability to make that space for peace and quiet is what it's all about. I've been conjuring those very vibes on the regular by aimlessly hitting the open road in World, going wherever it may take me, and taking pictures of the charming little world Nintendo has spun from this historic franchise. This is a place where I can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-a-silly-sketch-led-to-cow-becoming-a-pivotal-character-in-mario-kart-world/1100-6531712/">play as a cow</a>, pick up a burger from a fast-food restaurant operated by Yoshi, and park next to a Shy Guy seated on a bench. It's a world with hitchhiking Toads, random campsites, and a tour bus company apparently run by Rosalina. Some guy on the internet <a href="https://butwhytho.net/2025/04/mario-kart-world-nintendo-switch-2/" rel="nofollow ">claims there are UFOs</a> to be found in free-roam, and others are taking over semi-trucks and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@tahk0_/video/7516248904929725727?q=mario%20kart%20world%20area%2051&amp;t=1750311855590" rel="nofollow ">storming the gates of an in-game Area 51</a>. Sometimes, enjoying games means taking it on its own terms and appreciating the tiniest of moments and details, or just making your own fun, rather than expecting it to deliver some huge creative swings.</p><p dir="ltr">To that end, free-roam also allows me to sidestep the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/these-mario-kart-world-tips-could-help-you-win-more-races/1100-6532281/">frankly ridiculously competitive nature</a> of Mario Kart World--which is more intense than it has ever been, thanks to a slew of new advanced maneuvers--and explore the sights of magnificent locales like I've never been able to before. Go to the Great ? Block Ruins in free-roam and really take in the view of the dilapidated skyscraper-sized block. Try to make sense of it, and if you can't, just bask in it. I know I sure did.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4518315-img_1393.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4518315" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4518315-img_1393.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4518315"></a><figcaption>Sometimes, free-roam mode is perfect for a chill, late night drive.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4518315-img_1393.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">I'm sure I'll be called a mark or some kind of Nintendo apologist, but the simple truth is this: Mario Kart World fully delivers on a vibes-based free-roam mode, and I prefer that to any of the half-dozen overstuffed open-world titles available at any given moment. And hey, I love some of those games quite a lot, but a break from them is just as welcome as having more of them to play. Games that big can feel grand and adventurous to start before devolving into laborious trudges and when everything is an open-world RPG, it begins to feel like nothing is special. It's rare then to get a marquee title from a major developer and publisher like Nintendo that does away with the excess and cuts right to the chase, making Mario Kart World a breath of fresh air. Y'know, through the scent of exhaust fumes and Yoshi burgers.</p><p dir="ltr">Moreover, what else might you possibly want or need from an open-world Mario Kart game that you can't already get in the larger package of World? If you want to race, hit a grand prix or Knockout match. Want some challenges? Well, free-roam's already got those in spades, but there's an additional set of Time Trials that have long been a staple in the series. Want some competition? Go online and do some good ol' fashioned versus battles. If you want collectibles, the game's already got 'em!</p><p dir="ltr">When you really think about it, what's an actionable feature that could tangibly make Mario Kart's free-roam a richer experience? Side quests? Possible interactions with roaming NPCs? One-on-one races with rivals? I can see some of that working in this game, but by and large, I don't think any of it is the silver-bullet fix that'll enrich Mario Kart World for the players disgruntled by its implementation of free-roam. I think what they might be looking for is simply a different kind of game.</p><p>So yes, Mario Kart World's free-roam mode is not the most robust offering. If you come to it expecting the next great open-world title, you're likely to be sorely disappointed. What you get instead is so much better though, so much more <em>freeing</em>, and in a field awash with overstuffed and overstimulating titles around every corner, I'm grateful that Mario Kart World eschews those trends and stays in its own lane where it (and I) remain unbothered.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We’ve seen enough: In the race between <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/01/26/cuomo-sexual-harassment-doj-00138140" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a sexual harasser</a> who <a href="https://hellgatenyc.com/cuomo-deranged-parking-job-speeding-tickets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">parks bad</a> (and is <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/05/landlord-lobby-will-boost-cuomo-with-2-5m-spend-00389886" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in bed with the landlord lobby</a>), a guy who smiles maybe a little too much but wants to <a href="https://jacobin.com/2025/05/mamdani-affordable-new-york-mayor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">make NYC cheaper</a>, and some other people, we – a video game website mysteriously and perhaps ominously followed by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Bluesky – are officially endorsing Zohran Mamdani for mayor.</p><p>You might find this to be unusual; after all, has any other video game publication ever endorsed a political candidate? But I assure you, it makes a certain kind of sense considering that a) four of Aftermath’s five founders are based in New York City, and b) the office of current <a href="https://defector.com/the-most-unbelievable-bits-from-nyc-mayor-eric-adamss-indictment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">disgraced clown mayor Eric Adams</a> has actually made an effort where video games are concerned, alongside <a href="https://esd.ny.gov/industries/digital-game-development" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a push from New York state</a> that includes $25 million in tax credits for projects made in New York.</p><p>In 2022, the Mayor’s Office of Media and Entertainment <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/306-22/mayor-adams-takes-steps-transform-new-york-city-global-hub-digital-games-industry#/0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">established</a> a Game Development Industry Council that included figures from Microsoft, Take-Two, Avalanche Studios, Games for Change, Game Developers of Color Expo, NYU Game Center, and Zynga. It also funded a $2 million bachelor’s game design degree program with the goal of, <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-york-city-nyc-eric-adams-bachelor-s-degree-game-dev-1848933337" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as Adams put it</a>, helping NYC “level up and finally become a leader in the digital gaming space.” There have been <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/mome/news/12032024-minecraft-battle-of-the-boroughs.page" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiple</a> <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/mome/news/02082024-battle-of-the-boroughs.page" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mayoral <em>Minecraft </em>tournaments</a> for students with the goal of “addressing climate change while continuing to make our city the digital gaming capital of the world.” </p><p>This year, the Mayor’s Office also <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/mome/news/05282025-nyc-video-game-festival.page" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hosted an inaugural NYC Video Game Festival</a> in May to kick off “NYC Summer of Games,” a series of gaming-related expos, tournaments, exhibits, workshops and programs across the city. A lot of them are events that happen every summer anyway, but now there’s an umbrella over them.&nbsp;</p><p>Of the NYC Video Game Festival, our own Riley MacLeod, who was in attendance, says: “I caught the high school finals for the <em>Minecraft</em> tournament, where teams from a school in each of the boroughs had to build an environmentally-friendly version of Ellis Island and then give a presentation on it. As someone who’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/writing-tests-math" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">worked in education and on educational games</a>, I thought it was actually really cool; it was fascinating to see what each team did and how they presented their design. Also, the emcee kept shushing the audience <em>just</em> like a teacher, which I found hilarious.”</p><p>Neither Mamdani nor Cuomo have spent much time outlining their plans in this regard (Aftermath reached out to the campaigns of both to learn more, but did not receive a reply as of this publishing), but Mamdani <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7ThzwqHprA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">collaborated with leftist Twitch politics king Hasan “HasanAbi” Piker</a> earlier this year – and hilariously kept doxxing the duo because he couldn’t stop enthusing about specific NYC locations – while Cuomo, back in 2016 when he was governor of New York, <a href="https://www.pressconnects.com/story/news/local/new-york/2016/11/29/cuomo-music-video-games/94625582/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blocked a bill</a> that would have created $50 million a year in tax credits for those who produce music or video games.</p><p>What really cinches it, though, is simple economics: If, per <a href="https://www.zohranfornyc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mamdani’s plan</a>, rent is frozen, buses and childcare are free, and city-owned grocery stores bring down the price of food, New Yorkers will have more money left over to buy video games. Potentially a lot more. That makes him The Gamer Mayor, as far as I’m concerned. Given whose pocket Cuomo is in, the city will likely become more expensive on his watch, not less. And with <a href="https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/video-game-prices-might-increase-this-year-heres-why-i-dont-mind-paying-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">video game prices going up</a>, that's the last thing New Yorkers need. </p><p>Oh, and on top of landlords, Cuomo is <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/18/bloomberg-donation-cuomo-super-pac-00413966" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">being bankrolled</a> by billionaires, real estate and finance execs, and Donald Trump supporters – to the tune of over $8 million, which he's spending on smear ads. At this point, we're almost more in the territory of a Cuomo anti-endorsement than anything else, but <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/new-york-times-leads-the-movement-to-stop-zohran-mamdani.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">if the New York Times can do it</a>, so can we. Also, I don’t think Cuomo even knows what Twitch is.</p><p>This does not, however, mean that Mamdani has Aftermath’s unilateral support in perpetuity. Even with a winning grin and the miraculous ability to, for example, talk with their hands endlessly and somehow not annoy me, politicians are not our friends. The second they take office, it is our job to hold them accountable. If they step out of line – if they go against the will of the people who elected them – they should not know a moment’s peace. Inevitably, because our political system is little more than a series of corrupt backroom handshakes, Mamdani will fail us one day. Maybe it will be over something relatively small, or maybe he’ll reveal himself to be a different person than we all thought he was. Regardless, while it will be tempting to parasocially leap to the defense of the nice man from all the videos, that won’t help anybody. Politics is neither a game nor a popularity contest; it’s a fight.

                <p>Easily one of the most useful items in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/" data-ref-id="5000-73990">Minecraft </a>is the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-make-a-compass-in-minecraft/1100-6524852/" data-ref-id="1100-6524852">compass</a>. Crafting one will point to your world spawn point, helping out if you find yourself lost during your adventures in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-survival-games/2900-5289/" data-ref-id="2900-5289">survival game</a>.</p><p>However, compasses become obsolete if your base isn't anywhere near the world spawn point. Sure, you can use <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-minecraft-cheats-and-console-commands/1100-6531935/" data-ref-id="1100-6531935">Minecraft console commands</a> to change the spawn point if you're the Minecraft server owner, or have admin permissions, but if that does not apply to you, you'll want to learn about how lodestones can alter the direction a compass points. That's where we come in.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4517822-lodestones.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4517822" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4517822-lodestones.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4517822"></a><figcaption>A lodestone in the overworld</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4517822-lodestones.jpg"></figure><p>Lodestones alter the place that your compass points to. It can also be used in the Nether, the End, and the overworld, whereas compasses only usually work in the overworld. Lodestones in the real world are naturally-occurring magnets, and rare to find.</p><h2>How to find a lodestone</h2><p>You can find lodestones in chests in bastion remnants, but you can also craft them. To create your own, place one iron ingot in the center of your crafting table, surrounded by chiseled stone bricks. It used to be more expensive to craft a lodestone, as instead of one iron ingot, a netherite ingot was required.</p><h2>How to use a lodestone</h2><p>Once you have your lodestone block, place it on the ground where you want the compass to point towards, take out your compass, and use it on the block. The compass will get the same sheen as enchanted armor gets, so you'll know whether it's worked or not.</p><p>If the lodestone is broken or in a different dimension than the compass, the compass will randomly spin. If the lodestone is destroyed while its paired compass is in a chest or storage item, then the compass will not register that the lodestone is destroyed until it is retrieved. Placing a lodestone back in the exact place as the original lodestone will prevent unpairing in this situation.</p><p>For more tips and hints, visit our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-guides-hub/1100-6526408/" data-ref-id="1100-6526408">Minecraft guides hub</a>.</p>

"Launching FBC: Firebreak is a significant milestone for us, not just because it’s our first online co-op game, but because we’ve self-published it as well. Several things have gone well. Clearly, not everything has."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> FBC: Firebreak – Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Remedy released a patch today that including UI fixes and changes to how much unlockables costs. The studio re-organized unlockables into two categories: operational requisitions and essentials. Operational requisitions now include only cosmetics like sprays and armor sets while essentials includes gear and weapons. Essentials are now easier to unlock, according to the studio.</p><p>Remedy also detailed how they plan to change the "games' first hours" by better communicating how the crisis kits work and giving players better information on what to do within each mission. In addition, Remedy is giving new players deeper access to each job right off the bat, instead of limiting them to lower difficulties at the start.</p><p>The studio said it had been breaking down data and have more ideas on how to improve the overall experience but will need more time to execute.</p><p>"Today’s patch is just the beginning," the studio wrote. "These are some of the most immediate changes, but we are actively discussing and planning broader improvements to the game based on what we are hearing and seeing."</p><p>FBC: Firebreak was highly anticipated by fans of the Finnish studio, especially after strong showings with single-player adventures like Control and Alan Wake 2. While the gameplay is enjoyable, the number of problems quickly piled up. Many are still hopeful that Remedy can turn FBC: Firebreak into a fun and satisfying experience.</p><p>"As the game has launched on two different subscription services, I expect some players will likely try it, only to be quickly turned away by a subpar first impression and write Firebreak off without the lack of investment that might keep them around for longer," Mark Delaney wrote in his <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/fbc-firebreak-review-controlled-chaos/1900-6418376/#:~:text=Firebreak%20is%20a%20first-person,distance%2C%20and%20a%20lot%20more." data-ref-id="1900-6418376">GameSpot FBC:Firebreak review</a>. "Hopefully, those who enjoy co-op PvE games do stick around past the early roughness, because there's something really fun to uncover. Sometimes the game gets in its own way by not tutorializing key points, like how to best deal with status effects and play roles dependably. But once you've gained that institutional knowledge, FBC: Firebreak is an enjoyably chaotic power fantasy, and an interesting experiment for Remedy between its bigger, weirder projects."</p>

            <p>
If you've been considering taking <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a> for another spin (or even a first spin) but want to do it on device small enough you could feasibly play it while, say, spelunking, there's some good news: the "reimagined" mobile version of developer ZA/UM Studio's acclaimed RPG comes to Android devices on 5th August. And if you still need some convincing it'll work on a smaller device, there's even more good news, as the first two chapters are free.
</p>
<p>
Disco Elysium - a sort of hard-boiled noir mystery presented using the conventions of a CRPG - tells the story of an amnesiac, alcoholic detective attempting to solve a murder while in the throes of existential crisis. And Eurogamer contributor Edwin Evans-Thirwell enjoyed its verbose, improbably deep psychodrama enough that he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-of-the-year-2019-disco-elysium-is-about-outliving-history">named it one of his faves of 2019</a>.
</p>
<p>
And Edwin is far from its only fan. But ZA/UM - a troubled studio that's been involved an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-studio-says-lawsuits-from-former-members-have-been-resolved">absolute mess of litigation and finger-pointing</a> since Disco Elysium's release - didn't exactly impress when it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-is-being-reimagined-for-mobile-devices-to-captivate-the-tiktok-user">announced a "reimagined" mobile adaptation earlier this year</a>. "We intend to captivate the TikTok user with quick hits of compelling story, art, and audio, ultimately creating an all new, deeply engaging form of entertainment," is how studio head Denis Havel put it.

In truth, though, the reality doesn't seem anywhere near as dubious; essentially, ZA/UM has ditched the original's isometric gameplay in favour of an approach somewhat closer to a visual novel, where players swipe through dialogue options presented against bold 2D artwork. The idea, the studio says, is to create an experience specifically tailored toward "short play sessions that should easily fit into your life". Such as, say, when you're spelunking.
</p>
<p>
When Disco Elysium's mobile version "debuts" for Android on 5th August (suggesting an iOS release may follow), it'll <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ZAUM.M0_stable&amp;pli=1">cost £9.99/€9.99/$9.99 USD</a>. But if you're not entirely sold on the idea of ZA/UM's reimagining, you'll be able to play the first two chapters for free.
</p>
<p>
As to what ZA/UM is doing next, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-studio-zaums-new-rpg-c4-is-part-espionage-thriller-part-psychedelic-sci-fi">that'll be C4</a>, a new RPG described as being "part espionage thriller, part psychedelic sci-fi". Meanwhile, a whole bunch of former staff (many who split acrimoniously) have announced new projects in a similar vein to Disco Elysium.
</p>
<p>
Over in the UK, there's Dark Math Games and Longdue - two studios comprised of former ZA/UM developers that both announced Disco Elysium spiritual successors last year. Longdue is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-disco-elysium-alumni-join-former-staff-at-longdue-working-on-spiritual-successor">working on a "psychogeographic RPG" it's now unveiled as Hopetown</a>, while Dark Math is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/detective-rpg-in-the-works-from-breakaway-group-of-former-disco-elysium-developers">developing a detective RPG called XXX Nightshift</a>. Additionally, former Disco Elysium writer Argo Tuulik has also announced a new RPG, being <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-former-zaum-devs-have-set-up-another-studio-but-they-are-definitely-not-working-on-a-disco-elysium-sequel">made at his Summer Eternal studio</a>. And finally, Disco Elysium lead writer Robert Kurvitz and art director Aleksander Rostov have also set up their own studio, and were previously said to be making a game with backing from NetEase.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Final Fantasy XVI just recently arrived on <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-xbox-series-x-720p-performance/">Xbox Series consoles</a>, which means that it's now available to play on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC, with Nintendo still left out of the equation. At least, for now, as series producer at Square Enix, Naoki Yoshida and creative director Kazutoyo Maehiro seem to have just dropped a hint that FFXVI could be coming to the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>Spotted and translated by a user on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/switch-2-port-of-ffxvi-hinted-at-by-naoki-yoshida-and-kazutoyo-maehiro.1224171/">ResetEra</a>, in the most recent 'Letter from the Producer' live stream video for Final Fantasy XIV, towards the end of the stream, as Yoshida and Maehiro are discussing what players can look forward to in the world of Final Fantasy, such as FFXVI coming to Xbox, they joke that Nintendo is the only platform left out, to which Maehiro says he "<em>will do his best</em>."</p>
<p><iframe title="FINAL FANTASY XIV Letter from the Producer LIVE Part LXXXVII" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zg-LRoukGVo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>At face value, this is a joke between friends and co-workers, and is in no way an official confirmation that Final Fantasy XVI is coming to Switch 2. But it's not the first time a Switch 2 port of Final Fantasy XVI has been brought up.</p>
<p>There were rumblings about <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/much-requested-square-enix-ports-will-finally-be-announced-for-xbox-and-switch-2-its-claimed/">XVI coming to Switch 2 at the beginning of this year</a>, and now that we know Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade is coming to Switch 2, there have <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-director-hints-the-entire-remake-trilogy-could-be-coming-to-switch-2/">been hints that the rest of that trilogy is coming to Switch 2 as well</a>.</p>
<p>Seeing Final Fantasy XVI on the Nintendo Switch is a pipe dream that was probably never going to happen, but if Final Fantasy VII Remake can work on the Switch 2, and maybe even the rest of the series, than so could Final Fantasy XVI.</p>
<p>Of course, if it won't look like it does on your PC, PS5, or Xbox Series device, but seeing a successful port of the game would be another example of how much more is possible on the Nintendo Switch 2 than its predecessor.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Junior additionally mentioned Dune: Awakening will receive new PvE maps for players to explore in the future, though it's unclear if these would be included for free as a major update or come in the form of a paid expansion.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the more immediate future, Junior said an update is coming in early July that will contain "too many" quality-of-life changes to list. Junior didn't go into detail on what those changes would be, but said to expect the patch notes when the patch is closer to being ready for testing.</p><p dir="ltr">Funcom dove into plenty of other topics as part of the AMA, ranging from plans to make it so players can name storage containers and vehicles to its thoughts on potential changes to Dune: Awakening's PvP-focused endgame. Many of players' complaints are focused around the heavy reliance on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-unlock-craft-and-repair-all-dune-awakening-vehicles/1100-6532312/" data-ref-id="1100-6532312">vehicles</a> in the game's endgame Deep Desert zone, so much so that PvP encounters are largely between flying Ornithopters rather than on-foot encounters where the game's melee and firearms can come into play. When asked about the potential of a Deep Desert zone where only ground vehicles would be allowed, creative director Joel Bylos shot down the idea but did say Funcom is looking to make some changes.</p><p dir="ltr">"The current balance between vehicles and on-foot is not tuned to our liking and there are multiple changes in the pipeline to address this," Bylos said.</p><p dir="ltr">Other additions players can expect in Dune: Awakening's future based on Funcom's Reddit answers include an option to duel other players, a deposit all option for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-ways-to-get-blood-and-water-in-dune-awakening/1100-6532157/" data-ref-id="1100-6532157">water</a>, changes to the endgame PvE Landsraad system, additional contracts to complete, and a third faction that "will change the entire dynamic" of the Landsraad, according to Bylos.</p><p dir="ltr">Dune: Awakening is finding major success on Steam, having <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-awakening-is-the-lisan-al-gaib-of-dune-games-as-steam-concurrents-top-140000/1100-6532344/" data-ref-id="1100-6532344">surpassed 140,000 concurrent players</a>.

World has been pulling in a peak of at least 25,000 players each day this week while Wilds has not broken the 23,000 player mark in that same period. Fans of the series are going back to World after being disappointed by the endgame content and performance issues in Wilds.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Monster Hunter Wilds Review</p>
      </div>
<p>Players have been sounding off about Monster Hunter Wilds' performance issues and other problems via Steam's review system. Many of the reviews cite frame rate issues, an unsatisfactory story, not enough endgame content, and a few go as far to say the game will no longer start on their computers.</p><p>Capcom brought new content to Monster Hunter World for two years after it was released. While it did have some performance issues, players never criticized the game as harshly on Steam. Monster Hunter Wilds is scheduled to be part of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/capcom-will-show-off-more-of-resident-evil-requiem-in-a-showcase-next-week/1100-6532567/" data-ref-id="1100-6532567">Capcom Spotlight</a> showcase stream next week where the publisher will show off an upcoming update. Players are hoping for some big additions to endgame content and upgrades to how the game runs on PC.</p><p>"Capcom understands the value of throwing you into one climactic battle after another in what would be a set-piece boss fight in almost any other game," Richard Wakeling wrote in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/monster-hunter-wilds-review-new-frontier/1900-6418338/" data-ref-id="1900-6418338">GameSpots Monster Hunter Wilds review</a> at the beginning of 2024. "Monster Hunter Wilds suffers from some performance issues, the environments are often bland, and the story feels superfluous, but when you're face-to-face with a fearsome monster, few situations are quite as riveting. Monster Hunter Wilds may only make iterative improvements to further refine the formula, but that's all it really needed to do."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>It’s summer gaming showcase season, and the minds behind Little Nightmares are getting in on the fun by announcing a dedicated presentation for the franchise. The Little Nightmares Showcase has been revealed for next week and will likely have an update on the upcoming third entry.</p><p>All we know about the showcase for now is that it airs on June 24 at 12 p.m. PT/3 p.m. ET. The news was shared by the Little Nightmares III <a href="https://x.com/LittleNights/status/1935729464823976221">X account</a>, with a post stating,</p><p>Something unsettling is coming. It's closer than you think.</p><p>Are you ready to face it, little ones?&nbsp;</p><p>One would imagine the presentation will heavily revolve around Little Nightmares III, which was <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/gamescom-2023/2023/08/23/little-nightmares-3-announced-for-2024-release-developed-by-until-dawn">first announced</a> at Gamescom 2023. Supermassive Games is developing the title, replacing the original creators, Tarsier Studios, which is currently working on a new horror platformer, <a href="https://youtu.be/mUymvhAXOnM?si=8nr9ft1tikkJkT9t">Reanimal</a>. Little Nightmares III was <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/05/31/little-nightmares-iii-moves-into-2025">delayed to 2025</a> last year and has no concrete release date.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RFO9Z_0wrKE"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RFO9Z_0wrKE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>It’s also plausible we’ll learn concrete details for the long-rumored Little Nightmares Enhanced Edition. Though technically unannounced, the game’s existence <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2023/12/esrb-rates-little-nightmares-enhanced-edition-for-ps5-xbox-series-and-pc">first came to light</a> in late 2023 after it received a rating by the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) in South Africa. Much like the Enhanced Edition for Little Nightmares II that released in 2021 (also developed by Supermassive), this would presumably be a new-gen remaster of the 2017 original game.</p><p>Whether we get a Little Nightmares III release date or confirmation for the Enhanced Edition of the first title, we don’t have to wait long to find out either way. &nbsp;Until then, you can brush up on Little Nightmares III by checking out 18 minutes of gameplay <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2023/10/27/check-out-18-minutes-of-unsettling-little-nightmares-3-co-op-gameplay">here.</a>&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>What do you hope or expect to see during the Little Nightmares Showcase? Let us know in the comments.&nbsp;</em></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/06/20/little-nightmares-showcase-announced-for-next-week]]></content:encoded>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Indie <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game developer Ruled are onto a nice little spree with their shortform Itch.io releases - seemingly, they are skipping from phobia to phobia. First there was <a href="https://ruleddev.itch.io/automatonophobia">Automatonophobia</a>, a game that navigated the fear of subterranean golems, then there was <a href="https://ruleddev.itch.io/chrometophobia">Chrometophobia</a>, a game dedicated to the fear of spending money, and also to the act of finding "grimbo" gibs for a delicious pie. What's next on the menu? Ah yes, scarecrows. </p><!--more-->
<p>In <a href="https://ruleddev.itch.io/formidophobia">Formidophobia</a>, which can be downloaded for free, you are a farmer trying to make it across a hazy lofi cornfield. Your dad told you never to go in that field. His dad told him never to go in that field. Neither of them are around anymore, however, and your wife needs medical attention, so off you trot with your bolt-action rifle and exactly one shell. With luck, you'll find more shells along the way.</p>
<p>The rifle is a stubborn, slothful broomhandle of a weapon that wobbles drunkenly at stomach level and often gets caught on other objects, dragging behind you in a way that makes me empathise for the weary arms of my character. The principal challenge and source of dread in Formidophobia is reloading it in a punctual fashion.</p>
<p>The starting area is a ring of scrawly signposts that illustrate the process of pulling back the lever, tugging a shell from the holder, and closing the gun up again. The utility of those signposts isn't that they tell you how to wield your gun, in my experience - it's that other things can't walk through them.</p>
<p>I enjoy the grubbiness, stodginess and overall inhospitability of this game. Don't come expecting "polish", do come expecting a briskly unpleasant meditation on the rasp of stems and the crickle-crackle of bones, deep in the mist.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-fun-failing-to-reload-your-gun-fast-enough-in-this-cornfield-creepfest]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">It's been roughly three weeks since <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> dropped on May 30, and players have started to get their heads around all the different tools and abilities available to them in Limveld. What some are starting to do with those abilities, though, is pretty fascinating.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the top posts on the r/Nightreign subreddit this morning <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1lg0on3/new_strategy_for_getting_to_noklateo_quicker/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">was from user u/Quantam-Law</a>, who was playing with a Raider under the username "BRO....". BRO had a pretty great idea: the trio of Nightfarers had the Noklateo Shifting Earth event, and rather than storm the front gate of the city, BRO popped Raider's ultimate to provide a new platform for entry.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Noklateo, and other Shifting Earth events, are random, map-changing alterations that can appear, adding new encounters and areas to explore in the process. But while this usage of Totem Stela is good for that, it gets the gears turning on other places and ways you could use the massive brick to get up and around designed obstacles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Raider's not the only one with tricks, either. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1lfvzuf/crater_wylder_skip/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">u/Mockz_ also had a recent skip posted</a> up on the Elden Ring Nightreign subreddit, this time for the Crater Shifting Earth event. In this one, Mockz uses their abilities, and a little bit of good ol' fashioned gravity to get where they need to go, at the bottom of the Crater.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another user, u/ninjabladeJr, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1lfox8v/consistent_crater_skip/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted a feasible</a>—albeit challenging and dangerous—skip of their own to the bottom of the Crater, using a spectral hawk and specific line-ups. Are these Crater skips dangerous? Absolutely. Is it awesome to see someone breeze past the many, many encounters of the dungeon and straight to the big boss, the ultimate goal and prize of the Shifting Earth event? You betcha.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Heck, there are people <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1l691iv/mountaintop_event_skip_to_save_you_some_time/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">even finding ways to the top of the Mountaintop event</a> by just Skyrim-jumping their way up the side of the cliffs like an ibex. Shifting Earth events are a fun, fascinating part of Nightreign's construction and layout, and it's amazing how players are already finding ways to navigate them faster and smarter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The actual usability of these is absolutely up-in-the-air. I could see popping the Noklateo totem-skip in a random lobby, but I think attempting the spectral hawk Crater skip in a room with two random players who don't know what I'm doing is a fast path to two, if not three, Nightfarers down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But the fact players are getting so creative with their abilities and finding such interesting uses for them bodes well for the long-term health of Elden Ring Nightreign. As of this writing, the speedrun leaderboards for Elden Ring Nightreign <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/Elden_Ring_Nightreign/news/mxl4856p" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">still aren't live</a>, but these community-discovered skips already have me intrigued to see what speedrunners can showcase with the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Essential_Tips_and_Tricks"><u>Nightreign tips and tricks</u></a> to help you take down <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightlord_Boss_Guides"><u>all the eight Nightlord Bosses</u></a>, and if you’re wondering how to unlock the two locked <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightfarers_-_List_of_Character_Classes"><u>Nightfarer Classes</u></a>, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Revenant"><u>How to Unlock the Revenant</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Duchess"><u>How to Unlock the Duchess</u></a>, plus <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Change_Characters"><u>How to Change Characters</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/three-weeks-in-elden-ring-nightreign-players-are-inventing-some-creative-ways-to-skip-around-the-map]]></content:encoded>

Chapter 5 is currently set for a 2026 release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This information was revealed in the end credits of Deltarune Chapter 4, which released alongside Chapter 3 earlier this month. No further specificity about dates or windows was given.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/20/deltarune-ch-5-1750433683939.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Deltarune is a "sequel" of sorts to beloved indie RPG Undertale, and has released chapter by chapter starting in 2018, with Chapter 2 releasing in 2021 and the two most recent chapters <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deltarune-chapters-3-and-4-are-out-now-and-its-already-exploding-on-steam">dropping alongside the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2 earlier this month</a>. The game follows a human named Kris who lives in a peaceful town of monsters familiar to those who played Undertale. Together with the school bully Suzie, they fall into a mysterious "Dark World" and meet a prince named Ralsei, who charges them with saving both the dark and light world by sealing dark fountains. Each chapter tackles a different dark fountain in something like a "monster of the week" format, though Chapter 4 goes off the rails a bit in exploring the game's overarching meta-plot that fans speculate may eventually tie the game back to Undertale.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Chapters 1 and 2 are available on all major platforms for free, while the full game including Chapters 3, 4, and all future chapters (up to at least seven) costs $25. With the paid release, we reviewed all of Deltarune so far, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deltarune-review">giving it a 9/10</a> and saying that "its incredible and well-refined culmination of captivating characters, hilarious and earnest writing, and stellar music has already left one hell of a lasting impact I’m not likely to forget."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>Those who've played <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/09/now-pac-man-can-run-into-the-ghosts-behold-the-new-championship-edition-2/">the excellent <em>Pac-Man Championship Edition</em> series</a> will be familiar with the high-speed vibe here, but <em>Pac-Man Superfast</em> remains focused on the game's original maze and selection of just four ghosts. That means old-school strategies for grouping ghosts together and running successful patterns through the narrow corridors work in similar ways here. Successfully executing those patterns becomes a tense battle of nerves here, though, requiring multiple direction changes every second at the highest speeds. While the game will technically work with swipe controls on a smartphone or tablet, high-level play really requires the precision of a keyboard via a desktop/laptop web browser (we couldn't get the game to recognize a USB controller, unfortunately).</p>

<p>As exciting as the high-speed maze gameplay gets, though, <em>Pac-Man Superfast</em> is hampered by a few odd design decisions. The game ends abruptly after just 13 levels, for instance, making it impossible to even attempt the high-endurance 256-level runs <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/04/billy-mitchell-says-hes-not-going-to-stop-now-after-scoreboard-ban/">that <em>Pac-Man</em> is known for</a>. The game also throws an extra life at you every 5,000 points, making it relatively easy to brute force your way to the end as long as you focus on the three increasingly high-point-value items that appear periodically on each stage.</p>
<p>Despite this, the game doesn't give any point reward for unused extra lives or long-term survival at high speeds, limiting the rewards for high-level play. And the lack of a built-in leaderboard makes it hard to directly compare your performance to friends and/or strangers anyway.</p>

<p>Those issues aside, I've had a blast coming back to <em>Pac-Man Supefast</em> over and over again in the past few days, slowly raising my high score above the 162,000 point mark during coffee breaks (consider the gauntlet thrown, Ars readers). If you're a fan of classic arcade games, <em>Pac-Man Superfast</em> is worth a try before the "YouTube Playables" initiative inevitably joins <a href="https://arstechnica.com/series/google-kills-product/">the growing graveyard of discontinued Google products</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="GameCube 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/132905828a6e7/gamecube-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>I still remember the day I got my GameCube. It wasn’t the launch day, because I remember getting <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_smash_bros_melee">Super Smash Bros. Melee</a> alongside it, which to my knowledge released a few weeks after the console itself in the UK.</p>
<p>Oh gosh, I was so excited though! I poured over early issues of <a href="https://www.nintendomags.com/magazines/ngc-magazine/">NGC</a> in the weeks leading up to The Big Day (somehow, there were already about six or seven issues before the console even released), perhaps most notably while on a family holiday in Cyprus, clutching the magazine while my Mum tried to get me to focus on the sights and sounds of the Limassol coastline. <em>No Mum… I’m reading about Link’s Melee moveset for the hundredth time, thanks.</em></p><p><figure data-videoid="QmxeKH0YIR0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QmxeKH0YIR0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxeKH0YIR0"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxeKH0YIR0">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>The day I actually got the GameCube felt so magical; previously, my brother’s Mega Drive and PS1 had been passed down to me while he moved onto the next big thing, and I had already owned a Game Boy Color by this point thanks to the <strong>Pokémon</strong> boom, but the GameCube was the first home console that I could truly call my own. It was <em>mine</em>. My precious.</p>
<p>The three or four years following were some of the most memorable of my life; really up until the release of the Wii, if I’m honest. And it’s because the GameCube launched right when I was starting to find my feet at high school, and so the friendships I cultivated during that time linked directly with my experience with the console.</p>
<figure><a title="GameCube 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/db266839ba078/gamecube-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life / Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I had two ‘best friends’, I guess you could call them, and they both owned their own GameCubes and were just about as passionate as I was about Nintendo’s adorable little purple box – perhaps more so, actually. So we played multiplayer as often as we could, and when we weren’t playing together, we’d be talking about our own experiences in between classes (and yes, probably during classes too).</p>
<p><em>“How does Link control?”</em> is an actual question I specifically remember asking one of my friends after he’d got his hands on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/legend_of_zelda_the_wind_waker">The Wind Waker</a> six or seven hours before me. He got his delivery before school started that day, and I had to wait until I got home the same evening. Ridiculous! But it was these kinds of conversations that really got me through high school. I’ll never forget it.</p>
<p>Life goes on, of course, and for reasons I can’t quite recall, I had to get rid of my GameCube and accompanying games. High school and college ended, and so my friends and I went our separate ways when university hit, chasing our own visions of what adulthood might look like. Outside of a few brief chance encounters in the years since, we’d pretty much remained apart for nearly 20 years.</p>

<p>However, after another encounter a couple of years back, I’ve reconnected with those same two friends I’d spent so much time with during high school. Now, on a near-weekly basis, we get together at a local micro pub, knock back a couple of pints, munch on some pork scratchings, and spend each Saturday evening enjoying rousing discussions about current affairs, gaming, and of course, our time together at high school.</p>
<p>The best thing about these little get-togethers is the joint realisation that none of us has really changed. Sure, we’ve changed in the obvious sense that we’re now grown up with lots of different responsibilities and whatnot, but we still all love gaming, and it genuinely felt like our time apart after high school just never happened. It was like we were right back in 2002, albeit without the constant threat of bullies and the monotonous homework. I had a real rough time in 2023 for reasons I won’t go into here, and honestly, reconnecting with my two best friends again saved me.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2025, and our conversations frequently involve the Switch 2. We’d go over our hopes for the console, rumours and speculation, along with any information that Nintendo itself had officially announced. Naturally, when <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-direct-april-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-and-trailer">the big Direct</a> happened at the start of April and included confirmation that GameCube games would be making a comeback, this became a hot topic for the three of us. Not only was the console that effectively cemented our friendships back in 2002 suddenly a thing again, but the fact that it was happening <em>now</em>, after so many years of us being apart, felt remarkably significant.</p>

<p>So I have to admit, booting up the GameCube app on Switch 2 for the first time, official wireless GameCube controller at hand, I felt a little bit emotional. I've had that nostalgic feeling plenty of times – haven't we all?-- but nothing quite like this. Hauling myself down that ladder and taking my first steps across Outset Island in The Wind Waker immediately brought back memories of that ridiculous question I'd asked my friend all those years back.</p>
<p>But instead of it festering in the back of my mind, I know I can bring it up with the exact same friend at the pub, and I know it'll lead to a dozen other GameCube memories and unrestrained belly laughs. That's just how it is. And it's the same with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/f-zero_gx">F-Zero GX</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/soulcalibur_ii">SoulCalibur II</a>: all three games played a huge part in our teenage years, and so they all hold their own respective treasure troves of memories within.</p>
<p>There is, however, one thing missing right now. The game that started it all, the one I poured over for countless hours in NGC magazines, and the one I played the first time I booted up my GameCube in 2002: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_smash_bros_melee">Super Smash Bros. Melee</a>.</p>
<p>It's yet to be confirmed for Nintendo Switch Online, but if/when it does, I imagine our nights out at the pub will turn into impromptu Melee tournaments. And I can't wait.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Sloclap's new football game, Rematch, is officially out, and in just the game's first 24 hours of being live for everyone, not just those who paid for early access a few days ahead of launch, <a href="https://x.com/PlayRematch/status/1936061475447013553">Sloclap announced</a> that Rematch had&nbsp;<strong>1 million unique players</strong> running on to the pitch.</p>
<p>It's great news for Sloclap, but what was better news for players was Sloclap pushing a new hotfix for Rematch, which can be downloaded now on all platforms. Patch 0.5 adds a bug fix for the ball hitting the post and going out of sync with other players, though still notes that ball sync issues "<em>might still happen under other circumstances</em>."</p>
<p>And most importantly, this new hotfix includes fixes for stability issues, netcode improvements, and matchmaking updates to improve queue times.</p>
<p>On the one hand, it's been a great launch for Rematch, with more than 1 million unique players, and on Steam alone, hitting <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2138720/charts/">92,841 concurrent players</a>. On the other hand, it's been fraught with bugs, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Rematch/comments/1lg6j0f/please_consolidate_all_na_servers/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">long queue times</a>, and Sloclap has already <a href="https://www.playrematch.com/post/rematch-launch-priorities-next-steps">talked about its priorities</a> when it comes to making more fixes and improvements.</p>
<p>Crossplay support is at the top of the list, as it was just hours before the game released in its early access launch for the players who paid extra, that <a href="https://wccftech.com/sloclap-rematch-wont-support-cross-play-at-launch/">crossplay support would not be in the game at launch</a>.</p>
<p>Sloclap has apologized for not telling players that crossplay would be missing sooner, and hopefully, it's not too long of a wait for the feature to be added.</p>

You’ve got some work to do if you’re looking to get your system exactly the way you want it out of the box. But we have come to you from the other side of the chaos with a few things you should know before the Switching hour. </p><h2 id="h253576"><a id="1"></a>Make the system remember you</h2><p>Probably not a surprise that you’re gonna be signing into your Nintendo Account a LOT during the initial setup. But while the sign in screen conveniently gives you a QR code so you can sign in on your phone instead of doing the on-screen keyboard cabaret, it’s easy to ignore <strong>the fact that the Switch 2 screen has a little button onscreen to remember you</strong>. That button is not hit by default, so while you’re working on signing in, you might just guarantee that you’re gonna see this screen again in the very near future (it’ll come up again when you sign into the eShop for the first time, but that’s about it). Save yourself some annoyance, click that button on the Switch before you go to your phone.</p><h2 id="h253577"><a id="2"></a>Do System Transfer before anything else</h2><p>It’s tempting to want to just slap the thing on your dock and get started as soon as possible. If this is, somehow, your first Switch, knock yourself out. But <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-system-transfer-cloud-local-initial-1851784644?rev=1750174943328&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-system-transfer-cloud-local-initial-1851784644?rev=1750174943328">if you’re planning on transferring data from your old Switch</a></span> to the new one, pump your brakes a sec. </p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-system-transfer-cloud-local-initial-1851784644?rev=1750174943328&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-system-transfer-cloud-local-initial-1851784644?rev=1750174943328">The Nintendo Switch 2’s System Transfer Is Great If You Do It Correctly</a></span></p><p>The transfer process will throw up a message to connect the Switch to an AC adapter before starting. And they’re not asking, they’re telling. The popup will happen again and the process literally won’t be able to start until the Switch determines there’s enough power flowing into it. </p><p>For us homebodies that prefer to do their Switchery on TV instead of handheld, that’s fine for the system you’ve got docked. But then <strong>you’ll have to have your original Switch doing the same thing in its transfer menu, and it needs to be in close proximity of the Switch 2. </strong>Furthermore, whatever the Switch 2's power demands are, 2 plain old USB-C chargers won’t do the job, either. It’s recommended to use the charger that came with the Switch 2 itself, i.e., the one you fucked up and plugged into your dock. If you’re a super fancy dual-handheld household, I personally managed to skate past it using my Steam Deck’s charger, but not everybody’s got that option. Once that’s done, though,<strong> both systems must remain in close proximity for the actual data transfer</strong>, which thankfully only took about 5 minutes. Basically, don’t go docking until that’s done.</p><p>Oh, by the way, the Switch 2's kinda like an iPhone, <strong>you’ll only get the option to transfer your old data during the initial setup process</strong>. If you go to the main menu, you’ll have to factory reset the Switch 2 to do the transfer later.</p><h2 id="h253578"><a id="3"></a>Can’t use System Transfer? Use Nintendo’s website instead</h2><figure id="" data-id="7ac4a57476ef884916b3f569b41c6907" data-recommend-id="image://7ac4a57476ef884916b3f569b41c6907" data-format="png" data-width="692" data-height="381" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the user's original Switch.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>On the flipside, if you want access to your old stuff but don’t have access to your original Switch, you can at least do so from Nintendo’s site. Logic and common sense dictates that if you buy a game from a digital storefront, the game is tied to your account, and as long as you sign into your account, they’ll follow you anywhere. Nintendo, however, is not a logical company. <strong>As it turns out, while games will show up on your account, they’re actually tied to a specific console. System Transfer takes care of linking the games to your Switch 2 for you, but if that’s not an option, there is an alternative.</strong></p><p>Go to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://accounts.nintendo.com&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://accounts.nintendo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">accounts.nintendo.com</a></span>, and you’ll see a section for Game Systems. Click that, then select your original Switch. You’ll see a bar marked “Loadable”. Click that and unlink that system.

Basically, though, you’re not missing anything, really. </p><p>Oh and also, the same goes for VRR, which is only supported in handheld mode.</p></div><h2 id="h253580"><a id="5"></a>Turn on Auto Uploads for the Switch Online App</h2><figure id="" data-id="fd2f8354521baf2b7f79b486cf03a2e7" data-recommend-id="image://fd2f8354521baf2b7f79b486cf03a2e7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Switch 2's upload settings." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Switch 2's upload settings." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Justin Clark / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fd2f8354521baf2b7f79b486cf03a2e7" data-recommend-id="image://fd2f8354521baf2b7f79b486cf03a2e7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Switch 2's upload settings." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Good news! The Switch Online app is actually extremely useful with the Switch 2, and not just for the most convoluted voice chat ever. One of the big improvements is that Nintendo’s joined the rest of the pack this console generation and included a feature where screenshots get uploaded to a centralized location to be accessed off of your system. Excellent news, but they also kinda bury the lede that you need to actually turn that feature on from the Switch 2 to make it happen. The option’s in the Upload Settings menu in the Album app. </p><h2 id="h253581"><a id="6"></a>Clearing up the controller conundrum</h2><figure id="" data-id="45f6d5f9c4c07fd7f09e0d22786d5a4e" data-recommend-id="image://45f6d5f9c4c07fd7f09e0d22786d5a4e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows controller options on the Switch 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows controller options on the Switch 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Justin Clark / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="45f6d5f9c4c07fd7f09e0d22786d5a4e" data-recommend-id="image://45f6d5f9c4c07fd7f09e0d22786d5a4e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows controller options on the Switch 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Given how many different control configurations there are for the original Switch, adding a brand new set of options into the mix hasn’t made staying sane any easier for folks with a half dozen Joy-Cons running around.

      </div>
<p>Pocketpair has said that players will be able to "catch, train, fight, and work monsters from Terraria" as if they were any other creature from Palworld. Palworld is currently on sale for 25% off its full price on both Steam and the PlayStation Store.</p><p>Palworld hasn't had any other crossovers since it launched at the beginning of 2024. Terraria is one of the more popular games that Pocketpair could have partnered with for this update. The sandbox adventure game launched in 2011 and still has over 30,000 concurrent players on Steam 14 years later.</p><p>Palworld has also been in the midst of a lawsuit filed by Nintendo for allegedly infringing on its patents for gameplay. Palworld has made several changes to its game, including removing the ability to summon creatures by throwing Pal Spheres. More gameplay and artistic changes are expected to come as legal proceedings continue.</p>

<p>What a blast</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Devolver Digital has announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shotgun_cop_man">Shotgun Cop Man</a>, the incredible action-platformer from developer DeadToast Entertainment, has received a generous new DLC expansion for absolutely free.</p>
<p>Inspired by DeadToast's previous title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/my_friend_pedro">My Friend Pedro</a>, the new levels will feature the signature 'bullet time' slow motion gameplay that made the game such a unique, memorable experience. Oh, and there's also skateboarding involved, too. How cool!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Utilize the power of sick moves and slow motion to battle and backflip your way through this hefty heap of challenging new stages, and face off against a selection of three fearsome and strangely familiar bosses.</p></blockquote><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p><blockquote>
<p>"You can also enjoy a shotgun blast of new Pedro-inspired gameplay including acrobatic slow-motion, skateboarding, breakable windows, swing ropes, frying pans and zip-lines."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Lies of P&nbsp;</em>developer Neowiz has announced that its puppet-centered Soulslike has reached a brand new sales milestone, just a handful of days after the release of its first big story DLC.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://x.com/Liesofp/status/1935850080948699629" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, the action RPG, which launched back in 2023, has reached three million sales. That means it's picked up another two million for itself since launch month, during which it managed to achieve the impressive milestone of a million copies sold.</p>

<p>It's likely that the shadowdrop of&nbsp;<em>Overture</em>, the game's first story expansion, helped sales along; it was launched without preceding fanfare during the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/summer-game-fest-2025-recap" rel="nofollow">main Summer Game Fest show</a> earlier this month, having been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lies-of-p-dlc-q1-2025-new-ip" rel="nofollow">teased</a> by Neowiz for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lies-of-p-dlc-sequel" rel="nofollow">some time</a> prior to that announcement.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lies-of-p-sales-3m-overture.jpg?itok=Y7qonlF9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lies-of-p-sales-3m-overture.jpg?itok=idEhKMsX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Lies of P&nbsp;</em>has managed to reach a new sales milestone, perhaps driven by the release of its first major DLC pack.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Lies of P</em>, it's a Soulslike action RPG created by Korean studio Neowiz. As you've probably guessed, it's an extremely loose adaptation of 1883 children's novel&nbsp;<em>The Adventures of Pinocchio</em>, although the emphasis here is on "loose"; if you're expecting a faithful retelling of Carlo Collodi's classic fable, you'll be disappointed.</p>

<p>Instead, you're getting a fairly straightforward Soulslike setup; the city of Krat, a Belle Epoque-era metropolis full of breathtaking architecture, is now sadly also full of murderous puppets, and it's up to you, a different kind of murderous puppet, to do something about that.</p>

<p>Gameplay-wise,&nbsp;<em>Lies of P&nbsp;</em>hews pretty close to the formula; it's built around parry-focused combat, semi-linear exploration, and an oblique story that drip-feeds clues over the course of the game's running time.</p>

<p>The game's first major DLC,&nbsp;<em>Overture</em>, revolves around a legendary figure in&nbsp;<em>Lies of P</em>'s mythology by the name of Lea Florence Monad. You'll uncover her story while also exploring new areas, battling new enemies, and trying out some new weapons into the bargain.</p>




<p><em>Lies of P</em>&nbsp;is out right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1627720/Lies_of_P/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/lies-of-p/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/lies-of-p" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and its&nbsp;<em>Overture&nbsp;</em>DLC is also available on all of those platforms.</p>

            <p>While the prospect <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> turning out to be a real thing had folks wondering what that might mean for Oblivion remake mod <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skyblivion">Skyblivion</a>'s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skyblivion-project-lead-and-gog-chat-about-partnering-up-to-release-the-massive-elder-scrolls-mod-following-fallout-londons-troubled-success">release</a>, Bethesda were quick quell fears of a shutdown.</p>
<p>Both sides have been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-get-twice-the-amount-of-oblivion-this-year-says-skyblivion-modder-undeterred-by-official-remaster">openly chummy</a> since that point, with the studio behind The Elder Scrolls even having the team of modders pop by for a visit around the time their project was being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bethesda-are-so-chill-about-skyblivion-that-theyre-promoting-it-in-oblivion-remastered-videos">shouted out on the official channels</a>. We've now learned a bit more about how that social call went and what the two sides chatted about.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Speaking to cheery RPS fanzine <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-elder-scrolls/we-just-kept-geeking-out-skyblivion-devs-were-invited-to-bethesda-hq-and-ended-up-spending-the-whole-day-talking-about-modding-with-the-team-and-todd-howard/">PC Gamer</a>, Skyblivion project lead Kyle 'Rebelzize' Rebel revealed that the studio visit came about because he'd been planning a trip to the US around PAX East, and decided that since he was going to be in the area, he'd ring up Bethesda and see if they'd mind Skyblivion folks popping in.</p>
<p>Cue a day at ToddCo HQ that the modder recalled ran from 11AM until 6PM, with Bethesda's devs and Todd Howard himself chatting to the Skyblivion folks about their work. Naturally, it sounds like the studio's devs were curious about how the modders have found building their own interpretation of Oblivion using <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>'s tools, with Rebel saying that "how we experienced using those tools, what kind of issues we run into, and what we'd like to see in terms of documentation" were all big talking points.</p>
<p>As for the feedback the Skyblivion folks offered, the project lead said he kindly asked Bethesda to consider bringing back the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDKivlGmia4">official creation kit tutorial video series</a> it released on YouTube when Skyrim got its tools. If you've not watched these vids, they're basically short how-tos narrated by different Bethesda devs that explain the ins-and-outs of the modding process.</p>
<p>A way to get started with Skyrim modding using the CK by making a basic dungeon, if - as I was when I used these videos for exactly that last year - you don't know your bum from your elbow when it comes to actually making mods or the navigating the practicalities of game development.</p>
<p>Sure, there are plenty of good tutorials you can find if you're looking to get into modding more recent Bethesda games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/starfield">Starfield</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a>, with some even being by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k9iRuLqwoY">high-profile modders</a>, but it's cool to have the devs who made the thing you've been playing talk you through the tools they used to do so. They're pretty good teachers, and it gives you an extra level of appreciation the next time you delve into one of Skyrim's dungeons. You'll know just how much work went to ensuring the enemies don't all get stuck on the same rock and eliminating void-leaking gaps in the ceiling, and it'll be good for your soul.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skyblivion-devs-used-their-bethesda-visit-to-fight-the-good-fight-asking-todd-and-co-to-bring-back-skyrim-style-official-modding-tutorials]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/blood-message">Blood Message</a> is a new singleplayer third-person action game from NetEase, publishers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/naraka-bladepoint">Naraka: Bladepoint</a>. It follows the journey of a “nameless messenger” and his son across Tang dynasty China, and is laced with the “customs, culture, and rich history of the era”. Amongst other sights and sounds, you will join an uprising in Shazhou, Dunhuang and tread the legendary Silk Road trade routes as you “etch a final tale of loyalty” into the helpless, screaming face of Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>I know absolutely nothing about any of these historical and cultural precedents, so I will frame things in terms of the mechanics and skits I recognise from opulent manly bonkfests like God Of War. You will: shimmy through narrow gaps, presumably so that the next area has time to load! Lift a huge sliding door so that your AI-controlled partner can scamper under it, bookending your progress! Mash somebody’s mug into the woodwork while performing an environmental finisher! Topple over and slide uncontrollably through collapsing scenery! Remorselessly QTE a cartwheel while trapped beneath the speeding vehicle! There, now - between those two paragraphs, you don’t even <em>need</em> to watch the following trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>It's end-of-day Friday and I am probably being too pissy. Yes, this appears to be another vibrantly violent canyon of exploding or murdersome photoreal furniture, but there is a lot of (romanticised?) history here I wouldn’t mind encountering up close.</p>
<p>I just hope it manages to have a sense of humour about itself, somewhere. NetEase don’t give that impression in their announcement release. “How can countless ordinary people—smaller than dust—leave a mark on history?” it brays. “The Blood Message development team offers this answer: The remembrance and praise of future generations become their eternal monument.” Nice to hear, because the monuments in the trailer don’t seem very eternal: it’s like the masonry is mortared with anti-matter.</p>
<p>Lead producer and NetEase executive vice president Zhipeng Hu adds that this is the “first completely single-player focused experience from NetEase Games”. They are certainly making no bones of the genre markers they're trying to hit with that video. There’s no release date yet.

The first toggle you’ll see is for Smart Steering. Those who played the previous entry likely remember what this means. Anyone who’s jumping into the <em>Mario Kart</em> series for the first time or in a long while is out of luck, since there isn’t any explanation as to what this does.</p><p><strong>Smart Steering is an assistant feature that’s meant to keep you from driving off the edge of a course.</strong> You’ll find yourself being tugged back along the track whenever you get too close to an edge or wall. Visually, it’s represented by a small antenna on the back of your kart that lights up when the feature is activated.</p><figure id="" data-id="ad8fb29dab13132f2b916460b32076e9" data-recommend-id="image://ad8fb29dab13132f2b916460b32076e9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Settings/Controller menu, highlighting the Smart Steering option." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Settings/Controller menu, highlighting the Smart Steering option." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ad8fb29dab13132f2b916460b32076e9" data-recommend-id="image://ad8fb29dab13132f2b916460b32076e9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Settings/Controller menu, highlighting the Smart Steering option." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Newer and younger players alike are sure to enjoy Smart Steering’s assistance. However, <strong>enabling this does come with caveats. The obvious setback is that you’ll be unable to perform up to the second level of your mini-turbo</strong>. Not having access to the third and strongest drift boost is a huge detriment when playing online or even in 150cc. Just as challenging is that Smart Steering’s corrections can ruin some of your drifts and make it difficult to take off-road shortcuts. I’ve also experienced a bit of awkwardness when <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-rail-wall-charge-jump-ride-switch-2-1851784648&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-rail-wall-charge-jump-ride-switch-2-1851784648">trying to Rail Ride</a></span>. As helpful as this feature is, you might enjoy playing without it once you’ve become more familiar with <em>Mario Kart World</em>.</p><h2 id="h1122251"><a id=""></a>What is Auto-Accelerate?</h2><p>Directly underneath the Smart Steering option is Auto-Accelerate. This one might be easier to guess, but it’s still pretty vague without a proper definition. <strong>Auto-Accelerate is an assistant feature that constantly keeps the Accelerate input triggered.</strong> Considering that you’re likely pressing down on the A button 99% of the time anyway, this probably sounds like a dream for accessibility reasons or even if you find your thumb getting sore.</p><p>I’d argue this feature is much more of a convenience option that you could use for as long as you play. That being said, it’s not without some problems. <strong>Continuously accelerating means you can’t brake as effectively or go in reverse</strong>. These are minor issues that can be mitigated with experience over time, but they’re still worth taking into account.</p><p>The best part with either of these features is that they can be toggled with a quick visit to the Options menu. Go ahead and experiment whenever you want to make adjustments to your driving ability!</p><p>.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-smart-steering-auto-acceleration-work-1851784842]]></content:encoded>

It has also made everyone lose their minds as the best-selling expansion in the card game’s history sees prices skyrocket, including one collector asking $50,000 for the set’s rare Golden Traveling Chocobo. <br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195519" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="I Didn’t Play Final Fantasy XVI ‘Right,’ And That’s OK" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="148" data-playlist="195519,195905,196805" data-current="195519"><div><p>I Didn’t Play Final Fantasy XVI ‘Right,’ And That’s OK</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21013.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The<em> Final Fantasy </em>Universes Beyond set includes only 77 of these foil cards in total.

While there are more of them, making them slightly less rare in theory, that also means there are more of them to be traded between collectors, and one of the  Golden Traveling Chocobo cards that’s already been discovered was recently put <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ebay.com/itm/157065192564&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/157065192564" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">up on eBay for $50,000</a></span>.<br></p><p>It was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/mtgfinance/comments/1l4odcw/the_first_two_serial_chocobos_have_been_pulled/#lightbox&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mtgfinance/comments/1l4odcw/the_first_two_serial_chocobos_have_been_pulled/#lightbox" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Traveling Chocobo 41/77</a></span> to be precise, and it was technically listed for $200,000 initially, before its seller apparently thought better it <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.wargamer.com/magic-the-gathering/golden-chocobo-40k-sale&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.wargamer.com/magic-the-gathering/golden-chocobo-40k-sale" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Wargamer</em> reports</a></span>. It has since been sold for a “best offer,” so the final price is unclear, but according to the third-party tool 130point it may have been closer to $40,000. If accurate, that would actually made the <em>entire</em> set of 77 Gold Chocobos worth $3,080,000 if they all fetched a similar amount, dwarfing what the One Ring previously sold for. <br></p><figure id="" data-id="7af119cd922be758813c683f6519335a" data-recommend-id="image://7af119cd922be758813c683f6519335a" data-format="png" data-width="1380" data-height="686" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows an eBay listing for a foil chocobo.

Other expensive cards include, not surprisingly, iconic main characters like Sephiroth, Cloud, Lightning, Terra, and Clive, as well as summons like Knights of the Round and Bahamut. There are borderless, Through the Ages, and Surge Foil variants of each, upping the prices even further.</p><p>And what about people who just want to have fun opening packs, looking at cards, and playing the actual game? Well, the launch frenzy has made Final Fantasy one of the hardest sets to actually participate in as a fan, just as its popularity hits new heights. Play booster boxes are sold out most places, and the collector’s boosters are pretty much only available from resellers at this point for extreme markups. </p><p>Even big box stores <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-x-secret-lair-mtg-sold-out-ebay-reprint-1851784230&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-x-secret-lair-mtg-sold-out-ebay-reprint-1851784230">are turning to scalping</a></span>.

While reprints are expected as soon as July, and should continue for a while given the<em> Final Fantasy</em> expansion is part of MTG’s standard set of cards (and thus legal in all tournament play), the difficulty of not only finding cards at the moment, but actually being able to afford them, has been a bit of a buzzkill. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/golden-chocobo-mtg-final-fantasy-price-foil-restock-1851784836]]></content:encoded>
