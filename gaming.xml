            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gears-of-war-reloaded-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microsoft has announced&nbsp;<em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em>, a remastered version of the seminal 2006 third-person shooter, and it marks the third-person shooter series' debut on PS5.</p>

<p>Per an Xbox <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/05/05/gears-of-war-reloaded-release-date/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>,&nbsp;<em>Gears of War: Reloaded&nbsp;</em>lands on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5 on August 26th. It's a "faithfully remastered and natively optimized" version of the original&nbsp;<em>Gears of War</em>, which is to say it's essentially a new version of 2015's&nbsp;<em>Gears of War: Ultimate Edition</em>.</p>

<p>You can expect all the usual current-gen bells and whistles: 120fps and 4K support, cross-play and cross-progression, and all of the original game's DLC, including the bonus Campaign act and "a full roster of classic characters and cosmetics unlockable through progression".</p>

<p>It'll support two-player campaign co-op play, as well as up to eight players in multiplayer modes, all of which can be enjoyed across different platforms. Signing into a Microsoft account also allows you to enjoy cross-progression, so you can pick up where you left off on any platform.</p>

<p>Thanks to the Xbox Series X|S and PS5's SSDs, you can also enjoy a campaign with "zero loading screens", according to Microsoft, as well as a host of visual improvements like enhanced post-processing and better shadows.</p>

<p>If you already bought&nbsp;<em>Gears of War: Ultimate Edition</em>, don't worry; you'll be getting this one as a free upgrade, although you can't rush out and buy the game now, because that only applies to purchases made before 4pm UTC today (which is about twenty minutes ago at time of writing).</p>

It'll cost you $40, unless you already own&nbsp;<em>Ultimate Edition</em>, but it'll also be on PC Game Pass and Game Pass Ultimate on day one.</p>

This included the source code for the OG <em>Fallout</em>. Cain complied, which made it awkward when Interplay called a few years later asking if he had <em>Fallout’s </em>source code still. He thought it was a trap; turns out, Interplay had actually lost the code for it and <em>Fallout 2</em>. And <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tim-cain-fallout-obsidian-lgbtq-pride-month-gay-history-1850501928&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tim-cain-fallout-obsidian-lgbtq-pride-month-gay-history-1850501928">Cain</a></span> had assumed that due to Interplay’s “destroy it all” policy, the source code for the old RPGs were lost and destroyed. Thankfully, that’s not the case. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogamer.com/news/fallout-1-fallout-2-source-code-isnt-actually-not-lost-reveals-former-interplay-founder/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/fallout-1-fallout-2-source-code-isnt-actually-not-lost-reveals-former-interplay-founder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On May 5, <em>Videogamer </em>reported</a></span> that it had heard from Interplay founder and game designer Rebecca Heineman that she had the source code for both <em>Fallout </em>and its sequel, as well as many other Interplay classics. She started preserving every Interplay game after working on the studio’s <em>10 Year Anthology: Classic Collection </em>and realizing how poorly the company’s past work was being saved for the future. </p><p> “I made it a quest to snapshot everything and archive it on CD-ROMs,” Heineman explained. “When I left Interplay in 1995, I had copies of every game we did. No exceptions. When I did MacPlay, which existed beyond my tenure at Interplay, every game we ported, I snapshotted. It included <em>Fallout 1 </em>and <em>2.</em>” </p><p>Heineman confirmed to <em>Videogamer </em>that Cain’s comments about Interplay demanding all employees who leave the studio destroy all assets or face possible “litigation” in the future was true. She just didn’t follow those orders. And while she doesn’t have Caine’s lost and destroyed design docs and notes, she does have the source code for <em>Fallout </em>and <em>Fallout 2</em> safely secured on a high quality Blu-Ray disc.</p><p> “Interplay had a reputation of threatening ex-employees with litigation if they were ‘poached’, and if they had assets taken home,” she told the outlet. “However, they had no legal leg to stand on which was why a suit was never filed on anyone. [If] they did have a legal leg to stand on, I would have been sued into last week.”</p><p>As for why Heineman hasn’t released the code to the internet, she says that could only happen with permission from Bethesda (now the owners of <em>Fallout</em>) as they are still selling <em>Fallout </em>and <em>Fallout 2</em> today. </p><p>“I need expressed permission to release, despite the source code being pretty much obsolete,” said Heineman. “I [haven’t] gotten around to asking them. They are on my list.” She is a busy woman, working on bringing back MacPlay and porting more games to Mac. But hopefully, when she does ask, Bethesda is cool with her sharing these important pieces of game history online. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But now that they’ve confessed their feelings and decided to live a life of mutual domesticity with a kid on the way, the reaction has been somewhat mixed. Like most criticism laid at the show’s feet, it has to do with how showrunner Craig Mazin has chosen to change the storyline up for the show compared to the game on which it’s based.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195618" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Unboxing The Baldur’s Gate 3 Collector’s Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="376" data-playlist="195618,197551,197550" data-current="195618"><div><p>Unboxing The Baldur’s Gate 3 Collector’s Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>In <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>, Dina and Ellie’s relationship begins in much happier circumstances.

The two’s budding romance is pretty much conflict-free for the first several hours of the game. Dina is a ride-or-die, ready to help Ellie cross state lines for her revenge tour in Seattle, and most of their time together on the first day in the city is about getting to know each other better in this new romantic context. The first time there’s real tension between the girls is when Dina reveals that she is pregnant with her ex-boyfriend Jesse’s baby. By this point, they’ve been traveling for weeks to reach the city, and Dina suspected she was pregnant for at least some of the trip. Ellie is furious at her for keeping this information from her, saying that they could have turned around and gotten her back home, going as far as to call her a “burden” in a fit of anger.</p><p>The two reconcile the next morning, but the scene illustrates how Ellie’s violent conquest is distorting everything else in her life. She’s concerned for Dina, but frustrated at how this development threatens to derail her revenge. Ellie comes off as boorish and dismissive of her girlfriend’s condition, and it stings hearing something so callous come out of her mouth in the heat of the moment. Compare that to the show’s take on this reveal:</p><p>Ellie is jazzed about being a parent in HBO’s version of the scene. Some fans similarly share the excitement of the mothers-to-be. Part of this is no doubt because viewers have been waiting for weeks for these two to seal the deal, but Ellie actor Bella Ramsey’s humorous “I’m gonna be a dad” line has become its own meme. It’s a sweet scene, and cuteness is enough to win over most people’s hearts.</p><p>But isn’t it all a little too perfect? That’s the argument some <em>Last of Us </em>fans are making, looking at the scenes side-by-side.</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@ackvvrman/video/7500789433646484766&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ackvvrman/video/7500789433646484766" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TikTok</a></span> user tambor wrote, “I’m trying real hard to defend the show and understand their choices, but why is Ellie so joyous after Joel’s death?”</p><p>“I know everybody’s gonna love this change because it’s funny, but them removing all of the conflict and relationship development and combining it into one happy-go-lucky fairytale moment is annoying,” TikTok user char said in the comments.</p><p>“I didn’t like this change [because] it was one of the stepping stones of Ellie losing herself to revenge,” TikTok user Invader wrote. “I hope they can still flesh this out correctly.”</p></blockquote><p>Part of me reads this as another example of the show being scared to let its leads be unlikeable. The adaptation has taken a lot of the thornier aspects of the original story out to endear viewers to characters like Abby and Joel. The second season was forthcoming with Abby’s motivations, seemingly in an effort to help viewers warm up to her after the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-part-2-abby-laura-bailey-threats-grounded-1851222035&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-part-2-abby-laura-bailey-threats-grounded-1851222035">ludicrous backlash</a></span> toward her when <em>The Last of Us Part II </em>launched. The show also <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-tlou-hbo-show-finale-joel-lies-ellie-part-ii-1850209559&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-tlou-hbo-show-finale-joel-lies-ellie-part-ii-1850209559">bent over backwards to justify Joel’s violent actions</a></span> in season one, so this isn’t a recent tonal shift for HBO’s recreation. Ellie’s curt reaction to Dina’s pregnancy is hardly the most reprehensible thing she’ll do before she leaves Seattle, but if the show’s already pulling its punches on this, it doesn’t bode well for how down-and-dirty it’s going to be when things get much, much worse for our funky little lesbian.</p><p>If nothing else, the show needed a little bit of levity after the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-tv-season-2-episode-joel-abby-death-reaction-1851777264&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-tv-season-2-episode-joel-abby-death-reaction-1851777264">brutal past couple of weeks</a></span>.

They've been removed from Destiny 2 as part of Bungie's "vaulting" process that sees the developer occasionally <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-vault-of-glass-is-returning-but-old-cont/1100-6478197/" data-ref-id="1100-6478197">remove older content</a> from the game. That led to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-lawsuit-had-to-cite-destiny-2-fan-videos-because-in-game-content-no-longer-exists/1100-6529709/" data-ref-id="1100-6529709">Bungie including YouTube lore videos in its motion to dismiss the case</a> (like a one a 10-hour-long <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzBmOeYmN_M" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"Complete Story of Destiny" video</a> from YouTuber My Name is Byf) as well as wiki pages from <a href="https://www.destinypedia.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Destinypedia</a> in order to show the differences between Destiny 2 and Martineau's work.</p><p dir="ltr">In a declaration included as part of Bungie's attempt to dismiss the case, Destiny 2 game director Tyson Green explained that the Red War and Curse of Osiris campaigns "can no longer run because their outdated code is incompatible with Destiny 2's underlying operational framework," hence the studio's use of YouTube videos and wiki pages.</p><p dir="ltr">"As a result, Bungie cannot feasibly provide the Court with the original Destiny 2 game as it existed in 2017, including the accused 'Red War' and 'Curse of Osiris' campaigns, in any operable or reviewable form," Green said. "Nor will Bungie be able to produce the accused campaigns in operable or reviewable form if this matter proceeds to formal discovery."</p><p dir="ltr">That is, however, what's happening. The judge overseeing the case said there is sufficient evidence to proceed with the copyright infringement case and that it will not consider YouTube videos and wiki pages as acceptable on Bungie's part, as they originate from a third-party and their "authenticity" has not been established. The judge also stated that the cases Bungie cited in its motion to dismiss are not applicable to this specific case, and that the case "would require a much more complicated side-by-side analysis than those conducted in the caselaw cited by Defendant."</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie will reveal <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-edge-of-fate-reveal-announced-for-next-month/1100-6530898/" data-ref-id="1100-6530898">Destiny 2's next expansion, The Edge of Fate</a>, during an upcoming livestream on May 6.

			<p>Gears of War: Reloaded, a remaster of the first entry in the series, will launch this summer on PC and consoles, marking the classic third-person shooter series' debut on PlayStation consoles.</p>
<p>The remaster, which was announced today with a new post on the official <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/05/05/gears-of-war-reloaded-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox website</a>, is being developed by The Coalition in partnership with Sumo Interactive and Disbelief, and will be the most complete version of the game, featuring all the content included in the Gears of War: Ultimate Edition such as the main campaign, all post-launch DLC such as the bonus Campaign act, all multiplayer maps and modes, and a roster of classic characters and cosmetics that can be unlocked through progression.</p>
<p>Besides featuring all this content, Gears of War: Reloaded will enhance the original experience on all platforms with 4K resolution support, 60 FPS gameplay in the campaign and 120 FPS gameplay in multiplayer, HDR support, VRR support, enhanced post-processing visual effects, improved shadows and reflections, super resolution with improved antialiasing and zero loading screens during the Campaign. No matter which system the game is played on, signing with a Microsoft account unlocks full cross-platform functionality, enabling cross-progression and cross-platform multiplayer, including the ability to send invites to players across all systems. Cross-platform multiplayer will still be available even without a Microsoft account.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-running-unreal-engine-5-features-trouble/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 will support the full set of Unreal Engine 5 features, but the hardware will likely have trouble running all of them simultaneously.</p>
<p>Replying to a supporter's question during the latest episode of their weekly podcast, the tech experts at Digital Foundry commented on how the soon-to-be-released new Nintendo system will handle games powered by the Unreal Engine 5 using features like Nanite, Lumen, and Virtual Shadow Maps. While it's obviously impossible to say for sure at this time, chances are high that games powered by the engine will likely be unable to use all the above features at the same time, not even targeting 30 FPS with significant compromises in terms of resolution, image quality, and performance. Recently, we have seen the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X struggle to run UE5-powered games using all three features, and the Nintendo Switch 2 would struggle even more, considering its hardware.</p>
<p>All the above, however, doesn't mean that we won't see Unreal Engine 5-powered games using these features on Nintendo Switch 2, only not all of them at the same time. According to Digital Foundry, how Fortnite runs on the system is a good indication of what should be expected on the console for UE5 games. The popular battle royale game was shown running at 60 FPS, but without Lumen, which has proven to be highly demanding in a test conducted by the tech experts featuring The Matrix Awakens demo<a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-4-the-matrix-awakens-cpu-gpu-performance-improvements/"> ported to the latest public version of the engine</a> running on comparable PC hardware with an Ampere architecture GPU. With Lumen, the demo ran poorly even at low resolution, and with NVIDIA DLSS in Performance mode, the feature is the prime candidate, together with the demanding Virtual Shadow Maps, that will be cut or heavily cut down to achieve acceptable performance.</p>
<p><iframe title="DF Direct Weekly #212: Big Xbox Price Hikes, Doom The Dark Ages Path Tracing, Far Cry 4 60FPS!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FTAW38VTIJQ?start=6242&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While the system may struggle with the complete set of Unreal Engine 5 features, the Nintendo Switch 2 handles Cyberpunk 2077 rather well, so there's a solid chance the system will be pushed beyond expectations once developers get more comfortable developing games for it. We won't have to wait much longer to finally see what the system will be capable of, as it finally launches worldwide on June 5th.</p>

			<p><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/author-sues-bungie-for-copyright-infringement-over-destiny-2s-story">Last year</a>, writer Matthew Kelsey Martineau filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against Bungie, claiming that the studio had stolen his work to create the story for Destiny 2.</p>
<p>Martineau claimed that Destiny 2's Red Legion was pulled straight from his work, which was published on WordPress in 2013 and 2014. Bungie responded with a motion to dismiss the case, saying (per <a href="https://thegamepost.com/bungie-pushes-back-destiny-2-red-war-lawsuit/">TheGamePost</a>) that Martineau's claim "<em>failed to plausibly allege that Bungie copied constituent elements of Plaintiff's work that are original, and, specifically, that the Complaint fails to plausibly allege factual copying by Bungie and that the works incorporated by reference into the Complaint are not substantially similar as a matter of law</em>."</p>
<p>Demonstrating that has become an issue, however, as <a href="https://thegamepost.com/court-denies-bungie-dismiss-destiny-2-red-war-lawsuit-youtube-wiki/">TheGamePost</a> reports that the court denied Bungie's dismissal claim because Bungie cannot provide the court with the original content from Destiny 2 to demonstrate the differences between Bungie and Martineau's work. Bungie can't provide the court with Destiny 2's original content because it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-content-removed-vault-beyond-light-november/">vaulted</a>, and it's now incompatible with the modern-day version of Destiny 2.</p>
<p>Bungie game director Tyson Green described why Bungie can't provide the game's original content, clarifying that "<em>the 'Red War' and 'Curse of Osiris' legacy builds can no longer run because their outdated code is incompatible with Destiny 2's underlying operational framework, which has evolved considerably since the 'Red War' and 'Curse of Osiris' campaigns were retired</em>."</p>
<p>Unfortunately for Bungie, Green's statement wasn't enough for Judge Susie Morgan, who won't accept YouTube videos of the game's original content or wikis as admissible evidence.</p>
<p>"<em>While Plaintiff does reference Destiny 2 in his complaint</em>," Judge Morgan's dismissal decision reads, "<em>he does not reference the YouTube videos containing Destiny 2 game footage, the Destinypedia pages, or the Tyson declaration.</em>"</p>
<p>Judge Morgan acknowledged that this is an extremely complicated copyright case and not typical compared to previous examples of copyright infringement, which also seems to be part of why the case is moving forward at all.</p>
<p>Vaulting content has never been popular with Destiny players, and while Bungie certainly has its reasons for doing so, those decisions are seemingly coming back to bite them in more ways than just facing the ire of players.</p>

			<p>Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition is undoubtedly the best-looking version of the open-world game developed by Rockstar Games, but this doesn't stop modders from taking the game's visuals to the next level.</p>
<p>A new 4K resolution video shared by Digital Dreams shows the latest version of the fifth entry in the series by Rockstar Games running with mods such as <a href="https://www.patreon.com/crxhvrd/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CoreFx</a> and <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/lively-world-for-124497674">Lively World</a>, two known graphics and immersion improvement mods released for the original version of the game that were later ported to the Enhanced Edition. Needless to say, the two mods introduce noticeable enhancements that can make players forget the game initially released over a decade ago and possibly make the wait for the next entry in the series more bearable.</p>
<p><iframe title="[4K100] GTA 5 Enhanced: modded CoreFX - Lively World BeyondallLimits RTX5090 RAYTRACING Graphics" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/juHYo9QMU54?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Fans of the Rockstar Games series will have to make do with Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition for a while longer to experience the best the series has to offer, as Grand Theft Auto VI will not release as initially scheduled. <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/">Last week</a>, Rockstar confirmed the game will now release on May 26th, 2026, on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, as the studio requires additional development time to deliver the level of quality fans expect. While the public was only informed of the delay last week, the fact that the game would slip to 2026 was known for a while at Rockstar Games, due in part to <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-reportedly-had-no-chance-of-releasing-in-2025-for-months-due-in-part-to-a-real-desire-to-avoid-crunch/">a real desire to avoid crunch</a>, which is commendable.</p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition is now available on PC. You can learn more about how this new version of the game breathes new life into the popular open-world game by checking out Alessio's analysis.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/clair-obscur-expedition-33-new-mod-allows-easy-configuration-of-additional-graphics-settings-for-better-visuals-and-performance.1181244/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-mod-additional-graphics-settings/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 mod now available for download allows users to easily tweak additional graphics settings not available in-game without modifying engine configuration files directly.</p>
<p>The Expedition 33 - Unreal Config tool, created by Bighead and now available on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/clairobscurexpedition33/mods/119?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a>, is a very handy tool that creates and configures engine configuration files for the game, allowing users to tweak additional graphics settings not available in-game to achieve better visuals, performance, or both. The tool, which is compatible with both the Steam and the Xbox Game Pass versions of the game, also comes with some built-in presets that can be selected as a base configuration to help users tweak these settings.</p>
<p>Though plenty of mods have been developed for the game, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is absolutely enjoyable in its vanilla form, as it is one of the best role-playing games released in the past few years. With an incredibly compelling story, a charming cast of endearing characters, and excellent gameplay, the debut game from Sandfall Interactive is well worth experiencing, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Before launch, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 looked like a solid yet safe role-playing game, but Sandfall Interactive’s debut shattered expectations in the best possible way. With a gripping story, a beautifully written cast of characters, and engaging gameplay that breathes new life into familiar mechanics, the game is a journey that leaves a lasting mark on both the mind and the heart.</em></p>
<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide.</p>

A new report states that only players who have purchased a battle pass for the FPS will have access to modes tied <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-squid-game-event-includes-red-light-green-light-operator-bundles-and-rewards/2900-6100/#1">to special events, like the Squid Game collaboration</a> earlier this year.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KC9Qz9edHJyjR5XCMy5slTzprus4SFSrq3CtSqnkEYc/edit?tab=t.0" rel="nofollow ">Call of Duty insider "The Ghost of Hope"</a> wrote <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1919060883696722210" rel="nofollow ">on X</a> that Activision is looking to "have more seasonal LTMs," but they will be locked behind the battle pass. Currently, all Call of Duty players have access to these events and modes, though people can buy a premium track pass to earn items and skins if they want. Apparently, this report states those premium tracks wouldn't exist starting with Call of Duty 2025.

Actual businesses don’t have the luxury of gambling like that, however.</p><p><em>Reuters</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/trump-announces-100-tariff-movies-produced-outside-us-2025-05-04/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/trump-announces-100-tariff-movies-produced-outside-us-2025-05-04/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a></span> that Hollywood execs were scrambling last night to figure out what the hell was going on.

                <p>A Minecraft Movie continues to soar at the box office, climbing above $870 million after about a month in theaters. This weekend, it faced new competition from Marvel's Thunderbolts* movie, and here's how the two films compared for their opening weekends in the US and globally.</p><p>Thunderbolts* made $76 million in the US for its opening weekend from May 2-4.  For comparison, A Minecraft Movie debuted on April 4 and made $162.7 million worldwide over its first weekend in the US alone. This past weekend was A Minecraft Movie's fifth weekend in theaters, and it made $13.7 million in the US. Movie theaters held "block party" screenings of the movie this weekend, during which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-minecraft-movie-getting-a-theatrical-block-party-edition-inviting-viewers-to-basically-go-wild/1100-6531180/" data-ref-id="1100-6531180">attendees were encouraged to go wild.</a></p><p>Thunderbolts* made $162.1 million worldwide for its opening weekend, compared to $301 million for A Minecraft Movie.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/thunderbolts-box-office-solid-opening-1236206794/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, $76 million in the US for Thunderbolts* was "slightly ahead" of expectations, with the report noting that Thunderbolts* featuring relatively lesser-known characters might have factored in to the movie's performance so far.</p><p>Thunderbolts* reportedly had a production budget of $180 million, compared to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/06/business/a-minecraft-movie-box-office.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$150 million for A Minecraft Movie.</a></p><p>A Minecraft Movie is the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/highest-grossing-video-game-movies-of-all-time/2900-3968/" data-ref-id="2900-3968">No. 2 highest-grossing video game movie of all time</a>, only trailing The Super Mario Bros. Movie ($1.3 billion). Another video game movie is currently in theaters, too, as Sony's Until Dawn movie has now earned <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt30955489/?ref_=bo_se_r_1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$34.8 million worldwide</a> against a reported $15 million budget.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, Warner Bros. is reportedly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-minecraft-movie-2-sounds-like-a-sure-thing/1100-6530854/" data-ref-id="1100-6530854">close to announcing A Minecraft Movie 2.</a></p>

			<p>Chief executive officer of Lords of the Fallen studio CI Games, Marek Tyminski, claims that he has data proving "'<em>modern audience' is a false myth.</em>'"</p>
<p>On his personal<a href="https://x.com/tyminski_marek/status/1918051654336684343"> X account</a>, Tyminski wrote, "'<em>Modern audience' is a false myth. Data prove it now. Making games for them is a path to extinction.</em>" It's the latest seemingly culture war-related post from Tyminski, who commonly engages with and reposts statements from other culture war grifters online.</p>
<p>Previously, Tyminski has <a href="https://x.com/tyminski_marek/status/1906468008354062627">claimed</a> "<em>Video games have gotten way too political</em>" and that this alleged change is "<em>Not good for the industry. My company won't be part of it. Bad for gamers, bad for shareholders, and bad for talent</em>." Earlier this year,<a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-studio-dei/"> CI Games stated</a> that the studio would not integrate elements of DEI into its games moving forward.</p>
<p>He doesn't follow up his post with any kind of data or research into his claim, though it's possible he's referring to the <a href="https://x.com/tyminski_marek/status/1878494267762520464">polls on X he's conducted</a> on topics like whether players want to choose between body type's A/B or if they'd prefer the option say male/female.</p>
<p>Recently, Lords of the Fallen released a major 2.0 update that <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lords-of-the-fallen-frustration-your-side/">Wccftech's reviewer</a> notes is a <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lords-of-the-fallen-2-0-is-a-massive-improvement-over-the-launch-version/">"<em>massive</em>"</a> improvement on the game compared to the state it launched in. Which included making Lords of the Fallen a more forgiving game to help acclimate new players when they first step into Lords of the Fallen, with modifiers provided to allow players to ramp the difficulty back up, if they choose to do so.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hundred-line-last-defense-academy-ps5-xbox-unlikely<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you've been holding your breath for&nbsp;Kazutaka Kodaka and Kotaro Uchikoshi's JRPG&nbsp;<em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy&nbsp;</em>to hit other platforms, then it's probably safe to let that breath out, unfortunately.</p>

<p>That's according to a post by Kodaka on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kazkodaka.bsky.social/post/3loblywautc2f" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>, in which he says that there are "no plans" to bring the JRPG to other platforms. Not only that, but the chances of that happening in the future are "very slim", according to Kodaka.</p>

<p>Kodaka's post was in response to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ethangarcia.bsky.social/post/3lnapnme7ms2n" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a user</a> who asked how long a port might take if&nbsp;<em>The Hundred Line&nbsp;</em>is successful, as well as whether other translations might become available in time. Kodaka says he'd "love to get started" on localizations, but that his studio Too Kyo Games is "still on the brink of going under".</p>

For that reason, he says he'll share updates about future plans "when the time comes", encouraging players to enjoy the game "without any worries".</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</em>, it's a tactical RPG co-authored by Kotaro Uchikoshi and Kazutaka Kodaka, the creators of the&nbsp;<em>Zero Escape&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Danganronpa&nbsp;</em>franchises respectively.</p>

<p>Released <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy-release-date" rel="nofollow">last month</a>, the game's development saw Too Kyo Games <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/danganronpa-creators-new-game-risking-lives" rel="nofollow">indebted as a result of securing financing</a>, so Uchikoshi and Kodaka will no doubt be hoping that&nbsp;<em>The Hundred Line&nbsp;</em>is a success.</p>

<p>At time of writing, the game's player count is sitting at 8,200, with a 24-hour peak of 9,053 and an all-time high of 10,026. Those are some pretty respectable numbers for a very niche JRPG, but whether they're enough to save Too Kyo is another matter.</p>




<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3014080/The_Hundred_Line_Last_Defense_Academy/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.

                <p>Earlier this month, Fallout creator Tim Cain noted that the source code for the original Fallout and Fallout 2 was lost and thought to be destroyed. But that has turned out to not be the case. Interplay co-founder Rebecca Heineman has revealed that they saved the source code for both games and other titles that the company worked on. But that required defying orders to destroy them.</p><p>Heineman told <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/fallout-1-fallout-2-source-code-isnt-actually-not-lost-reveals-former-interplay-founder/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VideoGamer</a> that they began archiving the source codes for Interplay's games in 1993 after realizing that the company had lost the code for Wasteland and wasn't keeping an archive of its older titles. Heineman recovered Wasteland's code from a source at EA and took up a personal quest to preserve Interplay's gaming heritage.</p><p>"I made it a quest to snapshot everything and archive it on CD-ROMs," said Heineman. "When I left Interplay in 1995, I had copies of every game we did. No exceptions. When I did MacPlay, which existed beyond my tenure at Interplay, every game we ported, I snapshotted. It included Fallout 1 and 2."</p><p>Heineman went on to explain that Interplay had given standing orders to destroy the property of everyone who left the company, which would apply to them as well. However, Heineman noted that they kept everything in defiance of that order and that the source codes for Fallout 1 and 2 are safely stored on "M-Disc Blu-Rays for long term storage."</p><p>Although the source codes for the first two Fallout games are secure, Heineman can't release them without permission from Bethesda. Heineman intends to ask the company for their approval at some point but hasn't gotten around to it yet.</p><p>According to a recent report, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/there-is-a-fallout-3-remaster-in-the-works-but-its-not-arriving-anytime-soon-report/1100-6530903/" data-ref-id="1100-6530903">Fallout 3 remaster is coming</a> in the future.
