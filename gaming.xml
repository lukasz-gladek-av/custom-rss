			<p>Due to the PlayStation Network outage, Capcom has made the decision to extend the Open Beta Test by a full 24 hours across all platforms. The PlayStation Network outage occurred during the first weekend of the Monster Hunter Wilds Open Beta Test. Specifically, it happened on February 8, and as a result, millions of gamers were left without a way to play their games. This caused players to be locked out of all online services, even their single-player games, if they happened to own them digitally. While players who had them on the disc would be able to play, it would only be the case if the data of the game was already on the PlayStation and did not need to be installed.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Sony didn't really give much of a <a href="https://x.com/AskPlayStation/status/1888454556125708758" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full reason</a> as to why the network was down for so long, but blamed the outage on an "operational issue." Luckily, it sounds as if it was just an internal error rather than the network being hacked from the outside and causing major data breaches across the board.</p>
<p>As a result of the network outage, the Monster Hunter Wilds Open Beta Test 2 will resume today at 7 PM PST / 10 PM ET / 3 AM GMT and will continue until February 17 at 6:59 PM PST / 9:59 PM ET / 2:59 AM GMT.</p>
<p>As the Open Beta Test takes place, players will be able to unlock the participation bonus that will become available in the full version of the game, which is set to release on February 28 on PlayStation 5, PC, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
<p>If you're not sure whether this game will run on your PC, Capcom has released a Benchmark for you to utilize, as well as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-gets-free-benchmark-and-updated-pc-requirements/">full specification requirements</a>.</p>
<p>Like the original beta, Open Beta Test 2 will include a character creator, where the data can then be transferred into the full game. It will also include a story mission and free-roaming hunts with cross-platform multiplayer. Compared to the first Beta Test, this one comes with additional content, such as fighting the Gypceros and the flagship monster of the game, Arkveld.</p>
<p>Alongside those new features, the Training Area and online features such as Private Lobbies and Online Single Player mode are also included in this upcoming Beta Test.</p>
<p>Although it's been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/tWqiYSA-t8E" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced by the Monster Hunter developers</a>, the performance and balance adjustments will not be available in this beta build; instead, the developers are instead focused on implementing these changes in the full release of the game.</p>
<p>Will you be participating in the Monster Hunter Wilds Open Beta Test 2? Let us know in the comments.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds will be released on February 28 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>

Season 2 of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" data-ref-id="5000-630093">Black Ops 6</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone/" data-ref-id="5000-572198">Warzone</a> is themed around ninjas, so there's no better time to bring in the heroes in a half-shell.</p><p dir="ltr">Activision made the TMNT crossover announcement with a <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1890098739915768252" rel="nofollow ">brief teaser clip</a> for Call of Duty, which shows Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael, and Michelangelo peeking out from a sewer manhole. This likely means there will be operator skins for all four turtles. Call of Duty previously had a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-tmnts-shredder-with-a-gun-in-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2-and-warzone-2/1100-6512543/">TMNT collab for 2022's Modern Warfare 2</a>, but the only character featured was Shredder.</p><p dir="ltr">The video doesn't give a specific date for the TMNT collaboration, teasing only that the turtles will be "coming soon." However, the Season 2 Reloaded update is set to include a set of melee weapons, which is rumored to be a pair of sais, nunchucks, a bo staff, and a skateboard. Leonardo's katanas were previously teased in the promotional art for the launch of Season 2. This means the turtles will likely appear with the midseason "Reloaded" update or sometime shortly after.</p><p dir="ltr">Leakers suggested the crossover will include a limited-time event and a special TMNT-themed game mode, but those details haven't been confirmed by Activision. The turtles themselves will likely be included as operator shop bundles.</p><p dir="ltr">A Terminator crossover event is also currently live in Black Ops 6 and Warzone until February 20.

			<p>Announced during yesterday's State of Play, Hell is Us was announced to get an official release date of September 4, 2025. This title comes from Rogue Factor, a company that made Necromunda: Underhive Wars and Mordheim: City of the Damned. This new ambitious title will be developed by Rogue Factor and then <a href="https://www.nacongaming.com/hell-is-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published by Nacon</a>. If this game is something that you want to delve into, pre-orders are now open on the PlayStation Store and will follow suit in the next coming days for Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hell is Us | Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8iZbNIAM8eQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This game was previously announced in 2022, with a <a href="https://wccftech.com/hell-is-us-gets-15-minute-extended-gameplay-video/">15-minute extended gameplay video</a> being released during a State of Play in September last year. In this video, viewers were introduced to the dark world of Hell is Us, where you'd have to explore a war-torn country, going on an investigative journey to uncover the past, as well as confronting the ongoing chaos through the country.</p>
<p>This new trailer introduces viewers to the main character Rémi, who is voiced by Elias Toufexis (Criminal Minds, Supernatural, Assassin's Creed, Starfield) in the English language version of the game.</p>
<p>"I'm delighted to join my friends on Hell is Us. I wanted to take this role because Rémi is particularly interesting: while he may seem cold or reserved at first, we gradually discover the complexity of his character and the events that have shaped his personality," says Elias Toufexis. "The world of the game is so endlessly fascinating. I can't wait for people to play it!"</p>
<p>Hell is Us is a third-person action-adventure game where you rely on melee combat for your main method of attack, with a heavy focus on player-incentivized exploration and a captivating story. Instead of being given markers to show them the way, players are encouraged to follow their instincts. This methodology is being used as an homage and return to the roots of adventure games from the 90s, where hand-holding in video games was very minimal.</p>
<p>You play as Rémi, a protagonist who is on an investigative journey to find who he was in a country that was torn apart by civil war. Along the way, he'll find supernatural creatures that are reminiscent of ancient headstones and monuments that were found in the region.</p>
<p>Along with the Standard Edition of the game, there will also be a Deluxe Edition that you can purchase, giving you some in-game goods. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hell is Us</li>
<li>Hollow Walker Skin + 1 Additional Skin for Rémi</li>
<li>Digital Artbook</li>
<li>Hollow Walker Skin + 1 Additional Skin for The Drone</li>
<li>Digital Soundtrack</li>
<li>Secret Code for in-game bonus</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, if you pre-order the game, you will be rewarded with a Military Pack. If you pre-order the Digital Deluxe Edition, you'll get 72-hour early access to the title.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fortnite-is-receiving-yakuza-skins-soon-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1108797/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-is-receiving-yakuza-skins-soon-its-claimed/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>According to a reliable leaker, Fortnite’s next game collaboration could be with the popular Like a Dragon series (formerly Yakuza).&nbsp;</p>



<p>ShiinaBR, known for providing players with Fortnite leaks at the earliest, recently posted about the Yakuza collaboration on <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1889756376404029528" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a>. Their post revealed that the series’ beloved characters, Kazuma Kiryu and Goro Majima, will be coming to Epic’s popular battle royale. <span>The information comes from&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/Wensoing" target="_blank">Wensoing</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD" target="_blank">Loolo_WRLD</a>&nbsp;on X. Kiryu was the initial protagonist for the series, whereas Majima leads their latest game,</span>&nbsp;Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii. </p>



<p>Fans are already pumped for the Fortnite x Yakuza collaboration, with many hoping for a slew of emotes and song tracks for which the Like a Dragon series is popular. Players have also started discussing alternate outfit options for the characters, such as “<a href="https://x.com/Hakuji_03/status/1889846041928933738" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the Mad Dog style and the Cabaret Manager style</a>”. Some wonder if Ichiban Kasuga could be added in the future, too.</p>



<h2 id="h-yakuza-is-a-good-fit-for-fortnite-s-lawless-season">Yakuza is a Good Fit for Fortnite’s Lawless Season</h2>



<p>In other news, Fortnite is gearing up for a new season called Lawless, which will be released on February 21, 2025. The next adventure takes players to Crime City, where Big Dill is dropping their new single. According to ShiinaBR, the upcoming season’s vaults can’t be opened with key cards and must be broken into with <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1889782607249818034" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">thermite</a>. Releasing the Yakuza collaboration with the upcoming season makes sense, too, as it matches the “Lawless” theme.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>
Pokémon fans attending this month's big meetup in Los Angeles are being encouraged to bring a can of soup along with them. 
</p>
<p>
The initiative is part of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> developer Niantic's push to aid LA's wildfire relief efforts - which also involves a joint $1m donation from the developer and The Pokémon Company group.
</p>
<p>
Some fans were unsure whether Pokémon Go Tour: Unova - Los Angeles would still go ahead at the city's Rose Bowl Stadium later this month, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/riot-tells-staff-impacted-by-la-wildfires-that-what-matters-most-is-taking-care-of-yourselves-and-each-other">January's devastating wildfires</a>. 
</p>
<p>
But after several weeks of uncertainty, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-offers-refunds-for-los-angeles-event-following-wildfires">Niantic confirmed at the start of February that the event would continue as planned - with optional refunds</a> for those who decided they no longer wanted to attend.
</p>
<p>
"For ticket-holding Trainers attending the in-person event, Niantic will host a donation drive at Rose Bowl Stadium supporting the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank.
</p>
<p>
"The Los Angeles Regional Food Bank supports food pantries across Los Angeles County, and we encourage ticket-holding Trainers who are able and willing to participate in this drive to bring one can of protein or low sodium soup to the event."
</p>
<p>
Numerous <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-announces-donation-to-los-angeles-wildfire-relief">video game and entertainment companies have donated to LA wildfire relief efforts</a> over the past month.
</p>
<p>
Treyarch co-founder Peter Akemann - who more recently served as president of Skydance Interactive - has pleaded guilty to flying the drone that crashed into, and grounded, a firefighting plane assisting in the efforts to control the wildfires. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/treyarch-co-founder-pleads-guilty-to-flying-drone-that-crashed-into-firefighting-plane-during-la-wildfires">He now faces up to a year in prison</a>.

		<p>Raw Fury and developer Ground Shatter have announced that their pun-tastic medieval sequel Knights in Tight Spaces is coming to PC on 4th March. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2315400/Knights_in_Tight_Spaces/">A demo is available to play now on Steam</a>, and you can wishlist to note support for the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="⚔️ Knights in Tight Spaces | Date Reveal Trailer | Wishlist Now! ⚔️" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Be9T5dAxzfw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Knights in Tight Spaces is, obviously, a successor to the more business suit brawling of Fights in Tight Spaces, but looks to take that idea to a whole new realm. A fantasy realm.</p>
<p>You’ll still be battling it out with enemies in small arenas, but this time it’s knights, rangers and wizards fighting against skeletons, banshee, bandits, other knights and more. Your main character is the titular knight, but you can hire others to fight alongside you, join a secret society (or not) and then see how far you can get in the roguelite format of this game.</p>
<p>All of your actions are determined by the cards in your hand, but they now combine with the different classes and gear you’ve equipped. you also need to be mindful of your surroundings, carefully positioning yourself around enemies and obstacles to get a tactical advantage, building up combos to release special moves.</p>

<p>We loved the first game in this series, saying in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/12/02/fights-in-tight-spaces-review/">our Fights in Tight Spaces review</a>, “Fights in Tight Spaces is a really unique and stylish take on the deck building genre with a level of strategy on offer that will be enough to keep people coming back for a long time. Fights in Tight Spaces is worth your attention.”</p>

<p>Milestone has announced the official release date for Monster Energy Supercross 25. Available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, the game is scheduled to launch on April 10, 2025.</p>



<p>It’s been two years since the last game in the franchise, and the developers at Milestone have been “re-inventing” the franchise “from the ground up.” Monster Energy Supercross 25 sees the franchise make the move to Unreal Engine 5 and leave the last-gen systems behind.</p>



<p>“[With] Unreal Engine 5, the game delivers a graphical overhaul with a cutting-edge physics system for precise control over riders and bikes, both in the air and on the ground, as well as the integration of neural AI for increased immersion,” Milestone said. “This package of novelties will result in a more realistic and simulative gameplay which all fans will get to master through dedicated tutorials.”</p>



<p>Along with the release date, a short gameplay showcase trailer was released to give players a look at the gameplay changes coming with the new game. You also get a look at the Anaheim 1 and Glendale circuits with their 2025 layouts as well as a custom-built Motocross course exclusive to the game.</p>



<p>Monster Energy Supercross 25 launches April 10. Those who pre-order the game will get access starting April 7.</p>

<p>Pokemon TCG Pocket card listings have been spotted on eBay, with players charging around $10 for some cards.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/people-are-making-money-selling-virtual-pokemon-tcg-pocket-cards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Gamer</a>, Pokemon TCG Pocket cards like <a href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/405516225584?_skw=pokemon+trading+card+game+pocket&amp;itmmeta=01JKZ7CQRGBCSSKACZV0DRADFH&amp;hash=item5e6aa68c30:g:X6kAAOSwb4FnnyZ-&amp;itmprp=enc%3AAQAKAAAA4FkggFvd1GGDu0w3yXCmi1eF6GR6UIxsrCeh9V9p9DhqadEgZyZ5Xp9TDFdXwq3aEI2tK5%2BeaL%2BSWVUFnlsgHgMEPCr%2BYiz6rzyrQrwdjWu81kj9hGgPEj8Wz8nf5fvi8%2FDOZLjnu%2FHT%2FD9A0WJGCAj7nvDXW76koW6z7dheEVkYiKNanxupqbXAah7pKys5xz9dv6fQG%2FcMHqApI8KgJTwSCbYNPmJFtPdb2BVpsVf2uCRL0ZIG%2FdK8EHBT%2BnEY0LhYflRGtWNBnLLqaHsTq63haDs0b4FhT4w68S8PsdAN%7Ctkp%3ABk9SR7T8suefZQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Blastoise Ex</a>, <a href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/316188339515?_trkparms=amclksrc%3DITM%26aid%3D1110006%26algo%3DHOMESPLICE.SIM%26ao%3D1%26asc%3D280766%26meid%3D4d4addc9a15446559b0d13c582e1788b%26pid%3D101224%26rk%3D2%26rkt%3D5%26sd%3D316188373597%26itm%3D316188339515%26pmt%3D0%26noa%3D1%26pg%3D2332490%26algv%3DDefaultOrganicWebV9BertRefreshRankerWithCassiniEmbRecall%26brand%3DPok%25E9mon&amp;_trksid=p2332490.c101224.m-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Mewtwo Ex</a>, <a href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/405516259939?_skw=pokemon+trading+card+game+pocket&amp;itmmeta=01JKZ7CQRGGP8QY4S7PQ1EXW1Q&amp;hash=item5e6aa71263:g:9IkAAOSw1GJnnyqL&amp;itmprp=enc%3AAQAKAAAA4FkggFvd1GGDu0w3yXCmi1f4BEHVgCJq8rJeMbdXEbBdJG8VpHIbnDQlWd0Lp7qNEKWy1%2Bq6A2CrGmBzIV2qahSdEr8agf955XrOO2GfsbBBfWdB5jEIIhrn%2B9dU7wEDniSYs%2BjQKXYmkaz%2FRbOzR3u2ZRzaetp%2F87cuBvmAwDhN3JX6pLPfeNq2K7noujawG0nh5AbSewwstejyIeDyJFuSl%2B1NUCX5zx907NaSJOP80bV7XnQJ%2FywHpsBrojP770YDG6ZVAmebITPKUlu%2FtKjb5Vlbxjq7ealMxLsnbUcg%7Ctkp%3ABk9SR7T8suefZQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gengar Ex</a>, and more have been listed on eBay, with prices ranging from $4 to $10 for each card. Players on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1ioctqy/this_is_actually_insane_lol/?share_id=ZW-qMKXrJkBFfLFq-ZP_M&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">r/PTCGP</a> subreddit have also caught on, with one user posting a screenshot of someone trying to get $5 out of them for a Tauros. The community on the subreddit wants such players to be reported instantly, but the game doesn’t have the feature. However, some wonder how one would prove a card was sold or not sold for real money outside the app, even if a report feature existed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The eBay listing for these cards has appeared even after Pokemon TCG Pocket rigorously tried to stop players from using real money to trade. The developers have already notified players that using “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-real-money-trade/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">real money</a>” to trade is an offence that can get them banned. Moreover, the developers had instilled <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-restrictions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">restrictions</a> into the trading feature to prevent such behaviour, but players have clearly found a way past them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Interestingly, one of the restrictions of Pokemon TCG Pocket’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-trade-cards-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trading feature</a> states that players can only trade cards of the same rarity, which means the eBay traders will receive a new Ex card for every Ex they trade. This means they can keep doing these trades until the developer catches them.</p>



<p>In other news, Pokemon TCG Pocket recently gifted players <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-is-gifting-players-free-trade-tokens/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1,000 free trade tokens</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/some-overwatch-fans-are-thrilled-loot-boxes-are-coming-back-some-not-so-much<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Blizzard Entertainment laid out the roadmap for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a>'s coming months yesterday, confirming a massive overhaul of the hero shooter. There was a lot to dig into, from perks and the incoming Stadium mode to plenty of cosmetics, but one notable piece of Overwatch history also returned: loot boxes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-reveals-radical-overhaul-of-overwatch-2-including-return-of-loot-boxes-perks-and-third-person-mode">Loot boxes are returning to Overwatch 2 with Season 15</a>, and it's spurred some interesting discussion around whether that's a good thing or not. For those unfamiliar, these boxes are drops you can accrue over time, which will randomly spit out an Overwatch cosmetic at random once you open them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Loot boxes were a core part of Overwatch 1's original monetization model and methods for doling out cosmetics, especially for those who would rather spend time than money. They had seasonal variants, great animations, and were a way to build up a modest portfolio of skins, poses, and highlight intros even if you weren't spending extra cash on Overwatch.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Overwatch 2 Season 15 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, loot boxes have also been a historic point of contention in the industry. Reports called them <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lootboxes-manipulative-exploitative-new-report">manipulative and exploitative</a>, and some players found them — alongside similar microtransactons like gacha — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/heres-how-loot-box-addiction-destroys-lives">addictive</a>. As <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/genshin-impact-developer-agrees-to-20m-fine-over-loot-box-violations">recently as last month</a>, these forms of microtransactions were eliciting fines. Overwatch itself <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-battle-pass-store">ditched the model years ago</a>, shifting to a free-to-play, battle pass-driven model.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To those points, it's not surprising that the return of Overwatch's loot boxes will look a bit different from its previous iteration. For one, loot boxes are a free offering; Blizzard confirmed to IGN that you can acquire loot boxes through free means, like the battle pass' free track or weekly rewards, but you won't be able to buy them directly. Secondly, there are some relatively helpful mechanics for getting boxes and finding what you want. Game director Aaron Keller <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRoM9B6vmhw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">confirmed in an interview with Overwatch content creator Emongg</a> that duplicate drops can be re-rolled, and other venues for boxes (like Discord and Twitch promos) will be available. Plus, it sounds like the team is dipping into past Overwatch cosmetics for box fodder, even adding things that aren't available in the current shop.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So with all that laid out, how is the Overwatch community responding to the return of loot boxes? Well, that's a little complicated. A celebratory post on the Overwatch X/Twitter account, below, has a mix of enthusiasm and jabs in the replies.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>LOOT BOXES. ARE. BACK. 🙌🎁</p><p>Available in both the Battle Pass and weekly rewards, see what surprises are waiting for you when Loot Boxes make their official return in Season 15 🎉 <a href="https://t.co/BGZmIlii5d" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/BGZmIlii5d</a></p></div>— Overwatch (@PlayOverwatch) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1889741290394227102?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 12, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Some streamers <a href="https://x.com/BroYouWack/status/1889766365575131588" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">showed genuine excitement</a> at the return of loot boxes, and if you head over to the Overwatch subreddit, you'll also <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1inyadh/ladies_and_gentlemen_loot_boxes_are_back/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">find some threads</a> where players are happy to see loot boxes back. The sentiment is largely carried by this being a free option for progression. Plus, in my opinion, nostalgia is a factor. The animations and tangible tension, hoping for a legendary drop, all rekindles some of Overwatch 1's original vibes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, there are criticisms of loot box's return. With all the aforementioned fines and stories around microtransactions, the tone around loot boxes has shifted quite a bit since Overwatch launched in 2016. And though these boxes are free to stack up over time, there are <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1inywdx/overwatch_2_is_bringing_loot_boxes_back_from_the/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">plenty outside Overwatch-affiliated spaces</a> who are sceptical about their return.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I do think this highlights another interesting critique. Overwatch bringing back loot boxes, combined with ongoing 6v6 experiments, the new Perk mechanics, incoming Stadium mode, and more all paint a picture of a studio trying to drastically overhaul its game. The fact that loot boxes seem to be resonating most with the Overwatch fans, both current players and those who have moved onto other games, lends some credence to it. Bringing back loot boxes as a free offering and doling out past cosmetics through it feels like a strong play for nostalgia, a return to an older, "classic" form of Overwatch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One thing's for sure: Blizzard certainly seems like it's trying to pick up momentum in 2025. Alongside the heroes, cosmetics, and maps you'd expect from a live-service shooter, Perks seem set to dramatically shift the play space, and Stadium could go even further. We'll see how all that, loot boxes included, pans out for Overwatch 2 when Season 15 goes live on February 18.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

This is joined by a PlayStation 5 Pro patch, which allows the best resolution while running at 60 frames per second.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Detailed in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/02/13/astro-bot-five-new-levels-and-special-bots-begin-rolling-out-today/?sf276380355=1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation Blog</a> post, Tick-Tock Shock is the first level available now. Subsequent stages — Thrust or Bust, Cock-A-Doodle-Doom, Hard to Bear, and Armored Hardcore — will be available each following Thursday at 6am Pacific / 9am Eastern / 2pm UK.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Unlike our last update Winter Wonder, which was a walk through the Xmas park, this new update features harder levels to test your jumping skills," said director of developer Team Asobi, Nicolas Doucet. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Each level comes with a brand new Special Bot to rescue and, once that’s done, can be replayed in Time Attack mode with online rankings."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the third full wave of Astro Bot downloadable content, which began with a similarly structured five speedrun levels after launch and, until this release today, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-reveals-free-expansion-coming-to-astro-bot-this-week">most recently saw a special Christmas themed level released</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players have long expected more DLC, however, as a number of unreleased bots appeared in the Astro Bots credits. Featured here are licensing credits for Rayman, Worms, Assassin's Creed, Beyond Good &amp; Evil, Croc, and Tomba, potentially revealing which five special bots will be released alongside these levels. That being said, Armored Hardcore is almost certainly a reference to Armored Core, while Cock-A-Doodle-Doom is likely Doom, so bots from these franchises are also likely.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-exclusive-astro-bot-sells-15-million-in-2-months">Astro Bot has proved incredibly popular for PlayStation, having sold 1.5 million units in its first two months</a> on sale and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-review">earned a 9/10 in IGN's review</a>. "A fantastically inventive platformer in its own right, Astro Bot is particularly special for anyone with a place in their heart for PlayStation," we said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

Unlike weapons or armor, unique gloves cannot have their passive ability upgraded, meaning the stats above are the set stats for the gloves.

                <p>Captain Henqua's Spoils is a treasure map found in Dawnshore, the first area of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/avowed/" data-ref-id="5000-516154">Avowed</a>. This treasure map can be found on top of the lighthouse, which is located just west of Calviger's Landing, which is in the southern part of the map and where you first arrive in The Living Lands. To reach the top of the Lighthouse, head to the base of the building and use ledges and scaffolding to climb to the top of the tower, moving in a spiral around the building. Tracking down this treasure will reward you with a Superb quality shield far earlier than you can normally get one.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Where to find Captain Henqua's Spoils</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4441408-henqua6.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4441408" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4441408-henqua6.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4441408"></a><figcaption>Henqua's Spoils are found in an underwater cave at the location shown above.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4441408-henqua6.jpeg"></figure><p>After obtaining the treasure map from the top of the lighthouse, follow the river north until you reach a broken archway over the river, just next to the Western Pargrun Wall Beacon fast travel point.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4441409-henqua2.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4441409" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4441409-henqua2.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4441409"></a><figcaption>From here, jump into the river and swim underwater towards the shore you jumped from.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4441409-henqua2.jpeg"></figure><p>On the southern side of the arch, go to the river bed and look for a large amount of roots.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4441410-henqua3.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4441410" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4441410-henqua3.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4441410"></a><figcaption>Swim through the hole shown above.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4441410-henqua3.jpeg"></figure><p>Jump into the water and look for a small opening heading west, which leads to a cave with the shield and a treasure chest inside.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4441411-henqua4.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4441411" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4441411-henqua4.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4441411"></a><figcaption>The shield is the quest item, while the chest contains additional loot.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4441411-henqua4.jpeg"></figure><p>Collecting the shield will mark the quest as complete.</p><p dir="ltr">Your reward for finding this treasure is the Wind and Wave Superb Quality shield.
