<p>Valve has been making headlines this week with its latest lineup of hardware, and rumours suggest that the company isn't done with the announcements just yet...</p>
<p>Assuming for a moment that we're probably not going to get <strong>Half-Life 3</strong> or <strong>Portal 3</strong> anytime soon, however, we're quite happy with the news that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/chromagun-2-dye-hard">Chromagun 2: Dye Hard</a> will be making its way to the Switch 2 on <strong>12th February, 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>If you've played <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/chromagun">the first entry</a>, then you'll probably know the gist already. Chromagun 2 is a homage of sorts to Valve's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/portal_companion_collection">Portal</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/portal_companion_collection">Portal 2</a>, but instead of portals, you'll be messing around with colours. Essentially, by matching coloured items found within the levels, they'll attract via magnetism and allow to you solve intricate puzzles.</p>
<p>The first game was pretty neat and we awarded it a solid score of 8/10. So we're expecting some good things with the upcoming sequel! Now let's check out the key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- A one-of-a-kind tool - The ChromaGun: Wield the titular "ChromaGun," a versatile paint-gun used to shoot primary colors onto surfaces and objects, mixing them to manipulate the environment</p>
<p>- Magnetoid Chromatism: Master the key mechanic of "Magnetoid Chromatism" - a proprietary concept where Droids and other objects are magnetically attracted to walls of the same color.</p>
<p>- Multiverse Puzzles: Travel through time and space across different dimensions and parallel universes, each introducing new physics and increasingly complex mechanics.</p>
<p>- State of the art accessibility: Pixel Maniacs developed a unique accessibility game mode overlaying symbols on colored objects to help color blind players to enjoy the game too! With this well thought feature, ChromaGun 2 Dye Hard won the Horizon Award for Technical Innovation at GG Bavaria 2025!</p>
</blockquote>

			<p>Another week, <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/geforce-now-thursday-call-of-duty-black-ops-7/">another batch of games added to NVIDIA's GeForce NOW streaming service</a>, though this week is arguably a bigger one than most. Not only are there 12 games in total joining the service this week alone, but one of the biggest releases of the year headlines this week's additions: Call of Duty: Black Ops 7.</p>



<p>Black Ops 7 is, of course, the biggest addition to GeForce NOW this week, though there is something to be said about playing a competitive shooter over cloud streaming, which is just that your mileage may vary. What's perhaps a better choice of game to play over NVIDIA's cloud streaming, and a game that's also joining the list of GeForce NOW titles that are RTX 5080-ready, is Anno 117: Pax Romana.</p>



<p>And as of this week, GeForce NOW users in Phoenix will be able to take advantage of those RTX 5080 cards, as Phoenix, Arizona, is the latest region to join the ever-growing list of places RTX 5080 servers are available. On deck is Stockholm, and if you're curious about when your region can be added, you can <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/server-upgrade/">check out the server rollout page on NVIDIA's website</a> to see where RTX 5080 servers will be available next.</p>

<ul>
<li>Surviving Mars: Relaunched - Nov. 10</li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Over the last five years, <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> games have gotten a bit strange. Cards featuring characters from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/690509/how-to-play-final-fantasy-magic-the-gathering-set"><em>Final Fantasy</em></a>, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/tabletop-gaming/magic-the-gatherings-spider-man-set-is-only-just-fine-which-isnt-good-enough/">Spider-Man</a>, and, in a few weeks, <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em> are starting to show up with increasing frequency, making a typical Friday Night <em>Magic</em> game look more like a match in <em>Fortnite</em>. For some, this is a welcome change, allowing <em>Magic </em>to entice newcomers and invigorate existing players with properties they know and love. But others feel this focus on licensed sets comes at the expense of <em>Magic</em>’s identity, quality, and longevity.</p><p>Depending on who you talk to, <em>Magic</em> crossover sets have been around since the early days of the game with the Arabian Nights set released in 1994. But the modern idea started in 2020 with <em>Magic</em>’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/11/25/magic-the-gathering-reveals-new-secret-lair-drop-series-with-wild-art">Secret Lair</a> product. Originally, Secret Lair products weren’t full sets, or even original cards. Existing <em>Magic</em> cards were revamped with new art from popular artists or IPs and sold at a premium as collector’s items. However, with <em>The Walking Dead</em> Secret Lair, <em>Magic</em> publisher Wizards of the Coast decided to create totally new cards set within Robert Kirkman’s zombie universe — and it blew up.</p><p>“From Wizards’ side, it was a slam dunk,” said <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/shivambhatt.bsky.social">Shivam Bhatt</a>, an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@casualmagicwithshivambhatt"><em>MTG</em> content creator</a> and former <em>MTG</em> consultant who’s been a player for most of the game’s 30-year history. “Make six cards, sell a gillion of them, and you get a chance of getting people to come into the game.”</p><p>From there, <em>Magic </em>expanded on that formula, going from six-card Secret Lair drops to developing whole decks for the game’s Commander format. To set this new family of cards apart from cards set within <em>Magic</em>’s own storytelling universe, Wizards of the Coast called these crossovers <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/magics-voyages-universes-beyond-2021-02-25">Universes Beyond</a>, or UB. These experiments sold so well that <em>Magic</em> decided to expand again into full sets, starting with <em>Lord of the Rings</em>, which, at the time, became <em>Magic</em>’s best-selling set ever. It was official: UB was a hit, which was a good thing for Wizards’ parent company, Hasbro.</p><p>“Ultimately, the reason Universes Beyond exists is because Hasbro is a dying company,” said <a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/content/author/Emma-Partlow?srsltid=AfmBOorhzPSruQd-Yq23nG7zXmKUkofHXwwTJwJ54XwkR_jDRhqjkXLv">Emma Partlow,</a> <em>MTG</em> content editor at TCGPlayer, one of the biggest resources and retailers for collectible card games. “But if you put Wizards of the Coast in that they’re just breaking records every quarter, they’re one of the only things keeping Hasbro afloat.” (Hasbro’s <em>Monopoly GO!</em>, frequently at the top of most-downloaded mobile games lists, <a href="https://investor.hasbro.com/news-releases/news-release-details/hasbro-reports-second-quarter-2025-financial-results">is the other</a>.)</p><p>These successes led to WotC going all in on Universes Beyond, so much that it’s starting to cause concern among <em>Magic</em>’s core player base. <em>Magic</em> is a heavily stratified game with different formats in which different sets of cards are legal to use. These different sets were arranged on two different release tracks: standard and supplemental. On the standard track are all the sets that are legal in the Standard format — the main competitive format of <em>Magic</em> — and form the core of <em>MTG</em>’s yearly release schedule. The supplemental tracks are the sets that are for different formats, like Commander and Modern.</p><p>Up until this point, Universes Beyond has largely been kept on the supplemental track, and in 2021, Wizards of the Coast said that’s where it’ll stay. “Universes Beyond cards will not be Standard legal,” <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/magics-voyages-universes-beyond-2021-02-25">read a blog explaining Universes Beyond</a>. “This is purely a cool thing we’re doing in addition to all the other cool things we’re already doing.”</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The </em>Final Fantasy MTG<em> set was the best-selling set in the game’s 30-year history.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>But that calculus changed in 2025 when the first Universes Beyond sets were permanently brought onto the standard track. <em>MTG</em>’s vice president of design, Aaron Forsythe, <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/aligning-the-universes-making-all-our-sets-legal-in-all-our-formats">explained</a> that the change was essentially to give the players outside the Standard format a new place to play their cards, but it seems to be coming at the expense of existing Standard players.</p><p>“The number one problem with Universes Beyond is that [Wizards] decided to put them in the core competitive formats so they’re no longer an opt-in product,” said writer, games journalist, and <em>Magic </em>enthusiast <a href="https://aidanmoher.com/">Aidan Moher</a>. “You can no longer ignore it.”</p><p>In 2025, the split between in-universe sets and UB sets was even at three apiece. Next year will feature a Ninja Turtles set, a Marvel superheroes set, <em>The Hobbit</em>, and <em>Star Trek</em>. For the first time, UB sets will outnumber the in-universe ones, which could be alienating to players who enjoy <em>Magic</em> for its own distinct storytelling universe. “I think a lot of people are feeling threatened in their space just because here’s all this advertisement seeping into <em>Magic</em>,” Partlow said.</p><div><p>“I think a lot of people are feeling threatened in their space”</p></div><p>There’s also a concern with these sets’ quality and price. While <em>Final Fantasy</em> was <a href="https://articles.starcitygames.com/magic-the-gathering/mtg-final-fantasy-already-the-best-selling-set-of-all-time/">a runaway success</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/mtg-magic-the-gathering-spider-man-survey-wizards/">the next UB set, Spider-Man, was not</a>. Like many games, <em>Magic</em> sets take years to design and develop. Spider-Man, being a UB set, was originally conceived as a supplemental set, which typically has fewer cards than a standard one. However, the decision to switch from supplemental to standard required that designers add more cards to fill out the set.</p><p>“It felt like it was just thrown together,” Bhatt said. “It felt cheap and rushed and unpleasant.” There’s also the setting of Spider-Man itself, which, according to Moher, didn’t quite match <em>Magic</em>’s high-fantasy identity. “All of a sudden you have a card that’s <a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/651951/magic-marvels-spider-man-bagel-and-schmear?srsltid=AfmBOopwKGpX4Y1fJbWGrJj3am_8mwYZnUpmEaqHWgDhG4hxwHH5GwlJ&amp;Language=English">bagel and schmear</a> or like the guy on the computer,” he said. “It’s just strange and anachronistic.”</p><p>That antipathy is impacting the game’s secondhand market. Packs of Universes Beyond cards typically cost a few dollars more than in-universe packs. That cost increases for higher-end products like collector’s boxes and on the secondhand market. Like <em>Pokémon</em> cards, <em>Magic</em> has its own speculative market with people buying up product in hopes of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/2/23817243/one-ring-magic-the-gathering-post-malone">selling at higher prices later</a>. But with the current cadence of UB sets combined with the poor reception of Spider-Man, even the collectors are tuning out.</p><p>“The audience is like, ‘I’m not going to buy it,’” Bhatt said. “‘I’m just not going to pay you $40 or $60 for a Spider-Man collector booster pack, because I don’t care.’”</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->5</strong><span><figcaption><em>An example of how some of the cards in the Spider-Man set create a dissonance with </em>Magic<em>’s traditional magical fantasy setting.</em></figcaption> <cite>Image: Wizards of the Coast</cite></span></p></section><p>Even though Spider-Man didn’t hit the mark the same way <em>Final Fantasy </em>or <em>Lord of the Rings</em> did, many fans are still enjoying these crossovers. On his personal blog, <a href="https://markrosewater.tumblr.com/post/766239595791810560/hey-mark-i-have-played-against-a-few-ub-decks-and"><em>MTG</em> head designer Mark Rosewater wrote</a>, “The reason Universes Beyond is so successful is because many longtime, invested, enfranchised <em>Magic</em> players enjoy it.”</p><p>The next UB set, <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em>, launches on November 21st. Based on pre-launch sentiment in the <em>MTG</em> community, it feels like a set that won’t suffer the same reception or quality issues that Spider-Man had. Universes Beyond is here to stay. When<em> Fortnite</em> first started incorporating characters like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/11/23301844/goku-dragon-ball-z-fortnite-new-crossover-teaser">Goku</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/28/22954749/naomi-osaka-fortnite">Naomi Osaka</a>, it was mocked for being an unserious cash grab. Now, it’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/streaming/789954/kpop-demon-hunters-fortnite-event">a celebrated feature</a> of a game that continues to dominate the most-played charts. <em>Magic </em>can have that too.</p><p>“In an ideal world, there would be more <em>Magic</em> sets than UB sets,” Partlow said. “I think that is the balance [Wizards] needs to strike. And if it wants to keep its core audience, that’s what it needs to do.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/report/819098/magic-the-gathering-universes-beyond-avatar-final-fantasy-spider-man]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/jbl-charge-6-bluetooth-speaker-is-practically-free-an-all-time-low-you%E2%80%99ll-only-see-for-early-black-friday.1352503/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good music can bring life to any party, but not all speakers are made equal. If you’re after something that’s portable enough to travel with and powerful enough to fill any room with rich sound, JBL’s Charge 6 Bluetooth speaker is a great option to consider.</p>
<p>On a regular day, it would run you around $200, which we won’t exactly label a budget buy. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5551/">But right now, Amazon has it marked down to just $130, thanks to a nice 35% early Black Friday discount.</a> The deal is available on all color options. Prefer your audio gear with a classic look? Consider the classic Black option. Want your speaker to have a bit more personality? The cool Squad version is up for grabs, too. Of course, like all massive discounts, we’re not expecting this one to stick around for long. We’re also not sure if it will be back for Black Friday, so it’s best to take advantage of it while you can!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5551/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Sound That Fills Any Room</h2>
<p>The size is compact, and it comes with a removable strap, which makes it quite convenient to carry it with you on the go. Redesigned hardware and JBL AI Sound Boost come together to deliver deeper bass, better highs, and clear lows without any distortion. It’s enough to fill any room with your favorite tracks, whether you’re listening to something energy-filled or winding down with some relaxing music after a long day.</p>
<p>The Charge 6 is more than enough to get the vibe going on its own, but if you’re after bigger sound, Auracast lets you link up other JBL speakers for bigger, wider coverage. Just ask your friends to bring theirs, and keep the party going all night long.</p>



<p>Battery is just as impressive. You’re looking at around 24 hours of playtime on a single charge, which easily translates into around two days of fun. If you need some extra juice and cannot plug it in, JBL Playtime Boost gives you an extra four hours of jamming. Charge 6 is also rated IP68 waterproof and dustproof, plus can survive 1-meter drops onto concrete. Take it to your off-road adventures, on the beach, by the pool, and even in the shower for a private concert without a worry.</p>
<p>All in all, this speaker not only offers great sound, but also easy portability, durability, and a long battery life that keeps the fun going.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>In a growing field of copycat Soulslikes, <a href="https://kotaku.com/lies-of-p-review-pinocchio-soulslike-bloodborne-sekiro-1850857903"><em>Lies of P</em> stands apart</a> as one of the best. This year’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/lies-of-p-dlc-weapons-bosses-hltb-prequel-expansion-2000618041"><em>Overture</em> DLC</a> proved the game wasn’t a fluke. Now, the publisher behind the Pinocchio-punk action-RPG has confirmed it has a whopping five games currently in various stages of development, and only one of them is <em>Lies of P 2</em>.</p>

 <p>The South Korean mobile gaming giant Neowiz’s upcoming slate was outlined in <a href="https://cdn.neowiz.com/neowiz-site/assets/ir-library/3Q25_NWZ-IR-PPT_EN-itjp3znq.pdf">its latest earnings report</a> as part of a multi-phase plan. The first phase revolves around a handful of new mobile games and published projects coming next year. The second phase is much more ambitious and outlines several PC and console projects from different genres aimed at driving “global expansion.” Here’s how they’re listed:</p>

 <ul> <li>Life Simulation New Project – Life Simulation – PC/Console</li> <li>Survival Action Adventure New Project – Survival Action Adventure – PC/Console</li> <li><em>Lies of P</em> Sequel – Souls-like RPG – PC/Console</li> <li>New Project by Seungho Jin – Narrative-based RPG – PC/Console</li> <li>New Project by Kay Lee – Souls-like RPG – PC/Console</li> </ul> <p>The life sim and survival action games seem pretty self-explanatory. Seungho Jin directed the anime-style visual novel <em>Buried Stars</em>, though it sounds like his new game will push more into RPG territory. Maybe something in the vein of a turn-based Atlus game?<em> Lies of P</em> was made by in-house subsidiary Game8. It’s unclear if they’ll be involved in this second Soulslike RPG or if Kay Lee will be leading a completely separate team.</p> <p>Hopefully, most of these projects comes out and at least some of them are good. It’s interesting to see more South Korea-based publishers and developers move into bigger, single-player PC and console releases. It suggests the success of games like <em>Lies of P</em> and <em>Stellar Blade</em> has proven there are lucrative opportunities outside of free-to-play grinds and gacha casinos. Though it’ll probably be several years yet before we see the next wave.</p>

                <p>Former PlayStation executive Shuhei Yoshida has discussed cancelling games during his tenure at the company, including a new IP from God of War developer Santa Monica Studio. Sony had invested $25 million into the game, saw potential in it, but ultimately decided to shut it down and eat the cost.</p><p>Yoshida said on the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Plu6ciaLMfso6xWbRqQuz?go=1&amp;sp_cid=5b691c77600e893959bfe6b75f0ea351&amp;utm_source=embed_player_p&amp;utm_medium=desktop&amp;nd=1&amp;dlsi=5fccf9ee027b4228" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">My Perfect Console podcast</a> that this new game was not a God of War title, but it had a "really amazing concept and very interesting gameplay ideas." Sony worked on this game for "many years" but after spending $25 million on it, the studio itself approached Yoshida to say things were not working out.</p><p>"They came to me and said, 'We have to stop.' I do not exactly remember the reason--probably the team was not able to find the game. It was a great concept, great idea, but you know, the gameplay didn't really come to be," he said, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/shuhei-yoshida-recalls-when-he-cancelled-two-25-million-game-projects-including-one-by-god-of-wars-santa-monica-studio/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as reported by VGC.</a></p><p>Yoshida did not provide a timeline for when this occurred, however. Earlier this year, it was reported that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-cancels-two-games-including-a-live-service-god-of-war-report/1100-6528869/" data-ref-id="1100-6528869">Sony canceled a live-service God of War game</a>, but the one Yoshida is speaking about was a new IP.</p><p>Also in the interview, Yoshida said cancelling games is a normal part of the business because the creative process involves lots of iteration. Cancelling games early in their development "doesn't cost us much," Yoshida said, but it was a "really hard decision" to cancel the new IP at Santa Monica Studio because of the time and money involved.</p><p>"But I think in this case, the team at Santa Monica Studio by themselves was like, 'You know, we probably have to stop,'" Yoshida said.</p><p>Yoshida also discussed another game he oversaw the cancellation of, and this was a title from an unspecified European studio. Yoshida did not share much in the way of specifics, but said this was a "big-budget project" that lacked a "core game" and did not go ahead.</p><p>"These days, $25 million cancellation is nothing special. [There are] much bigger cancellations," he said.</p><p>Yoshida went on to say cancelling these projects was ultimately in the best interest of the developers and the business overall. "If we continued, it just got bigger and bigger in terms of [financial] loss, and the developers eventually get tired of working on these. And it's not healthy to work on something that's struggling for the longest time," he said.</p><p>Yoshida added that, when the decision to cancel a game came down during his time at Sony, he tried to communicate with the developers about how it might be rough to abandon a project, but sometimes it's necessary. "Not doing this means we can do something different, something new, like brand new. So let's do the fresh restart," he said he told developers.</p><p>Yoshida also made headlines recently for saying he would have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ex-playstation-exec-says-he-would-have-resisted-sonys-live-service-push/1100-6528881/" data-ref-id="1100-6528881">"resisted" Sony's push into live-service games</a> and that he was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-sony-exec-on-the-one-playstation-game-he-was-surprised-didnt-sell-like-he-thought-it-would/1100-6528860/" data-ref-id="1100-6528860">surprised Horizon Forbidden West didn't sell as well as expected.</a> Yoshida also talked about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-playstation-exec-theorizes-bloodborne-director-is-too-busy-for-remaster/1100-6528852/" data-ref-id="1100-6528852">why there hasn't been a Bloodborne remaster yet.</a> He left Sony earlier this year <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-veteran-shuhei-yoshida-announces-retirement-from-sony/1100-6528084/" data-ref-id="1100-6528084">after 30+ years. </a></p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Over 200 employees from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-north">Rockstar North</a> have signed a letter to management, in which they have condemned the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-developer-rockstar-accused-of-union-busting-after-it-fires-dozens-of-developers">firing of their fellow staff members in a move seen by many as 'union busting'</a>.</p>
<p>In this letter, Rockstar North's employees demand their colleagues - all of whom were Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB) Union members - be reinstated. This letter follows protests held in London and Edinburgh earlier this month, which were held in solidarity with the fired employees. Further protests are planned to take place in London, Edinburgh and Paris later this month.</p>
<p>The employees had been in the process of forming a union within the company. This union was known as The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a> Workers Union, and aimed to push for better working conditions ahead of the release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>.</p>
<p>PRIM</p>
<p>"It's heartwarming to see so many of our colleagues supporting us and holding management to account - during a period where Rockstar want us to feel scared, my brave former colleagues are marching straight up to our boss's door and demanding our voices are heard and not backing down," said one fired employee, who withheld their name to protect anonymity.</p>
<p>"It's clear to everyone close to this situation that this is a blatant, unapologetic act of vicious union busting. Rockstar employs so many talented game developers, all of whom are crucial to making the games we put out."</p>
<p>Rockstar itself has claimed the recent firings were due to misconduct, including leaking information in public channels. However, the IWGB has refuted this, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unacceptable-and-unlawful-gta-6-developer-rockstar-hit-with-legal-claim-from-uk-trade-union-following-alleged-unfair-dismissal-of-staff">yesterday announced it had issued a legal claim against the Grand Theft Auto developer</a>.</p>
<p>In a further statement today, IWGB organiser Fred Carter said: "By deciding to fire more than 30 union members, Rockstar have carried out an Amazon-style act of union-busting unprecedented in the games industry. This is a company that benefits from more than £440m in UK tax relief, while displaying a callous and blatant disregard for both the livelihood of workers and the letter of the law."</p><p>Rockstar recently made further headlines after it made the decision to<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-gta-6-is-delayed-again-by-half-a-year-to-november-2026-take-two-stock-immediately-begins-to-drop"> delay the release of GTA 6 from May of next year into November</a>. At this time, publisher Take-Two, the most recent GTA 6 delay is designed to give "some additional time to finish the game with the high level of polish players expect and deserve". It added "Rockstar has our full support of course", and that the Take-Two team is "confident they will deliver an unrivalled blockbuster entertainment experience".</p>

            <p>Dispatch writer Pierre Shorette regrets cutting sex scenes from AdHoc's episodic superhero workplace comedy.</p>
<p>The first series of Dispatch wrapped last night, with the release of episodes seven and eight. While much of our time in the game was spent - as you would surmise given its name - dispatching a ragtag team of antiheroes to calls about everything from stuck cats to bomb threats, over the last few weeks we have also watched the characters and their relationships grow thanks to a range of narrative based choices and cinematics.</p>
<p>However, there were some more romantic scenes cut from the final release, which Shorette says on reflection the team "shouldn't have". <strong>Please be aware of some Dispatch spoilers below. </strong></p>

<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/dispatch-romance-deleted-sex-scenes-telltale-developers-exclusive-interview">Inverse</a>, Shorette acknowledged that many Dispatch fans were especially invested in the game's relationship and romance options, and despite there only being two to pursue, they became a "meaningful" part of the experience.</p>
<p>In Dispatch, players can choose to date either Blonde Blazer or Invisgal (who has a rather steamy dream about your character, Robert), though neither of these story lines is the main focus of the game. However, the team wasn't expecting the reception to Dispatch to be as "ravenous" as it has been, and that's "probably why we didn't plan for more romance options".</p><p>Shorette continued: "One of my secret shames is I think I default to romantic comedy in my writing and my whole life. I'm trying to pull out of that and make things more serious. Even in Wolf <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/among-us">Among Us</a> or Tales From the Borderlands, there's some romance."</p>

<p>The writer said he doesn't "know that Dispatch is any one thing", adding that seeing streams of the game has allowed him to see what has worked. "So if we can have people freak out at seeing a wiener on screen, laugh at a fart joke, and then somehow cry at the end of all that. I'm happy it's working, but I also don't think we made a 'gooner game,' and people know that now if they've played up to Episode six," Shorette said. "It's interesting to see the community switch up real fast, and lock in."</p>
<p>And, well, we now all know that the romance parts of Dispatch definitely worked. But, alas, some of those moments didn't make the final release. "We definitely cut some sex scenes. Which, in retrospect, we shouldn't have," Shorette laughed, teasing we may yet "get to see those one day".</p>

<p>"There isn't anyone on the development team that wouldn't have a laundry list of stuff they wish they could polish more or gotten into the game. On the writing side, our team has a bunch of darlings that had to be killed along the way," the writer closed. </p><p>"We're still an indie studio, I think people forget that because it's doing so well and looks so good. But because it looks good, it costs a lot per second to make this video game, and sometimes it costs things that often with these games is branching too."</p>

<p>Earlier this year, AdHoc announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-episodic-gaming-back-on-the-map-ex-wolf-among-us-devs-superhero-workplace-comedy-dispatch-sells-big-to-become-a-well-deserved-smash">Dispatch had sold over 1m copies in just 10 days</a>. Thanks to this success, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-dispatch-getting-a-second-season-well-thats-something-the-developer-is-definitely-going-to-think-about">the studio is now considering a second season</a>.</p>
<p>For more, our Bertie has also been playing Dispatch, and this has left him quite excited about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/critical-role-working-on-its-first-video-game-which-will-be-set-in-exandria">AdHoc's involvement with the upcoming Critical Role game</a>. "That Dispatch made me think over and over that 'this feels like a Critical Role animated show' is some of the highest praise I can heap upon it. That's not because Critical Role is the be-all and end-all of everything creative - it is brilliant, and it is endearingly wholesome - but it's because hitting those presentation heights is hard to do," he wrote in Eurogamer's feature <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-is-brilliant-which-is-great-news-for-critical-role-fans">Dispatch is brilliant, which is great news for Critical Role fans</a>.</p>
<p>"I didn't think a Telltale-like game was capable of it. But Dispatch has proved me wrong."</p>

		<p><em>Have you tried to buy anything lately? It's weird.</em></p><p><em>In Rob's case, it's trying to sell something (a condo) because he bought something (a house) at the worst possible time. In Patrick's case, it's trying to buy something (strawberries) and realizing "wait, is that more expensive now or is it just out of season?" (sometimes)</em></p><p><em>Trump is purposely tanking the economy, in ways big and small, over a strange lifetime obsession with tariffs. A grand economic experiment only felt by the kinds of people who pay attention to their credit card bill at month's end, aka just about everyone. </em></p><hr><p><strong>Rob</strong>: The other day I was at the grocery store and couldn't find orechiette. It's a little shell-shaped pasta, nowhere near as ubiquitous as spaghetti or fettucine but not a speciality item by any stretch of the imagination. The closest substitute was several shelves' worth of huge conchiglioni, about the size of an actual conch shell compared to the thumbnail-sized orechiette I was looking for.&nbsp;</p><p>Actually, as I looked closer at the shelves, there was a <em>really </em>weird selection from Barilla and De Cecco. There was an absurd amount of little bow-tie farfalle. No penne but tons of rigatoni. I'm not going to get into tier-listing pasta here, because every pasta has its place and mission, but I don't think anyone will be offended if I say that all the crowd-pleasers outside spaghetti were in short supply and what was left was stuff that couldn't really substitute.</p><p>A couple days later I read that a massive tariff on imported pasta is poised to hit the Italian food market and wondered if I'd just had bad luck or if I'd encountered a Trump Pasta Shortage. Was there, somewhere, a bunch of brokers snapping up contracts for bucatini and fusili like at the end of <em>Trading Places</em>, preparing to control the supply as prices are about to soar? Am I going to spend the next few years thinking, for the first time in my life, whether we can afford to make something with fettucine?</p><p>In the scheme of things, this stuff is minor compared to SNAP benefits or Border Patrol and ICE agents spending weeks gassing random people on the street before posing in front of the Bean Chicago like Wehrmacht troops marching through the Arc de Triomphe. But I also think there's a pervasive strangeness to the second Trump administration where you're never sure if something is just a weird coincidence or a harbinger of some looming systemic collapse or kleptocratic market manipulation.</p><p>We talked before the election about how bizarre and frustrating it is to see the Republican Party treated as if it exists in a world of policy hypotheticals. The fact the Republican brand has been "good for the economy" throughout my lifetime is laughable given the track record they've assembled. They are pro-business only insofar as they serve the whims of established, market-dominating incumbents and financiers, ensuring the rich get richer. I can look at my grocery bills since the summer and it's clear that I effectively had my taxes raised by corporate America, collected in installments at the till every week. Meanwhile, my actual taxes? Probably stolen to pay for National Guard deployments and base housing for Trump goons rather than local projects the funds were earmarked for. Meanwhile the Democrats have elected leadership that have turned important Senate seats into the most lavishly appointed cuck chairs in history. Chuck Schumer got new glasses for the second Trump term and I guess now we know why.</p><p>But really it's just hitting home for me the degree to which my entire adult life is going to be defined by Republicans trashing the country and profiting amid the ensuing chaos and anger. I graduated into an economic collapse and, predictably, now that I am selling my first home, the market <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/u-s-home-turnover-rate-at-lowest-level-in-decades-as-housing-slump-drags-on-analysis-finds?ref=remapradio.com"><u>has completely tanked</u></a>. You can almost mark the moment units in my building stopped selling: May of this year. Shortly after the tariff chaos began and before immigration raids started terrorizing specific communities and huge segments of the workforce. If I'd listed my place before Trump took office, I'd likely have sold within a month for about $50,000 or $60,000 more than I'm likely to get, to say nothing of the four months I'll have been paying a mortgage on an empty condo. We're well into "life-altering" amounts of money here. Did I just get unlucky with the timing of the end of a long real estate boom, or is a Republican government the equivalent of an unending series of black swan disasters?</p><p>I don't write all this to plead hardship. I'm incredibly fortunate to be in this position at all, and there are people for whom these pressures determine whether they can afford rent or healthcare at all. But I don't think I've ever felt like there is such a direct connection between my individual circumstances and the news I read. It's like Trump and Russell Vought are my new roommates in a way that's never been true of any other administration. Imagine if instead of fireside chats FDR just went around like a fucked-up Santa eating everyone's leftovers and blocking their toilet. That's what we've got now.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@towfiqu999999?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Towfiqu barbhuiya</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Patrick: </strong>One of the more curious things about the current state of play is that it’s just hard to <em>tell</em>.</p><p>Like, for example. Strawberries. My children <em>love</em> strawberries. It does not matter if they’re in or out of season, we’re going to find a way to eat strawberries on a near daily basis. Sometimes those strawberries might be coming from a giant Costco-purchased bag of frozen fruit, but hey, it’s still a damn strawberry.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s not every day you get to snag a fully loaded 17-inch laptop with serious muscle for less, and that’s especially true for options from known brands out there. While we’re still a couple of weeks away from Black Friday, deals on top-rated tech are coming in hot already, which makes it a great time to treat yourself to a new, powerful laptop that you can use for both work and play.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5549/">Amazon is currently being generous with a massive 71% discount on the 17.3-inch HP laptop, which brings it price down to $700.</a> This machine is packed with high-end specs, so finding it at an entry-level price like this is a rare win, and you’re even getting a bunch of useful accessories thrown in for absolutely free. It’s also one of the lowest prices we have ever seen this powerhouse drop to, and the deal is open to both Prime and non-Prime members. We just recommend getting your orders in fast, as the offer might wrap up any moment now.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5549/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Immersive Visuals, Comfortable Typing Experience</h2>
<p>It’s a sleek laptop with a basic, no-fuss design. The build feels premium, and is also quite lightweight for you to carry around easily. The screen size is quite generous. For context, most options in this range offer a 15.6-inch display, so you’ve got significantly more room to work, browse, and stream here. You’ll enjoy crisp, bright visuals thanks to its HD+ IPS panel, and since it’s anti-glare, you won’t have to deal with annoying reflections when working in brighter settings.</p>
<p>Then there’s a full-sized keyboard with a lift-hinge design, which gently elevates your typing angle just a bit to ensure a comfortable position. Those who spend long hours typing won’t have to deal with sore wrists by the end of it.</p>



<p>Performance-wise, you’re covered with an Intel i3-N305 processor with 8 cores, reaching speeds up to 3.8GHz, plus a massive 32GB of DDR4 RAM. That’s enough power to push through a variety of tasks and even multitask during busy days without slowing down. For storage, you get a fast 1TB PCIe SSD. It’s got enough room to store all your important data without constantly needing an external drive.</p>
<p>Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.4 make wireless connectivity easy, and you’re getting a wide range of ports to connect peripherals without feeling limited. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5549/">There’s a lot more to like about this laptop, especially now that it’s down to $700. Just be sure to grab yours fast, before the price shoots back up.</a></p>

<p>Call of Duty has made a big change with Black Ops 7 by introducing a four-player co-op campaign, which, for the first time, has exclusive Camos to unlock.</p>



<p>While earning Camos has long been part of the Call of Duty grind, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-zombie-camo-challenges/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exclusive Camos available in both Zombies</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-multiplayer-camo-challenges/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Multiplayer</a>, Black Ops 7 adds even more to the mix with the campaign.</p>



<p>If you’re on the hunt to unlock every Camo you possibly can in Black Ops 7, keep this guide handy as it details all of the challenges to tick off.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-black-ops-7-campaign-camos-amp-challenges">All Black Ops 7 Campaign Camos &amp; Challenges</h2>

<p>Military Camos have the same requirements across the board, with some exceptions, while Special Camos have specific challenges to unlock.</p>



<p>Finally, there are also Mastery Camos to earn, which require unlocking all the Camos available on specific guns.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/unannounced-valve-game-listing-fuels-half-life-3-speculation/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/unannounced-valve-game-listing-fuels-half-life-3-speculation.1352461/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The hype for a potential Half-Life 3 announcement continues to grow, especially with the knowledge that Valve has an unannounced game under its upcoming releases. The Half-Life 3 hope is higher than ever.</p>



<p>If we discount Half-Life: Alyx (admittedly a phenomenal VR experience), we’ve not had a mainline, multi-platform <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/half-life-player-count/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Half-Life</a> game since 2007. We know Valve and Gabe Newell have explained before that the company doesn’t feel the need to make a sequel, but it’s still one of gaming’s greatest mysteries.</p>







<p>Recent developments are pushing the narrative that Half-Life 3 could finally happen, and an unannounced Valve listing offers another glimmer of hope.</p>



<h2 id="h-valve-has-an-unannounced-upcoming-release">Valve Has An Unannounced Upcoming Release</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We’ll forgive you, Valve, it’s fine. Credit to Valve</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you go to Steam, search for any Valve game, then click on the company’s name, you’ll be taken to the main page. From here, a simple scroll down takes you to the company’s existing and upcoming portfolio.</p>



<p>Clicking on ‘Upcoming Releases’ reveals four products:</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/deadlock-was-the-top-game-on-steam-in-august/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deadlock</a>.</li>



<li>The new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/steam-controller-2-announced-by-valve/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam Controller</a>.</li>



<li>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valve-announces-the-steam-frame-vr-headset/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam Frame</a>.</li>



<li>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valve-reveals-steam-machine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam Machine</a>.</li>
</ul>



<p>All exciting Valve products and releases. However, if you look at the ‘All’ label in the left column, <strong>it clearly says 5, yet only 4 products are displayed</strong>. This more than likely <em>isn’t </em>an accident, and it suggests Valve has another product or game in the works, but perhaps something so big that Valve doesn’t want to announce it yet—see where we’re going with this?</p>



<figure><figcaption>Interesting. Credit to Steam</figcaption></figure>



<p>It wasn’t long ago that a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/half-life-3-trailer-rumoured-to-be-in-production/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Half-Life 3 trailer was rumored to be in production</a>. If you don’t think this is enough evidence, how about the suggestion that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/half-life-3-is-playable-end-to-end-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Half-Life 3 is ‘Playable End-to-End</a>‘?</p>



<p>Again, this is speculation, and we’re not saying this is Half-Life 3 confirmed (we wish). However, Alyx shows Valve isn’t afraid to make more Half-Life games, and with the wind very much in the company’s sails right now, it could be full Steam ahead on Half-Life 3.</p>







<p>We’ve had to sit on the Half-Life 2: Episode Two cliffhanger for nearly two decades, and we think it’s about time we finally get at least one final journey to wrap up the most incredible gaming saga.</p>



<p>Stay tuned. What do you think? Is it reasonable to suggest the long-awaited Half-Life 3 announcement is coming? Or are we blowing this out of proportion?

                <p>Rockstar's 2010 game Red Dead Redemption has been rated for Switch 2, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. The ESRB <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40987/red-dead-redemption/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">recently posted a rating</a> for the game on these platforms, and this has led some to believe a remaster of the game is in the works and that it could possibly launch soon. Nothing is confirmed, however.</p><p>This is all separate from the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/red-dead-redemption-2-ps5-xbox-switch-2-port-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6536035/" data-ref-id="1100-6536035">ongoing rumors of Red Dead Redemption II coming to Switch 2 and getting updated versions for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S</a>. The ESRB database has no rating for Red Dead Redemption II on those platforms, however.</p><p>The ESRB rating for Red Dead Redemption mentions zombies, which suggests the possible upcoming re-release could feature the game's popular Undead Nightmare expansion.</p><p>Red Dead Redemption came to the Switch in 2023 and PC in 2024, some 13 and 14 years after the game originally debuted on PS3 and Xbox 360 in 2010. The follow-up--which is a prequel to the events of the first game--launched in 2018 for PS4 and Xbox One and came to PC in 2019.</p><p>The rumored RDR2 ports for Switch 2, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S are said to be in the works for a 2025 release, while a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-4-remaster-may-be-in-the-works/1100-6531466/" data-ref-id="1100-6531466">GTA 4 remaster</a> could come out this year as well. Whether or not the rumored new versions of RDR and RDR2 could be packaged together is unknown.</p><p>Rockstar owner Take-Two recently said it had eight new iterations of previously released titles in the works that will be released by the end of its 2028 fiscal year, meaning by March 31, 2028. These will be remasters and ports; <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/red-dead-redemption-2-ps5-xbox-switch-2-port-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6536035/" data-ref-id="1100-6536035">only four have been confirmed so far</a>, and some are speculating that the possible re-releases of RDR and RDR2 could be among the announced projects.</p><p>As for Rockstar's biggest upcoming release, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6 has been delayed yet again</a> and is now set for release in November 2026.</p>

<figure><a title="Winter Burrow Review - Screenshot 1 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160505/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>Developed by Pine Creek Games and published by Noodlecake, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/winter_burrow">Winter Burrow</a> is a cosy woodland survival game where you play as a mouse who braves frigid weather, collects food and resources, and rebuilds their childhood home.</p>
<p>It begins with the death of our young mouse protagonist's parents, prompting a return to the long-abandoned family burrow. It's an opening that echoes the call for a simpler, more self-actualised life that is seen at the beginning of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/stardew-valley-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Stardew Valley</a> and many early <strong>Harvest Moon</strong> titles, yet Winter Burrow's beginning is tinged with a sadness that threads itself through the remaining plot in a way that feels appropriate for a cast of wildlife creatures trying to survive a brutal winter.</p>
<p>Given the suitably melancholy start of the game, I was hopeful that Winter Burrow would weave together the cosy and the cruel in a survival landscape equal parts challenging and charming. For a survival game, however, Winter Burrow is lacking in that oh-so-important tension between risk and reward. The resulting experience is surprisingly linear and short-lived despite its artful aesthetic presentation. While you can technically spend as long as you want building furniture and decorating the burrow, gaining access to all the tools and areas through the main plot takes under 10 hours; there’s not much to entertain afterwards.</p>
<figure><a title="Winter Burrow Review - Screenshot 2 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160502/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The art style has often been compared to that of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/donrt_starve_nintendo_switch_edition">Don't Starve</a>, but the two games have distinct approaches to the mechanics of survival. When you die in Don't Starve, you lose all of your progress and must begin again from the start of an entirely different world map.</p>
<p>There are multiple ways to deplete your health in Winter Burrow — taking damage from the varying forms of bugs that wander the wilderness, staying out in the cold for too long, or simply starving — but death isn't actually a possibility for our little mouse. They simply pass out, dropping all of their items in an animation also reminiscent of Klei Entertainment's game, and find themself back at home none the worse.</p>
<p>Passing out would be more of a deterrent if resources were more precious, but it’s easy to replenish everything, from building materials like wood and rocks to ingredients such as nuts and berries. The joy of tracking down and even stockpiling difficult-to-come-by ingredients is half the fun of crafting in survival games. Crafting in Winter Burrow feels like it requires a grocery list more than a treasure hunt. Making new, updated clothing is worthwhile since it generally offers better cold resistance, but the majority of furniture is just for looks.</p>
<figure><a title="Winter Burrow Review - Screenshot 3 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160500/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Winter Burrow is meant to be more forgiving than your everyday survival game, and it certainly accomplishes that. There just isn’t a whole lot gameplay-wise to fill the holes in a survival game that isn’t very challenging. Although the woodland neighbours are interesting and distinctive, their interactions are limited, and once you’re done with the main story, there’s not much reason to stick around.</p>
<p>The Danish developers describe Winter Burrow as a game where “it is you who tells the story.” These kinds of buzz phrases seem to pop up more and more often as the years go on, but it feels like a particularly inaccurate description in this case. The player does not make choices that impact the plot in Winter Burrow. Certain sections of the map are inaccessible without specific tools, which can’t be constructed without completing NPC requests. It’s a plot on a train track - not at all what I would call telling my own story, and a bit out of place with survival game norms.</p>
<figure><a title="Winter Burrow Review - Screenshot 4 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160497/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>What Winter Burrow gets right, though, it gets very right indeed. The art that renders the intrepid winter wonderland is beautiful. The music and sound design lend themselves well to each scene and scenario. A little mouse knitting in a big armchair next to a crackling fire is as cosy as it gets, and don’t even get me started on getting to dress a mouse up in different tiny hats and sweaters.</p>
<p>In terms of performance, the game held up well in both handheld and docked mode, although the images are crisper and the UI is easier to make out while playing docked on a larger screen. It was sometimes difficult to tell what menu option was currently selected while crafting and looking at the required materials in handheld mode, but this is a pretty minor complaint.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Ultimately, Winter Burrow is a fun, cute game that could make for a cosy weekend, but its lack of mechanical depth precludes it from lasting significance.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong: a nice, linear plot and the ability to make cute furnishings for a hollowed-out tree of a home can be a lovely gaming experience. If only because the scaffolding itself is so wonderfully crafted, I wanted more from Winter Burrow than it was able to give.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB) has filed a legal claim against Rockstar Games, following the game developer's decision to <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-developer-accused-union-busting-after-firing-dozens-of-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suddenly fire 31 workers from the Edinburgh office</a> (and three more in Canada). As we previously covered, Rockstar claimed the terminations were due to 'gross misconduct', which was later <a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-says-fired-gta-developers-had-been-leaking-information/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clarified</a> as 'leaking information on a public forum'; however, the workers <a href="https://wccftech.com/anonymous-rockstar-employee-says-there-were-no-leaks-layoffs-union-busting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">maintain</a> that they had been on the verge of unionization after reaching the 10% threshold required by law.</p>



<p>Thus, the IWGB considers this a brazen act of union busting. After a series of protests held in front of the Rockstar North headquarters, the union asked the studio to voluntarily reinstate the workers, who <a href="https://wccftech.com/fired-rockstar-workers-want-to-be-reinstated-get-back-to-work-on-gta-vi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> they wanted to return to work and finish their project (Grand Theft Auto VI, <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">now scheduled for November 19, 2026</a>).</p>



<p>However, yesterday afternoon, the union <a href="https://iwgb.org.uk/en/post/iwgb-issues-legal-claims-against-rockstar-over-unfair-dismissal-of-staff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> Rockstar refused to meet, forcing them to issue the claim. The IWGB's legal department shared the following statement:</p>



<p><em>We are representing employees who were dismissed by Rockstar Games in circumstances that we believe amount to victimisation and collective dismissal linked to trade union activity. Despite our representation and attempts to meet with Rockstar to resolve the matter through negotiation, Rockstar have declined and persisted to terminate members of the union in a manner that is unacceptable and unlawful. Accordingly, we have now issued formal legal claims against Rockstar on behalf of the Claimants. Our members allege that Rockstar’s conduct constitutes trade union victimisation and blacklisting.</em></p>



<p>IWGB President Alex Marshall added: </p>



<p><em>We are confident that what we’ve seen here is plain and simple union busting, and we will mount a full legal defence with our expert group of caseworkers, legal officers and barristers. Employers like Rockstar would do well to understand that private spaces such as trade union Discord servers have protections, and that their company’s contractual clauses do not supersede UK law. This case stands as a warning to any employer in the games industry and beyond who thinks they are able to act with impunity against organised workers - we will not be intimidated.</em></p>



<p>Notably, a legal claim is not the same thing as a lawsuit. Instead, it is an informal request to resolve the matter outside of court. However, if the legal claim isn't successful, the IWGB and the former Rockstar employees will likely have to file a proper lawsuit. Needless to say, the proceedings could take a lot of time, forcing some of them to look elsewhere for employment in the meantime.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Valve has created a PC-based game console that lives under your TV. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/818111/valve-steam-machine-hands-on-preview-specs-announcement">Steam Machine</a> takes everything that’s great about the Steam Deck and adds the raw power to compete with the latest PlayStation and Xbox consoles. It also puts a huge amount of pressure on Microsoft to perfect its Windows and Xbox combination, as the Steam Machine brings Windows games to the living room in a way that Microsoft is dreaming up for its next-gen devices.</p><p>The Steam Machine looks like an Xbox Series X that has been cut in half into a miniature box. The 6-inch cube runs Windows PC games through Valve’s Linux-based SteamOS, and it should have enough power through its two AMD chips to deliver performance that’s close to an Xbox Series X or PS5. Inside, the Steam Machine’s components have all been compacted in a similar way to the Xbox Series X.</p><p>Beyond the hardware, it’s really SteamOS that makes the Steam Machine a viable Xbox and PS5 competitor. Valve failed to make Steam Machines a reality a decade ago, largely because developers had to port their games to Linux for them to run. Valve’s new Steam Machine utilizes its excellent Proton compatibility layer, which allows most Windows PC games to run seamlessly on the Steam Deck and often better than they do on equivalent Windows handhelds.</p><p>While the Steam Machine is a single device and Valve hasn’t announced OEM plans right now, I still think it represents a big threat to Microsoft’s next-gen Xbox plans — and even potentially to Windows PC gaming.</p><p>It’s no secret that Microsoft is working to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682011/microsoft-windows-xbox-pc-combination-features-rog-xbox-ally-devices">combine the best bits of Xbox and Windows</a> for its next-gen consoles, and that means more PC-like hardware and software, just like the Steam Machine. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/799698/xbox-ally-x-review-asus-microsoft-full-screen-experience">Asus’ Xbox Ally handhelds</a> are an early look at the direction Microsoft is heading in for Xbox consoles, with Windows at the heart and an Xbox UI on top.</p><p>Microsoft’s combination of Windows and Xbox feels like a beta right now, though, and one that is shipping on a $1,000 device. Microsoft has effectively made the Xbox PC app into Steam’s Big Picture Mode and suppressed some of the annoying parts of Windows so they’re hidden away. It’s very early days for Microsoft’s vision here, and I personally feel it shipped far too early. The Windows and Xbox teams have a lot of work ahead to improve the Xbox full screen experience and hide the complexity of Windows away. Valve’s Steam Machine now heaps on the pressure for Microsoft to execute its vision perfectly.</p><p>That pressure will only increase if Valve can convince other PC OEMs to build Steam Machines in the future, just like it expanded SteamOS to Windows handhelds. While Microsoft is working on its own next-gen Xbox hardware, sources tell me it also wants OEMs to build future Xbox-branded hardware just like Asus has with the Xbox Ally. That puts Microsoft and Valve on an even bigger collision course.</p><p>Microsoft and Valve are both trying to attract similar audiences, gamers that are intrigued by PC gaming but want a simplified console-like experience, or those who are already PC gamers and want a reliable living room option that plays all the games they’ve already purchased.</p><p>The challenge for Microsoft is that Valve has already perfected SteamOS into a controller-friendly operating system, with a storefront that dominates PC gaming. All the pieces are ready to go for a Steam console, while Microsoft is building out its next-gen Xbox with a combination of Windows and Xbox and without being <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/688407/microsoft-next-gen-xbox-cloud-amd">locked to a single store</a>. The next Xbox now looks set to embrace rival stores like Steam to entice people in, but Microsoft still faces a massive hurdle of convincing people to actually buy games in its own PC store instead of just buying them on Steam.</p><p>Microsoft will undoubtedly lean on its impressive Xbox cloud saves and Xbox Play Anywhere support as parts of its strength to battle Valve’s Steam Machine, but with SteamOS now available across consoles and handhelds it diminishes Microsoft’s cross-device effort. PC Game Pass is still exclusive to Windows, though, so Microsoft’s subscription service will play a big role in helping its next-gen hardware stand apart. Microsoft also has the huge advantage of games like <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Valorant</em>, <em>Battlefield 6</em>, and other multiplayer titles working seamlessly on Xbox, whereas they don’t run on SteamOS due to their complex anti-cheat systems.</p><p>Pricing will also be a big factor in Xbox + Windows vs. Steam Machine. Valve hasn’t finalized pricing yet, but it says “Steam Machine’s pricing is comparable to a PC with similar specs.” That sounds more pricey than a subsidized console, at a time when Microsoft and Sony are both bumping console prices beyond the norm. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/803824/microsoft-xbox-sarah-bond-next-gen-xbox-console-pc">Microsoft is also hinting</a> that its next-gen Xbox will be “a very premium, very high-end curated experience,” so expect more PC-like pricing for those consoles as well.</p><p>As the Steam Machine brings a simplified form of PC gaming to the living room, it also threatens to shine a bigger spotlight on Windows’ performance issues and the direction Microsoft is taking with its operating system. SteamOS has been outperforming Windows in a variety of titles already, leading some PC gamers to take a closer look at Linux for the first time. Combined with a simmering dislike of Microsoft’s direction with Windows from the PC gaming community, the Steam Machine should be a wake-up call for Microsoft to focus on performance and gaming instead of shoving Copilot buttons everywhere.</p><p>The Steam Machine now looks like a well-timed response to Microsoft’s Windows gaming struggles over the years, and an effort that has been in the works for a long time. Valve originally tried to put a box into everyone’s living room with its “Steam Box” effort more than a decade ago. I still remember encouraging my colleague T.C. Sottek to chase after <strong>Gabe Newell</strong> at CES in 2013. The Valve CEO <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/1/8/3852144/gabe-newell-interview-steam-box-future-of-gaming">sat down with us</a> for a rare and wide-ranging interview about the future of Steam and Steam Machines. Much of what Valve was trying to do with the original Steam Box felt like a reaction to Windows 8, and Newell <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/7/25/3186615/valve-gabe-newell-gaming-interface-windows-8-interview">even described</a> the decision to launch Valve games on Linux as a “hedging strategy” against Microsoft. He also described Windows 8 as a “giant sadness” at the time, showing that Valve was frustrated at Microsoft’s direction with Windows more than a decade ago.</p><p>Valve’s hedging strategy now looks like it could deliver the dream of a PC in the living room that Microsoft has been chasing for decades — from Windows Media Center to the Xbox One’s big push with Windows underneath. Except it’s not Windows in the living room, it’s Linux.</p><p>You’d think that would be setting off alarm bells over at Microsoft. Instead, Microsoft Gaming CEO <strong>Phil Spencer</strong> was positive about Valve’s announcement during an all-hands with Xbox employees yesterday. He also <a href="https://x.com/XboxP3/status/1988677531801944496">posted on X</a> to congratulate Valve.</p><p>“Expanding access across PC, console, and handheld devices reflects a future built on choice, core values that have guided Xbox’s vision from the start,” said Spencer. “As one of the largest publishers on Steam, we welcome new options for players to access games everywhere.”</p><p>Microsoft is convinced its path for the next Xbox devices is the right one, but it now has to compete with Steam on its living room home turf to make a PC-like game console a reality. Game on.</p><div><p id="whats-happening-with-the-windows-insider-program"><h2>What’s happening with the Windows Insider program?</h2></p></div><p>In recent weeks the faces behind Microsoft’s Windows Insider program have all announced they’re moving on. <strong>Brandon LeBlanc</strong>, <strong>Amanda Langowski</strong>, and <strong>Jason Howard </strong>have all moved to separate roles inside Microsoft, and it’s not clear who will replace them yet.</p><p>Microsoft assures me that “there are no changes to the Windows Insider Program,” despite the trio all suddenly moving roles at the same time. “While we hire to backfill these roles, the Insider Program will be led by Alec Oot, Principal Group, Product Manager, Windows Servicing and Delivery,” says Chris Morrissey, senior director of communications for Windows servicing and delivery. “We remain committed to listening and learning from our Insiders, continuing our cadence of blog posts as we develop new experiences each week.”</p><p>The current Windows preview build blog posts are unnamed, and I do wonder if they’ll all just be written by AI agents in the future.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hideo-kojima-and-disney-plus-reveal-death-stranding-isolations.1352428/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We already knew Hideo Kojima was working on an anime movie set in the <em>Death Stranding</em> universe,&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/hideo-kojima-physint-od-trailer-showcase-2000627889"><em>Death Stranding: Mosquito</em></a>, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/hideo-kojima-productions-death-stranding-2-od-physint-1851661289">he’d also dropped word</a> that there were other&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding-</em>based adaptions in the works. Well, now we know what at least one of them is going to be:&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding Isolations</em>, an anime TV series created for Disney Plus.</p>

 <p>Kojima’s number-one fan, Geoff Keighley, posted the news to his&nbsp;Game Awards account, stating that the seemingly very brightly-colored series would be arriving from Kojima Productions and E&amp;H Productions on Disney’s streamer some time in 2027.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Death Stranding Isolations has been announced, a new anime series coming to Disney+ in 2027, from the mind of Hideo Kojima. <a href="https://t.co/gY65pFFWkh">pic.twitter.com/gY65pFFWkh</a></p> <p>— The Game Awards (@thegameawards) <a href="https://twitter.com/thegameawards/status/1988808663201640643?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 13, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><a href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/disney-unveils-death-stranding-isolations-from-game-creator-hideo-kojima-1236616004/"><em>Deadline</em></a>, meanwhile, has a few more details about the project, revealing that the series will be directed by&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods</em>‘ Takayuki Sano, and stresses it will be using traditional hand-drawn 2D animation (which is presumably now how we say, “God, no, it’s not using AI.”) It will star the series’ main character, Sam Bridges, in a spin-off story where Bridges is attempting to save America and help others cope in their isolation. The summary continues,</p>

 <blockquote><p>“An old man is trying to realize salvation through ways outside of the connection advocated by Bridges. A female warrior is trying to kickstart a world of constant fighting. A boy holds a grudge against Bridges, and a girl has embraced her loneliness. On the precipice of the end of humanity and the world, their fates and hopes converge, as another story of <em>Death Stranding</em> begins.”</p></blockquote> <p>There’s no word on casting yet, although it would be surely impossible for anyone other than Norman Reedus to voice Bridges. It’s interesting to note that the promotional image doesn’t show him, however, instead presumably focusing on that younger boy and girl mentioned in the blurb. It seems likely that the anime will explore the lives of the individuals Bridges meets on his wobbly journeys, as he helps them reconnect. And hopefully it’ll all be super-fucking weird.</p> <p>Obviously this is still a long way off—given there’s no specific portion of 2027 mentioned, it could be as much as two years before we get to see any of it. But, unlike&nbsp;<em>Mosquito</em>, at least this seems to be showing some sort of plan for when to actually exist.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/funko-pop-practically-gives-away-pok%C3%A9mon-advent-calendar-to-clear-out-remaining-stock-before-black-friday.1352425/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Are those sleigh bells I hear? No, sir. Those are Pokéballs. December is approaching faster than a Blaziken’s Quick Attack. With the holidays right around the corner, why not have some extra fun counting down to Christmas this year? You and your family can celebrate the beginning of the holiday season with this advent calendar from Funko Pop. This set is packed with daily surprises in the form of mini Funko Pop vinyl figures of a handful of your favorite Pokémon. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5548/">Amazon usually lists the mystery box holiday calendar for $50, but ahead of Black Friday, the site has it going for 10% off.</a> That saves you a cool $5, bringing the price to just $45 for a limited time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5548/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Celebrate With Your Favorite Pokémon, One Day at a Time</h2>
<p>This makes an ideal gift for Pokémon fans of all ages. Just get it to them before December, otherwise that kind of defeats the purpose of an advent calendar. How it works is the mystery box contains four rows of six small doors, each containing a beloved Pokémon character. Starting on December 1, you can peel back the layer to reveal who it is behind it waiting in vinyl Funko Pop form. One day, you’ll find Caterpie, the next you might Bulbasaur, then after that maybe Piplup. Every day for 25 days, you get to reveal a new pocket-sized friend.</p>
<p>All Pokémon included are featured right on the box. If you want to keep yourself surprised, I suggest you neither not look at it too closely nor read the following list, detailing each of the 24 Funko Pop Pokémon included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Caterpie</li>
<li>Sylveon</li>
<li>Dragonite</li>
<li>Oshawott</li>
<li>Arcanine</li>
<li>Lucario</li>
<li>Pigeotto</li>
<li>Leafeon</li>
<li>Horsea</li>
<li>Ponyta</li>
<li>Umbreon</li>
<li>Lapras</li>
<li>Munchlax</li>
<li>Psyduck</li>
<li>Charmander</li>
<li>Squirtle</li>
<li>Charizard</li>
<li>Alakazam</li>
<li>Scorbunny</li>
<li>Lapras</li>
<li>Espeon</li>
<li>Eevee</li>
<li>Pikachu</li>
<li>Bulbasaur</li>
</ul>
<p>Predictably, most featured are Gen 1 though there are some later generation favorites getting some love too. 16 are among the first Pokémon we met on our Game Boys back in 1999 while the other nine comprise of mainly later generation starters and various new Eeveelutions.</p>
<p>Each figure is smaller than the standard, popular Funko Pop figures. They measure in individually at a maximum of two inches tall. They are made from a durable vinyl materials. As collectibles, these are built to last—able to withstand daily wear of playtime too.</p>

<p>A new ESRB rating has surfaced for Red Dead Redemption on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch 2. </p>



<p>All we have been hearing from the Red Dead Redemption franchise in recent days has been RDR2. We were recently informed that the game has become the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-2-has-become-the-fourth-best-selling-game-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fourth-best-selling title of all time</a>. We were also told that the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-2-doubted-budget-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was in doubt</a> due to budget and time issues. Now, new details for the original RDR game have surfaced online. </p>



<h2 id="h-red-dead-redemption-rated-for-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-switch-2">Red Dead Redemption Rated for PS5, Xbox Series X/S and Switch 2</h2>



<p>If you head over to the ESRB <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40987/red-dead-redemption/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website</a> right now and search for Red Dead Redemption, you will see that a new rating has surfaced online for current-gen consoles. The rating mentions “PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch 2, Xbox Series”, which hints at the game releasing for these consoles. The rating, content descriptors, and summary are all the same as previous ratings. </p>



<p>Lately, all the rumors that have been circulating are of a current-gen upgrade for Red Dead Redemption 2, which will see the title released for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-2-could-launch-on-switch-2-this-year-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, as well as PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, with upgraded visuals and performance. However, instead of RDR2, the rating has surfaced for the original Red Dead Redemption game, which has confused all the players. </p>



<p>In other news, Rockstar Games has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rockstar-has-delisted-red-dead-redemption-2s-companion-app/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delisted</a> Red Dead Redemption 2’s companion app. Additionally, IWGB has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rockstar-hit-with-legal-claim-after-firings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">issued formal legal claims</a> against Rockstar Games for recent firings.

<p>Finally, Mastery Camos are unlocked when you have gathered all available Camos for a specific weapon, or group of weapon.</p>

                <p>Sony has announced Horizon Steel Frontiers, a new game for mobile devices and PC under development at Guild Wars studio NCSoft. The new entry in the Horizon franchise is an MMORPG that looks heavily inspired by Capcom's Monster Hunter series--albeit with mechanical monsters instead of organic ones--and the PC version will be playable through NCSoft's Purple platform.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qwAulK6db4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9qwAulK6db4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Developed in collaboration with Horizon studio Guerrilla Games, Horizon Steel Frontiers is set in the Deadlands. As a Machine Hunter, players will get to customize their character and embark on large-scale raids, utilizing an "advanced" combat system to secure resources. A release date has not been revealed yet, and the game isn't listed for PS5 or PS4--a first for the franchise considering its PlayStation roots.</p><p>Recently, Sony took Chinese conglomerate Tencent to court over <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/light-of-motiram/">Light of Motiram</a>, a game that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-sues-tencent-over-horizon-lookalike/1100-6533493/">Sony labeled as a "slavish clone" of the Horizon series</a>.</p><p>Since the first Horizon game launched in 2017, the series has steadily grown with expansions, a sequel, and spin-off games like Horizon: Call of the Mountain and Lego Horizon Adventures. Back in 2023, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/horizon-forbidden-west-sequel-in-development-guerrilla-confirms/1100-6513480/">Guerrilla confirmed that it was working on</a> "Aloy's next adventure" and the studio is also rumored to be developing a multiplayer game that will feature a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-horizon-online-co-op-game-confirmed-in-job-listing/1100-6510122/">completely different art direction</a> when compared to the mainline games.</p><p>Outside of games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonys-horizon-movie-gets-release-window-update/1100-6535520/">a Horizon live-action movie is also in the works</a>, with filming expected to kick off in 2026.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Brendan Greene, the game designer better known by the alias PlayerUnknown, who helped create the battle royale genre - first in an Arma mod, then in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/h1z1">H1Z1</a>, then in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds</a> (PUBG) - is planning a new and large-scale multiplayer shooter. The current plan is for the game to support 100 versus 100-player battles.</p>
<p>The shooter is to be the second game in Greene's three-game masterplan, which is underway at his newish studio PlayerUnknown Productions, he told me in a video call. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pubg-creator-brendan-playerunknown-greene-is-about-to-release-his-next-game-and-its-not-what-youre-expecting-at-all">The first game in his plan, Prologue: Go Wayback, a wilderness survival and orienteering game</a>, is already close to release - it arrives in early access later this month, on 20th November.</p>

<p>But to understand the idea for the shooter you have to loosely understand the overarching idea for the three games Greene wants to make. They are significantly different experiences designed to test different parts of an ambitious and potentially industry-shaking new piece of game-making technology. I'm talking about world-generation on a planetary scale. I'm not exaggerating when I say Greene's goals are as ambitious as remaking the internet - but more about that in a separate article.</p><p>Game One, Prologue: Go Wayback, was initially created as a way to implement and test terrain-level planetary generation. Every time you play, the game generates a new 8x8km forested game world for you to survive and explore in. Game Two, meanwhile, will be about testing different systems like shooting and multiplayer.</p>
<p>"Game Two aims to test limited multiplayer, maybe up to 100 versus 100 players," Greene told me. "It's more of an FPS/RTS mix. This is in my head what it is. And the aim is to test terrains at a bigger scale. Therefore we can test FPS mechanics, we can test interaction between NPCs, we can try testing these networking protocols at scale. So Game Two is that.</p>
<p>"And then Game Three," he added, "is where we really go to big-scale multiplayer. And then we can take all the stuff we've learned from the previous two games of generating terrain, enabling players to create their own planets, and having a network that works for whatever you want to use it for, be that an FPS game or whatever you want to create in these worlds."</p>
<p>Big plans, and again, I'll discuss the overarching idea more in a separate article. But how much of Game Two has actually been made or committed to paper? How much of it exists outside Brendan Greene's head? Because remember, Prologue: Go Wayback isn't even available in early access yet, and there's still a year's worth of promised open development to do there, I'm told.</p>

<p>What exists of Game Two? "So far, general high-level plans," Greene said. "I have an idea in my head for the game and we're talking about what it would require from a team - what kind of timeline we expect to do that in. Because this would be using our own engine and not Unreal [as Prologue uses], so it requires Melba [the studio's proprietary engine] to be in a state that artists and designers can work with."</p>
<p>Incidentally, there's a playable demonstration of this world-generating engine, Melba, available on Steam. Look for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2820060/Preface_Undiscovered_World/">Preface: Undiscovered World</a> there.</p>
<p>"But because it's going to be an FPS-type game," Greene continued, "that requires it to be in a very different state to how we released Go Wayback!, for example, which was very much in the early stages. So it requires time."</p><p>How much time? "We have a general idea of how long it will take to get to Game Two," he said, "and then with Game Two we expect another two, three, four years, maybe longer. We have a 10-year plan, more or less, of getting to Game Three."</p>
<p>You can already play Prologue: Go Wayback ahead of its early access release, incidentally, in an open - and free - beta playtest. That's where I've had a ramble around, and I found it a very powerful experience. The forested world is detailed and immersive, and the weather systems are terrifying. Rushing from cabin to cabin as a blizzard breaks and your temperature drops is a tense and thrilling thing. Even inside, you might not be safe, as wind rattles and breaks the windows, and dislodges wooden-planked walls. You'd better make sure there's a fire in the hearth and you've a full belly and you've salvaged all the warm clothes you can find.</p>

		<p>Is an Octopath game still an Octopath game if you’re not following eight different protagonists? That’s the question that Octopath 0 immediately had me asking, as it takes a thoroughly different approach to the series’ classically-framed JRPG action. Built on the foundations of mobile title Champions of the Continent, Square Enix has expanded on that game’s prequel setting and story, bringing a fully-fledged console entry to life, albeit one that does several things very differently from the previous two games.</p>
<p><iframe title="OCTOPATH TRAVELER 0 | Story Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-xSyjJSAkWw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Firstly, you create your own character from the ground up. There’s a decent selection of pixel art poses, hairstyles and voices, though I’d have liked to see a little more variety. There are some unique options here, though, and my favourite choice was being able to create your own favourite food. You select your preferred effect and name the dish, so I will now spend the game eating beef noodles for an attack boost whenever I’m feeling run down. The only problem with this is that I might be constantly hungry in real life.</p>


<p>Aside from that, you also select three personal belongings, each of which might give you some kind of stat boost, or present future opportunities for side quests. A letter you think was given to you by a cat? Consider me intrigued. It all serves to give your hero a little more personality and individuality than you might be expecting, and that can only be a good thing, even if I’m immediately wondering about the loss of those crafted character experiences.</p>


<p>This is the land of Orsterra, a place where legend and history prove to be closely interlinked. Here, the Flamebringer, Aelfric, brought light to the world and sealed away the dark god in the process, but now, evil is once again awakening. For you, however, things begin much more peacefully, awakening, as is so often the case, in a little village in the middle of the countryside.</p>
<p>You’re the child of the Wishvale’s Watch’s leader, son or daughter of Fried, a fearless warrior that everyone in the village looks up to. His presence clearly gives everyone a feeling of safety, and you’re soon competing to become a full member of the watch yourself. The opening couple of hours is spent getting to know the people of Wishvale, your character, and enjoying the idyllic hamlet and the vibrant festival that’s held there. It can’t last, though, and when the soldiers of the Crimson Wings arrive, setting the village ablaze, and murdering your parents, it sets you and your companions on a path into myth and legend.</p>

<p>Octopath 0 continues the series’ visual design feat of tricking your brain into thinking this was what games looked like thirty years ago. It’s clearly not what they looked like, as Octopath 0 is utterly stunning, the HD-2D imagery glistening with a sheen that would make a jeweller blush. There’s something cosy and welcoming about it, with the way lanterns burn with a subdued glow, and snow gently sparkles as it falls, and as seasonal RPGs go, Octopath 0 feels like an ideal candidate for long, wintry nights and wrapping yourself up in a cosy blanket of turn-based combat.</p>
<p>The combat isn’t as gentle as that sounds, or as easy-going as those picturesque visuals would have you believe, and the returning systems from the previous games prove as reliable and engaging as before, rewarding patience and thoughtful timing to inflict the maximum damage on your foes.</p>
<p>You build up your Burst gauge with every standard attack, and as you attack enemies, you move them ever closer to a weakened Break state. The key is biding your time, waiting until enemies are at their weakest, before using your stored-up attacks to unleash a barrage of blows at just the right moment. It felt fantastic in the first two games, and it’s just as enjoyable here.</p>

<p>That journey from a free-to-play mobile title to a full-scale console release is an interesting one. On first impressions, this looks, sounds and feels like a true Octopath title, and shorn of the mobile version’s free-to-play foibles, there’s plenty of encouraging signs that this will be just as impactful as the other entries in the series, especially for fans of classic turn-based RPGs.</p>
<p>While there are no longer eight separate characters to work your way through, the number eight still plays a key role, with eight legendary rings to search for, and the ability to take a party of eight into battle – albeit split across two fronts. As we progress further into the game, it’s going to be interesting to see where else the team have worked in the number eight, and whether the overall shift in the series narrative takes away from, or adds to the winning Octopath formula.</p>

		<p>Ride 6 has been announced by Milestone, with the team aiming to get the game across the finish line and into players’ hands by February 12th. Ride 6 is adding a new Ride Fest career mode, which looks to take some inspiration from the Forza Horizon games, but players will choose from 10 real world racers to compete in the festival, including Casey Stoner, Troy Bayliss and Guy Martin.</p>
<p><iframe title="RIDE6 - Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kuIfwnu1SeQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Ride 6 will have a large roster consisting of 340 motorcycles, though some of these will be part of DLC packages. Those bikes will cover 21 manufacturers and seven categories including Bagger and Maxi Enduro bikes. The game has been developed using Unreal Engine 5 which has allowed Milestone to add in a new dual physics system. This is split between Pro for players who want to get right into the simulation side of Ride 6, and Arcade for players who just want to ride around without having to fiddle too much with different bike parts. The Riding School will allow players to learn different parts of the game and complete challenges, and Ride 6 will also support cross platform play multiplayer. Split screen multiplayer and a race creator are not going to be available at launch for Ride 6, but will come later down the line.</p>
<p>Ride 5 was the last game in the franchise, coming in 2023, but we did not review that. However, Stefan did <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/10/05/ride-4-review/">review Ride 4</a>, saying, <em>“A fairly well-rounded and solid entry in Milestone’s franchise, Ride 4 makes a similarly well-rounded and solid jump to the new generation. There’s no need to compromise on resolution or performance anymore, with the PS5 able to power the game to look its very best, but it’s really the smart take on how to use the DualSense haptics and adaptive triggers that will enhance how the experience feels.”</em></p>

<p>Ride 6 will be available on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series XS.</p>

            <p>Among the trio of new hardware devices <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-announce-a-new-steam-machine-steam-controller-and-the-steam-frame-vr-headset-and-ive-played-them">Valve just announced</a> for 2026 – which also include the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-steam-frame-is-real-and-valve-want-it-to-be-the-last-vr-headset-youll-ever-buy">Steam Frame</a> VR headset and a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valves-new-steam-controller-aims-to-entice-a-broader-field-of-pc-players-which-i-fear-already-includes-me">redesigned Steam Controller</a> – the new Steam Machine is probably the most surprising. Mainly because the original Steam Machines, a series of partner-built SteamOS mini-PCs, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-machines-arent-exactly-flying-off-the-shelves-but-valve-are-sticking-with-linux">sank like rectangular stones</a> upon launching in 2015.</p>
<p>Designed and built entirely in-house, the new model is a very different proposition, though it’s not so much the updated hardware that has Valve believing it’s time to give the Steam Machine another chance. According to engineers Yazan Aldehayyat and Pierre-Loup Griffais, the biggest problem faced by those doomed Machines was one that the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a>’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valves-proton-the-reason-most-steam-deck-games-work-has-a-version-100-beta-to-try">Proton software</a> has solved: a lack of SteamOS-compatible games.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"I think a big part of it was that the software was not quite ready," Aldehayyat replied when I asked what went wrong in 2015. "We learned from the first Steam Machines that we needed to make our developers’ lives a lot easier. So now we have Proton, right? Which is essentially just a compatibility layer that lets games run on Linux, that are originally meant for Windows."</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rock Paper Shotgun</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Proton predates the Steam Deck by a few years, but the handheld was the first major device to show what it could do, allowing punters to play the majority of their already-owned Steam games right out of the box. During the days of the first Steam Machines, the only reliably-running games – unless you got lucky with other, less integrated compatibility tools like Wine – were those that had been manually ported from Windows to Linux, on which SteamOS is based. That meant a relatively tiny library compared to the thousands upon thousands of Steam games that the Deck could run at launch, all without needing any significant input from developers or publishers.</p><p>"Yeah, I think it's really about the games catalogue," Griffais added. "Being able to control your TV, boot directly into the game, launch games and install them in a way that meant you didn't have to install drivers, or that you didn't have to clean up your system after you installed and uninstalled a couple of games... all of those elements were there. We just didn't have a really compelling games library.</p>
<p>"Developers were kind of stuck between the equation of 'Do I want to do a bunch of work to port my game? But there's not an audience for it that justifies this work yet.' So it was a little bit of a bootstrapping problem.</p>
<p>"The catalogue wasn't quite there, but then once we released Proton, we started to see that tendency invert."</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rock Paper Shotgun</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>SteamOS still lacks native support for non-Steam launchers like Ubisoft Connect or the Epic Games launcher. But, the Steam Deck has also shown that it’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-install-and-use-lutris-on-the-steam-deck">fairly</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-install-battlenet-on-steam-deck">easy</a> to get these <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-install-epic-games-launcher-on-steam-deck">working</a> regardless – in turn, further expanding the new Steam Machine’s compatibility umbrella over games that would never have played ball with the older models. And although an increasingly common blockade for the Steam Deck has been its struggles with squeezing adequate performance out of technically demanding games, Valve are sure that the brawnier Steam Machine won’t fall short on speed.</p><p>"For Steam Deck, we had a lot of work to do on performance, but it was kind of a different angle, right? Like it was power efficiency and stuff like that,” Griffais explained. "So even around the Steam Deck release, if you're running SteamOS on hardware like that, maybe the performance wouldn't be exactly on par as it would be on desktop. But [for the new Steam Machine] we've done a tonne of work on desktop performance, ray tracing, and all that stuff, and now we expect that all the same performance advantages are presented in more discrete GPU form factor."</p>
<p>Although I wouldn’t call the Steam Machine a powerhouse, it’s a damn sight quicker than the Deck: while Valve’s engies were telling me all this, I was using it to play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> at 4K (upscaled with FSR 3 in Performance mode) on a combination of Medium settings and Low ray tracing. Between Proton and this added muscle, the new Steam Machine might be a few months off, yet it's hard not to agree that it'll likely avoid the compatibility woes that – in Valve’s eyes – doomed its predecessors.</p>

<p>Shuhei Yoshida has revealed that two PlayStation projects were cancelled after costing $25 million each; one of them was a new IP game from the developer of God of War. </p>



<p>We have heard about a few cancelled games in recent times, including the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-cancelled-multiplayer-screenshots-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game screenshots</a> for the scrapped God of War multiplayer title, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rare-cancelled-everwild-screenshots-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">images for Rare’s Everwild</a>, comments on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-civil-war-former-actor-reacts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancelled Civil War game</a>, and more. Now, Shuhei Yoshida has spoken about PlayStation projects that were cancelled after significant investments. </p>







<h2 id="h-two-playstation-projects-costing-25-million-each-were-cancelled">Two PlayStation Projects Costing $25 Million Each Were Cancelled</h2>



<p>During an appearance on the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Plu6ciaLMfso6xWbRqQuz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">My Perfect Console</a> podcast (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/shuhei-yoshida-recalls-when-he-cancelled-two-25-million-game-projects-including-one-by-god-of-wars-santa-monica-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VGC</a>), Shuhei Yoshida opened up about cancelled PlayStation Projects. Yoshida first spoke about the internal game from God of War developer Santa Monica Studios. He confirmed that it was not a God of War game, but a new IP instead, with “a really amazing concept and very interesting gameplay ideas”. </p>



<p>Yoshida revealed that the game was supported for “many years”, but after putting in $25 million, the developers came to him saying, “We have to stop.” He wasn’t able to recall the exact reason for the cancellation, but it was probably because “the team was not able to find the game”. He added that it was a great concept, but “the gameplay didn’t really come to be.”</p>



<p>Shuhei Yoshida then discussed canceling “so many games” that were in early development. With most new games, developers will try a new idea, create a prototype, and if it’s successful, they continue; if not, it has to be reworked or stopped. Hence, early cancellation is not as expensive for them. </p>



<p>However, when projects like the Santa Monica title are progressing well and have had $25 million invested in them, it becomes a “tough decision” to cancel them. But in their case, the developers themselves came and told him, “You know, we probably have to stop.”</p>



<h2 id="h-there-have-been-much-bigger-cancellations">There Have Been “Much Bigger Cancellations” </h2>



<p>Yoshida then spoke about another game “of the same size” that was cancelled. The cancellation occurred when Yoshida was put in charge of Worldwide Studios, where he was overseeing all the games in development. There were many “great projects” from European studios like London Studios, EyeToy, and eventually PSVR and Media Molecule, you know?&nbsp;Guerrilla Games. </p>



<p>However, there was one “big budget project” that didn’t “have the core game” similar to Santa Monica’s cancelled new IP. He added that these were the two large cancellations, “but these days, $25 million cancellation is nothing special. [There are] much bigger cancellations.”</p>



<p>Yoshida also spoke about how difficult it is to cancel games, even when there is a slight chance for the game to “turn around.” However, at the same time, the financial loss could become larger, and the developers could become tired of working on those titles, he explained. Which is why he tries to communicate during every cancellation, not to get stuck on a project, but rather to do “something different, something new, like brand new. So let’s do the fresh restart’.”</p>

<p>The Camo grind in Call of Duty titles is always a popular pasttime, and Zombie players will be relieved to learn that the process has been made slightly easier in Black Ops 7 compared to its predecessor.</p>



<p>While Black Ops 6 required a total of 2,000 Critical Kills to unlock all Military Camos, that amount has been halved in Black Ops 7. However, there’s still plenty to do, with an additional Special Camo available for each weapon.</p>



<p>Whether you’re on the hunt for all the Camos available in Black Ops 7 from Zombies, or are seeking one in particular, we’ve got you covered with all the challenges to tick off—so bookmark this page for future reference!</p>

<p><strong>Each weapon in Black Ops 7 has 12 Camos to unlock in Zombies, with nine Military Camos and three Special Camos, with Mastery Camos in addition to those.</strong></p>



<p>Military Camos have the same requirements across all weapons, with some exceptions, while Special Camos have specific challenges that vary per weapon.</p>



<p>Finally, there are also Mastery Camos to earn, which require unlocking all the Camos available on specific guns.</p>



<h3 id="h-all-military-camo-challenges">All Military Camo Challenges</h3>



<p><strong>There are nine Military Camos to earn in Black Ops 7 Zombies, with the requirements being to secure a set amount of Critical Kills with a weapon.</strong></p>



<p>However, there are some exceptions to certain weapon types, as Shotguns require point-blank kills, while both Launchers and Melee weapons require Eliminations.</p>



<p>Each of these Military Camos is available to earn with every weapon in Black Ops 7 Zombies, with similar requirements.</p>
