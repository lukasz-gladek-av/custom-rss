            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-9m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has announced that its&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4&nbsp;</em>remake has topped another major sales milestone, so it looks like the game is selling solidly.</p>

<p>Back in October, Capcom revealed that&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4&nbsp;</em>had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-8m" rel="nofollow">broken the eight million sales barrier</a>, and now, according to <a href="https://x.com/dev1_official/status/1876175498398822673" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a new post</a> on social media platform X, the game has topped nine million sales.</p>

<p>That means that in the intervening months,&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4&nbsp;</em>notched up another million sales or so for itself. To celebrate this latest milestone, Capcom also posted a new piece of artwork that depicts many of&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4</em>'s characters enjoying a surprisingly civil meal together.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-9m-artwork.jpg?itok=NeovxWmN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-9m-artwork.jpg?itok=IwStviWP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Resident Evil 4</em>'s sales milestones are growing increasingly impressive.</figcaption></figure><p>Given that it took&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e240313.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">around six or seven months</a> to amass the million sales needed to take it from seven to eight million, this latest milestone is perhaps even more impressive than previous achievements, too.</p>

<p>The remake was originally released in March 2023, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-hit-3-million-in-just-2-days" rel="nofollow">racking up three million sales</a> in the two days following its launch and swiftly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-top-4-million-mercenaries-mode-now-available" rel="nofollow">reaching four million</a> within just a couple of weeks. The game had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-reach-5-million-capcom-announces" rel="nofollow">hit five million sales</a> by July that year.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with the&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4&nbsp;</em>remake, it's a reimagining of the influential 2005 action-horror classic, which sees Leon Kennedy descending into a European village in order to rescue Ashley Graham, the US president's daughter, from a sinister cult.</p>

<p>The remake introduces a number of changes and additional elements to the original, including new exploration areas, revamped gameplay that more closely resembles the&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>3&nbsp;</em>remakes, and more.</p>




<p>Our very own Sam gave&nbsp;the&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4&nbsp;</em>remake an impressive score of 9.5 in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/resident-evil-4-review" rel="nofollow">his review</a>, praising its "fantastic" gameplay improvements and "beautiful" visuals, among other things.</p>

            <p>The baggiest thing about PS1-harkening <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-soulslike-games">soulslike</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tyrants-realm">Tyrant’s Realm</a> is the ratty pair of prisoner pants you start out with. Everything else is pleasingly austere. It is, like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a>, a game about equipment and stamina management, but it finds most success as a soulslike in the sensation that you are alone somewhere bad, not able to do very much except hit horrible things in the space between them trying to hit you. It also offers notable moments of lonely, loud footsteps rebounding off cold stone tiles in the seconds after felling some giant man-bastard - one of the subgenre’s greatest un-joys.</p>

<p>There are a few fancy moves. There’s a parry you’ll never use because it’s too risky, and an execution you can build up a meter for, then trigger the moment an enemy is stunned following the parry you’ll never use. There’s some weapon-arty bits: very slowly applying poison to your sword and getting your face smashed in in the process. A large overhead axe swing, using an axe that appears from nowhere while you’re holding a club. The poison is especially good and PS1-faithful because the target flashes green and goes ‘ugh’ in periodic blips afterward. This stands out as nicely juddery and violent because the action is very smooth otherwise.</p>
<p>But I was mainly drawn to Tyrant’s Realm’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2259260/Tyrants_Realm/">prelude demo</a>’s Steam page’s download button because it looked a bit like Deathtrap Dungeon - the 1998 action adventure based on the Fighting Fantasy CYOA of the same name. I am fairly certain top Soulsboi Miyazaki has mentioned it as an influence, which is a nice bit of continuity, but it's a connection I make here simply for the low fantasy spikeyness and grime of it all. One of the less common uses for PS1 visual aesthetics, that, at least behind retrowave racers and horror games. More spikes, I say. It’s out on the 16th of January.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> Fest 2025 will be held in Paris in June, developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/niantic">Niantic</a> has announced. 
</p>
<p>
Pokémon Go's biggest annual in-person event will kick off in Osaka, Japan from 29th May to 1st June, before a weekend in Jersey City, New Jersey from 6th to 8th June.
</p>
<p>
Paris will then become the latest capital city to host the event's annual European leg from 13th to 15th June. Previous years have seen the event held in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-director-discusses-avatar-backlash-and-a-course-correct-needed-on-the-slowdown-of-new-species">Madrid</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-joys-of-pokemon-go-fest-london">London</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-fest-returns-in-person-after-three-years">Berlin</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Full details of the event remain under wraps, as Pokémon Go is still to hold its big spring gathering, Go Tour: Unova, at the beginning of March. Still, for those looking to book travel now, you can now put those summer dates in your diary. 
</p>
<p>
Go Fest typically attracts hundreds of thousands of players to its three live event locations, before a global event is held for all Pokémon Go players. There are no details yet on exactly when that will be. 
</p>
<p>
Last weekend, Pokémon Go began 2025 with its first Community Day - though the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-gos-monthly-community-day-ticket-doubles-in-price">regular event's optional ticket price has now doubled</a>.

            <p>There is not long to go until you can rev your engines once more with an all new Tokyo Xtreme Racer game.</p>
<p>The upcoming release - which will mark the first series title in 18 years - will make its Steam early access debut later this month, on 23rd January. Developer Genki said it will use this early access stint to "utilise player feedback to elevate the game even further".</p>
<p>Early access is expected to last for around four months. Then, of course, the full release will launch. This version will include the remainder of the story, along with additional cars, additional rival characters, and "new features and improvements". Genki added those who plump for the early access version will have access to the full release version upon launch, at the discounted early access price (for now, that price is "TBA", so stay tuned). </p>

			<p>The elevator pitch for Skydance’s Behemoth promises you one thing: huge battles against behemoths. Enemies the size of skyscrapers that you have to dodge, climb, and eventually stab in just the right spot to bring down. It’s Shadow of the Colossus except in VR, with you doing the actual climbing motions yourself. It sounds like a perfect fit, and fighting them is as entertaining as you’d expect… except you only get to get to do so a handful of times. The rest of the game has you&nbsp;fighting human enemies, exploring levels, and solving puzzles, which is a bit less exciting.</p>
<p><iframe title="Skydance's Behemoth - Launch Trailer | PS VR2 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lLjFsZAHuJo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>If you’ve played a combat focused VR game before, you’ll have an idea of what to expect from the person to person combat – scabbards on each hip and shoulder allow you to carry and switch between a variety of weapons ranging from standard swords, axes, shields, and bows through to giant, Cloud Strife-sized swords and yet another sword that can be re-summoned after throwing. Make no mistake, you are a very dangerous person in this game and that’s before you take into account the powers that you’ll quickly acquire, such as super strength that, when activated, lets you pick up whole enemies and throw them around, punch through damaged walls, and more.</p>


<p>Clearly the game gives you a lot of tools and you will use them in conjunction with a parry/riposte system to fight your way through levels in search of the behemoth. There’s more than enemies to contend with though, as there’s also the dreaded stamina bar-based climbing which, provided you glance at what you need to do first and keep the pace up, isn’t really an issue. You’ll also quickly find a wrist mounted grappling hook that allows you to pull, swing, and zip up to things, not to mention pulling enemies towards you during combat. It doesn’t take long before you’re doing typical platformer things like grappling between points without landing. Except in VR!</p>


<p>The only problem is that it’s all a bit too easy. The puzzles in particular are very simplistic and feel especially laborious when you’re the actual person dragging giant blocks around. The combat is a bit easy as well, only really raising its difficulty when you reach a boss, whether that’s a beefed up human or behemoth. It doesn’t bother you too much whilst you’re playing, because the moment-to-moment fighting is so much fun, but after a battle it tends to feel like it was over too quickly. Even the enemies with lengthy health bars are a bit too easy once you’ve got a handle on the parry system. Then it’s just a case of working down their health until their helmet pops off so you can stab them in the face. Lovely.</p>
<p>I do enjoy the staging of things throughout – one battle with an archer boss had arrows hit a save point as you’re using it, with a dramatic pause waiting for you to turn around to continue the encounter. It feels like the kind of melodrama you expect in medieval fantasy. Outside of moments like this the story itself isn’t particularly engrossing, but it’s good enough to keep you going at least and the voice acting sells it well enough.</p>

<p>Now we come to the behemoths. Yep, they’re actually that big and they look even bigger in VR, especially when you’re clinging to their ankles. These go too far the other way in terms of difficulty, and I found that there was a bit of trial and error involved in defeating them – obviously error means death. Sometimes it took a while before I noticed a weak point or climbable part, which makes you feel like an idiot when really, you just couldn’t see it from where you were or it wasn’t shining like usual for some reason. Outside of this, though, they’re thrilling. The build up to the behemoths is good as well – one of my favourite moments comes in the run up to the second behemoth, a large bat like creature. It’s hanging in front of you silhouetted so you don’t notice it in the environment until it unfurls its wings and roars before flying upwards through the cavern you’re entering. It’s just great.</p>
<p>The game runs flawlessly on PSVR 2 and looks good, if not great. It controls well enough most of the time, though there can be a bit of awkwardness around sheathing weapons as is typical in VR. Activating the super strength is a bit inconsistent as well – sometimes I thought I had done it but it hadn’t triggered for some reason and others it wouldn’t register me hitting a wall with it activated, which caused it to run out and forced me to wait for the cooldown. I also found that aiming with a bow would sometimes cause the bow to wiggle slightly with the hand tracking, which isn’t great for aiming really.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Ultimately Behemoth is a good VR combat game that's a bit too easy, and with its impressively huge boss battles too few in number. Whilst the combat and exploration is enjoyable enough, the puzzling is too simple and, in a game about killing giants, you'd expect there to be a few more giants.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-unreal-engine-5/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion remake powered by Unreal Engine 5 could be in the works, judging from some recent findings.</p>
<p>As spotted by Timur222, a Technical Art Director at Chinese development studio Virtuos Games is listing among the games they have worked on an unannounced Unreal Engine 5 remake in development for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. While the fourth entry in the series by Bethesda is not mentioned anywhere on the online resume, Virtuos Games has long been rumored to be the developer behind the Oblivion remaster revealed back in September 2023 via some <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-fallout-3-remasters-leaked-alongside-dishonored-3-ghostwire-tokyo-sequel-and-more/">leaked slides</a>, so there's the chance the remaster could actually be a full-blown remake. However, as Virtuos is also the studio behind Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, an Unreal Engine 5-powered remake, there's also the chance the employee simply hasn't updated the resume since the game was officially announced. As such, we have to take this with a grain of salt until this project is officially revealed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="und">Hmmm <a href="https://t.co/KfbZ9EYTIV">pic.twitter.com/KfbZ9EYTIV</a></p>
<p>— Timur222 (@bogorad222) <a href="https://twitter.com/bogorad222/status/1875975208810713172?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 5, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>According to the aforementioned leaked slides, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion isn't the only older game developed by Bethesda poised to return to modern hardware, as a Fallout 3 remaster is supposedly in the works as well. Both of these projects have yet to be officially revealed, however, so there's the chance that plans may have been changed since 2022, when the leaked slides were shared with the FTC.</p>
<p>If The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion never gets remade or remastered, however, fans will still be able to experience an updated version of the game with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-team-confirms-2025-launch-window-though-dlcs-will-come-later/">Skyblivion</a> mod. The total conversion project, which will recreate the game in Skyrim, will be released later this year, although it will lack the conversion of the DLC expansions, which will come at a later time.</p>

<p>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is the second installment in Square’s epic remake trilogy. It’s nearly time for the PC release date of FF7 Rebirth for new users to enjoy a fresh chunk of reimagined RPG gameplay, and the potential impact can only be rivaled by the use of Meteor Materia.</p>



<p>I’ve already said <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/year-in-review-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-deserves-more-love/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth deserved more love in 2024</a>. Ultimately, it was overshadowed by fascinating new IPs, intricate roguelike card games, and an adorable PlayStation mascot. This doesn’t mean FF7 Rebirth wasn’t a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-success/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">success</a> (far from it) as it’s believed Rebirth has sold several million copies to go with its various game of the year awards and nominations.</p>



<p>PlayStation 5 players have had exclusive access to Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, but PC players are finally set to get their turn to strike.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-pc-release-date">When is Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth PC Release Date?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Strike down your opponents. Credit to Square Enix</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth PC release date is Jan. 23, 2025</strong>, marking the launch of FF7 Rebirth on only its second platform.</p>



<p>The PC release comes 11 months after the Feb. 29, 2024 debut of Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth on PlayStation 5. The launch was PS5-exclusive, but as we’ve seen with various PS5-only titles—God of War, Horizon, and Spider-Man—Sony has a habit of timed exclusivity. This means a PC release is always on the cards later down the line, and FF7 Rebirth is the latest addition to the crossover catalog.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-pc-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth’s PC release date</a> was confirmed at The Game Awards 2024. The exciting reveal trailer’s climax shows the Jan. 23, 2025 date, but the brief announcement was not the full story here.</p>

</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-all-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-pc-new-features">All Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth PC New Features</h2>



<p>The “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bzWvyncQh8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth PC Announce Trailer</a>” explains the PC port’s litany of upgrades over the original. </p>



<p>You can check out each promised improvement below:</p>



<ul>
<li>DLSS</li>



<li>Enhanced Textures &amp; Modeling</li>



<li>Improved Lighting</li>



<li>VRR</li>
</ul>



<p>DLSS stands for <strong>Deep Learning Super Sampling</strong> and is a real-time technique designed to artificially boost the frame rate and upscale the rendered gameplay. <strong>Enhanced Textures &amp; Modeling</strong> should help Mt. Corel, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-where-to-go-in-nibelheim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nibelheim</a>, and various biomes to pop in new ways never before seen. </p>



<p><strong>Improved Lighting</strong> allows environments to illuminate naturally and look more engaging and lifelike, whereas VRR means <strong>Variable Refresh Rate</strong> and this modern technical process provides various benefits from smoothing the frame rate to reducing lag and preventing screen tearing.</p>



<p>Additionally, “more” differences are indicated by the trailer, but we need to wait for the official launch to see what other surprises Square Enix has up its sleeve.</p>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 rumor mill has been working at a neck-breaking pace lately. Just yesterday, we got our first proper look at the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-high-quality-pictures-joy-con/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new JoyCon controller</a>, thanks to a leak from China. Fans immediately noticed its much larger shoulder buttons than the original Switch controller, as shown in the comparison picture below.</p>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The comparison between Switch 2 and Switch 1 joy-cons. Look at those massive top buttons! 💙 <a href="https://t.co/jcQel893Bg">pic.twitter.com/jcQel893Bg</a></p>
<p>— Mucrush 🦋 (@Mucrush) <a href="https://twitter.com/Mucrush/status/1875892254189162537?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 5, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Now, a new rumor <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1hue20a/switch_2_shipping_data_indicates_the_joycons_will/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=mweb3x&amp;utm_name=mweb3xcss&amp;utm_term=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggests</a> that the new JoyCons could also be used similarly to PC mice. This stems from shipping data listing component parts as 'mouse soles'. Insider NextHandheld had also previously <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1hh6flf/unexthandheld_could_be_hinting_that_the_surprise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hinted</a> that the controller's laser sensors will allow it to be used that way, as we've already seen with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/lenovo-legion-go-handheld-with-amd-ryzen-z1-apus-official-starts-at-e799/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lenovo Legion Go</a> PC handheld. It could definitely be an interesting new approach for Nintendo Switch 2 gaming.</p>
<p>On a completely separate note, insider Nash Weedle has <a href="https://twitter.com/NWeedle/status/1873657637927338043?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1873657637927338043%7Ctwgr%5Ebb0b8b52fbe2d6bbc48c4823ef81f0d8f5a12f58%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamereactor.eu%2Frumour-no-mans-sky-to-land-on-nintendo-switch-2-1477163%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted</a> quite clearly that No Man's Sky will be released for Nintendo's new console. This isn't earth-shattering news, as the game is already available on the regular Switch, where it <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-mans-sky-launches-on-nintendo-switch-this-october/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> in October 2022 after a <a href="https://wccftech.com/near-impossible-no-mans-sky-nintendo-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">'near-impossible' porting process</a>. The new console is also backward compatible, so the game's compatibility with the system was a given. Weedle probably hints at a new version of No Man's Sky optimized to take advantage of the Nintendo Switch 2 hardware improvements; while <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-performance-range-xbox-series-s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not as powerful as Microsoft's Xbox Series S</a>, the upcoming hybrid console is rumored to be around the PlayStation 4 Pro, with certain built-in advantages over Sony's console like NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution and Ray Reconstruction. As such, No Man's Sky should certainly look and run a lot better on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>At this point, it would be no exaggeration to say that Nintendo fans are nearly frothing in anticipation of the Japanese console manufacturer and game developer/publisher's official announcement. The reveal might come <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-january-dock-image/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as early as this week</a>, so stay tuned.</p>

            <p>Last June, Valve’s trading card game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/artifact">Artifact</a> Classic peaked at 78 players. November was a little rosier for the abandoned <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-multiplayer-games-on-pc">multiplayer</a> game, with a monthly peak of 1,028. Then, on New Year’s Day, that number jumped to 11,900 players on Steam - its second highest concurrent besides launch. Soon after, they vanished. Who were these mysterious shufflers, flocking to the deserted, echoing halls of Valve’s disastrous flop like your mate who uses the word ‘liminal’ too much to a dead shopping center? Forbes, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikestubbs/2025/01/01/12000-people-are-playing-artifact-right-now-and-no-one-knows-why/">who first reported on the phenomena</a>, don’t know. <em>No one knows</em>. Somebody might actually know but writing ‘no one knows’ makes it more dramatic. Let’s dig in.</p>

<p>This latest 24 peak of 12,500 players echoes a uptick last December of around 14,000, which lasted but a single day. Forbes speculate that the reason is “likely bots” in the absence of any notable community or influencer activity on Twitch, YouTube, or similar. There’s no interest in Artifact’s cards on the Marketplace, say Forbes, so unless Valve is hiding something <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life-3">Half Life 3 </a>related, there’s no clear reason why this should be happening. Unless…</p>
<p>The game’s subreddit has been doing some theorising of its own, as reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valves-dead-tcg-artifact-suddenly-had-12000-players-on-new-years-day-and-the-community-is-baffled">IGN</a>. Is Artifact being used to train AI? Are there <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Artifact/comments/1hqvdjy/comment/m4y3g74/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">scammer bots increasing their playtime</a> to build legitimacy for other, nefarious purposes? Could it be pirates using the free-to-play game’s AppID/SDK to mask other games - an honour, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Artifact/comments/1hqvdjy/12k_players_again/">according to one poster</a>, usually reserved for Spacewar?</p><p>Paul Curtin digs into <a href="https://www.githyp.com/piracy-on-steam-may-have-tripled-in-past-2-years-based-on-unexpected-source/">this here</a>, but the basic idea is that pirates will give cracked games the AppID of the game Spacewar, which used to be part of Steamworks’ software dev kit as a testing tool. The pirated game then shows up as Spacewar to Steam, which then does whatever the platform equivalent of a slightly suspicious British Bobby deciding to move along casually twirling their baton and whistling is.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in diving into Artifact’s deflating history, Will Partin’s <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/artifact-isnt-a-game-on-steam-its-steam-in-a-game/">brilliant piece</a> for Waypoint remains the definitive chronicle. The game ceased development and went free-to-play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-have-stopped-working-on-artifact-20-and-so-theyve-made-the-game-free">back in 2021</a>, with Valve saying “we haven't managed to get the active player numbers to a level that justifies further development at this time."</p>
<p>Valve’s newest multiplayer offering is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deadlock">Deadlock</a>, which Matt Cox <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fiddly-parkour-is-the-secret-sauce-that-makes-every-moment-of-deadlock-compelling">wrote about here</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Photo by Yui Mok/PA Images via Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Based on that, then, Notch is indeed setting out to work on a spiritual successor to Minecraft a decade after selling Mojang to Microsoft for $2.5 billion. Mojang continues to work on the eternally popular Minecraft, of course, putting out multiple updates each year across all the platforms the sandbox game is available on. Minecraft is officially the best-selling video game of all time, with an incredible 300 million copies sold. Microsoft has made no indication that it intends to release a Minecraft 2, which comes as no surprise given how popular Minecraft remains. Perhaps that leaves the door open for Notch to fill a gap from the original creator.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Notch noted himself, it remains to be seen whether this ‘Minecraft 2’ ever sees the light of day. Since selling to Microsoft, the Swedish developer has started and stopped a number of games, including space sandbox game 0x10c (pronounced "Ten to the C”). However, in another tweet, Notch said the odds of him finishing projects now are higher than they were because he has employees he feels responsible for.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In later tweets, Notch answered questions from followers on social media about this Minecraft 2, and insisted he doesn’t want to use anything “too similar to the stuff I sold,” in this new game. He also said his Minecraft 2 wouldn’t be a story game, suggesting a new sandbox of some kind. “I'd make a similar game [to Minecraft] based on what I think the audience that says they want that game might enjoy,” he explained. “Probably do early access to make sure we're on track.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">I mean best I've got at the moment is Adventureland, so yeah no idea</p>— notch (@notch) <a href="https://twitter.com/notch/status/1875234889773261240?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 3, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Notch even went on to <a href="https://x.com/notch/status/1875244214272893244" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">say</a> that if Minecraft ever wanted him to make an official Minecraft 2 and both parties agreed on terms, “I'd absolutely be willing to to that.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I'd even give them a much bigger share than I'd feel obliged to just to make it clear I'm not doing it with ill intent,” he continued, before adding: “But I'll be a bitch to work with.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It seems unlikely that Microsoft would work with Notch, given <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/03/28/new-minecraft-update-removes-mentions-of-notch">it removed his name from the opening credits of Minecraft</a> following various controversial statements he made in the years following the sale of Mojang.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Yui Mok/PA Images via Getty Images,</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>If you are one of the many who play Wordle every day (I still like to use it to flex the ol' mental muscles with my morning cup of tea), you may well be interested to discover the one word in 2024 that stumped so many of us, it broke a whopping 5.6m streaks.</p>
<p>In a recent conversation with <a href="https://www.today.com/popculture/news/new-york-times-top-wordle-connections-2024-rcna185738">Today</a>, editorial director of NYT Games Everdeen Mason revealed that 11.1bn puzzles were solved via the New York Times in 2024. Of those, Wordle accounted for 5.3bn plays.</p>

<p>The most played day for the New York Times' Wordle puzzle was 23rd April, when the word was Rover. But the word that left the most players scratching their heads arrived later in the year, on 15th October. That word was Corer. Like I said, this chap caused 5.6m Wordle streaks to come to an end.</p><p>In addition to sharing these little titbits, Mason revealed 2.8 million of us are creatures of habit and routine, and use the same starting word every day. As Eurogamer reported previously, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wordle-now-has-an-in-app-bot-to-analyse-how-good-your-guesses-are">the most popular starting word for Wordle is Adieu</a>, which is actually what my mother uses (for general interest, I always start with Ouija. My sister-in-law starts with Ocean).</p>
<p>I also learned a few weeks ago that Epona - Link's wonderful horse from the Legend of Zelda series - can not be used as a guess. I was quite upset by this, and took a screenshot to document this sad moment (and now, finally, I have somewhere to share it - so, hurrah!).</p>

<p>Along with Wordle, other New York Times puzzles also remain popular. In 2024, the Mini Crossword and Strands accounted for 2.1bn and 1.3bn plays respectively. I recently discovered Strands - which is a kind of themed word search - along with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-york-times-responds-to-only-connect-resemblance">Only Connect clone Connections</a>, and have added these to my daily puzzle time. Anyone else?</p>

            <p>The Sonic film franchise has now surpassed $1bn at the global box office, following the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-hedgehog-3">Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a> prior to Christmas.</p>
<p>The latest film earned over $187m in the US, for a worldwide total of $336.3m. It debuted globally with $211.5m in its first week.</p>
<p>The previous two films collectively grossed $725.2m globally, following releases in 2020 and 2022 respectively.

<p>Sonic 3 has certainly been a success, then, earning franchise-best critics ratings, aided by the inclusion of Keanu Reeves as Shadow the Hedgehog.</p>
<p>"We are so overjoyed with the amazing response to the Sonic the Hedgehog films from audiences and fans around the world and are proud to be part of the incredible, world-class filmmaking team that has come together to build this franchise," producers Neal H Moritz and Toby Ascher said in a joint statement.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/06/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-30-to-26/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-%E2%80%93-30-to-26.1074633/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/06/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-30-to-26/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>As we approach the midway point of our Most Wanted Games of 2025 list, there’s a suitably odd mish-mash of genres, new and old IP, and styles of game. From the turn-based RPG of Clair Obscur, to Borderlands 4’s looter shooter, and then onward to the Telltale successor studio’s superhero-infused Dispatch, there’s some great variety here.</p>
<h2>30 – Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – TBA</em></p>
<p>JRPGs are in a really good place right now, but who says you have to be a Japanese studio or developer to make a game in this style? French studio Sandfall Interactive has taken inspiration from this subgenre, belndingit with a Belle Epoque France fantasy world to create the turn-based RPG Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.</p>
<p><iframe title="Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4dLBUD08_3A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/28/clair-obscur-expedition-33-preview-a-poignant-and-painterly-rpg/">Poignant and painterly</a>, as I described it for our Gamescom preview, the game sees you follow yet another doomed expedition as they venture out to try and stop the Paintress from literally just ending the lives of people of a certain age. It will lean in on the tried and true turn-based RPG combat, with a few invigorating twists mixed in, such as an active QTE element and Persona-like menus fanning out from characters. This could be a real treat for fans of the genre.</p>

<h2>29 – Borderlands 4</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 2025</em></p>
<p>Welcome to the planet Kairos, a world that’s dominated by a ruthless dictator known as the Timekeeper, with an army of synthetic followers known as the Order. You, of course, will play as a Vault Hunter searching for mythical alien treasures in a race against time against the Timekeeper to uncover it.</p>
<p><iframe title="Borderlands 4 - Official First Look" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/26vY2GMfYTw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You pretty much know what to expect from Borderlands 4, with the procedurally generated loot pushing you on through each battle and mission, and a humour-filled script that will thankfully tone down the toilet humour of Borderlands 3. We’re yet to really be introduced to the Vault Hunters that will lead this adventure, but the gameplay first look showed an impressive sense of scale and slick snippets of action.</p>
<h2>28 – Dispatch</h2>
<p><em>PC, Consoles – 2025</em></p>
<p>Coming from the minds behind <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/tales-from-the-borderlands">Tales from the Borderlands</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-wolf-among-us">The Wolf Among Us</a>, and with a cast that features Aaron Paul, Laura Bailey and Jeffrey Wright, Dispatch is a narrative adventure that’s well worth paying attention to.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="DISPATCH | Official Reveal Trailer - Extended Cut (HD)" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZbERWU5bc50?feature=oembed" width="780" height="439" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p>Casting you as a de-suited Robert Roberston, formerly known as Mecha Man, this is a superhero workplace comedy that sees him adapt to life without powers. He still has a role to play in the community, but as a part of the dispatch centre team, charged with rehabilitating ex-supervillains as they go straight. Between the narrative moments, you’ll also have to manage those heroes, sending them out to answer calls, managing their particular skills and helping to unlock their full potential.</p>
<h2>27 – Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – TBC</em></p>
<p>The early 2000s and PS2 era is proving to be a fertile source for modern remakes, and Konami is the latest to try to get in on the action with Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater. Having been rumoured for years, this MGS3 remake was confirmed back in 2023, with 2024 giving us a couple of additional glimpses of cutscenes and story.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="METAL GEAR SOLID Δ: SNAKE EATER - Official Trailer #2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sk6VdMoAgTs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Very little is really known about the remake, how much the gameplay is being tweaked and modernised, but you can see from the cutscene-heavy trailers that the game does look pretty fab with Unreal Engine 5 powering it, and they’ve kept a lot of that Kojima tone.</p>
<h2>26 – The Sinking City 2</h2>
<p>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 2025</p>
<p>After all the trials and tribulations that Frogwares went through with the first game, it’s great to see The Sinking City 2 coming from Frogwares. This one’s a little bit different, though, with the team diving in on a full horror experience.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="The Sinking City 2 | World Premiere Trailer (PC, PS5, Xbox Series)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iLIOZg9NzUU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Taking us to 1920s Arkham – the Lovecraft one, not the Batman one – there’s still plenty of cosmic horror here, and you’re still trawling through a flooded city, but the detective elements of the first game have been toned down a lot. Combat and exploration will be the main focus now, the city and world you can explore will be smaller, and the team is aiming to have a much stronger visual horror as well.</p>
<p>It’s been a while since we’ve heard an update on this one – Frogwares has its roots as a Ukrainian studio, so there’s some real hardships that they’ve faced this past few years – but we hope to hear and see more on this soon if they’re to hit their 2025 release target.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/resident-evil-4-remake-has-sold-9-million-units.1074630/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-4-remake-has-sold-9-million-units/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>This morning, Japanese publisher and developer CAPCOM <a href="https://x.com/dev1_official/status/1876175498398822673" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that the Resident Evil 4 remake has sold over nine million units since its debut in late March 2023. It is no doubt a remarkable result, especially when considering that the game is essentially the same as the 2005 classic from a content standpoint.</p>
<p>The first three million units <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-surpass-3-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were sold</a>&nbsp;<span>just two days after launch. The fourth million mark&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-4-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was passed</a>&nbsp;in early April 2023, while the fifth&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-5-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was reached</a> in late July 2023. CAPCOM provided the next sales update around the game's first anniversary, when we <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-4-remake-has-sold-over-7-million-units-to-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> that&nbsp;</span>the Resident Evil 4 remake had sold over seven million copies.</p>
<p>The game was well received overall by critics, too, though our own Nathan Birch <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">didn't quite love it</a> (but still gave it an 8.5 out of 10):</p>
<p><em>Now, I have to say, while the tone of the last few paragraphs has been a bit negative, whether we’re talking about the original or the remake, Resident Evil 4 is still a very good game. I may be a bit disappointed by the scope and ambition of Capcom’s reimagining, but RE4 is still one of the most inventive and engaging action-horror games ever made, and this is a competent, technically-impressive new version of the game. The village battle may be largely the same, but it still gets your blood pumping. Same goes for the cabin defense sequence, your showdown with the village chief, or your first encounter with a Regenerator. The Resident Evil 4 remake is still a fun, bombastic dose of mayhem, I just feel like it had the potential to be even better. It also suffers from the fact that Resident Evil Village was, in some ways, the bigger, crazier take on RE4 that this remake could have been.</em></p>
<p>2025 might be a big year for the franchise, at least when it comes to announcements. Resident Evil 9 is expected to be unveiled, <a href="https://wccftech.com/rumor-resident-evil-9-reportedly-launching-in-second-half-of-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">potentially with a late 2025 launch window</a>, and there are already rumors that the atmosphere will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-stalker-enemies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inspired by Resident Evil 4</a> while also having two 'unkillable stalkers' possibly inspired by Resident Evil 3's Nemesis. The playable characters are rumored to be two of the most iconic protagonists in the series: Jill Valentine (Resident Evil 1, Resident Evil 3, Resident Evil 5) and Leon Kennedy (Resident Evil 2, Resident Evil 4, Resident Evil 6).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/wwe-2k23-servers-officially-closed-down-today/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>For many, this doesn't come as a surprise. WWE 2K23 was removed from all storefronts on November 1, 2024. It's now been taken one step further, with all online functionality for the title being removed. This means that anyone who was hoping to scrap against their friends in some online matches will no longer be able to do so. Instead, you will now have to resort to purchasing the latest game in the franchise, WWE 2K24. This title was only released in March 2024, and with an economic crisis and games being relatively pricey, people have to pick and choose which games they're picking up and when.</p>
<p>For a fair amount of players, WWE 2K23 losing online functionality won't affect them whatsoever. However, for those who haven't had the chance or funds to pick up the latest game in the franchise, it does make the franchise inaccessible. Compared to previous titles, this game didn't even have long in terms of online functionality, as it lasted less than two years before all of the servers were pulled.</p>
<p>Thus far, 2K hasn't given a reason as to why WWE 2K23's servers have closed down, just the broad statement that they were shutting down when announcing that the game was equally being pulled from storefronts in November. The message reads as follows:</p>
<p><em>WWE 2K23 is getting its final takedown. As of January 6, 2025 the servers will be discontinued. This includes all online functions, such as online matches and Community Creations. You will no longer be able to access any online game mode after this point. However, if you already own the game you will be able to continue to play offline modes.</em></p>
<p>Whether they will announce why this has happened is uncertain, as they commonly shut down servers for their old sports games, such as NBA 2K23 also being delisted from digital storefronts in December, 2024. However, some fans were expecting that 2K would push the date back and give fans more time with WWE 2K23. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case.</p>
<p>Now, the only game in the WWE franchise that has online functionality is <a href="https://wccftech.com/wwe-2k24-launch-roster-vince-mcmahon-brock-lesnar/">WWE 2K24</a>. If you want to purchase this game, the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1001-PPSA16306_00-WWE2K24CROSSGEN0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">standard edition</a> of the title will set you back around $69.99. There are also many different editions and bundles you can get, which can set you back up to a whopping $139.99, depending on what edition of the game you get. However, the most expensive version of the game does come in a bundle with NBA 2K25 and TopSpin 2K25. These games have recently been on sale for the festive period, but the sale is soon ending, meaning those who want to get their hands on the new wrestling game will have to pay top price for it.</p>
<p>Will you miss WWE 2K23?</p>

		<p>WWE 2K23’s servers have now been shut down, with 2K sunsetting all online functionality for the wrestling game. This means, currently, the only WWE game with online functionality is WWE 2K24, which was released in March 2024. WWE 2K23 was released in March 2023, meaning the online functions of the game lasted less than two years. The game had already been removed from digital storefronts on November 1st, 2024.</p>

<p>In its announcement about the WWE 2K23 server closures, 2K wrote, <em>“WWE 2K23 is getting its final takedown. As of January 6, 2025 the servers will be discontinued.This includes all online functions, such as online matches and Community Creations. You will no longer be able to access any online game mode after this point, however if you already own the game you will be able to continue to play offline modes.”</em></p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/03/29/wwe-2k23-review/">WWE 2K23 Review</a></h2>
<p>In our WWE 2K23 review, Adrian said, <em>“As a wrestling fan, I want to create five-star classic matches, with back-and-forth action, near falls, and iconic moments, but ultimately WWE 2K23 cannot facilitate that. Messy and overly complicated controls hamper those efforts, but it’s 2K’s obsession with players winning matches that ensure this professional wrestling game misses the point entirely.”</em></p>

<p>This server shutdown follows on from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/01/nba-2k23-has-now-been-delisted/">NBA 2K23’s servers</a> being taken offline on December 31st, 2024, after being delisted from digital storefronts at the end of November. This is standard practice for 2K, as the company turns off servers it’s big sports games only a couple of years after release to focus on the latest titles.</p>

<p><strong>Assassin’s Creed</strong> is one of the most legendary franchises in gaming history, with a series stretching back over fifteen years. It’s an iconic, open-world collection that boasts ambitious adventures, immersive stories, and memorable characters. But, given that there are dozens of games in the series, we’re asking (and answering) an all-important question: ‘Can you play <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/assassins-creed/">Assassin’s Creed</a> in any order?’</p>



<p>Some die-hard fans might have their ideal chronology, but in this guide, we’re looking on a more general scale. If you’re wondering what order to play Assassin’s Creed in, look no further than this guide.</p>



<p>Perhaps you can use it to get an idea of the size of the franchise ahead of the release of Assassin’s Creed Shadows on February 14.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-many-assassin-s-creed-games-are-there">How Many Assassin’s Creed Games Are There?</h2>



<p>It’s a rich and storied franchise that can be traced back to 2007. It’s a little-known fact, but <em>Assassin’s Creed’s</em> origins rest with <em><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/prince-of-persia/">Prince of Persia</a></em>. It was later revealed that 2007’s <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> title, which kicked off the franchise, was an experiment, with the project being twisted from the failed development of a<em> Prince of Persia</em> game. </p>



<p>In total, there are <strong>13</strong> major <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> games and several more spin-off titles that were typically released on handheld consoles and mobile devices. It’s a franchise that has taken players from Ancient Greece to Victorian London, and with each new release, the lore gets richer, deeper, and more immersive.</p>



<p>With that in mind, can you play<em> Assassin’s Creed </em>in any order?</p>

<h2 id="h-can-you-play-assassin-s-creed-in-any-order">Can You Play Assassin’s Creed in Any Order?</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Technically, no restrictions are blocking you from playing<em> Assassin’s Creed </em>in whatever order you so desire, but some barricades might make the experience a little confusing.</p>



<p>For instance, if you wanted to soak up the entire timeline in order of release, you’d start with <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> (2007) and end with <em>Assassin’s Creed Mirage </em>(2023). But, if you wanted to play the series in chronological order, you’d start with <em>Assassin’s Creed Odyssey</em> (2018) and end with <em>Assassin’s Creed Syndicate</em> (2015). </p>



<p>With the most recent releases, Ubisoft pivoted to an RPG-based model, with each game more or less being a standalone title with only a few concepts and aspects connecting them. For instance, Assassin’s Creed Origins (2017), Assassin’s Creed Odyssey (2018), and Assassin’s Creed Valhalla (2020) can all be experienced as standalone games but there is an underlying story that connects them.</p>



<p>It’s not as jarring an experience as if you were to play the older games as standalone titles, though. For example,<em> Assassin’s Creed Brotherhood</em> (2010) was a direct sequel to <em>Assassin’s Creed II</em> (2009). The former game starts in the exact scenes where the latter game ends, so if you’ve not played<em> Assassin’s Creed II</em>, <em>Brotherhood </em>will be disorienting until you’ve managed to catch up on the story.</p>

<h2 id="h-does-that-answer-your-question">Does That Answer Your Question?</h2>



<p>If you’ve been wondering what order to play<em> Assassin’s Creed</em> in, we hope that’s cleared things up. There are a few ways to soak up the franchise, but ultimately, it’s up to you in which order you play the games. Realistically, if you were to play them in order of release, you’d be neck-deep in <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> games for several hundred hours.</p>



<p>Perhaps it’s best to start with the most recent titles and track backwards if you want to learn about the origins of the series and what it all means. You can also skip some games if you don’t feel like they’d interest you. It’s your journey, after all. There might not be any one ‘best Assassin’s Creed order’.</p>
