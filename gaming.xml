<p>I don’t know why, but I always prefer the early firearms in Call of Duty—the weapons you receive a few levels into the game or those unlocked for you by default. They’re often the most versatile, especially when unlocking additional attachments. In Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, there’s one rifle that stands the test of time, and we’re going to explore all of the XM4 unlocks here and now!</p>

<p>Of the many weapons available in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, the XM4 offers some of the most extensive customization. You can turn it from a stock weapons platform to a highly modified, special operations-level weapon that should see you through most of the game’s player ranks. Here’s a complete rundown of the XM4 unlocks in the game currently!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/31/24232314/star-wars-outlaws-ubisoft-open-world-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There was a moment in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24230628/star-wars-outlaws-review-ps5-xbox-pc">Massive Entertainment and Ubisoft’s <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em></a> when I was scouring the depths of a creepy cave, just after finishing a dogfight in space and winning a card game in a boozy cantina, that the game clicked for me. The usual Ubisoft drudgery, where icons on maps become weights on the brain, was gone. Instead, there was an organic, self-determined flow as to why I chose to leave the frozen wastes of one planet to dig beneath the surface of another.</p><p>Here was a game reacting to my actions: it was an open-world experience I’d never encountered before.&nbsp;</p><p>I felt elated at this realization, with things happening as a result of the consequences of my own gameplay decisions. The game was organically adjusting to my moment-to-moment play. It works because of two clever systems: <em>Outlaws’</em> faction system where you either grow or destroy your reputation with various criminal syndicates, and <em>Outlaws</em>’ unique approach to ability upgrades.</p><p>Kay Vess, the protagonist, forms relationships with all sorts of shady syndicates, all with their own constantly conflicting agendas. As a freelancer, Kay can do missions for any and all of them, but sometimes stealing documents for one faction means undermining an ongoing scheme for another. This raises Kay’s reputation for one and lowers it for the other.</p><p>Higher reputation nets you discounts, access to syndicate-controlled areas, special gifts, and so on. Lower results in the opposite, primarily restricted access to areas and antagonistic reactions from members of the syndicate.</p><p>As an example, the result of a recent mission for the Hutt syndicate meant that if I wanted access to the Pyke syndicate area, I’d have to sneak in. Or, I could find ways to raise my reputation with the Pykes. A new mission centered around stealing or buying an item in the currently restricted Pyke area on the jungle planet of Akiva. Before embarking on the Akiva mission, I decided to improve my reputation with the Pykes. This took me to the underground caves on a distant moon of Toshara because the Pykes wanted an item there.</p><p>The reason I wanted access to the Pykes in the first place was related to Kay’s abilities. <em>Outlaws</em> ties ability upgrades to collecting specific rare gear and performing certain actions; there is no XP to speak of. I was trying to upgrade Kay’s silent takedown, allowing her to stealthily take out harder enemies instantly. Upgrading that skill required stealing or purchasing that item in Pyke territory. And since my reputation was so bad, I was now on a moon doing a mission for the Pykes to improve things.</p><p>This push-and-pull meant that I was traveling to distant planets and choosing missions based on what would improve my moment-to-moment play. I wasn’t following a preordained path, or filling out a checklist, but approaching the world on my own terms.</p><p>The game is structured like this: open-ended but with clear trajectories depending on your goals, cleanly doing away with the usual Ubisoft open-world bloat. Whereas so many of the developer’s other big games, like <em>Far Cry</em> or <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, often felt like ticking boxes, <em>Outlaws</em> provides a slicker but meatier canvas of play due to this depth and variety while allowing player choice to dictate action.</p><p>The game seems to speak directly to so many players’ frustration at the size and drudgery in Ubisoft games, as seen in, most recently, <em>Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla</em>. <em>Outlaws</em> really does feel as if my experience and choices not only matter but are part of the system. The world reacts, alignments shift, my choice of task changes. While there are legitimate complaints about its stealth system feeling underbaked and missions effectively repeating themselves, my own experience was one of constant joy, due precisely to the ebb and flow of the systems I could play with.</p><p>I didn’t realize how badly I wanted an open world that was actually this reactive until I played <em>Outlaws</em>. Yes, there’s some jank and instability, but by Picard’s beard, it is a blast to play with these systems, with the freedom ripe for manipulation of a gunslinging outlaw like Kay.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I’m sure most everyone has <em>a</em> story about this game, and here’s mine: my family could not afford a babysitter, despite the fact that my parents worked from sunrise to well beyond the sunset. My older brother was often placed in charge of me growing up, but when he wasn’t available (because he had his own life) I’d accompany my folks to the laundry they operated. Throughout the 90s and early-to-mid aughts, their business frequently featured one or two arcade cabinets. <em>Marvel vs. Capcom 2 </em>was the one that I occupied most, and it became everything to me. To my knowledge, it was the first game I ever tried to master. I must’ve hopped on the sticks twenty times an afternoon whenever I found myself at that laundry, and in turn <em>MvC2 </em>has never quite left me.

I came away really enthralled by its world and how it seems to be toying with the barriers of fantasy and reality. I was less thrilled with how Atlus <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-preview-persona-atlus-political-1851633394&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-preview-persona-atlus-political-1851633394">attempted to distance its in-universe political drama from reality</a></span>, but I’m still intrigued by what the game itself seems to be saying. I saw a lot of the game in those four hours, and I think I’m still waiting to find the flair in its turn-based combat, which felt like it was missing some of the bells and whistles that make games like <em>Persona </em>feel more complex than just hitting elemental weaknesses. But despite any lingering concerns, I still experienced a handful of standout moments in which I could feel <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> worming its way into my brain, sparking my curiosity, and alleviating some of the problems I’ve had with some of Atlus’ previous games. Here are a few moments from my play time that have stuck with me. - Kenneth Shepard <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-awakening-archetype-action-rpg-1851634250&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-awakening-archetype-action-rpg-1851634250">Read More</a></span></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4981bd9b82fc96d6960b5d74b08b1172" data-recommend-id="image://4981bd9b82fc96d6960b5d74b08b1172" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot showing Terry's win pose in Street Fighter 6, which is a callback to his same stance in Fatal Fury." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot showing Terry's win pose in Street Fighter 6, which is a callback to his same stance in Fatal Fury." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kotaku / Capcom</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4981bd9b82fc96d6960b5d74b08b1172" data-recommend-id="image://4981bd9b82fc96d6960b5d74b08b1172" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot showing Terry's win pose in Street Fighter 6, which is a callback to his same stance in Fatal Fury." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Admittedly, I’m not the fighting game savant at this site, or even in my own circle of friends.

Yesterday, August 25, was <em>Batman: Arkham Asylum</em>’s 15th anniversary. That’s right. What is arguably the most well-regarded game starring Bruce Wayne ever made is old enough for a learner’s permit.

			<p>BioWare continues to share media and information about the upcoming action RPG Dragon Age The Veilguard. Yesterday, the renowned developer <a href="https://x.com/dragonage/status/1829565257670709297" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> a few gorgeous new screenshots showcasing the companions' rooms.</p>
<figure>

</figure>


<p>BioWare also held a Discord Q&amp;A (available <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lGYb3hljfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> on YouTube thanks to a fan), revealing new details:</p>
<ul>
<li>Characters created in the creator can be saved to avoid starting from scratch every time</li>
<li>Transmogrification (the ability to select a different armor to display than the one actually equipped) also applies to the regular clothes used in the Lighthouse, allowing players to wear armor when they're roaming in the hub</li>
<li>There will be a setting to toggle on or off nudity and sex scenes</li>
<li>Players interested in the most immersive experience possible can turn off the minimap, damage numbers, health bars, indicators, and more</li>
<li>The companions range in age from the 20s to the 50s, the youngest being the Qunari Taash, while the oldest is the Necromancer Emmrich</li>
<li>Only companions are romanceable in Dragon Age The Veilguard</li>
<li>Gifts for companions are returning and will be on display in their rooms</li>
<li>Some of the larger areas offering exploration opportunities include The Crossroads, Arlathan Forest, and The Hossberg Wetlands</li>
<li>Every companion has their own story arc and challenges to go through</li>
<li>Companions may occasionally appear in the world even if they're not in your party</li>
<li>Certain quests may expire depending on the progression of the main story and player choices, but the player will be warned in advance</li>
<li>There is no mechanic behind companions getting together, as BioWare wanted to avoid making it feel mechanical. Instead, companions develop relationships based on player choices, such as committing to another relationship or not engaging in a romance with them. Companions may also develop friendships and even rivalries with each other.</li>
</ul>
<p>The wait for Dragon Age The Veilguard is not long enough. The game will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-to-launch-on-october-31/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> in exactly two months, and a lot more information is sure to drop next month. Stay tuned.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/31/24232540/summer-2024-best-indie-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Outside of some <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24180536/shadow-of-the-erdtree-review-elden-ring-dlc">notable</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24230628/star-wars-outlaws-review-ps5-xbox-pc">exceptions</a>, there haven’t been many blockbuster games this summer — but that doesn’t mean there hasn’t been much to play. In fact, at times, it has felt like a never-ending flood of fascinating indie releases, thanks to games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24206836/arranger-puzzle-game-review-netflix-summer-game-fest"><em>Arranger</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24152153/animal-well-review-switch-ps5-steam-videogamedunkey"><em>Animal Well</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24153478/crow-country-review-steam-ps5-xbox"><em>Crow Country</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24157530/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-review-switch-steam"><em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em></a>.</p><p>It’s been nearly impossible to keep up, but we’ve been playing through most of these games and settled on a handful of recommendations that offer a range of experiences. There’s everything from shadow-hopping puzzles to comedic platformers to a game that might help fill the <em>Silksong</em>-shaped hole in your heart.</p><p>Here are some of our favorites.</p><p><h4><em>The Crush House</em></h4></p><p><h5>PC</h5></p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/4/24121113/introducing-the-worlds-first-thirst-person-shooter"><em>The Crush House</em></a> is one of the rare games that capitalize on the tomfoolery potential of running a reality TV show. Part of the game is a kind of resource management sim. Ads make my bosses happy but make my audience tune out. The other part is like a first-person shooter requiring me to sprint around the house with a camera trying to capture the juiciest moments. But I’ve always hated the manufactured drama of reality TV, so I’m having the most fun making the most boring show possible. I haven’t been fired yet, but I feel it’s coming. —AP</p><p><h4><em>Flock</em></h4></p><p><h5>PlayStation, PC, Xbox</h5></p><p>It’s the creature-collecting of <em>Pokémon</em> but without all of the battles. Also, you can fly. <em>Flock</em> is all about, well, gathering a flock of cute little creatures. You do that by soaring around an idyllic landscape on the back of a giant bird and searching out every animal you can (all of which can similarly fly). Each time you find something new, you’ll have to help figure out exactly what it is, and while the game gives you some light goals, you’re mostly free to explore on your own. Even better: while it’s very serene to fly solo, you can also go exploring with friends. —AW</p><p><h4><em>Minishoot’ Adventures</em></h4></p><p><h5>PC</h5></p><p><em>Minishoot’ Adventures</em> mixes a twin-stick bullet hell shooter with top-down <em>Legend of Zelda</em>-style adventuring. Seriously: as a cute spaceship, you’ll explore dungeons and collect small keys and pieces of heart. It sounds strange, but it’s a genre mashup that totally works. —JP</p><p><h4><em>Nine Sols</em></h4></p><p><h5>PC</h5></p><p><em>Nine Sols</em> will feel familiar to <em>Hollow Knight</em> fans: it’s a beautifully styled Metroidvania with tough combat. <em>Nine Sols’</em> action rewards patience and parrying, which is a fun challenge; it’s incredibly satisfying to expertly parry an attack and follow up with a finishing move. The game’s copious amount of text, while interesting, can get in the way of the excellent action, but if you’ve still got your clown makeup on for <em>Silksong</em>, <em>Nine Sols</em> will probably scratch the itch. —JP</p><p><h4><em>Schim</em></h4></p><p><h5>PC, PlayStation, Xbox, Switch</h5></p><p><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1519710%2FSCHiM%2F"><em>Schim</em></a> is essentially “The Floor is Lava” translated into a video game. But instead of your mother’s loveseat, you hop between the shadows of people and objects to navigate the world. It’s a clever game that makes use of simple things like perspective to create complicated platforming puzzles that are satisfying to solve. Once while stuck, I had a great “aha!” moment when I realized I could create the shadows I needed by possessing a traffic light and changing the signal to free up a gaggle of patient bikers. <em>Schim</em> has the kind of strategic thinking I live for. —AP</p><p><h4><em>SteamWorld Heist 2</em></h4></p><p><h5>PC, PlayStation, Xbox, Switch</h5></p><p>It’s been a decade since the original <em>SteamWorld Heist</em> expanded the robotic franchise with some delicious turn-based pirate action. In the original, you’d recruit a team of robots and go on missions gathering loot and battling all kinds of enemies. Whereas the first game took place in space, the sequel goes nautical, with a huge sea to explore and lots of machines to battle and shipwrecks to plunder. The action is similar — which means you’ll be carefully plotting every move and attack as you strategically explore levels — but feels more polished this time around, buoyed by beautiful 2D visuals and a surprisingly deep storyline.—AW</p><p><h4><em>Thank Goodness You’re Here!</em></h4></p><p><h5>PC, PlayStation, and Switch</h5></p><p>This might be the strangest game I have ever played. You play as a little fella with a big head who only has two actions: jump and slap. It’s a little like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/20/20868532/untitled-goose-game-review-nintendo-switch-pc-house-panic"><em>Untitled Goose Game</em></a>, but also <em>much</em> weirder. You’re tasked with helping folks in a quaint English village (who all exclaim “Thank goodness you’re here!” when you arrive), but things almost always devolve into some odd mess. You’ll be collecting bird soldiers, exploring a tiny grocery store for rats, and navigating everything from underground pipes to a premium cut of ham. Along the way, you’ll slap a lot of bums and be charmed by the dulcet tones of Matt Berry. —AW</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"Thank you for your long-term support of the games and characters I have been responsible for. I hope you will continue to support Capcom's games and characters.</p>
<p>"From September, I will start developing a new game in a new environment. I hope to create fun, beautiful games that are as memorable as, or even more memorable than, the ones I have created so far.</p>
<p>"Please stay tuned for my next creation!"</p>
<p>Dragon's Dogma 2 secured a lofty five out of five stars in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragons-dogma-2-review">Eurogamer's Dragon Dogma 2</a> review.</p>
<p>"I do think a lot of what Dragon's Dogma 2 does scratches an itch for me, and that some of the things I love about it are specific to me," wrote contributor Lewis Parker.</p>
<p>"But the longer I've played it the less I've worried about my own bias towards it. Even if I hadn't have played the first Dragon's Dogma, I can tell you with complete certainty that I'd have come to same conclusion I have now, and I'd have given Dragon's Dogma 2 the same score I have now, simply because no other game in recent memory has inspired the same feeling of captivation and wonder in me.</p>
<p>"The joy of discovery lies within all of us, and Dragon's Dogma 2 succeeds in evoking that magical feeling in a way no other game has before it."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Concord is estimated to have sold just 25,000 copies.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-is-estimated-to-have-sold-only-25000-units-heres-why-analysts-think-its-failing">IGN</a>, analyst Simon Carless <a href="https://gamediscover.co/">estimates</a> that Concord’s sales equate to around 10,000 units on Steam and around 15,000 on PlayStation.</p>
<p>Whilst we can't track the real-time player numbers on PlayStation, right now there are just 71 players online on Steam. Its highest concurrent player count in the last 24 hours is 151.</p>

<p>"Concord ranked 147th in US PS5 daily active players across all titles, with fewer than 0.2 percent of Monday's active PS5 players playing the game," adds Circana analyst, Mat Piscatella.</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="316"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1f5k5pl/ign_concord_is_estimated_to_have_sold_only_25000/">IGN: Concord is estimated to have sold only 25,000 units</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/passmethegrease/">u/passmethegrease</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/">GamingLeaksAndRumours</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>Most analysts approached by IGN for comment suggest Concord's beleaguered launch follows "poor marketing, a high price point, and most critically, a lack of differentiation in an oversaturated genre".</p>
<p>"A tight-knit group of players might be willing to take a chance on a new game for free, but paying $40 is a big ask in today's macroeconomic climate," said Midia Research analyst, Rhys Elliott.</p>
<p>"Launching Concord as a premium game limited its audience numbers and user acquisition. The more people who play a game, the more appealing it is. Network effects are crucial for building a healthy, engaged ecosystem.</p>
<p>"Concord should have launched free-to-play - or at least as part of the PlayStation Plus subscription - to have a fighting chance in its overcrowded genre. It is not too late for this to happen, of course, but the damage might have already been done. First impressions matter."</p>
<p>We gave the hero shooter three out of five stars in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-review">Eurogamer's Concord review</a>, saying: "The question now, given Concord's allegedly poor uptake among players, is whether we'll get to see that. I for one hope we do. Concord may be a flawed game, but it is far from a hopeless one. </p>
<p>"And while the game currently misses the brief on the 'hero' part of its genre, it is worth remembering that heroes are ultimately defined by their actions, rather than their costumes."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
