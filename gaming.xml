            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Season 2</strong> for <strong>Battlefield 6</strong> finally <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-2-now-live-drives-highest-steam-concurrent-count-this-month/">arrived earlier this week</a> after an unexpected <strong>one-month delay</strong>. While we can hopefully trust the <strong>Battlefield Studios</strong> teams when they say the length between Season 1 and Season 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-2-delay-should-remain-isolated-case/">was an isolated case,</a> the new content in Season 2 hasn't exactly set the game's community on fire, and players still have several issues with the new content.</p>



<p>Outside of complaints about the new <strong>VL-7</strong> gas (which a scroll through the r/Battlefield page will show you players are either very positive on or very against), one thing that Battlefield 6 players agree on is that they want larger maps to run around. According to series producer <strong>Phillipp Girette</strong> at <strong>DICE</strong>, in an interview with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/dice-has-heard-the-message-very-clear-and-is-now-prioritizing-larger-maps-for-battlefield-6-but-it-takes-a-really-long-time/">PC Gamer</a>, the team is extremely aware of this. But don't hold your breath for a brand new large map coming anytime soon.</p>



<p>"<em>We don't want to spoil too much yet, but we've <strong>heard the message very clear</strong></em>," Girette said on the topic of players wanting larger maps. "<em>You've seen recently in Battlefield Labs that we started testing <strong>Golmud Railway,</strong> one of the older Battlefield maps. That is one of the responses [to that feedback] that we can give there, and the rest is for the future</em>."</p>



<p>So, in a similar vein to how <strong>EA</strong> and Battlefield Studios are pulling on fan-favourite elements of past Battlefields, like bringing back the <strong>Little Bird</strong> helicopter to kick off Season 2, and calling back to <strong>Battlefield 1</strong> by bringing back Operations with <strong>Operation Augur</strong>, an upcoming LTM set to arrive in the final phase of Season 2, we'll also likely see the return of old Battlefield maps, like Golmud Railway.</p>



<p>That's all fine and well, and it's a strategy that will likely add larger maps to Battlefield 6 faster than it would if the Battlefield Studios teams were making them from scratch. But it's not exactly the most exciting proposition to always be looking forward to the return of old maps. The problem, of course, with making brand-new, large scale maps, is how long it takes to make them.</p>



<p>"<em>For the maps, we try to make changes for the ones that are currently in development. And then we look further ahead, as you said. <strong>It takes a really long time to make these maps</strong>. We're somewhat, not limited, but we have to be very targeted in what we do…I think we will definitely take a look at the existing maps, but there's nothing we could announce that is going to happen within Season 2.</em>"</p>



<p>The idea that the team is making tweaks to new maps it already had in development is, again, a good sign and one that shows how the team is trying to respond to player feedback as quickly as it can. But that could also result in those maps just feeling stretched out. We've also seen how EA can overdo it in terms of the size of maps before, just ask anyone who was in <strong>Battlefield 2042</strong> when it launched.</p>



<p>Hopefully, the team is able to strike a good balance and get new, large-scale maps out to players sooner than later, at least for the start of Season 3, if it won't happen in Season 2.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Square Enix Teases What Fans Pray Is A New Nier Automata Game]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/nier-automata-3-sequel-square-enix-yoko-taro-2000671960</link>
            <guid>1441714</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s been nine years since <a href="https://kotaku.com/nier-automata-the-kotaku-review-1793002839"><em>Nier: Automata</em></a> first graced the PlayStation 4 and broke through to players beyond director Yoko Taro’s usual esoteric action-RPG fandom. But there hasn’t been a new game since. Fans are desperate for that to chance. Square Enix just gave them fresh hope.</p> <p>“<em>Nier: Automata</em> to be continued.” That’s how a celebratory trailer during an anniversary livestream on Friday ended. It could mean a lot of things. Fans hope it means <em>Nier: Automata 2</em>, or a fresh RPG within the <em>Nier</em> lineage that goes wherever Taro wants to take it.</p>

 <p>The action-RPG stars an android named 2B in a post-apocalyptic world where human-made robots are at war with invading alien machines. Developed by PlatinumGames, the combat sings and thanks to Taro’s baroque storytelling process, the game must be played and <a href="https://kotaku.com/every-time-nier-automata-ends-it-gets-better-1793524744">finished multiple times</a> to reveal its true secrets.</p>  <p>Set in the same world as <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-nier-replicant-remaster-does-many-good-things-and-o-1846743596">2010’s <em>Nier</em></a>, it succeeded way beyond the cult-classic legacy of the original. A PS4 exclusive when it first launched, Nier: Automata was also a surprising bright spot in a mixed portfolio at Square Enix. The company announced the game surpassed 10 million sales in this week’s anniversary stream. The obvious questions is why <em>wouldn’t</em> the<em> Final Fantasy</em> maker greenlight a sequel?</p>

 <p>2B has been in plenty of other games as a guest character (or costume), and a mobile spin-off <a href="https://kotaku.com/nier-reincarnation-shut-down-1851206958"><em>Nier Reincarnation</em></a> launched in 2021. But there’s never been a proper console sequel. If Square’s latest tease is actually for another mobile game, manga spin-off, or some other sort of transmedia adaptation, fans will riot.</p>

 <h2>What has Yoko Taro been up to?</h2> <p>For all of the love around his games, Taro hasn’t been shy about his struggles to get a new project off the ground. “I often get told stuff like ‘Why aren’t you making a new sequel to&nbsp;<em>NieR</em>?’ or ‘Yoko Taro isn’t doing anything,’ but that’s because recently, a lot of projects I was involved in got discontinued midway through development,” he said <a href="https://kotaku.com/please-stop-cancelling-yoko-taros-games-2000644949">back in 2025</a>.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ja" dir="ltr">９周年記念放送おわりました！ご視聴ご来場頂いた皆様、アリガトウゴザイマシタ！！ <a href="https://t.co/BCNwYjqcIz">https://t.co/BCNwYjqcIz</a> <a href="https://t.co/rdG1KkYeYN">pic.twitter.com/rdG1KkYeYN</a></p> <p>— yokotaro (@yokotaro) <a href="https://twitter.com/yokotaro/status/2024842023375929506?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 20, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“I’ve actually been working on some stuff, it’s just that it never ended up seeing the light of day,” he continued. “I got paid for it, so I personally have no issues with that, but people seem to think that I haven’t been doing anything just because none of the work I’ve done is being released.”</p>

 <p>It’s hard to believe that the guy who only ever appears in public wearing a mask of one of the characters from the first <em>Nier</em> wouldn’t want to keep working on the franchise. He appeared in the this week’s anniversary stream and tweeted about the new sales milestone but hasn’t let any cryptic hints slip about the franchise’s future. Yet.</p> <p>But if we somehow never got a new Nier: Automata game, well, that would be sort of fitting as well. “Life is unfair,” he told&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/life-is-unfair-a-q-a-with-nier-automatas-director-1795653562">back in 2017</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-confirms-far-cry-and-assassins-creed/</link>
            <guid>1441711</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a new interview, Ubisoft Co-founder and CEO Yves Guillemot has confirmed that two new Far Cry projects and multiple Assassin’s Creed games are in development.</p>



<p>Of course, for those in the loop with Insider Gaming, you’d know that we’ve been reporting on these games for the last two years, so Guillemot’s announcement shouldn’t come as a surprise.</p>







<p><span>The two Far Cry games are <span>codenamed ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/far-cry-7-story-details/" target="_blank">Blackbird</a>‘ and ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-far-cry-7-and-maverick/" target="_blank">Maverick</a>‘, with Blackbird being the next mainline Far Cry game and Maverick a</span> kind of extraction shooter.</span> We say “a kind” here because Maverick has been rescoped and iterated multiple times during development, with the last major change coming late last year.</p>



<p>Blackbird has also had problems of its own and has seen the game internally delayed multiple times, with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-has-delayed-its-significant-ips-to-improve-game-quality/" type="link" id="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-has-delayed-its-significant-ips-to-improve-game-quality/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest delay coming earlier this year</a> as a part of Ubisoft’s announced restructuring. </p>



<p>In the <a href="https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/ubisoft-ceo-interview-yves-guillemot-layoffs-creative-house-1236667500/" type="link" id="https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/ubisoft-ceo-interview-yves-guillemot-layoffs-creative-house-1236667500/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interview</a>, Yves also confirms that multiple Assassin’s Creed games are currently in development, with both single-player and multiplayer experiences.</p>



<p>Three games are understood to be fully “locked in” according to Insider Gaming sources, with Invictus, a multiplayer title, and Obsidian, the Assassin’s Creed Black Flag remake, scheduled to release later this year. The third game, codenamed Neo (publicly known as Hexe), is now scheduled to release in 2027.</p>



<p>As a part of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/six-games-ubisoft-canceled/" type="link" id="https://insider-gaming.com/six-games-ubisoft-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft’s recent restructuring</a>, two Assassin’s Creed games were internally cancelled. One being the already released mobile game Assassin’s Creed Rebellion, and a second game called Assassin’s Creed Singularity.</p>







<p>Assassin’s Creed Singularity was in development for a couple of years, said sources, and was intended to be a virtual trading card game with Web3 and blockchain integration. The game was scheduled to release on both PC and mobile platforms.</p>

<p>New US video game sales data is live, revealing that PlayStation 5 was the leading console in January 2026 and more. </p>



<p>In <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-5-was-uss-best-selling-hardware-in-november-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">November</a> 2025, PlayStation 5 was the US’s best-selling hardware; in December 2025, the Nintendo Switch 2 took the lead; and now the PS5 is back in first place at the start of the new year. The US video game sales data also revealed more details, such as the best-selling game, a dip in accessories spending, and more. </p>







<h2 id="h-playstation-5-overtakes-nintendo-switch-2-in-hardware-sales-for-january-2026">PlayStation 5 Overtakes Nintendo Switch 2 in Hardware Sales for January 2026</h2>



<p>The latest US video game stats come from Mat Piscatella’s post on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3mfcbfovqnc2r" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">BlueSky</a>. The analyst first noted that hardware spending increased year-on-year by 16% to $248 million. Switch 2 offset declines, whereas PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and Switch saw declines of 17%, 27%, and 79%, respectively. Despite the decline, PlayStation 5 was the best-selling hardware in January 2026, in both unit and dollar sales. The Nintendo Switch 2 came second. </p>



<p>Accessories spending fell 5% year on year to $185 million, the lowest since January 2020 ($143 million). In January, projected spending on video game hardware, content, and accessories increased by 3% year over year to $4.7 billion. This growth was driven by a 23% rise in subscription spending and a 16% increase in hardware sales. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-january-2026-best-selling-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best-selling game</a> of this month was Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. </p>







<p>In other news, Sony PlayStation has decided to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-playstation-is-shutting-down-bluepoint-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shut down Bluepoint Games</a>.

            <p>The latest set photos from Amazon's upcoming Tomb Raider TV series give us our first look at Martin Bobb-Semple's Zip, as well as Sophie Turner as Lara Croft holding a rather mysterious looking piece of kit.</p>
<p><strong>Please be aware of potential spoilers for Amazon's Tomb Raider TV series below</strong> (to be clear, I have no idea what the plot is - for this show and just generally in life - but I don't want to accidentally show you too much too soon if you would rather keep an air of the unknown around the upcoming series).</p>

<p>The latest Tomb Raider set photos appear to take place in the same Surrey woods from earlier set photos, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-first-look-at-sophie-turners-lara-croft-and-her-dual-pistols-on-set-of-tomb-raider">saw Turner parachuting in during the day time</a>. These new images, however, appear to take place at night, with Lara now sporting that aforementioned new kit - a mysterious dagger.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-15573351/amp/Sophie-Turner-knife-fight-scenes-motorbike-films-new-Tomb-Raider-series.html">Daily Mail</a>, Turner filmed "dramatic knife fight scenes" during the shoot, so I am now wondering if she went to the woods in search of this (potential) artifact. Though, Lara's gloves are <em>slightly </em>different, so maybe not… I guess we will have to wait and see.</p>
<p>In addition to the dagger, Lara also appears to have a retractable pickaxe with her. This tool made an appearance in the animated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider series</a> on Netflix if I recall correctly.</p>
<p>As for Zip, Lara's resident tech expert is no longer relegated to being behind an ear piece or computer. As you can see in the images below, Bobb-Semple's Zip is in on the action, and can be seen picking Lara up on a motorcycle.</p><p>I have to admit, I am not sure he is wearing <em>exactly </em>what I would choose to wear if I had to go and scoop my friend up from the dark, rain-soaked woods at night while on a motorbike, but he does look pretty sharp.</p>
<p>Also, I would have liked to see Lara on the front of the bike rather than at the back, but even so, I am very pleased to see motorbikes will be a part of Amazon's Tomb Raider show. Overall, I am really feeling rather optimistic about this adaptation.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, we had a wave of cast announcements for Amazon's Tomb Raider series. As well as Turner and Bobb-Semple, the show will also feature <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-traitors-celia-imrie-and-more-announced-for-amazons-live-action-tomb-raider-series">Jason Isaacs as Lara's Uncle Atlas and Bill Paterson as Winston</a>. Additionally, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-lara-croft-actress-spotted-on-tomb-raider-set-with-fans-now-speculating-she-will-play-laras-mother-in-amazons-series">former Lara Croft actress Keeley Hawes was also spotted on set in London</a> earlier this year, with many suspecting she will play Lara's mother Amelia on the show's release.</p><p>Meanwhile, Fleabag and Killing Eve's Phoebe Waller-Bridge <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-film-and-tv-series-reportedly-in-the-works-at-amazon">will serve as the show's creator</a>, writer, executive producer and co-showrunner. "It's not very often you get to make a show of this scale with a character you grew up loving," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-live-action-tomb-raider-series-has-found-its-lara-croft">Waller-Bridge has said of Tomb Raider</a>. "Everyone on board is wildly passionate about Lara and are all as outrageous, brave, and hilarious as she is.</p>
<p>"Get your artifacts out... Croft is coming..."</p>

<p>But then again, this is a platform that arguably deserves a second look, despite its well-documented shortcomings.</p>
<p>The brainchild of the late, great Gunpei Yokoi, the Virtual Boy was supposed to be another Game Boy-sized smash hit, but its undercooked tech (Yokoi reportedly wanted to work on it longer than Nintendo would allow), uncomfortable setup, and lack of convincing software support saw it dropped from stores less than a year after its release in 1995.</p><div><figure data-videoid="8i2vvu-qeBQ" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8i2vvu-qeBQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt8i2vvu-qeBQ" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8i2vvu-qeBQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8i2vvu-qeBQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4c3af8mwnsyv&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>Yet, there's nothing <em>quite</em> like the Virtual Boy – outside of those battery-powered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomytronic_3D">Tomytronic 3D handhelds</a> from the 1980s. perhaps. Even when compared to <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/features/meta-quest-3-is-the-best-way-to-play-3ds-and-virtual-boy-in-2024">modern-day Virtual Reality headsets</a>, Nintendo's stab at the technology has a charm all its own – and it's now possible to experience it without having to shell out for an original unit (I'll get to why that's important shortly).</p>

<p>In case you weren't aware, there's no actual working tech inside the modern-day Virtual Boy – it's essentially a caddy into which you place your Switch 1 or 2 (I'd advise you do this gingerly, by the way, as it feels like there's potential for scratches and scrapes on your console's screen, despite the presence of some rubber pads – it's quite an awkward fit).</p>
<p>The image on the Switch's screen is displayed in the famous 'Virtual Boy red', an effect which is reinforced by a pair of red-coloured lenses (these are needed because the main Virtual Boy NSO menu, where box art is displayed, is in colour). The stereoscopic effect comes courtesy of the same lens section that originally shipped with the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nintendo_labo_toy-con_04_vr_kit">Labo VR</a> headset – you can even remove the red lens section to reveal it.</p>
<p>While the old and new Virtual Boys look almost identical when placed side-by-side, there are several subtle differences.</p>
<p>The controller port, volume dial, and 3.5mm headphone socket aren't present on the new version, although Nintendo has been cute enough to mould them into the casing regardless. Likewise, the IPD / interpupillary distance and focus controls are purely for show – you can adjust the latter in-app, however.</p>

<p>The stand is also slightly higher on the new model, to allow the Switch console to poke out of the bottom of the main unit.</p>
<p>As for the stand itself, it's possible to use it with the original Virtual Boy, which is good news for those of you who have cracked stands – this is a very common problem on older units, with the failure point being where the two legs 'click' outwards.</p>
<p>Being able to replace the original stand with this new one is great, but it sadly doesn't work in the opposite direction; because it has two prongs that lock into the body of the original 1995 Virtual Boy, the old stand cannot be used with the resurrected model.</p>
<p>It also seems that replacing the 'eye shade' on the 2026 version isn't as straightforward as it was on the 1995 edition. Back in the day, you could easily pop off the existing eye shade and clean or replace it, but with the new variant, it doesn't appear to come away as easily – and I'm not brave enough to force it to find out. However, Nintendo does list it as a separate component on the box, so I'd assume it can be removed when the time comes. (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/gallery-weve-got-the-virtual-boy-accessory-for-nintendo-switch-online">Ollie has done it</a>, although it took "a little bit of force.")</p>
<p>The visual experience is recreated almost flawlessly; I constantly switched between an original Virtual Boy and the new offering to gauge the difference, and while the pixels on the Switch 2's screen are more noticeable than those on the legit VB, the effect is still pretty faithful.</p>
<p>The way audio is handled is similar, too, with the Switch speakers serving as a pretty competent replacement for the Virtual Boy's built-in offerings. The 'fake' 3.5mm headphone jack means you can't connect a pair of wired headphones like you could in 1995, however. You'll have to opt for wireless alternatives in 2026.</p>

<p>On the downside, the biggest drawback of using a Virtual Boy — the fact that you're hunched over, gazing into a table-mounted headset — is also present and correct in this version.</p>
<p>While many people complain about eye strain and headaches when using the machine, my biggest gripe was always the fact that my neck would hurt after even a short period of time. The same is absolutely true here, and, unless you get your seating position totally perfect, you can expect to feel some discomfort after just a few minutes of play.</p>
<p>It's little wonder, then, that Nintendo felt compelled to put an 'Automatic Pause' option into each Virtual Boy game back in the day; when enabled, this encouraged you to take a short break after around 20 minutes – essential not just to avoid eye strain, but also to allow you to stretch your back and move your neck around a bit. The feature is present in all of the games available for this new version.</p>
<p>Nintendo hasn't gone as far as to replicate the Virtual Boy's unique controller, which is a shame but not the end of the world. The dual-pad setup is reproduced well on the Switch Joy-Con's analogue sticks, with the 'A' and 'B' buttons taking the place of the (you've guessed it) 'A' and 'B' buttons of the original pad.</p>
<p>I'm actually of the opinion that the Virtual Boy controller isn't one of Nintendo's finest hours, so I prefer the setup Nintendo has offered here – plus, I dread to think of how much more expensive this thing would be had the company chosen to recreate the pad, as well.</p>
<figure data-uuid="cfaea520a0314"><a title="Review: Virtual Boy Switch 10" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/cfaea520a0314/review-virtual-boy-switch-10.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>While you can adjust the angle of the headset, there's no escaping the fact that it's not a comfortable device to use for prolonged periods — <em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The price of this new Virtual Boy really does need mentioning, because, at almost £70 / $100, it's not what I would call an impulse purchase.</p>
<p>I've already seen people online lamenting how easily they were suckered by Nintendo-related FOMO when it was first announced, and I absolutely get it. The original Virtual Boy is a standard-issue piece of furniture in the gaming room of any self-respecting fan (if it's good enough for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2017/02/random_of_course_seinfelds_george_costanza_was_a_virtual_boy_fan">George Costanza</a>, it's good enough for me!), so this is a cheaper way of improving your decor, if nothing else.</p>
<p>As I hinted earlier, it's also a hassle-free way of experiencing the Virtual Boy's meagre library, as owning an original unit is fraught with challenges.</p>
<p>I've already mentioned the fragile stand (my first Virtual Boy suffered from this), <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/04/a-fix-for-the-virtual-boys-second-biggest-failing-is-available">but there's also the problem of the glue on the ribbon connectors inside the unit failing over time</a>; like the infamous horizontal lines on a monochrome Game Boy's LCD, the Virtual Boy's monochrome red screens are prone to developing a horizontal line fault similar to that seen on the Game Boy's LCD.</p>
<p>It's possible to repair this fault, but it's not a cheap exercise. During my review period, I was dismayed to notice that my own Virtual Boy had developed this very same issue, so in one way, this new accessory couldn't have come at a better time for me personally.</p>

<p>Ultimately, there's no escaping the fact that, as a concept, the Virtual Boy is utterly flawed.</p>
<p>It would work better as a headset you could attach to your face (something Nintendo actually promised at one point in the '90s, before it became clear the product was a dud), and, while titles like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/virtual_boy_wario_land">Virtual Boy Wario Land</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/red_alarm">Red Alarm</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/vertical_force">Vertical Force</a> are decent, the system suffers from a dire lack of must-have games, rendering it more of a curiosity than a must-have purchase.</p>
<p>Still, while the Virtual Boy certainly has its problems and isn't something I'd recommend unreservedly, if you're already a Nintendo Switch Online subscriber and have in any way felt curious about Nintendo's most infamous hardware flop, then it's certainly worth a look – even more so when you consider that the company is commited to opening up the system's library with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/two-cancelled-virtual-boy-games-coming-to-nso-in-2026-including-f-zero-spin-off">unreleased titles</a>.</p>
<p>Just expect it to achieve ornamental status in your gaming room sooner rather than later.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Finji, the publisher behind indie hits like <em>Tunic </em>and <em>Night in the Woods</em>, has accused social media platform TikTok of creating "racist" and "sexist" generative AI ads for its games without its permission.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tunic-night-in-the-woods-publisher-says-tiktok-is-creating-and-running-racist-genai-ads-for-its-games-without-permission" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">IGN</a>, Finji first became aware of these ads through comments on its non-AI ads from concerned fans. One ad reportedly depicts the protagonist of Finji's game <em>Usual June</em>, a Black woman, in a way that, in IGN's words, seemingly "invokes a harmful stereotype".</p><p>Creatives and businesses on TikTok can choose to opt into a program called Smart Creative, which essentially grants TikTok permission to remix their content and ads with generative AI. You've probably already guessed this, but Finji's account had this option resolutely switched off.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Usual June </em>and <em>Night in the Woods </em>publisher Finji has some harsh words for TikTok, and rightly so.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Needless to say, Finji CEO Rebekah Saltsman raised this issue with TikTok's support center, and what follows can only be described as a descent into Kafkaesque absurdity.</p><p>At first, TikTok seems supportive, with a support agent pledging to "raise a ticket" to alert the relevant teams to what's going on. Following that, however, Finji and Saltsman received a response claiming that there was no "indication" of generative AI being used for the ads in question.</p><p>Naturally, a Finji rep then responds by providing evidence that this is not the case, upon which TikTok backtracks and promises to "initiate an internal escalation".</p><p>Finji still can't breathe easy at this point, though, because upon following up with TikTok, the studio was told that it was included in an automated ad initiative, again without its consent, and that said initiative "typically [brings] a 1.4x return on ad spend lift" for those enrolled.</p>
<p>Saltsman and Finji demand that the issue be re-escalated, and TikTok demurs, claiming that it's already passed the issue on to "the highest internal team" available, and that said team has "already provided [its] final findings and actions".</p><p>Finji replies yet again, upon which TikTok pledges to "re-escalate" the problem, but according to IGN and Saltsman, that's the last the studio heard from TikTok, and a followup message sent a few days ago yielded nothing.</p><p>Generative AI is already an intensely controversial topic in the gaming industry, with some studios <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/divinity-larian-gen-ai-concept-art" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="456b3d42-117f-4386-bca9-617e6237ee89" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">throwing their weight behind it</a> and others <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hooded-horse-no-gen-ai-contracts" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4bf049e2-a4f8-41a0-b834-8030bfbcc977" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">opposing it for all they're worth</a>.</p><p>To me, though, it seems like this usage of the technology - generating AI ads without the consent of the studio concerned, then seemingly deflecting and even essentially gaslighting the studio into believing that no, it's a good thing, actually - is beyond the pale.</p><p>We'll have to wait and see whether Finji and TikTok's issue gets resolved in future, but judging by the correspondence shared by the studio thus far, I don't think there's much cause for optimism. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <guid>1441684</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I’ve written about a lot of different video game hardware over the years, from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review">new consoles</a> to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/822849/analogue-3d-review-n64">retro gadgets</a> to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23025390/playdate-handheld-portable-gaming-console-review">whatever you want to call the Playdate</a>. But I can’t remember ever being perpetually sore from testing a device; such are the joys of the Virtual Boy. Nintendo has turned its biggest flop into an accessory for the Switch, but the costs involved — to your wallet, eyes, and neck — make it a tough sell. Much like the original, this is a novelty for Nintendo sickos only.</p><p>First released in 1995, the original Virtual Boy looked like a VR headset but wasn’t actually VR or a headset. Instead, the console offered stereoscopic 3D games that you viewed through a pair of bulky goggles that were propped up on a stand. It also rendered games in eye-searing red and black, making for an experience that had some potential but was ultimately ugly and uncomfortable. It was a flop and was discontinued after just a year, amassing a library of less than two dozen games.</p><p>Now Nintendo has brought that same experience to the Switch. Virtual Boy games have been added to the Nintendo Classics collection of retro games available to Switch Online subscribers this week, but the twist is, because of the unique nature of the original hardware, you need to buy an accessory to actually play them. There’s a plastic re-creation of the Virtual Boy that’ll run you $100, which is what I’ve been using, as well as a cheaper cardboard headset that’s a much more reasonable $25. Either way, you’ll need both a subscription and an accessory to play these games.</p><p>Technically the games will run in portable mode without one of the accessories connected, but without the magnifying goggles, they’re displayed so small that they’re essentially unplayable. It looks something like this:</p><p>The plastic Virtual Boy <em>looks </em>like the original hardware, complete with a fake controller port and volume dial. But really it’s an elaborate Switch (or Switch 2) case that turns it into something resembling a Virtual Boy. It works like this: The top of the Virtual Boy opens up, letting you slot in a Switch, sans Joy-Con controllers, inside. When you close it up, the Switch becomes the console powering the Virtual Boy-like experience. Look through the goggles, and you’re awash in pixelated reds and blacks (though other colors will <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/868569/nintendo-switch-online-virtual-boy-3d-lineup-launch">be available post-launch</a>).</p><p>Since you don’t wear it strapped to your face, the Virtual Boy doesn’t have the same problems as a typical VR headset, where you’re supporting a bunch of weight on your head. But it’s still far from comfortable in my experience. The stand is adjustable so you can change the angle of the goggles, but I had a hard time finding an optimal viewing angle, despite trying to play it lots of different ways. And man, those red graphics; they were hard to look at in the ’90s, and things haven’t improved much. The Virtual Boy is a system where you need to take frequent breaks to save your eyes and neck. Don’t make the same mistakes I did.</p><p>All that said, the Virtual Boy’s lineup is surprisingly interesting to play in 2026. There are seven titles available at launch, and while there are a few duds — I just can’t seem to wrap my head around the first-person robot fighter <em>Teleroboxer</em> — I’ve really been enjoying playing <em>3D Tetris</em>, <em>Galactic Pinball</em>, and the space shooter <em>Red Alarm</em>. The standout might be <em>Wario Land</em>, a fairly straightforward and occasionally clunky platformer but with 3D elements like enemies that jump out right in front of you, making things feel more tense. It’s not a huge lineup by any stretch, but it gives you a good sense of what the Virtual Boy is all about. Which is to say, there are some solid games with neat 3D gimmicks that are fun in short doses. (Why the tentpole <em>Mario’s Tennis</em> isn’t available at launch, especially given <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/875986/nintendo-switch-2-release-schedule-mario-tennis-fever">the recent release of <em>Mario Tennis Fever</em></a><em>,</em> is a mystery to me.)</p><p>Nintendo tends to have a complicated relationship with its own history, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/27/24256070/nintendo-museum-kyoto-tour-shigeru-miyamoto">often glossing over its failures</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/790186/super-mario-galaxy-nintendo-switch-2">doing a poor job of celebrating what makes its games so important</a>. So on one hand, the existence of this Virtual Boy seems like something of a miracle. Few people had a chance to play the original, and here it is available through <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/873098/nintendo-switch-era-best-selling-console">Nintendo’s most successful platform ever</a>. But it’s also a product that requires jumping through a lot of hoops for a small amount of payoff. And since it’s tied to NSO, you’re spending $100 to play games only for as long as you have a subscription or the service is active. After that, you have a costly paperweight.</p><p>The Switch version of the Virtual Boy is a device that’s weird, awkward, and of limited appeal — which, now that I think about it, perfectly re-creates the experience of the original.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/881677/nintendo-switch-virtual-boy-review]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 was the best-selling game in the United States (US) for January 2026. </p>



<p>The latest US sales data was released on Friday, and that came with the news that the latest in the long-running series continues to sit at the top of the sales charts. What makes it just as impressive is that it’s a game included for members with Xbox Game Pass PC or Ultimate.</p>







<p>Moving away from Call of Duty, looking at the Top 5 sees sports games fall right behind with Call of Duty’s main competitor, Battlefield 6, coming in at No. 5. The top five, in order, are: Black Ops 7, NBA 2K26, Madden NFL 26, Minecraft, and Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>Elsewhere in the Top 20, Final Fantasy 7: Remake jumps from 225 last month to the ninth spot thanks to its release on the Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series X|S in January. Other games from outside the Top 20 in December that found themselves on the list include Helldivers 2, Split Fiction, Elden Ring, and Fallout 4. </p>



<p>Lastly, one new release entered the Top 20 as Code Vein 2 finds itself at No. 11.</p>

<p>After the aforementioned "very special" event, you'll either need to hold the <em>Skate </em>Pass Premium or pay in-game Rip Chips to access the Isle of Grom, and the latter will only net you a 24-hour pass, so it's not permanent.</p><p>Technically speaking - and I mean real fine-print technical here - the new map isn't really locked behind a paywall per se, because you can theoretically access it without paying real money.</p><p>Still, though, I'd say this is a contravention of what EA <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/skate-4-now-titled-skate-will-be-free-to-play" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="966b1818-c2c5-4648-9899-942a622c5274" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">promised all the way back in 2022</a> in spirit, if not absolutely in letter. It's not a great look to need to argue the finer detail rather than the broader picture.</p><p>Perhaps more insultingly, in response to a player asking why EA stepped away from the no-maps-behind-paywalls promise, the company rather dismissively <a href="https://x.com/skate/status/2024539083259654345" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">says</a> that "plans have to change" sometimes, and that "that's part of the deal when you're building in public".</p><figure role="group">

<p>In fact, one X <a href="https://x.com/its6767/status/2024645684272480620" rel="nofollow">user</a> points out that just one week ago, <em>Skate</em>'s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260213192103/https://www.ea.com/games/skate/skate/faq" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">website FAQ</a> declared that "new areas of San Vansterdam (the game's world) will always be free and available to all players...if it's there, you can go there". Suffice it to say the FAQ <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/skate/faq" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">no longer</a> features that passage.</p><p>Of course, the obvious question to ask here is this: if EA can walk back this promise, what's to stop the company ditching the others in the above image too? How long before <em>Skate </em>features pay-to-win elements, paid loot boxes, or paid gameplay advantages?</p><p>For now, at the very least, if you want to access <em>Skate</em>'s Isle of Grom map beyond May, you're going to have to pay for it in some form. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

		<p><em>Football is over. Baseball is almost here. Basketball, entering its far more interesting post-All Star stretch, is finally going to get interesting. </em></p><p><em>But there are sports beyond America's big three, so why not dream bigger? Why not consider the possibility of becoming interested in something...new? Could another form of disappointment exist?</em></p><p><em>At least, that's where Patrick's head is at as the Super Bowl heads into the rear view mirror and the biggest discourse amongst Chicago Bears fans is </em><a href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/sports/nfl/chicago-bears/chicago-bears-release-statement-as-indiana-stadium-bill-inches-closer-to-reality/3896412/?ref=remapradio.com"><em>whether to pay a bunch of billionaires to build a stadium</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>Which they should not do, by the way. Even though they probably will.</em></p><hr><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> I was fortunate enough to be extremely busy this past Sunday, which meant I had no time to process that it was the first time in many months without any football on TV. I like basketball, I often love baseball, but god damnit, football is the one that gets me out of bed. I’ve got the Olympics on in the background like white noise, but it’s mostly that: pleasant background chatter. Perhaps it’s time to try something new. To be daring. Rob, I think it’s time to get into F1.</p><p>My friend, who is very F1-pilled, pointed out that I’d muttered about this idea a few times, and he pointed out that the new season of Netflix’s <em>Drive to Survive</em> season is kicking off at the end of the month. I am not going to watch seven seasons of <em>Drive to Survive</em>, so you can stop right there. But look, I did watch the incredibly mediocre <em>F1</em> movie from Apple, aka the poor man’s <em>Top Gun: Maverick</em>, and at least came away interested in learning more about the drama of it all.&nbsp;</p><p>When I got into football, I downloaded a bunch of podcasts, signed up for fantasy football—I tried to find various avenues into the sport beyond a generational fandom to the Chicago Bears.</p><p><em>Drive to Survive</em>, at least, seems like the easiest and no nonsense way to lock in before the new F1 season starts in early March. But I’m also considering a podcast to join me on my regular outdoors runs as the weather starts to warm up. I ask: Who is the most Chicago-coded F1 team? If I’m to start rooting for a single driver/team, who can I pick without being an asshole?</p><p>Help me, Rob.</p><p><strong>Rob: </strong>If we had forums, this prompt is a "discussion locked after 1052 pages" kind of thing. I do this shit for a living with <em>Shift+F1 </em>but <em>Patrick </em>asking me to find him <em>the Bears </em>of F1? Suddenly there's real pressure! This is my chance to convert you!</p><p>I woke up thinking about this and spent my entire shower arguing with myself about my answer, because there were three teams that immediately sprang to mind, but I realized two have better NFL analogues. We'll get to those in a minute.</p><h3 id="the-chicago-bears-of-f1-williams"><strong>The Chicago Bears of F1: </strong>Williams</h3><p>Williams was a family operation that was a predominant power in an earlier era of F1. One of the absolute best sports documentaries I've ever seen is simply <em>Williams</em>, and what starts as a straightforward team history ends up being a painfully intimate portrait of a family that apparently never talked about their issues <em>until a film crew came asking questions</em>! It's very clear that the whole operation started as Frank Williams' obsession and turned into a burdensome legacy for his wife, and then his children. The team spent the 2000s and 2010s sliding into embarrassing irrelevance as the Williams family's finances fell behind the investment required to compete in the sport. The team has one of the highest trophy counts in F1, but for about five years its cars were reliably near last place. The second or third season of <em>Drive to Survive </em>shows the lead designer and owner flying commercial, with car parts strapped into the seats next to them because they weren't able to finish their car in time for the start of testing.</p><p>So you basically have all this stale prestige from the equivalent of the George Halas era, and a grim decline. But the team sold to an investment group a few years ago and they hired a Ben Johnson-like figure, James Vowles. He was regarded as one of the strategic geniuses behind an incredible championship run at the Mercedes team. He's got a goofy charisma: he's an awkward nerd but genuine and unguarded in a way most team principals (basically coach <em>and</em> GM) are not. He's savvy about it, too. The Williams Youtube presence is the best in F1, a mix of good self-analysis, oddly cinematic behind-the-scenes films, and a video podcast starring their drivers called <em>Team Torque</em>.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f0FGuP09iJo?list=PLKwAx-HaumhyzJeW0yN_n8sANOTKTyKCM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p><em>Team Torque </em>is in a golden age right now because Williams also has the two most personable drivers on the grid. Alex Albon is a lot like Vowles: awkward and a bit strange, obsessed with his pets, but kind of hilarious. Carlos Sainz is newer to the team, a well-regarded driver who was treated like a secondary driver rather than a team leader at. He's become a bit of a hearththrob and leans into it in a self-deprecating way, flirting shamelessly with Albon in every episode of <em>Team Torque</em>. But in between the grabassing and tangents they will also give you some of the most honest, reflective talk about the state of racing that you hear from any drivers.</p><p>Williams is still an organization that has years of organizational rot to dig out. The people working there might be great but 20 years of operating on a shoestring left them pretty dysfunctional, and there are some signs that after a great season last year, they've stumbled badly with the huge overhaul to car design required for this season. But what could be more Bears? They might be about to plunge into mediocrity after a false dawn, or they might be carrying on with a rebuilding that's finally under the right leadership. With Williams you only get heartbreak and disappointment or heartwarming underdog success.</p><p>Now I told you there were two other teams I considered for my answer but I realized there are better parallels.</p><h3 id="the-dallas-cowboys-of-f1-ferrari"><strong>The Dallas Cowboys of F1: </strong>Ferrari.</h3>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-where-when-to-watch-generation-10-switch-2000671968</link>
            <guid>1441636</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>The Pokémon Company finally, in the dead of night, announced its annual Pokémon Day Presents showcase. This is the stream the company hosts every year on February 27 to celebrate the franchise’s anniversary. </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>is turning 30 in 2026, so there’s probably a lot to share ahead of the coming year. Here’s what we know and what we can likely expect to see next week.</span></p> <h2><b>When and where can I watch?</b></h2> <p><span>The Pokémon Presents stream will air on Friday, February 27, at 9 a.m. Eastern/6 a.m. Pacific. You can catch it on the </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@pokemon"><span>official </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>YouTube</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/pokemon"><span>Twitch</span></a><span> channels to watch it live, or as a VOD if you can’t tune into the show as it premieres. We’ll also have a recap of what we see here at </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span> if you just want the highlights.</span></p>

 <h2><b>What do we know?</b></h2> <p><span>Right now, the only project confirmed to make an appearance are the </span><i><span>Pokémon FireRed </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>LeafGreen </span></i><span>ports that were </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-fire-red-leaf-green-switch-pokemon-direct-price-2000671938"><span>announced alongside the presentation</span></a><span>. The showcase will last 25 minutes, according to the </span><a href="https://x.com/Pokemon_cojp/status/2024755907343557064"><span>Japanese Pokémon Twitter account</span></a><span>, which makes it </span><a href="https://x.com/JoeMerrick/status/2024760273723146356"><span>one of the longer Pokémon Day showcases</span></a><span> since Nintendo and friends started hosting these.</span></p> <h2><b>What will we likely see?</b></h2> <p><span>The Pokémon Presents showcases cover pretty much everything going on in the franchise right now, so if you’re only interested in the next big RPG, be ready to endure segments devoted to other things. We’ll see updates on mobile games like </span><i><span>Pokémon Masters EX</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Pokémon Go</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Pokémon Sleep</span></i><span>, as well as other major pillars of the franchise like the anime and </span><i><span>Trading Card Game</span></i><span>. </span><i><span>Pokémon Pokopia </span></i><span>is also out the following week, so I’m sure we’ll see at least a little bit more of that game as we approach its March 5 release date.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Since this is the 30th anniversary, we can probably expect some portion of the showcase to be dedicated to upcoming events, both online and off, celebrating the milestone. The Pokémon Company has confirmed plans to hold separate events for both families and adults with its </span><a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/get-ready-to-celebrate-30-years-of-pokemon"><span>Day Out and Night Out events,</span></a><span> with the former being geared toward all ages and the latter being suited for “longtime fans,” which is code for people who were relatively cognizant when the series debuted 30 years ago. Right now, we don’t know what these events will entail, so a 30th anniversary stream is as good a place as any to finally lift the curtain.</span></p>

 <p><span>Based on the many leaks that have come from Game Freak over the past few years, we know a fair bit about the upcoming Generation X games, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-gen-10-wind-wave-map-leak-pikachu-professor-2000655613"><span>reportedly called </span><i><span>Pokémon Wind </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Wave</span></i></a><span>. It’s very likely that these RPGs will take up a good portion of the showcase. I would be very surprised if </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>didn’t release a new RPG during its 30th year, and the leaks heavily imply these games are next on the docket, so we could be seeing the next generation of </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>next week.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Whatever is announced, we’ll have coverage of the stream here at </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span> as it’s happening.</span></p>

<p>Resident Evil Requiem offers different difficulty options, which are slightly different from what you’d expect from the difficulty settings in recent Resi games. If you’re having a hard time deciding between the two concerning your playthrough, this guide has everything you need to know.</p>



<p>You know how difficulty settings usually go in these games: Easy, Normal, Hard, and then a harder variant once you complete the game. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/resident-evil-requiem/" id="2693" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Requiem</a> borrows one of its most iconic game mechanics to present a headache.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-s-the-difference-between-classic-amp-modern-difficulty-settings-in-resident-evil-requiem">What’s The Difference Between Classic &amp; Modern Difficulty Settings in Resident Evil Requiem?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>An age-old classic. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The main difference between Normal and Classic difficulty in Resident Evil Requiem is that you need to find and use Ink Ribbons to save in Classic Mode when using Grace, with limited autosaves, whereas Normal will use a traditional save system.</strong></p>



<p>Ah, Ink Ribbons…the suspenseful and unusual resource that makes you question whether you <em>really </em>need to save in Resident Evil games.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming:</strong> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Is Resident Evil Requiem On Xbox Game Pass?</a></li>
</ul>



<p>They first appeared in the debut Resident Evil game and became a staple of the gameplay for a few years. They have largely been neglected now in favor of modern save systems, but Requiem is bringing them back, to an extent.</p>



<p>Capcom’s RESIDENT EVIL Showcase revealed that multiple difficulties were available, with Normal and Classic being the focal point of your first playthrough options—along with a Casual mode for those seeking an easier challenge.</p>



<p>Here’s the description for each. Expect there to be another one or two harder settings once you finish the main game.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Resident Evil Requiem Difficulty Setting</th><th data-align="center">Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Casual</td><td data-align="center">“Relax while enjoying the story and puzzles.”</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Standard (Modern)</td><td data-align="center">“A balanced experience of suspense and accomplishment at the standard difficulty found among modern Resident Evil games.<p>This game mode can be changed to Casual on the game over screen.”</p></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Standard (Classic)</td><td data-align="center">“A traditional experience with a difficulty similar to classic Resident Evil games. Recommended for long-term fans of the series.<p>Autosaves during Grace’s gameplay are limited and ink ribbons are required to save.”</p></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>







<h2 id="h-should-you-choose-classic-or-modern-in-resident-evil-requiem">Should You Choose Classic or Modern in Resident Evil Requiem?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Choices. Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>As Capcom suggests, the difficulty depends on three factors: If you just want to and enjoy the game and story with few to no deaths, if you like a normal challenge, or if you enjoy the suspense of archaic Resi gameplay with limited resources.</strong></p>



<p>Personally, we are long-time Resident Evil fans, so the Standard (Classic) is the obvious choice.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming:</strong> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-release-date-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Requiem Release Date &amp; Start Times</a></li>
</ul>



<p>If you’re a newcomer, then Standard (Classic) might be better, and Casual is for those new to horror games, or like the genre but are threatened by them, or if you want to blitz through and lap up the story beats.</p>

Even then, though, Radcliffe said he was instantly aware that this was "a bad idea."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"One of the worst ideas I've ever heard, during Potter, somebody came to us and I think asked... like they wanted to cast all three of us, me, Emma and Rupert, in a remake of Wizard of Oz," Radcliffe revealed. "Emma was Dorothy, I can't remember what Rupert was, and I just remember that I was going to be the lion, but also he knew karate?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I was like a karate kicking cowardly lion," he continued. "And I remember I was like 14 or 15, and I was like, 'I don't know a lot about the world, but this is a bad idea, this should not be made."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For context, the timeline here would place Radcliffe and his co-stars as filming the fourth Harry Potter book, Goblet of Fire.

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The message "Nier Automata will continue" was the stinger concluding today's celebratory showcase for the game, which covered the game's many cameo appearances, spin-offs, and its passing of 10m worldwide sales.</p>
<p>This video, posted to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> YouTube channel, covered the game's history of releases and adaptations since its initial release in 2017. Having only recently passed 10m sales, it marks a steady increase from December 2024 when it passed 9m.</p>
<p>This announcement came alongside some new art <a href="https://x.com/NieRGame/status/2024800054004138394">posted to official Nier Automata social media platforms</a>.</p>

<p>So what could this final message mean, aside from the obvious indication that Nier Automata will carry on in some form. Well, there's been little word of a sequel to Nier Automata, despite its widespread acclaim and success. There was Nier: Reincarnation, a mobile sequel of sorts that launched in 2021 and was shut down and made unplayable in 2024. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-cancels-unannounced-nier-mobile-game">Tencent also cancelled another Nier mobile game in 2024</a>, which reportedly "struggled to find a monetisation to offset its high costs.".</p><p>You could kill all hope of a AAA direct sequel in your heart, and instead see the tease as an indication of more cameos in other games. These have proven exceptionally popular whenever they emerge: <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/nier-automata-collaboration-pushes-goddess-of-victory-nikke-to-a-half-a-billion-in-revenue/">Goddess of Victory: Nikke saw a 215 percent increase in sales thanks to its Nier Automata collaboration</a>, leaping over $500m in revenue as a result.</p>
<p>One can certainly hope for the former. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/yoko-taro">Yoko Taro</a> has been largely an absent presence from the world of <em>released</em> video games since the Nier Replicant remake in 2021, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nier-automata-creator-yoko-taro-says-hes-actually-been-working-on-a-lot-of-projects-recently-its-just-that-they-got-cancelled-midway/">stating last year the projects he had been working on were cancelled</a>.</p>
<p>What are you hoping for? If you've not played Nier Automata, you can read <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nier-automata-review">Eurogamer's review to see what all the fuss is about.</a> In it, Jeffrey Matulef wrote: "Yoko Taro's eccentric action RPG gets a follow-up that's every bit as surprising as its predecessor with a little help from Platinum Games."</p>

<figcaption>Could the followup to <em>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet </em>finally be on the horizon?</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We already know one thing that's going to be featured during the show, namely the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-firered-leafgreen-switch" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="057d121c-d519-4dfa-af54-03ce59fa9f52" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Switch release of <em>Pokemon FireRed and LeafGreen</em></a>, which was confirmed earlier today. The games will launch just after the showcase concludes.</p><p>What else we'll see during this Pokemon Presents is a mystery for now, although we can make some educated guesses; it's likely that mobile games <em>Pokemon Cafe ReMix </em>and <em>Pokemon Masters EX</em> will appear, as they usually do, and we'll probably hear from <em>Pokemon Unite </em>as well.</p><p>Outside of the realms of virtual certainty, I'd be very surprised indeed if this presentation doesn't contain at least a nod to the upcoming tenth <em>Pokemon </em>generation. Back in October, a massive <em>Pokemon </em>leak <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-leak-2025-gen-10-more" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c5a709d9-d361-46d9-823d-aa0957eba8ed" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">seemingly revealed details about gen ten</a>, so the clock's ticking on an official reveal.</p><p>We may also see more DLC announced for last year's <em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em>. The game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-a-sales" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2d5d3818-49a2-4447-89bf-e19e298fa0df" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">sold very well indeed</a>, so a second DLC pack after <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension-dlc-release-date" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1a7fab66-8e9f-461b-8e80-b39e300cbd1a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">December's <em>Mega Dimension</em></a><em> </em>seems like a good idea.</p>
<p>Whatever gets announced, the next Pokemon Presents will be airing on February 27th at 6am PT/9am ET/2pm GMT. It'll be viewable on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@pokemon" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">YouTube</a> or <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/pokemon" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Twitch</a>.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix has revealed that <em>NieR: Automata </em>has crossed another major sales milestone, and if a new teaser is to be believed, more <em>NieR </em>could finally be on the way.</p><p>Per <a href="https://x.com/NieRGame/status/2024800054004138394" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a message</a> on the official <em>NieR </em>X account, <em>NieR: Automata </em>has officially sold over 10 million copies. That figure counts across both digital and physical sales, naturally, and it also includes all platforms on which the game is currently available.</p><p>The new sales figure means that <em>NieR: Automata </em>has racked up another million sales for itself <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nier-automata-sales-9m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="144a48d3-7eae-44a0-bba4-85056ad4cc63" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">since December 2024</a>.

</figure>
<p>There's reason to hope that more <em>NieR </em>could be coming, too. At the conclusion of a new video celebrating the 10 million achievement, a message simply reads "<em>NieR: Automata </em>to be continued...".</p><p>It's worth noting that the rest of the video is entirely in Japanese, so it's possible that this is a mistranslation, or that the message simply points to more <em>NieR: Automata </em>media in future. Perhaps a current-gen port could even be on the cards.</p><p>Still, <em>NieR: Automata </em>remains the last new mainline release in the <em>NieR </em>series at time of writing, so I don't think it's unreasonable to hope that Square Enix could be gearing up to give Yoko Taro another chance to hold the reins this year.</p><p>You can watch the aforementioned video, which celebrates <em>NieR: Automata</em>'s achievements over the years, right here.</p>
<p>If you're unfamiliar with <em>NieR: Automata</em>, it's an action game that serves as a collaboration between iconoclastic designer Yoko Taro and action luminaries PlatinumGames.</p><p>The game revolves around 2B, an android who slowly begins to question her existence as a war with machines threatens to develop into something more complex than she initially believed.</p><p>You can check out <em>NieR: Automata </em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/524220/NieRAutomata/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/nier-automata/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 4</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/nierautomata-become-as-gods-edition/BPPZVT8BZ15N" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox One</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/NieR-Automata-The-End-of-YoRHa-Edition-2232461.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch</a>, and it's playable on current-gen systems through backwards compatibility as well.

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-day-firered-leafgreen-switch-2-port-eshop-online-2000668213">The rumors were true!</a> As <a href="https://twitter.com/Riddler_Khu/status/2021518874785841331?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2021518874785841331%7Ctwgr%5E84390244049800bd06a3aa327dea273d54fee7b6%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkotaku.com%2Fpokemon-day-firered-leafgreen-switch-2-port-eshop-online-2000668213">anticipated</a> by Pokémon leaker Khu, <i>Pokémon FireRed&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>LeafGreen—</i>the Game Boy Advance remakes of the original English-language&nbsp;<em>Pokémon&nbsp;</em>games—are coming to Switch and Switch 2 February 27. They’ll be available as downloads as soon as the 30th anniversary Pokémon Direct comes to an end.</p> <p>So yes indeed, this confirms what was absolutely certain: that there would be a Pokémon Direct this Pokémon Day, during which it seems utterly impossible that we won’t get our first glimpse of Gen X Pokémon and the new mainline game in which they’ll appear. We now also have the time: February 27, 2026 at 9 a.m. ET.</p>

  <p>The arrival of these two 22-year-old versions of a 30-year-old game as a paid download, and not as new entries in the GBA section of Nintendo’s Online subscription package, is a bizarre and pretty shocking choice. Some might say a mercenary one. There surely was the potential that they could have been made available for free to celebrate the franchise’s 30th birthday, and given how ancient they are and how appropriate it would be…that’s obviously not happening. It’s Nintendo. If your uncle worked for Nintendo, he’d charge you for those imaginary leaks. So yeah, astonishingly the company has the complete gall to charge $20 for each. And it won’t even support online features.</p> <p>Ew, what a horrid taste that leaves in my mouth. The GBA versions of these two games had sold a combined total of 11.82 million copies in their first four years on sale. That’s over $400 million. They kinda made their money back. Nintendo could so easily celebrate this huge anniversary by having these be available for free, or at least a couple of bucks, gain so much good will, and get nostalgic players hyped for <em>Pokémon</em> again ahead of the release of the new game this winter. Gah. Twenty sodding dollars.</p>

 <p>And if you’re thinking, “But surely someone at Nintendo must be aware how bad this looks?” you’re right! Because this announcement comes with the most extraordinary FAQ in which Nintendo asks itself everyone you and I would want to know, and then <em>evades its own questions</em>.</p>

 <blockquote><p><b>“Will these games also be coming to the Game Boy Advance – Nintendo Classics collection?</b>These games are being offered as standalone software and are not planned for release as part of the Game Boy Advance – Nintendo Classics collection.</p> <p><b>Why are you handling these classic games differently?</b>In celebration of 30 years of Pokémon, we thought it would be fun to return to the ultimate versions of the original Pokémon adventures in the Kanto region with these special releases.”</p></blockquote> <p>That’s incredible, right! Like there’s this voice inside Nintendo’s head, the voice of reason, and it’s trying to understand why it’s making these choices, but then shouted down by non-answers that don’t address the issue at all. It’s not even the only time it happens in this FAQ:</p> <blockquote><p><b>“Will you add the original Pokémon Red Version and Pokémon Blue Version or other Pokémon games to the Nintendo Classics collections available with Nintendo Switch Online?</b></p> <p>The following Pokémon game is currently part of the Game Boy – Nintendo Classics collection, available with a Nintendo Switch Online membership:</p> <p>[List of non-mainline <em>Pokémon</em> games]”</p></blockquote> <p>It’s like watching a politician being interviewed on TV, and being left screaming at the screen because the interviewer didn’t follow up.</p>

<p>Nostalgia for Pokémon fans is through the roof ahead of Pokémon Day 2026, with a slew of news set to be announced, and the re-release of Pokémon Fire Red &amp; Leaf Green on Nintendo Switch platforms is on the horizon.</p>



<p>22 years after an initial release, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon/" id="181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a> Fire Red &amp; Leaf Green are coming to both <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch/" id="302" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/" id="908" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> as re-releases. Unlike other classic games, these will be a separate purchase and won’t be included with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch-online/" id="1413" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch Online</a> membership.</p>



<p>If you’re already counting down the hours until you can explore the Kanto region again, Insider Gaming has all the details on the release date and launch times.</p>

<p><strong>Pokémon Fire Red &amp; Leaf Green will be released on Nintendo Switch systems on Friday, February 27, landing as part of the Pokémon</strong> <strong>Day celebrations.</strong></p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-fire-red-and-leaf-green-release-for-switch-next-week/" id="178067" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcement of the re-release</a> of the titles originally released on Game Boy Advance two decades ago came a week ahead of their release. It was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-fire-red-and-leaf-green-return-teased-by-leaker/" id="175794" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously leaked</a> that the titles would be made available again.</p>

</ul>



<p>Full Pokémon Home connectivity will be added to the titles at a later date, increasing the number of available Pokémon in the game. In the original release, players could transfer Pokémon from other titles like Gold, Silver, Emerald, Ruby, and Sapphire.</p>



<p>It’s not entirely clear when Pokémon Home functionality will be available, and whether previous events in the game will be made available.</p>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-fire-red-amp-leaf-green-nintendo-switch-start-times">Pokémon Fire Red &amp; Leaf Green Nintendo Switch Start Times</h2>



<p><strong>Pokémon</strong> <strong>Fire Red &amp; Leaf Green will be released on Nintendo Switch platforms following the conclusion of the Pokémon Presents showcase on February 27.</strong></p>



<p>No precise time for the drop has been shared, and it’s not clear if the titles will be immediately available after the conclusion of the showcase. However, if they’re not available as soon as the show ends, it’s likely to only be a short wait until they’re in the store.</p>

<p>Styx: Blades of Greed dropped <strong>yesterday</strong>, presenting players with a stealth-driven, goblin-backed adventure packed with brutal kills, open environments, and quips from a protagonist accurately described as ‘caustic’.</p>



<p>In the reviews surfacing online, Styx has been doing very well for itself, earning decent scores from critics. It’s the third game in the series, which emerged in 2014 with Styx: Master of Shadows. In a recent post on social media, the developers took the opportunity to throw shade at competing franchises based on the positivity surrounding the launch of Blades of Greed.</p>







<h2 id="h-pay-attention-assassin-s-creed">Pay Attention, Assassin’s Creed</h2>



<p>Styx: Blades of Greed was given a positive review by Eurogamer, and the social team at Cyanide Studio took it upon themselves to go on the offensive against other developers. Of course, it’s all in the character of Styx himself, a volatile goblin prone to self-deprecation, harsh humor, and sarcastic one-liners.</p>



<p>When news of the positive reviews hit the airwaves, Cyanide went straight to social media, calling out Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed brand:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It didn’t end there. One user asked what Styx would do when faced with the ‘GOAT Sam Fisher’, the frontman of the legendary Splinter Cell series, arguably the most iconic stealth shooter ever made.</p>



<p>In response, the team at Cyanide simply wrote, ‘Sam Fisher stays in the shadows.’</p>



<p>It got a bit close to the wire when someone asked them to comment in French, so Ubisoft could ‘understand properly,’ and the social team wrote:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Styx has also openly challenged the likes of Agent 47 and Big Boss, which is ambitious.</p>







<p>Have you played Styx: Blades of Greed? Is the game good enough to warrant the arrogance from the developer’s social media team? Let us know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Titanium Court Is Just The Right Amount Of So Much]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/titanium-court-demo/</link>
            <guid>1441585</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>The other evening, in those weird hours when it’s too early to go to bed but too late to dig into a new task without ruining any chance of going to bed, I was looking for a new game to play. I remembered seeing mention of the demo for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2364580/Titanium_Court/?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Titanium Court</u></em></a>, a game that in its <a href="https://aftermath.site/dawnfolk-impressions-review/"><em><u>Dawnfolk</u></em></a> vibes felt like it might be something small and lightweight to poke around in at the end of the day. It was not that. I don’t quite <em>know</em> what it is, but I like it.</p><p><em>Titanium Court</em> appears to be several games in one. There’s a match-3 section, and a battle section, and a whole narrative of a fantasy kingdom in which you wander into a party one night and then discover you are the queen, tasked with fighting enemy forces while you try to get out of there. Here’s a trailer that doesn’t explain anything:</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xSxuuoYkR3o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Titanium Court Reveal Trailer"></iframe></figure><p>The gameplay part of all this involves fighting enemies in a two-phase battle that takes place on a tiled grid. In the first phase, called High Tide, you match resource tiles into lines of three to remove them from the grid. Matching features like water, hills, and fields gives you resources like food, rocks, and wood. You can also arrange the landscape to better protect the square representing your kingdom from enemy troops, surrounding it with hills or water. Matching multiple groups of three in a row also gives you more turns to play during this phase, making the whole thing a complicated mini-strategy game. </p><p>In the second phase, called Low Tide, you spend the resources you’ve gathered to deploy soldiers or farmers. The farmers gather more resources as the battle rages (provided you left some resource tiles on the field for them to harvest), while the soldiers go out to destroy enemy strongholds or fight to keep enemies from reaching your kingdom. You don’t control your troops; you just watch their tiny fights take place interspersed with images of cricket players, cats knocking things off tables, and Jenga towers that represent the tide of battle.</p><figure><figcaption><span>AP Thomson</span></figcaption></figure><p>Complications get added as the demo goes on. Special buildings can appear on the grid that you can access during Low Tide, but only if you keep them on the grid during High Tide, trying not to match them even when it’s <em>very</em> tempting. These can be hospitals that heal you, or shops where you can buy items; I was especially fond of a mirror I could arrange next to my kingdom to get two-for-one troops. Enemies get more varied, with catapults you can fend off by surrounding your kingdom with hills, or flying enemies who frequently mobbed by kingdom. </p><p>Layered atop all <em>this </em>is moving your kingdom along a roguelike map that even the game admits is confusing as hell, trying to make it to some kind of exit. And surrounding all <em>that</em> is the narrative element, which frequently breaks the fourth wall and is full of surreal jokes, talking cats, and a seeming conflict between the in-game narrative and the demo’s tooltips.</p><figure><figcaption><span>AP Thomson/Aftermath</span></figcaption></figure><p>It would be easy for all this to become grating, but instead these narrative bits never overstay their welcome, lasting just long enough to be funny without becoming too much. Absurd maximalism is deeply not my thing, but it totally works here; characters in the game seem just as confused as you, and it creates this vibe that you're all in this together, trying to survive and make sense of this very strange world. </p><figure><figcaption><span>AP Thomson</span></figcaption></figure><p><em>Titanium Court </em>is weird as hell and completely charming, enjoyable both to play and just to <em>experience</em>, which feels like an impressive balance to pull off. The demo is available now, and the full game is "coming soon" according to Steam, though there's no release date yet.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Upcoming Pikachu Puppetronic Is Equal Parts Adorable And Terrifying]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>We've seen our fair share of Pikachu plushies over the years (it's only one of the most recognisable faces in media <em>ever</em>, after all), but few have been quite as lifelike as this.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Wow! Stuff and RealFX unveiled their latest creation: the Pikachu Puppetronic. As that name suggests, this is a puppet with a traditional hand-controlled design, combined with a fair amount of electronics for even more movement and expression.</p>
<p>We're talking dual-motion ears, blinking eyes, light-up cheeks, a moving mouth, and sensors all over its head, body and neck, so it can react to your touch. Throw in "over 120 sounds and actions", and this is probably as close as you can come to having ol' anime Pika in your home.</p>
<p>Naturally, it doesn't come cheap. The first wave of pre-orders went up on <a href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/en-gb/product/72-11257-101/pikachu-puppetronic-by-real-fx">the Pokémon Center UK website</a> yesterday for <strong>£89.99</strong> and almost immediately sold out. Admittedly, there may have been a rush on these thanks to the inclusion of a special "First Edition" badge and certificate to up the FOMO, but we wouldn't be surprised to see folks clamouring for these for a while yet.</p>

<p>It's all very sweet, but there's a bit of us that finds the puppet a little... freaky. There's something about the blinking eyes, the vacant expression, and the promise that it can move on its own that pushes things closer to the uncanny valley than we'd like. A cute plushie, we can deal with, but one that might open its mouth and blurt out a "Pika Pi" in the middle of the night? *<em>gulp</em>*</p>
<p>The puppetronic is expected to ship in mid-spring 2026, so keep an eye out for restocks in the coming months, if this looks up your street.</p>
