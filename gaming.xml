			<p><strong>Code Vein II</strong> is set to launch on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on<strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/code-vein-ii-set-january-30-2026-debut/"> January 30, 2026</a></strong>, but you can start playing it a week early when the Character Creator Demo launches on January 23, 2026. The news of the demo arrived alongside a new eight-minute gameplay walkthrough trailer and the release of several previews for the game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/code-vein-ii-hands-on-preview-kill-the-past/">including one from Wccftech</a>. </p>



<p>The gameplay walkthrough trailer is a solid showcase of what to expect when Code Vein II <a href="https://wccftech.com/code-vein-ii-announced-with-new-cinematic-trailer-launches-in-2026-on-pc-and-consoles/">arrives at the end of the month</a>. It goes through new elements of the combat, like the new dual blades, allowing for agile and deadly combos, or the tried-and-true halbred making its Code Vein debut. </p>



<p>It also shows off Sunken Pylon, a new area in Code Vein II that players will explore as they search for the key to purifying the Sunken City. The trailer also introduces another new combat mechanic for Code Vein II, Forma. These new special skills are broken down into three categories: weapons, defensive, and bequeathed, which consume a resource called Icor.</p>

<iframe title="CODE VEIN II - Walkthrough Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/11mZY1UAqLo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>You'll gain Icor when attacking enemies, and when you have enough, you can use one of your Forma skills to unleash fatal and devastating attacks. The trailer also shows how you can switch between summoning and assimilation. Summoning allows your partner to fight alongside you, while assimilation fuses them to you and boosts your own health and stats. </p>



<p>The whole video is a good breakdown of what to expect in Code Vein II, but if you want to hear more about the game, then you should <a href="https://wccftech.com/code-vein-ii-hands-on-preview-kill-the-past/">check out Kai Tatsumoto's preview</a>, where they talked about several aspects of the game, including its combat, saying, "<em>Defensive tech works a bit differently in Code Vein II than what players might expect. It all comes down to the defensive forma that players equip and set to the L1 button. One allows for blocking, another allows for timed parries. They’re each situational, but with enemy attacks being well telegraphed, the parry forma should be the perfect fit for Soulslike veterans</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>On the other hand, combat skills and weapon forma are much like their counterparts from the first game. Players can set a palette of four different weapon skills between active attacks and passive temporary boosts, each with their own resource cost. Attacking and using a special drain attack both recharge this resource, allowing players to pull off vicious combos if they’ve accumulated enough stocked resources.</em>"</p>



<p>And of course, if you're keen to dive in, then be sure to download the demo when it arrives on January 23, 2026. The character you create can be transferred into the full game, meaning you can get a head start on your playthrough and start getting a feel for the game a week ahead of launch.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Major hardware player 8BitDo has announced a brand new device ahead of this month's CES showcase, which begins tomorrow, and if you've ever wanted to play games on your phone vertically rather than horizontally, the FlipPad is for you.</p><p>As spotted by the appropriately-named <a href="https://retrohandhelds.gg/8bitdo-announces-controller-built-for-vertical-mobile-gaming/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Retro Handhelds</a>, the FlipPad was revealed by 8BitDo over on <a href="https://x.com/8BitDo/status/2007844470444933384" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">social media</a>. The company describes the controller as "a flip-style gamepad designed for mobile gaming", and it'll be compatible with both iOS and Android phones.</p><p>8BitDo has earmarked the FlipPad for a summer release, but if you're lucky enough to be attending CES 2026, then you'll be able to experience the controller at 8BitDo's booth.

<figcaption>The 8BitDo FlipPad wants to be your vertical mobile gaming controller of choice.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As shown in the video clip accompanying the FlipPad's design, the controller connects to the USB-C port of your phone and can be flipped upwards to cover the bottom part of your screen. You can then swivel the FlipPad downwards when it's not in use.</p><p>Aesthetic-wise, as Retro Handhelds notes, the FlipPad bears more than a passing resemblance to one of the most iconic color schemes sported by the Nintendo Game Boy, which I can't imagine is an accidental choice.</p><p>Of course, since the FlipPad connects via your phone's charging port, you'll likely be able to use it just as you would any other regular controller, although you should bear in mind that it doesn't feature analog sticks, so this is very much a retro-focused device.</p><p>The FlipPad joins a mobile controller market that also includes heavyweights like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/backbone-pro-announcement" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="15935167-00e8-49bb-b367-3dba4b827098" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">the Backbone Pro</a> and offerings from companies <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/gamevice-is-smartphone-controller-worth-looking-into" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3002d824-ec13-462e-a34c-e7a6d3d44724" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">like Gamevice</a>, although it's fair to say 8BitDo's new offering is trying to serve a different niche than those venerable devices.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>The mobile controller field is very competitive indeed.</figcaption>

<p>Perhaps of greater interest to 8BitDo in this case are handhelds like GameSir's <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/843605/gamesir-pocket-1-smartphone-android-wireless-bluetooth-controller" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">recently-announced Pocket 1</a>, which I'm sure the company will be keeping an eye on.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hytale">Hytale</a> blocks up in early access this month, having swiftly gone from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-a-rare-bit-of-good-news-hytale-lives-on-with-its-original-devs-buying-the-rights-off-of-riot">thing in need of ressurection</a> to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytales-early-access-release-date-set-in-stone-for-january-2026-but-its-devs-admit-the-first-impression-will-be-rough">thing that's coming out</a>. As such, the team of devs led by original Hypixel co-founder Simon Collins-Laflamme are firmly in promo mode, with the world generation mechanics they've just posted a deep dive into clearly being an aspect of the game they think'll be key to its appeal.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"As I mentioned publicly a few days ago, this new approach to world generation will redefine the block-game genre," reads the first line of Collins-Laflamme's outro to this <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2026/1/the-future-of-world-generation">world gen explainer</a>, which is otherwise penned by an engineer and designer duo called Dan and Amber. That's pretty eye-catching verbiage from a lead who's otherwise generally been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-gets-a-cheap-price-point-all-because-its-devs-dont-think-the-game-is-good-yet">keen to couch any hype-talk</a> in more realistic chat about the game currently having plenty of warts which'll need ironing out in the long run.</p>
<p>So, what makes Hytale's biome creation tech worth shouting about? "For the first time, artists and game designers can take full ownership of world generation, with complete control over the final result," Collins-Laflamme summarises. "This is a fundamental shift away from a world shaped almost solely by programmers."</p>
<p>The rest of the post delves a lot deeper into gritty details. The artist and designer-first focus is so important, so say Hytale's devs, because it'll allow the game to feel "curated and procedural". Basically, the aim's to have their cake and eat it, with the game boasting both the sort of expansiveness often only achievable without endless work by employing some procedural generation and the handcrafted feel that's long been the biggest strength of smaller environments totally pieced together by developers.</p><p>It's a very tough line to tread if you've got a foot in both camps - just ask Bethesda how <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/starfield">Starfield</a> went. What's clear is that creative offerings of the second of the two versions of Hytale world generator that the team are working with will be key to pulling this off. That newer version's viewed as the game's future and will be what it gradually shifts to over time, after initially  launching on the first iteration of the world generator. That older version, developed between 2016 to 2020, "already has many biomes and content ready to go".</p>
<p>The second version's still currently a work-in-progress, but is planned to take over down the line with the old one gradually being phased out - though worlds built with it will endure. During the transition between those two states, it sounds like you'll be able to peek through special "gateways" which allow you to try out bits being built in the second world generator. And breathe. That seems a lot of moving parts to me, but the devs certainly project being confident it's a landing they can stick.</p>
<p>In other fresh Hytale news, the Minecrafty sandbox's early access launch on January 13th <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-will-launch-with-native-linux-support-though-the-steam-deck-is-not-officially-recommended">will come with native Linux support</a>, but it isn't guarunteed to work seamlessly on the Steam Deck right out of the gate.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The rising cost of PC parts is getting so bad that Nvidia is reportedly going to start making RTX 3060s again, so people have something to buy in the future while all the new shiny tech gets consumed by the AI industry.</p> <p>You’ve likely already noticed that in 2025, <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-10-biggest-gaming-disappointments-worst-news-game-key-cards-gta-6-delay-2000655356#:~:text=Playing%20Video%20Games%20Is%20Becoming%20A%20Very%20Expensive%20Hobby">it became more expensive to build or upgrade a PC</a>. Thanks to hyperscalers and <a href="https://kotaku.com/asus-rog-ally-price-increase-nvidia-amd-ai-ps6-delay-2000656448">AI-focused tech companies gobbling up PC parts to build datacenters</a>, it’s becoming <a href="https://kotaku.com/amd-gpu-prices-radeon-ps5-xbox-steam-machine-2000645803">quite pricey and challenging</a> for your average person to buy PC RAM and graphics cards. Even the prices on prebuilt PCs from companies like HP, Dell, and Asus will increase by 15 to 20 percent, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3021660/computer-prices-could-go-up-by-20-due-to-ram-shortage-pc-makers-warn.html">according to <em>PC World.</em></a> Not great! This will also lead to PC handhelds getting more expensive, and experts expect consoles will undergo price increases too, thanks to growing demand for specific parts.&nbsp; And Nvidia, a company that is making billions from all of this, has a solution to provide PC players with a somewhat affordable GPU in 2026: Start making and selling its old RTX 3060 again.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">01.05update<br>rtx3060  Q1 come back… 🥲</p> <p>— hongxing2020 (@hongxing2020) <a href="https://twitter.com/hongxing2020/status/2008043115308065078?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 5, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>As recently reported by reliable Nvidia leaker Hongxing2020 and spotted by <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-to-bring-back-geforce-rtx-3060-q1-2026-tackle-memory-shortages/"><em>Wccftech</em></a>, Nvidia is seemingly planning to restart production on the RTX 3060 in Q1 of this year. The card first launched in 2021 and is still one of the most popular gaming GPUs around, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/videocard/">according to data from Steam</a>.</p>

 <p>In 2024, Nvidia began retiring the card as it moved on to the 40 and 50 series of GPUs. However, due to DRAM being rapidly consumed for data centers, it has become harder and more expensive to procure the GDDR7 needed to produce the newer, more powerful RTX 5060. (Sidenote: <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-enshittifinancial-crisis/#the-upcoming-data-center-disaster:~:text=Now%2C%20you%E2%80%99ve%20probably,generation%20of%20GPUs.">Basically, every datacenter built or being built will be out of date in the near future, meaning the billions invested in them will be basically a waste!</a>)</p>

 <p>So it seems like the plan is for Nvidia to start producing 3060s again, using cheaper, easier-to-acquire components that aren’t top of the line and therefore aren’t being sought after by AI tech giants for their massive datacenters. If that is the case, hopefully Nvidia at least prices the new 3060s at $200 or less, as the only market for these cards will be gamers looking to upgrade a PC from an older GPU to something (somewhat) modern. But greed is a nasty thing and has infected all tech companies, including Nvidia, so I wouldn’t hold my breath on a sub-$200 price point despite the 3060 entering its fifth year in 2026.</p>

Sandfall Interactive was a new developer with a lot of industry talent on its roster, but it wasn’t yet a storied studio with a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-12-best-video-games-of-2025-2000656161"><span>Game of the Year-winning debut</span></a><span> to live up to. Now that it is, however, folks at the studio claim it won’t just be aiming to meet fan expectations with its next project.</span></p> <p><span>In an interview with </span><i><span>Edge</span></i><span> (thanks, </span><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/clair-obscur-expedition-33-devs-next-game-will-simply-focus-on-what-we-think-is-cool-ive-seen-too-many-tv-shows-and-books-be-swayed-trying-to-please-a-lot-of-people/"><i><span>GamesRadar+</span></i></a><span>), </span><i><span>Clair Obscur </span></i><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-ending-choice-canon-correct-2000633292"><span>lead writer Jennifer Svedberg-Yen</span></a><span> expressed that while she is “”a bit of a people pleaser” and is cognizant of fan expectations, Sandfall Interactive’s mostly concerned with their own interests rather than catering to fandom whims.</span></p>

 <p><span>“Creatively, we’ve always let our North Star be our own personal taste in terms of what we think is cool, what it is we enjoy and want to see,” she said. “I’ve seen too many TV shows and books be swayed trying to please a lot of people, and in the process you end up losing the heart of what’s there. So [we] feel like we need to trust our instincts and continue to trust the vision behind the studio.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Sandfall has been upfront about wanting to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sequel-sandfall-interactive-2000620688"><span>make another </span><i><span>Clair Obscur </span></i><span>game</span></a><span>, and fans are already clamoring for it to explore some of </span><i><span>Expedition 33</span></i><span>’s unsolved mysteries, especially regarding </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/expedition33/comments/1kffyby/painters_vs_writers/"><span>some of the major reveals in the RPG’s third act</span></a><span>. But it sounds like the stuff that fans are latching onto isn’t going to guide Sandfall’s creative decisions, so it’s possible the next game may be about something entirely different. It’ll be exciting to see what the studio comes up with, even if it’s not exactly what we’re hoping for. You already know they’re capable of making something great, so why not stay open to what it wants to do next?</span></p>

<p>It seems Rainbow Six Siege players are being banned again; what’s more, the ban is for 67 days, inspired by the viral ’67’ meme. </p>



<p>For those unaware, Rainbow Six Siege servers shut down <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-siege-hack-servers-shut-down-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">after a massive hack</a> late last month, which led to multiple developer-only skins, billions of credits, and bans. Siege and the Marketplace were intentionally shut down while the team resolved the issue; however, it appears Ubisoft hasn’t yet reached a solution. </p>







<h2 id="h-rainbow-six-siege-hands-out-67-day-bans-inspired-by-viral-67-meme">Rainbow Six Siege Hands Out 67-Day Bans, Inspired by Viral “67” Meme</h2>



<p>If you haven’t heard about the viral ‘6-7’ trend, then you are better off not knowing about it; however, it has somehow made its way into Rainbow Six Siege in the most surprising way possible, with several players reportedly receiving 67-day bans. The cause for these bans is unclear; however, a screenshot posted by vxunderground on <a href="https://x.com/vxunderground/status/2007891913425531290" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) via <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/rainbow-six/rainbow-six-siege-hacked-again-as-breach-triggers-67-day-bans-3300391/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dexerto</a> reveals that these 67-day bans are being handed out “due to harassment”. Additionally, if players head to the Rainbow Six Siege <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/rainbow-six/siege/status" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">status</a> page, they will see “4 unplanned issues” across every platform the game is available on. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ubisoft's Rainbow Six Siege has been compromised (again). Social media is filled with players complaining about being banned for "67 days", a reference to the "Six Seven" meme. <a href="https://t.co/1gYvvoU3WT">pic.twitter.com/1gYvvoU3WT</a></p>— vx-underground (@vxunderground) <a href="https://twitter.com/vxunderground/status/2007891913425531290?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 4, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Due to the appearance of the viral meme number 67, players believe Rainbow Six Siege has been hacked again. However, Ubisoft has yet to confirm that it has been hacked again. To fix the earlier issue, Ubisoft had begun a “rollback of all transactions” that occurred after the hack, followed by extensive quality control tests “to ensure the integrity of accounts and effectiveness of changes.”</p>







<p>In other news, Rainbow Six Mobile will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-mobile-releasing-february/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release globally in February 2026</a>. Players in Canada, France, Poland, and LATAM can download and play the test version of the game now. What are your thoughts on Rainbow Six Siege players receiving viral ’67’ meme-inspired bans?

    <div>
        
<p>CES 2026 is here and that means another keynote speech from Nvidia. While, usually, CEO Jensen Huant takes the stag and reveals a brand new graphics card for players, that won’t be the case this year.</p>



<p>Shortly before the company’s scheduled keynote on Monday, Nvidia confirmed that no new GPUs will be announced during the event. There also won’t be any sort of GPU announcement during Nvidia’s <a href="https://twitter.com/NVIDIAGeForce/status/2008176911747371438?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2008176911747371438%7Ctwgr%5E4123a5ccd62e9a05d4cd884725a5b1bd7c63d3e5%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fvideocardz.com%2Fnewz%2Fnvidia-confirms-no-rtx-50-super-gpus-at-ces-2026-but-promises-updates-for-gamers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GeForce On community update</a> broadcast on Monday night.</p>







<p>That means that the rumored RTX 50 Super graphics card isn’t coming just yet. As far as what is coming, Nvidia is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-to-reveal-dlss-4-5-at-ces-2026/">expected to unveil DLSS 4.5</a> during the annual event. The major update to the technology will include newer Super Resolution paths as well as the ability for RTX 50 series cards to generate up to six times the number of frames. </p>



<p>While no new graphics cards might be disappointing to some, it doesn’t feel like much of a surprise. The consumer electronics industry, specifically PCs, is going through a tumultuous time. The continued rise of AI and Data Centers have made components like storage, memory, and others in scarce supply. That’s led to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pc-ram-costs-more-than-new-graphics-cards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">extreme price increases</a>, leaving regular enthusiasts out in the cold. </p>

                <p>A new controller from 8BitDo has been announced for smartphones, and this add-on will make your phone resemble a next-gen Game Boy. At CES 2026, 8BitDo showed off the FlipPad, a gamepad that connects to a smartphone via its USB-C port. Details on the FlipPad are scarce for now, but 8BitDo says it will support both iOS and Android devices.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/8BitDo/status/2007844470444933384" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Where mobile play unfolds.<br>Introducing 8BitDo FlipPad — a flip-style gamepad designed for mobile gaming.<br>Compatible with iOS and Android devices.

You can grab the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Controller-Bluetooth-Joysticks-Officially-Smartphone/dp/B0F9L7L7CJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">white Xbox model</a> for $46 or the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Controller-Bluetooth-Joysticks-Officially-Smartphone/dp/B0F9L7Q3VG?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">black version</a> for its standard price of $50.</p><p>It can connect wirelessly to your device via Bluetooth, so you can also use it with Android tablets, iPad, Mac, Apple TV, and even the Apple Vision Pro. As for battery life, 8BitDo claims the 300 mAh battery can deliver up to 13 hours on a full charge.</p>

A nice, juicy nine-minute-long <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/styx-blades-of-greed">Styx: Blades of Greed</a> gameplay trailer has been plucked from the tree of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-stealth-games">stealth</a> games today. Juicy in the sense that nine minutes is plenty of time to help ascertain whether a game looks like it could be fun, yet if we're sticking with this metaphor this is one of those apples that's really good but has a nasty bruise on it you have to avoid.
</p>
<p>
First, the good part. This is a pretty neat looking stealth game! The trailer paints a much clearer picture of what you'll be getting up to, showing off a mission in which you broach a very tall fortress you need to make your way up to get some quartz, a valuable resource that also helps the titular goblin Styx pull off some of his magical tricks.

<p>
He can turn himself invisible, sneak under bits of flooring, poison a drinks pot to take down an enemy that's too big for him to outright kill, melting him afterwards to hide the evidence. Styx also has these sort of monkey-esque creatures that can kill enemies for or alongside him. Even stealth games can't escape being Breath of the Wildified, as the green goblin also has a paraglider at his disposal which he can use to glide about the place, alongside a grappling hook that lets him zip about.
</p><p>
According to a press release, Blades of Greed follows a metroidvania style structure, allowing you to explore new areas in places you've previously visited when you unlock more abilities. A fun approach for a stealth game that sounds like it could keep things fresh!
</p>
<p>
And here's where the bruise comes in. I get that Styx as a character is meant to have these zippy, quippy one liners, but yeesh are they laid on thick. Admittedly at points he's vocally reactive in a way that feels surprisingly quick, to the point I can't tell if it was added in the edit for the trailer. He also never shuts up, even outlining the different options you can take, so I do hope it is a trailer-only thing. I mean come on, he references Scarface at one point, who does that any more?
</p>
<p>
Anyway, it's not all that long until Styx: Blades of Greed launches, as it's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/styx-blades-of-greed-isnt-releasing-in-2025-after-all-but-thats-okay-because-its-got-a-firm-release-date-now">currently slated for release</a> next month on February 19th.

<p>A new datamine has revealed Monster Hunters Wilds Switch 2 port details, and it seems the game could run at 30FPS with DLSS enabled on Nintendo’s latest console. </p>



<p>Rumours about a Monster Hunter Wilds Switch 2 port have been circulating for a while now, with dataminers constantly providing new details through the latest update. One of the recent posts on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1pyv6pp/more_info_on_mh_wilds_for_switch_2_including/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> discusses Monster Hunter: Wilds Switch 2 data on local multiplayer, DLSS, NPC Culling, and more. Now, details on the graphics preset have also surfaced online. </p>







<h2 id="h-monster-hunter-wilds-switch-2-preset-seemingly-runs-better-than-the-very-low-preset-on-pc">Monster Hunter Wilds Switch 2 Preset Seemingly Runs Better than the ‘Very Low’ Preset on PC</h2>



<p>Spotted by Necrolipe on <a href="https://x.com/necrolipe/status/2007523103845253447" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/evidence-grows-for-a-nintendo-switch-2-port-of-monster-hunter-wilds-including-a-glimpse-at-how-it-could-run/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VGC</a>, the Chinese group responsible for the recent Monster Hunter Wilds datamines has revealed graphics details for the Switch 2 port. The details revealed that the game will run at 30 FPS with DLSS enabled and at 1080p when docked. It is said to have “better fidelity” than the ‘very low’ graphics preset for the PC version of the game. Necrolipe’s post also provides a video based on the datamining preset; however, it doesn’t represent the final version of the port. </p>

<p>It doesn’t seem too far-fetched for Capcom to create a Switch 2 port for Monster Hunter Wilds, considering they have already planned Day One releases for their next flagship title, Resident Evil Requiem, as well as Pragmata, Monster Hunter Stories 3, and Mega Man. Additionally, the developers have also revealed that Resident Evil Village and Resident Evil 7 Biohazard will also be released on the platform alongside Requiem. </p>







<p>In other news, Monster Hunter Wilds received its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-free-title-update-4-details-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free Title Update 4</a> last month, along with a roadmap for the following updates.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/styx-blades-of-greed-aims-to-carry-the-torch-for-stealth-games</link>
            <guid>1397449</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The opening area of the campaign for Styx: Blades of Greed shows promise and the potential for creative stealth gameplay as a tiny but mighty creature in spaces designed for much larger beings. Extinguishing torches to create safe passages, cutting chandelier chains to crush groups of guards, and popping out of goblin-sized tunnels to assassinate enemies from behind is just kind of Styx’s thing. And now, the third entry in the series has sharpened its blades considerably. If you already liked Styx: Master of Shadows, Styx: Shards of Darkness, or any of the series’ obvious inspirations – such as Thief, Dishonored, Assassin’s Creed, et cetera – you’re in for a treat when Styx: Blades of Greed launches on February 19 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Before we get into the nitty-gritty of goblin life, it’s worth noting that the preview session ran through a cloud streaming service, which, unfortunately, experienced considerable latency issues that made the caliber of precision platforming necessary to progress through Styx: Blades of Greed feel more like piloting a drone on another continent than stepping into the boots of a little green fellow. Split-second timing defines Styx's gameplay loop, making input delay a serious obstacle when it appears. Fortunately, after massively downgrading bitrate settings to get this zeppelin flying, the early areas uncovered a beautiful and compelling high-fantasy world with plenty of nooks and crannies to explore.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Styx: Blades of Greed Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On first boot, there’s an initial accessibility menu with thoughtful implementation, which is always nice to see. Options for deuteranopia, protanopia, and tritanopia colorblindness modes appear alongside adjustable color vision deficiency severity, color spectrum shifting, and controller vibration settings. It takes less than a second to skip through, but matters enormously to players who need it.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>You’ll travel between even larger locations on a sweet zeppelin in classic Warhammer or World of Warcraft fashion.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">After a decently paced and informative opening cutscene, a subsequent tutorial layers in movement mechanics gradually. Running, jumping, double-jumping, and power sliding are all properly introduced and explained as the playable zone starts opening up, which is great because the tutorial itself doesn’t overstay its welcome. The B button executes a slide that allows players to slip under obstacles or cover ground quickly, while pressing RB after a jump triggers a cool little dash that propels Styx upward along walls. The preview build also included advanced saves that showcased grappling hook and glider mechanics in the Turquoise Dawn environment, which are available later on in the campaign. That said, our session focused primarily on the opening hours centered around The Wall, a sprawling human settlement built on the side of a mountain.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Styx: Blades of Greed commits earnestly to its high-fantasy roots, and its environments carry substantial detail to help players establish a sense of place in its immersive world. For instance, its opening zone features ornate dwarven architecture covered in ramshackle human structures and detritus, illuminated by atmospheric lighting that casts long shadows across vast industrial spaces. You’ll also travel between even larger locations on a sweet zeppelin in classic Warhammer or World of Warcraft fashion. A deep level of consideration went into the way this world functions, and playing as a goblin within it provides a distinct perspective that makes Styx both unique and interesting. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ll find zeppelin crewmates like the dark elf Djarak and human pilot Helledrin to be well-written, which adds dimensionality. Meanwhile, the world is sprinkled with fun side-interactions throughout. Random guards can be overheard making offhand comments about eating goblins and turning them into pies, which would be darkly humorous if they weren't actively trying to murder our boy Styx. Besides some minor NPCs that sound like they're reading lines off scripts, using jarring modern American accents that clash with this vibrant fantasy setting, Styx: Blades of Greed’s voice acting broadly delivers solid performances, particularly during the cutscenes that act as connective tissue between the first few playable areas.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Dead Zeppelin</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Styx: Blades of Greed is one of those games where trial and error are key gameplay elements, and you’ll probably die a lot while figuring out the best strategy to get through each challenge. Falling too far will kill you instantly. Likewise, walking into environmental traps like energy-spewing fissures, laser grids, and explosive vents will end your runs immediately. If you find yourself caught in direct combat, enemies kill in two or three hits. Death physics can, at times, create unintentionally comedic moments that add to the fun. For instance, when Styx flops around like a ragdoll after a mistimed jump sends him plummeting off a ledge.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s all perfectly fine because autosaves are extremely frequent, and death here is almost overly forgiving. Respawns rarely throw players back more than a minute or two, meaning death is more of a teaching tool than a setback. Each failure reveals something about enemy patrol patterns, environmental hazard placement, or ability limitations. In this way, Styx encourages methodical approaches and keeps everything good and fun, keeping its pacing steady even during some of its harder encounters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What became clear after the first hour is that Styx: Blades of Greed rewards patience and observation in addition to twitch reflexes. There’s a solid selection of abilities to unlock as well, including Invisibility, which is activated by holding RT and pressing A and can prove invaluable when slipping past large groups of enemies. The climbing mechanics do sometimes feel janky, which could be a side effect of those aforementioned cloud streaming service issues – but animations also look unnatural, moving Styx up surfaces faster than what seems physically plausible.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, the stealth systems show a clearer mix of promise and limitations. On a positive note, light and shadow both matter significantly. Enemies spot Styx more easily in illuminated areas, while darkness provides cover. Players can extinguish torches with the Y button, creating safe passages through otherwise dangerous zones. Silent kills require careful positioning – like approaching from behind or above – but when executed properly, stealth is mechanically rewarding. Styx: Blades of Greed’s satisfying death animations convey a brutal elegance to grabbing an enemy, bringing them to their knees, and ending them with a quick throat stab, goblin-style.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Styx: Blades of Greed’s satisfying death animations convey a brutal elegance to grabbing an enemy, bringing them to their knees, and ending them with a quick throat stab, goblin-style.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Even so, the enemy AI typically often came up short in intelligence in the preview build. Guards sometimes get stuck on geometry or fail to react logically to obvious threats. In one notable instance, an enemy watched Styx kill his companion, then promptly turned around and stood facing a door, waiting to receive a knife in his gullet. This inconsistency in tone and mechanical depth is disappointing at times, undermining the tension Styx works so hard to establish with its thick atmosphere, slick stealth action, and excellent worldbuilding. There are times when enemy guards feel genuinely threatening, using ranged weapons with alarming accuracy even when Styx hides in supposedly safe spots like rooftops, or easily scrounging him out of simpler hiding places like cupboards and barrels. And then there are times they seem to forget they’re guards altogether, making it way easier to simply walk to the next zone like Boromir would walk into Mordor if he were a real Son of Gondor.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Stick 'em Wiv Knives</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Direct combat in Styx: Blades of Greed feels deliberately awkward, which makes thematic sense: Styx is a small goblin, not a warrior. But this creates frustrating moments when stealth fails. To fight, you must manually draw your dagger by pressing into the right stick, which feels incredibly clunky, creating vulnerable moments during frantic situations. Enemies can much more easily block your attacks, interrupt strikes, and deal significant damage, slaying you in just a few hits; by the time combat starts, you’re basically already dead unless you can run elsewhere and hide.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/30/ss-6c16015c621d70e39091ba3af62e4bdffe522532-1920x1080-1767125038889.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">There is a dodge mechanic here, and enemies do telegraph attacks with a blue flash before striking – but timing feels inconsistent, especially when fighting multiple opponents in confined spaces. The camera compounds these issues by obscuring key details in tight quarters, frequently clipping through geometry while players attempt to track Styx and the enemies he’s trying to fight off. This game clearly wants its problems solved through stealth, not brute force. This would be fine if some of the challenges didn’t end up feeling more punitive than strategic, with far too many enemies to outsmart and not enough breathing room to outmaneuver them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s good, then, that each area typically includes at least one scripted environmental interaction that allows real creativity if you manage to weave it into your strategy. In one tavern, you can cut chandelier chains to crush the group of enemies waiting below, but you’ll need to have already snuck past or incapacitated a whole other group of foes to use this opportunity efficiently. Most of the time, there are opportunities to lure guards into explosive barrels or turn off lights to make an easier path for yourself. These moments highlight what Styx does well: rewarding clever observation and planning over reflexes and combat skill.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/30/ss-54011d695a81a99ffe91820c5d24cdd49c2118e2-1920x1080-1767125053526.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">About an hour into the session, Styx’s seemingly robust progression systems started becoming available, giving the moment-to-moment gameplay a sense of depth that rewarded exploration beyond surviving to the next story beat. There’s a decent system for item crafting in the field. This feels similar to A Plague Tale in that you’ll collect raw materials in the environment that enable the instant creation of distractions and limited-use weapons. Craftable glass bottles break on impact and distract nearby enemies. Whistles lure guards toward specific locations. Acid traps eliminate both enemies and their bodies, removing evidence quickly and efficiently – a real boon if you can’t find enough time to hide a body in a nearby container before a passing guard catches up to you. Bolts provide ranged silent kills, though the physics feel janky and slow since bolts fly in straight lines and enemies slump over in basic ragdoll animations that lack the cinematic flair the rest of the game strives for.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Styx can equip up to four of these items at once in his quick slots, creating opportunities to switch up loadouts depending upon the situation. The crafting system requires gathering uncommon materials such as iron ore and cloth scraps scattered throughout each level.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/30/ss-6526cba475bab4032dbe418e887579151b439856-1920x1080-1767125068422.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of progression, it’s cool to see experience points accumulate from exploration and successful encounters, eventually unlocking skills in two categories: Amber skills, which lean defensive, and Quartz skills, which feel more aggressive. During the preview session, there were eight unlockable skills visible in the character menu. We only got a chance to try Invisibility and Clone Decoy, but the in-game menu shows some intriguing options that open up further into the story. A few that stood out included Time Shift for super-speed movement, Mind Control for possessing enemies, and Flux Blast for sending out waves of energy and knocking back enemies. The Clone Decoy move is particularly versatile; you throw it down at a location of your choosing, and it makes noise to distract enemies. It seems like with upgrades, multiple clones can remain active simultaneously, making it worthwhile to pump extra points into it if that’s your thing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Granted, this framework suggests meaningful customization over the course of Styx’s estimated 20-hour campaign. Being able to specialize Styx's abilities based on preferred playstyle – whether that be pure stealth, aggressive elimination of key targets, or a hybrid approach – could add some decent replay value if the system is ultimately as robust as it feels during these early hours.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/30/ss-ff1ae2f80f75e2d0d202364aa4bd771e7e82f925-1920x1080-1767125082647.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">We spent roughly two hours with Styx: Blades of Greed, and it already looks like a potentially great high-fantasy stealth action game that understands what made the first two entries in its franchise work while expanding upon their scope. The Wall is a breathtaking zone, demonstrating Styx’s impressive environmental storytelling. Standing upon rooftop vantage points and looking outward, you can see the rolling mass of buildings clinging to the mountainside connected by precarious bridges, fires dotting the darkness below, creating a sense of lived-in verticality that excites us for the rest of the campaign.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even in its current state, though, significant questions remain. Particularly around whether the enemy AI improves beyond its early inconsistencies, whether the grappling hook and glider feel good in later zones, or whether the narrative delivers on its setup as Styx leads a zeppelin crew in pursuit of valuable Quartz and away from the pursuing Inquisition that’s set out to hunt him down. The technical rough edges and combat frustrations can't be ignored, but they also don’t obscure the feat that Blades of Greed attempts and largely seems to nail.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Simply put, we’re excited for the rest of it. This is already shaping up to be a memorable third entry to cap off the Styx trilogy, and hopefully it will become the next great methodical stealth game in the vein of classic Thief and Dishonored.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/styx-blades-of-greed-aims-to-carry-the-torch-for-stealth-games]]></content:encoded>

So, how much did you spot?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Some of the name references are straightforward. A note for the Nevron enemy Potier explains that its name simply means "potter", because "it's an enemy that uses pots." Fair enough. The trumpet-wielding Troubadour, meanwhile, uses the same name as that of a French minstrel or composer. Makes sense.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Barbasucette is a combination of the French words for beard ("barbe") and lolipop ("sucette"). Licornapieds is the smushing together of unicorn ("licorn") and 'with feet' ("à pieds"). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you hadn't guessed already, the annoying Petank enemy — a fast-moving ball on legs that likes to run away — is a reference to the French boules game Pétanque. Finally, it's confirmed that Gestral fighter Ono Puncho is indeed a reference to anime hero One-Punch Man (and Sandfall even provides a Wikipedia link to details of the anime for further explanation).</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Review - Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">My favorite note is the one for a gestral named Limonsol, whose name is simply explained as an "inside joke." No further detail is provided, other than a request that the name to be transliterated. Why Limonsol? Putting my detective hat on for a moment, I wonder if this could be a reference to the French energy drink Nocco, which comes in a Limon Del Sol flavor. Nocco is, of course, the name of another prominent gestral character. Cheers to that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still after more from Clair Obscur? One final update to the game arrived in December with new challenges and boss fights, and you can <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/clair-obscur-expedition-33/Update_1.5.0_Patch_Notes">catch up on the full patch notes for Expedition 33's final update here</a>. Already though, of course, fans are already speculating what might come next, Sandfall has teased that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yes-another-clair-obscur-game-is-coming-expedition-33-is-one-of-the-stories-that-we-want-to-tell-in-this-franchise-teases-director">Clair Obscur is a "franchise name."</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

RDR2 players have uncovered a pattern of web that only shows up on the map at a certain time of day, and the ultimate destination of this mystery hasn't been fully solved yet.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSQPMaU7yz8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Strange Man YouTube channel</a> (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-biggest-discovery-in-red-dead-redemption-2-in-years-rockstar-fans-uncover-spiderweb-mystery-unnoticed-since-release-and-now-the-hunt-is-on-for-answers" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>) shared the first video guide to the webs, and credited the discovery to three players: goldenplaysterraria, pariah87, and u/FL4VA-01. Like the dreamcatchers quest in the game, players can shoot the webs and get them to release a feather. However, there's only a one-hour window in-game to find a web, and each web only appears at a specific time throughout the in-game night cycle.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSQPMaU7yz8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OSQPMaU7yz8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In a follow-up video, Strange Man reveals the location of a ninth web in the middle of the spider puzzle, which leads to a telephone pole and more clues.

            <p>The upcoming third season of HBO's The Last of Us TV adaptation will feature a new actor playing WLF member Manny.</p>
<p>As first reported by <a href="https://www.nexuspointnews.com/exclusive-the-last-of-us-season-3-set-to-recast-danny-ramirez">nexuspointnews</a>, Danny Ramirez has departed the show due to scheduling conflicts. As such, the role is now being recast, though who will fill Manny's shoes is yet to be determined.</p>

<p>As well as The Last of Us, Ramirez is also known to many as Joaquin Torres/Falcon in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. He is due to appear in Avengers: Doomsday, as well as in the upcoming Jean-Michel Basquiat biopic Samo Lives.</p>
<p>As for Manny, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-cast-adds-danny-ramirez-tati-gabrielle">when Ramirez was first announced to be joining The Last of Us</a>, the showrunners described his character as "a loyal soldier whose sunny outlook belies the pain of old wounds and a fear that he will fail his friends when they need him most".</p><p>Ramirez's Manny joined fellow newcomers <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-casts-kaitlyn-dever-as-abby-for-season-two">Kaitlyn Dever as Abby</a>, Tati Gabrielle as Nora, Ariela Barer as Mel, Spencer Lord as Owen, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-tv-series-casts-beef-actor-young-mazino-as-jesse">Young Mazino as Jesse</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-adds-schitts-creek-star-catherine-ohara-to-its-cast">Catherine O'Hara as Gail </a>and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/isabela-merced-cast-as-dina-in-hbos-the-last-of-us-adaptation">Isabela Merced as Dina</a> for the second season of The Last of Us. Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey, meanwhile, reprised their roles as Joel and Ellie.</p>

<p>Ramirez is not the only key team member to be leaving the show for season three. Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/neil-druckmann-steps-away-from-hbos-the-last-of-us-tv-adaptation">Neil Druckmann announced he was stepping back from the series after The Last of Us season two</a>, in order to focus on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s gaming output, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-studio-naughty-dog-reportedly-mandated-crunch-to-ready-a-demo-for-intergalactic-the-heretic-profit">includes Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>. Druckmann had previously worked on The Last of Us' adaptation as a co-showrunner, director, writer and producer.</p>
<p>While he's returned to full-time video game development, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/neil-druckmann-will-retain-high-level-role-on-the-last-of-us-season-three-to-ensure-its-as-deeply-faithful-as-season-one">Druckmann has since said he will remain somewhat involved in The Last of Us' adaptation at a "very high level"</a> to make sure it's "as deeply faithful" as the show's first season was.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>What's surprising about <strong>ARC Raiders</strong> isn't that it's a popular game that sold well; <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-opens-pre-orders-server-slam-oct-17-19/">there was a lot of hype leading up to its launch</a>, and developer <strong>Embark Studios</strong> already <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-tech-test-hands-on-promising-extractions/">had a lot of great feedback from the beta tests it ran</a>. Its staying power and continued upward momentum are what's surprising, as no one could have predicted it would continue to be one of the most-played games on Steam each and every day since it arrived. </p>



<p>Now, according to Alinea Analytics, Embark Studio's third-person extraction shooter has reached a new milestone, with over <strong>12 million copies sold</strong>, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/superhys.bsky.social/post/3mbocqp3vzc2w">says analyst Rhys Elliot</a>. "<em>So ARC Raiders passed 12M copies sold over the weekend (Alinea estimates)</em>," Elliot wrote in a post on Bluesky.</p>



<p>Not only has it hit yet another sales milestone, but it also set a new record for its daily active users, with over 3.2 million players tuning in yesterday, January 4, to spend their final hours of the winter/holiday break playing some ARC Raiders.</p>







<p>When ARC Raiders launched in October 2025, <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-surpasses-200k-concurrent-players-on-steam-at-launch/">it was immediately Embark Studios' biggest game</a>, reaching over 200K concurrent players on Steam and who knows how many more on consoles. It <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-sold-2-5-million-copies-in-debut-week/">hit 2.5 million copies in its debut week</a>, and barely a week later, <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-has-sold-4-million-units-nexons-most-successful-global-launch/">it had surpassed 4 million copies sold</a>. Yes, there was a <a href="https://wccftech.com/nexon-ceo-claims-we-should-assume-every-game-company-now-using-ai-game-devs-say-no/">fair bit of controversy around Embark Studios' use of GenAI</a>, but that never seemed to slow down the game's sales or the fact that it was dominating the conversation around multiplayer games heading into the end of the year and awards season.</p>



<p>It was <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-was-2025-most-searched-videogame-on-google-gta-vi-only-7th/">the most searched video game of the year according to Google</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-schedule-i-hollow-knight-silksong-battlefield-6-steam-best-selling-new-games-2025/">was one of Steam's best-selling games by revenue in 2025</a>. Embark Studios' <a href="https://wccftech.com/people-have-to-take-step-back-understand-ai-can-be-big-help-developers-benefit-players-says-arc-raiders-boss/">continued use and promotion of GenAI</a> still follows the game whenever it comes up in conversation, but it's clearly not a hindrance to it, as at the time of this writing, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1808500/charts/#1m">there are over 240K concurrent players in the game on Steam right now</a>. </p>



<p>It hasn't even dropped below 250K concurrent players since launch, according to SteamDB. Its staying power has been impressive, to say the least, and it wouldn't be surprising at all if the defining game of 2026 was this third-person extraction shooter from October 2025.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-is-weird-and-fcked-up-why-one-modder-is-pushing-artistic-flair-against-realism-and-boring-ray-tracing-trends/</link>

			<p>With the improvements made to the <strong>ShadPS4 PlayStation 4 emulator</strong> in the past year, playing <strong><em>Bloodborne</em></strong> on PC has become a reality even without an official port. The emulation improvements also paved the way for mods that <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-4k-100-fps-rtx-4070/"><strong>unlock the game's framerate past the 30 FPS cap</strong></a> of the vanilla release and introduced <strong>visual enhancements</strong>.</p>



<p>Among the visual overhauls released for the now-classic PS4 action role-playing game is the <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-remaster-improved-pointlights/">Bloodborne Remaster Project</a></em></strong> created by <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@fromsoftserve" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fromsoftserve</a></strong>, a known Souls series modder. Over the past few days, the project became <strong><em>Shadows of the Hunt</em></strong>, undergoing some massive changes fueled by the modder's desire to push <strong>"artistic flair"</strong> against realistic visuals and <strong>"boring" ray tracing trends</strong> that are dominating the industry of late.</p>



<p>The launch of the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Shadows of the Hunt</em></strong> mod, now available from <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/bloodborne/mods/45?tab=files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nexus Mods</a></strong>, was announced in a new video shared by <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">fromsoftserve</strong> on YouTube, which goes over its features. The most notable are the inclusion of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">dynamic shadows</strong>, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">parallax occlusion mapping</strong> to many surfaces, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">point lights</strong> for elements that emit no light in the vanilla version, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">higher resolution skyboxes,</strong> and more.</p>



<p>Possibly more interesting, however, is the inclusion of <strong>alternate color grading</strong>, which gives <strong><em>Bloodborne</em></strong> a rather peculiar feel. Although quite different from the vanilla grading, <strong>fromsoftserve</strong> believes it suits the game well: <em>"Bloodborne is cosmic and weird and f*cked up, and you can have a very weird looking game,"</em> the modder said in the video.</p>



<p><em>"I'm actually far more interested in an image being interesting than realistic. I think the industry is way too focused on realism, and they’re forgetting that we’re playing games. I think that’s more interesting and has more 'soul' to it than just trying to make it look like a photograph,"</em> fromsoftserve continued in the video to highlight how their approach has a more <strong>artistic flair</strong> that is in stark contrast to the <strong>almost obnoxious search for realism</strong> that is dominating video games as of late.</p>



<p><strong>Ray Tracing</strong> and <strong>Path Tracing</strong> are two other trends that have dominated the video game industry in recent months, and the new approach in the <strong><em>Bloodborne Shadows of the Hunt</em></strong> mod is also a pushback against how ray-traced features are being used.</p>



<p><em>"I love ray tracing and path tracing, but I think the industry is using it currently in a somewhat boring method where they’re just trying to make it look realistic. Making lighting unrealistic is also awesome and fun."</em> Seeing the visuals most of the industry, especially Western developers, is pushing nowadays that is making it difficult to distinguish one game from another, it's difficult not to agree with <strong>fromsoftserve</strong>.</p>

<p>Besides any further improvements <strong><em>Shadows of the Hunt</em></strong> mod may bring in the next few months, <strong>2026</strong> is still setting out to be an exciting year for <strong><em>Bloodborne</em></strong> fans, even without an official remaster on the horizon. <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-pc-online-play-is-no-longer-a-dream-shadps4-developer-showcases-working-multiplayer-milestone/">The </a></strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-pc-online-play-is-no-longer-a-dream-shadps4-developer-showcases-working-multiplayer-milestone/"><strong>ShadPS4 team is currently exploring the possibility of enabling the game's online multiplayer features on PC</strong></a>, which will truly transform the emulated version into the <strong>definitive edition</strong> of the game once they become available.</p>

The 8BitDo Ultimate 3E Controller for Xbox follows last August’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/717994/8bitdo-wireless-xbox-controller-rare-40th-anniversary-edition">Ultimate 3-mode Controller for Xbox — Rare 40th Anniversary Edition</a> with some excellent upgrades, less branding, and a big price hike. It’s got <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/643886/joystick-drift-tunneling-magnetoresistance-tmr-hall-effect-gaming-solution">tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) joysticks</a>, Hall effect triggers with adjustable stops for improved reaction times, and swappable ABXY buttons. It was announced at CES 2026 but isn’t expected to launch until sometime in Q2 of 2026 for $149.99, putting it in competition with more premium console controllers like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-ROG-II-Wireless-Controller/dp/B0G36827DR/ref=sr_1_3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">recently announced ASUS ROG Raikiri II</a>.</p><p>The Ultimate 3E Controller is also one of 8BitDo’s most customizable controllers. It comes preinstalled with two standard joysticks that can be replaced with two tall joysticks, a “thick-neck” joystick, or a dome-capped stick. The standard metal D-pad can be swapped out to one with a circular design, but it’s the controller’s ABXY buttons that stand out. Unlike the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/706967/8bitdo-pro-3-wireless-bluetooth-controller-tmr-swappable-buttons">8BitDo Pro 3, which only lets you swap out the button caps</a>, the Ultimate 3E includes two interchangeable button modules: one with squishy silicone membrane buttons, and one with clicky micro switches that are accessible by removing the controller’s faceplate.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->4</strong><span><figcaption><em>The controller’s ABXY buttons are part of a module that can be swapped out to provide a different feel when pressed.</em></figcaption> <cite>Image: 8BitDo</cite></span></p></section><p>In addition to the Hall effect triggers, the Ultimate 3E has two pairs of shoulder buttons, a pair of remappable bumpers on the back, and six-axis motion controls that are limited to PC gaming. The bases of both joysticks are surrounded with RGB rings that light up and react to movements, but battery life is still rated at a decent 18 hours of playtime between charges on an included dock.</p><p>The Ultimate 3E doesn’t connect to the Xbox using Microsoft’s native wireless protocol and instead relies on a bundled 2.4GHz USB dongle. But Bluetooth is included for connecting to Apple and Android devices, or you can tether to consoles and PCs using a USB cable to minimize lag. The controller is also compatible with 8BitDo’s Ultimate Software X (a variant of its Ultimate Software V2 for its Xbox controllers) so you can customize its performance and remap controls to make custom profiles that are swappable using a button on the Ultimate 3E.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/848331/8bitdo-ultimate-3e-controller-xbox-wireless-tmr-swappable-joysticks]]></content:encoded>

            <p>If you're a fan of both the colour grey being draped all over designs that could be accurately described as both angular and slabby, you're in luck. A third brutalist map jam has hit <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/quake">Quake</a>, with this one being less of a fan-made map pack and more of a huge overhaul mod - the concrete cavernousness of which dwarfs the original game.</p>

<p>Quake's first two brutalist map jams, which dropped in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/quake-goes-brutalist-in-a-new-map-pack-thats-all-about-concrete">2022</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/quake-goes-brutalist-again-in-another-free-map-pack-celebrating-concrete">2023</a>, contained 35 and 30 maps respectively. This third one contains 77. Imagine the sheer weight and density of all of those floors and walls. The maps aren't all this "megalithic community project more than a year in the making" has to offer, either.</p>
<p>"The goal for QBJ3 was to make something uniquely ambitious for the community to build with us," reads the project's intro blurb. "Beginning production in the winter of 2024, the team slow-cooked a total conversion mod in (semi) secret. In October 2025 the work-in-progress mod was unleashed upon the community, who spent the next six weeks exploring its tools, testing its limits, and ultimately creating the worlds for the mod to take place in."</p><p>Among the stuff being tested were a bunch of new weapons, monsters, powerups, and "a complete visual overhaul of Quake's existing roster". The armaments, which you can see shown off in a suitably grey armoury in the video below, include a pipe wrench dubbed Skullcracker and dual-wielded automatic nail guns. Oh, and in case those aren't brutalistic enough for you, there's the Rebar Cannon. It's an "industrial crossbow" which fires rusty metal bolts with a satisfying churm-kachunk sound effect that belongs woven into the percussive mix of some 90s German heavy metal.</p>

<p>To get your hands on the Rebar Cannon you'll need to pick one of the two options by which this third brutalist jam can be grabbed via <a href="https://qbj3.slipseer.com/">Slipseer</a>. The recommended version works like a regular mod, bolting to your copy of Quake and a source port of your choosing (the modders suggest <a href="https://github.com/andrei-drexler/ironwail">Ironwail</a>). Then, there's a version which works like a standalone game that you can extract and run right away, since it comes already set up with Ironwail and open source Quake remake project LibreQuake.</p>
<p>As with Alice O's writeup of the first Quake Brutalism Jam, I'll end this newsing by disclosing that this third jam also includes a map by <a href="https://x.com/radiatoryang/status/2007635685113770212">Robert Yang</a>, who's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/authors/robert-yang">written for RPS</a> about Quake and level design.</p>

            <guid>1397407</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>2018’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/red-dead-redemption-2-the-kotaku-review-1829984369"><em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> </a>is a very big game. Rockstar’s open-world cowboy simulator is also chockablock with secrets and mysteries. And somehow, nearly a decade after launch, players have stumbled upon a whole new one to solve involving mysterious spider webs, feathers, and…guitars?</p> <p><a href="https://youtu.be/0T4J8LYqUi0">As expertly documented by <em>Red Dead</em> YouTuber StrangeMan,</a> in late December, <em>RDR2</em> players discovered <a href="https://youtu.be/OSQPMaU7yz8">a strange spider glyph</a> on a telegraph pole. Above the pole, players spotted a spider web that only appears between the in-game hours of 3 am and 4 am. On the web are some feathers, which can be shot off.</p>

  <p>Things got more interesting when players took the glyph below this secret web and overlaid it onto <em>RDR2</em>‘s map. This led them to more hidden spider webs on telegraph poles. And at the center of all this is a large spider-web hidden inside a tree, which seems to contain a message pointing players to a utility pole that hides a new clue pointing to more poles that seem to be connected to acoustic guitars found at a military fort.</p>

 <p>People have <a href="https://kotaku.com/red-dead-redemption-2-players-are-still-unraveling-all-1832303583">spent years and years digging through <em>RDR2</em></a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/red-dead-redemption-2-players-keep-finding-creepy-easte-1830502069">all of its mysteries and secrets</a>. Yet despite all those mystery hunters leaving no stone unturned, it seems there’s at least one more secret left unsolved in Rockstar’s massive open-world Western, with all of this apparently hiding in the game, undocumented by players, for the better part of a decade. Might all this also be connected to an obscure mystery in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chiliadmystery/comments/4l3n4o/a_guide_of_all_known_spider_webs/"><em> Grand Theft Auto V</em> involving spider webs?</a></p>

 <p>For now, investigators trying to piece it all together are stuck at <a href="https://reddead.fandom.com/wiki/Fort_Wallace">Fort Wallace</a>, where two guitars can be found that many believe are part of the next step in the mystery, but which (at least for now) nobody has cracked yet. There are some theories, some of which are very wild and seem hard to believe. But then again, it sure seems like players have found a seven-year-old secret in <em>RDR2</em> involving disappearing spider webs and glyphs hidden behind the breakable wood of random telegraph poles, so at this point, I’m open to basically any theory, because the reality is plenty weird. If you want to possibly help solve this new mystery before <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-november-rockstar-games-2000641787"><em>GTA 6</em> arrives later this year</a>, head over to Fort Wallace and see what you can find.</p>

                <p>Sometimes you get so into a game that you scream uncontrollably. Whether that be a curse word or an SOS, if you yell loud enough, someone will come to your rescue. At least that's what happened to one <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a> player, whose door was kicked in by a concerned neighbor after he heard the player yelling for help.</p><p>Redditor dreamthorp <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ARC_Raiders/comments/1q35psm/neighbor_heard_me_yelling_help_in_arc_raiders/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posted a 16-second clip of the incident</a> on the Arc Raiders subreddit on January 3. They said they were playing a night raid on the Dam Battlegrounds, the game's very first map. While trying to extract from an elevator, a Leaper reportedly pounced on and downed them before the elevator doors shut. "I just wanted to get stabilized so I could leave," dreamthorp said in the comments of their Reddit post. It's at this point that they started screaming, "Somebody help me."</p><p>Well, somebody did come to help. As displayed on the door's Ring camera, a concerned neighbor walked over, knocked, and asked if they were "all good." Dreamthorp screamed for help again, at which point the concerned neighbor--a firefighter, according to dreamthorp--stepped back, assumed a stance, and kicked the door in, an action that allegedly corrupted the Ring camera's file.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/CultureCrave/status/2007892644694024323" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Concerned neighbor attempts to break down door as player repeatedly shouts for 'help' during an 'ARC Raiders' game 😂<br>The player gave him a six-pack of beers for trying to help out<br>(via u/dreamthorp) <a href="https://t.co/6Qpufew4ID" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/6Qpufew4ID</a></p>  — Culture Crave 🍿 (@CultureCrave) <a href="https://twitter.com/CultureCrave/status/2007892644694024323?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 4, 2026</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Dreamthorp clarified in the comments that they were house-sitting for a friend when the incident happened. The door didn't break (and if it did, they said they would've bought their friend a new door), but dreamthorp figured that "one more kick and I’m pretty sure it would’ve busted." That's even with two deadbolts locked. After their heart nearly popped out of their chest because "the door bulged like an explosion was behind it," dreamthorp then unlocked the door, laughed with the supposed firefighter neighbor, and "dapped him up." They also dropped off a six-pack of Shiner Bock beers as a thank you for his natural instinct and quick action.</p><p>The commenters on dreamthorp's post were largely divided. Some found the moment very wholesome, calling the firefighter a "good dude" and a "real bro" for acting when someone might've been in need. (In a video game, that is.) Others questioned the veracity of dreamthorp's video, with folks wondering why it didn't show the firefighter neighbor actually kicking the door in.</p><p>Dreamthorp, who claimed to be a videographer in the comments, said corrupted files happen "all the time," especially when you turn off a camera while it's recording or pull out the SD card when transferring data. Regardless, dreamthorp purported that the two "scared the ever-living sh*t out of each other" in that moment.</p><p>Arc Raiders has found itself in the hot seat lately over <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-sparks-debate-over-ai-voice-acting-in-games/1100-6536146/" data-ref-id="1100-6536146">its use of artificial intelligence</a>, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-dev-defends-use-of-ai-yet-again/1100-6537166/" data-ref-id="1100-6537166">developer Embark Studios defending the controversial technology</a> because of the "tremendous benefits" it offers players and developers.

<p>Here's a look at the full announcement post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As I began thinking seriously about preparing myself to continue drawing for many years to come, I decided to leave Square Enix at the end of last year. Last year marked a major milestone with the 25th anniversary of FINAL FANTASY IX, a truly significant event, and I was deeply grateful to see so many people celebrating FFIX.</p>
<p>With the illustration work and supervision related to the 25th anniversary now complete, I feel a strong sense of accomplishment in having fulfilled the role entrusted to me. At the same time, I felt this was the right moment to draw a line under this chapter and take on new challenges.</p>
<p>From here on, I will be working as a freelance illustrator and character designer. While remaining deeply grateful for all the connections I’ve been fortunate to receive through my work so far, I hope to draw upon my experience and continue creating a wide variety of new artwork.</p>
<p>At the moment, I’m still finding my way—listening to advice and learning from senior freelance illustrators—but if you happen to come across my work somewhere, I would be truly happy if you could support me.</p>
<p>To everyone who played the games I worked on at Square Enix, and to all those I had the pleasure of working with over the years, thank you very much. I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude, and I sincerely hope for your continued support in the future.</p>
<p>May this new year be an exceptionally happy one for all of you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Final Fantasy IX is currently available via the Switch eShop. Many had hoped that the 25th Anniversary would include an announcement for the long-rumoured remake, but alas, that has yet to happen.</p>

              <p>Millions of votes later, <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> has officially taken home Steam’s Game of the Year award for 2025. It’s the highest-profile prize yet for the excellent Metroidvania Soulslike after it repeatedly <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-tga-winners-losers-who-won-game-of-the-year-clair-obscur-2000652261">lost out to <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a> at recent events like the Game Awards. The game is finally getting its much-deserved flowers just as Valve’s storefront cracked an all-time concurrent player peak to kick off 2026.</p> <p>In addition to <em>Clair Obscur</em>, <em>Silksong</em> was also up against <em>Arc Raiders</em>, <em>Dispatch</em>, and <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 </em>for Steam’s GOTY, so winning is no small feat. It’s also been the platform’s best-selling game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-was-steams-best-selling-game-over-the-holiday-period">throughout the holiday season</a> and continues to set new concurrent player records on PC. Over the weekend <a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/1808500">it cracked 450,000</a>.</p>

 <p>Here are the rest of the 2025 Steam Awards winners:</p> <ul> <li>VR Game of the Year: <em><strong>The Midnight Walk </strong></em></li> <li>Labor of Love: <em><strong>Baldur’s Gate 3 </strong></em></li> <li>Best Game on Steam Deck: <em><strong>Hades 2 </strong></em></li> <li>Better with Friends: <em><strong>Peak </strong></em></li> <li>Outstanding Visual Style: <em><strong>Silent Hill f </strong></em></li> <li>Most Innovative Gameplay: <em><strong>Arc Raiders </strong></em></li> <li>Best Game You Suck At: <strong><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong </em></strong></li> <li>Best Soundtrack: <strong><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 </em></strong></li> <li>Outstanding Story-Rich Game: <strong><em>Dispatch </em></strong></li> <li>Sit Back and Relax: <strong><em>RV There Yet</em></strong></li> </ul> <p>Are the Steam Awards, where the winners are determined entirely based on user votes, basically a popularity contest? Yes. Could you have predicted most of these winners ahead of time? Probably! But it’s also neat to see so many great games given their flowers across unique categories in which they are unquestionably very deserving of praise.</p>

 <p>The results are certainly more interesting than those at this year’s Game Awards, where <em>Clair Obscur</em> swept and<em> Silksong</em> didn’t even nab the Player’s Voice award. That went to free-to-play gacha action-RPG <em>Wuthering Waves</em>. The Steam Awards are also by far the biggest community-voted prize in gaming. Anyone with an eligible Steam account can participate and the platform recently boasted a new record player peak of 41,746,984. Is it <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/roblox/roblox-smashes-concurrent-user-record-thanks-to-war-between-two-games-3242035/">catching up to<em> Roblox</em></a> any time soon? Doubtful. But it’s good news for everyone trying to actually make and sell games on Valve’s storefront.</p>

            <guid>1397362</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>As of last summer, there were only <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/08/19/nx-s1-5476267/the-number-of-shakers-in-the-u-s-rises-to-3?ref=aftermath.site"><u>three Shakers</u></a> left, up from a more recent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/05/magazine/shakers-utopia.html?ref=aftermath.site"><u>two</u></a> but down from thousands in the religion’s height in the mid-1800s. Plenty of movements from that time have since died out, but the Shakers face a particular uphill battle given their commitment to celibacy, meaning they can’t just make a new generation of Shakers. The movement once grew through conversion and adopting children, but these days, few people want to live the Shaker life of communal austerity and hard work. But what feels outdated and even conservative today was once a radical break with the status quo, and it’s that perspective that the quasi-musical, quasi-biopic <em>The Testament of Ann Lee</em> viscerally captures.</p><p>The film stars Amanda Seyfried as the titular Ann Lee, a religiously-minded child in England who falls in with a group of “shaking Quakers,” later known as Shakers. Ann marries a neglectful husband and loses four children in infancy, and this drives her closer to the group and into the belief that sex is mankind’s ultimate sin and needs to be renounced. She comes to see herself as the second coming of Christ in female form, and as “Mother Ann” leads a small group of Shakers to America, where their unusual physical worship style and credo of “hands to work, hearts to God” spread throughout the country alongside other utopian movements.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-zK_nzG36mk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="THE TESTAMENT OF ANN LEE | Official Teaser | Searchlight Pictures"></iframe></figure><p>The movie hews <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2025/12/testament-of-ann-lee-movie-shakers-true-story.html?ref=aftermath.site"><u>fairly close</u></a> to what’s known of the actual life of Mother Ann, which has mostly been passed down through her adherents. (In a move that drives this home, the story is narrated by one of her followers.) The first half, before the group moves to America, is harsh and arresting; their worship moves in and out of intentional choreography and chaotic twitching, and composer <a href="https://www.avclub.com/cinemusic-daniel-blumberg-the-testament-of-ann-lee?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Daniel Blumberg</u></a> rearranges Shaker spirituals to include instruments or writes his own songs. <em>The Testament of Ann Lee</em> isn’t quite a musical, in that songs don’t happen at the peak of emotion; instead, song and dance weave themselves into both worship and narrative and then fade away, keeping the viewer off-balance and contributing to the sense of the Shaker movement as strange and otherworldly. Before seeing the movie, I’d <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rcmacleod.bsky.social/post/3m4xuo5ta3c2g?ref=aftermath.site"><u>made fun of a teaser trailer quote</u></a> that called it “fearlessly feral,” but I get it now: For a movie about a religion devoted to celibacy, the whole thing is carnal and sexual, as the film’s young, attractive cast shakes and writhes to the Shakers’ distinctive music and Blumberg’s strange, creative arrangements.&nbsp;</p><p>It would be easy to fall into reductiveness here–Ann Lee was burned by sex, so she started a religion to rebuke it–and while <em>Testament</em>’s loose structure keeps it from coming to any kind of conclusion that would disappointingly drive that idea home, the film feels like it has more to say about sex than it does faith. Things lose focus and intensity once the group moves to America and builds its first commune in upstate New York. The passion that moves the group’s worship or its clashes with suspicious outsiders and societal institutions is largely absent once the community is on its own, and Seyfried never quite feels as convincing talking about God as she does defending the Shakers from the rest of the world. There are beautiful shots of the woods and of Shaker handicrafts and architecture, and a lovely montage of Shaker life set to a weird, moody arrangement of “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8Ko8aYr83U&amp;list=PLiGi2vh90YNkqyw6poDmKKHIj5kMHYFgf&amp;index=14&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>I Love Mother</u></a>,” but <em>Testament </em>becomes a bit adrift in the space between the group’s arrival in America and Mother Ann’s ultimate death.&nbsp;</p><p>While it might falter as a narrative, the music is what carries the movie through, and the way the arrangements and dance try to portray a specific feeling of Shaker worship. The film’s best intensity and emotion is here, and it’s here that it does the most with its subject matter. I’m a huge fan of Shaker spirituals and their <a href="https://www.americanmusicpreservation.com/simplicityofshakermusic.htm?ref=aftermath.site"><u>unique musical structure</u></a>, and while I never think they’re improved by adding instrumentation, Blumberg’s bells and electric guitars and choruses make them feel otherworldly, not quite rock music and not quite worship songs. He turns “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN3jCMMZyxw&amp;list=PLiGi2vh90YNkqyw6poDmKKHIj5kMHYFgf&amp;index=2&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>I Hunger and Thirst</u></a>” into a moment that could be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlWVcKcqC3U&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>at home in any musical</u></a>; he turns “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hn9J7ykHGE&amp;list=RD9Hn9J7ykHGE&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Beautiful Treasure</u></a>” into something like a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/7aQW-8W5N9Q?ref=aftermath.site"><u>sad lounge number</u></a>. The plain language of Shaker songs, like many hymns of their day, have always stuck with me; unlike so much <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/god-gave-rock-and-roll-to-you-9780197555248?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>modern worship music</u></a> that seems to want to feel relatable to secular life, Shaker songs are so clearly about religious longing and the Shakers’ communal life, an honesty and intimacy that has kept them <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv6nJM-C4P0&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>relevant</u></a> even as the movement itself has faded. They become something new here, but they still long so strongly for something other than this world, and this conveys the passion of faith in a way the film’s script doesn’t. I loved the way familiar-to-me refrains weaved in and out of the movie’s soundtrack, even if it was missing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdTFYETY5D4&amp;list=RDmdTFYETY5D4&amp;start_radio=1&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>some</u></a> of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8yXzjhQ0Zk&amp;list=PLiGi2vh90YNkqyw6poDmKKHIj5kMHYFgf&amp;index=3&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>my favorites</u></a> and, perhaps wisely, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZaTHJSUXqs&amp;list=PLiGi2vh90YNkqyw6poDmKKHIj5kMHYFgf&amp;index=9&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>better-known songs</u></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yDQmkyn6Xdk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="THE TESTAMENT OF ANN LEE | Agony &amp; Ecstasy: The Music &amp; Movement of Ann Lee | Searchlight Pictures"></iframe></figure><p>Likewise, <em>Testament</em>’s choreography grabs at what was so shocking and threatening about the early days of the Shaker movement. Shaker dance <a href="https://www.nps.gov/articles/history-of-the-shakers.htm?ref=aftermath.site"><u>changed over time</u></a>, becoming more structured and eventually <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Shakers?ref=aftermath.site#ref459031"><u>fading away</u></a> altogether. Choreographer Celia Rowlson-Hall turns what we might today think of as old-timey dances into something aggressive and passionate, and in doing so, as Blumberg does with the music, expresses something challenging and even frightening about religious faith.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CLVGLPr1G1I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="THE TESTAMENT OF ANN LEE | &quot;All is Summer” Song Clip | Searchlight Pictures"></iframe></figure><p><em>Testament</em> doesn’t attempt to sum the Shakers up, or make a pitch for revitalizing the faith. The strange structure of the whole film, and the way the story just sort of <em>happens</em>, paints a picture of the flow of religious movements during the Shakers’ time, when new faith movements sprung up by the dozens in an effort to revamp not just religious institutions, but <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/220839/paradise-now-by-chris-jennings/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>society</u></a> as a whole. People tried to take life in new directions, directed their hopes and fears toward something bigger than themselves, and those things arose and fell away and new things took their place. The beliefs that mean the most to us, that can seem world-altering, become <a href="https://aftermath.site/death-by-lightning-knows-history-is-temporary/"><u>lost to history</u></a> or woven into it, and radical movements can become quaint oddities as time marches on.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lhc9PK2tG5k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Shaker Music &amp; Dance - Hancock Shaker Village"></iframe></figure><p><em>Testament</em>’s greatest strength, then, is expressing how Shakerism might have <em>felt</em> back then, the disruptive potential of its beliefs, worship, and way of life. The way its music and choreography aren’t separate from the story, and the way it infuses them with modern aesthetics, tells a story that feels new and weird in the current landscape of film in a way similar to how the movement itself would have felt in its society. Even as it stumbles in the space between the secular and the spiritual, it gets at something radical and true. &nbsp; </p><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/pope-conclave-memes/"><div><p>Conclave Fandom Is The Religious Left - Aftermath</p><p>Pope fever sweeps nation</p><p><span>Riley MacLeod</span></p></div></a></figure>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>CES 2026 is here, and Nvidia is set to reveal its latest major update to its Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) technology with DLSS 4.5.</p>



<p>According to a new report from <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/nvidia-dlss-4-5-to-feature-2nd-gen-transformer-model-and-dynamic-6x-frame-generation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Videocardz</a>, DLSS 4.5 will feature “changes centered on Super Resolution and a new ‘Dynamic Multi Frame Generation’ path”.</p>







<p>With Super Resolution, Nvidia is moving to a “2nd generation transformer” model that will cover more failure cases while using larger datasets. The goal of the updated technology is to offer “better temporal stability, less ghosting, and cleaner anti-aliasing”. Regarding Dynamic Multi Frame Generation, users will see three-to-six times more frames, depending on their settings. </p>



<p>DLSS 4.5 will be available through the Nvidia app, and will have day-one launch support for a number of games. The Dynamic Multi Frame Generation, however, is coming later on. </p>



<p><strong>“Nvidia also says that users will be able to set a target FPS in the app up to the display’s maximum refresh rate, with the feature dynamically adjusting how many frames are generated to meet that goal,”</strong> the report says.</p>







<p>DLSS 4.5 Super Resolution will be available for all GeForce RTX GPUs from the 20 series through 50 and beyond. That said, the new frame generation features are available exclusively for RTX 50 graphics cards, and will be available in Spring 2026.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-sales-estimate-hits-12-million/</link>
            <guid>1397356</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders is proving to be the gift that keeps on giving. In the last 24 hours, at the time of writing, the game soared to a peak player count of 466,372 users on Steam. That’s ever-so-slightly behind the all-time peak of 481,000 secured just after launch in November 2025.</p>



<p>In a recent data-driven estimation, it was claimed that ARC Raiders might have surpassed <strong>12 million sales</strong> in just over two months, a whopping 53.5% of which have landed on <strong>Steam</strong>. It was also claimed that the game is enjoying a daily active user count of a staggering 3.2 million gamers.</p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-continues-to-shatter-expectations">ARC Raiders Continues To Shatter Expectations</h2>



<p>When ARC Raiders was released on October 30, no one thought it would reach such lofty heights. It has become known as one of the (if not <strong>the</strong>) best extraction games ever made. The accessibility of the game has introduced millions of extraction novices to a genre previously populated almost exclusively by crushing and challenging titles.</p>



<p>Things have changed, and ARC Raiders is here not just to stay, but to evolve.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>In a recent post on social media, Alinea Analytics’ Rhys Elliot <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/superhys.bsky.social/post/3mbocqp3vzc2w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">published a graphic</a> showcasing some pretty stellar figures.</p>



<p>First, it was estimated that ARC Raiders now sits at a total sales count of 12 million units across Steam, PlayStation, and Xbox. It has made Embark Studios around $350 million, and it enjoys a daily active user count of 3.2 million players.</p>



<p>It was theorized that a sizeable discount over the festive period, a 20% price reduction, drove additional sales through December. The arrival of Cold Snap, the Flickering Flames event, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-second-expedition-window-confirmed/">first Expedition Project</a>, and a new Raider Deck all combined forces to welcome back stacks of players to the game that <strong>some </strong>thought was starting to slow down.</p>



<p>Far from it, though. Embark Studios has a stunning amount of content in the pipeline and is only just getting started with ARC Raiders. This post-apocalyptic extraction adventure title has legs that stretch on ad infinitum, and it’s easy to see why the developer originally pledged to support the game for ‘years to come’.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">“Anime Souls” is a term often used to describe the original Code Vein. And while that is a very simple but fair descriptor – it is after all one of the very few soulslike games with an undeniably anime aesthetic – it also doesn’t really describe what was <em>actually </em>cool about the 2019 action RPG. For instance: the emotional storylines of your companion characters, delivered in these excellent sequences where you relive their most tragic memories; the phenomenal score by the wonderful Go Shiina; the flexible Blood Code system that allowed players to switch up their stats and playstyle without having to respect their whole character while also being able to pick and choose skills from other “classes.” There was certainly room for improvement in the core combat and level design, but it had great ideas, and would benefit from some refinement and iteration.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that’s what Code Vein 2 seems to be all about: Refinement and iteration. Based on the three or so hours that I’ve played, Code Vein 2 felt familiar, but altogether much more confident and focused on the strengths of the original, while also getting off to an immediately more interesting start thanks to a brand new story with some intriguing time travel twists. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Like the first game, at the heart of Code Vein 2’s plot is a catastrophe that occurred many, many years ago. This time around, it’s known as the Resurgence, a calamity that corrupted everything it touched and gave rise to a new being known as a Revenant. Somehow, the Revenants managed to seal the Resurgence, but the victory was short-lived, as soon after, the Resurgence… well, surged again. This led to a battle that became known as the Upheaval, in which several heroes gave their lives to seal the Resurgence once again. One hundred years later, that seal is weakening, causing existence-erasing explosions all over the world, and this time, the means to save everything exists not in the present, but in the past. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And thus the stage is set for Code Vein 2’s time-hopping story that sees the nameless protagonist teaming up with Lou Magmell, a Revenant with the power to jump back and forth through time as they link up with the heroes of the past to try and find a way to stop the imminent world-ending threats of the future.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a pretty good hook! As someone who never really got invested in the world of Code Vein 1, outside of learning more about my companions, I was pretty happy that I was immediately invested this time around. I looked forward to seeing how the heroes of the past fought back against the Resurgence and what ultimately brought about their fates. I got a chance to ask Code Vein 2’s director, Hiroshi Yoshimura, if he looked to any specific sources of inspiration with regards to their interpretation of time travel, or the rules that govern it, and he said, “I wouldn’t say there’s one film or work in particular, but one golden rule that we had within the development was that once the player has observed or seen something happen within the game, then that becomes truth, or that becomes locked in the sense that it can’t be overturned.” </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Thicker Than Blood</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">On the gameplay side of things, much of the core of Code Vein 1 is still intact in the sequel. It’s still a stamina-governed combat system with a big focus on special abilities tied to various Blood Codes, which essentially determine your class or playstyle. Switching to a new Blood Code changes your stats, defense, and your max Ichor, which is essentially the mana that powers your special abilities. One of the interesting new twists of Blood Codes is that they also now come with a series of traits that can dramatically affect how you approach combat. For example, traditionally, the way combat works is you attack an enemy to inflict stacks of bleed, and then use a special technique known as a jail attack (previously known as “Drain Attacks”) to collect that blood, which then gets converted into the Ichor that you use to use your special skills.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Pretty much every aspect of Code Vein 2's combat is more customizable than before. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But if that doesn’t sound like your style of play, you could instead use Josée’s Blood Code, which lets you gain Ichor simply by attacking, but that boon comes with a catch. If you gain more than your maximum Ichor, you take a significant chunk of damage. This was my preferred method of play, as it meant that I didn’t have to fish for opportunities to use my jail attacks to regain my Ichor, and it helped me be extra vigilant about using my abilities regularly so I didn’t end up overflowing with Ichor. Of course, my attention would occasionally wane, and this would occasionally be the death of me, but regardless, I appreciated the added twist to the gameplay.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In fact, pretty much every aspect of Code Vein 2’s combat is more customizable than before. While Drain Attacks used to be tied to your Blood Codes, they’re now got their own equippable slot in your inventory, and there are a ton of different types. You’ve got the returning Ogre claw for a fast and short ranged option; Hounds for a powerful two-hitting mid-range attack; Stinger to nail enemies from afar; and then you’ve got a handful of completely new attacks like Ivy, which caused spikes to emerge from the ground and can be placed by charging the attack and moving the targeting circle; Bat, which causes you to grow wings and sends out a swarm of bats, and Reaper, which is a scythe that can be swung around to hit enemies in an AOE.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to Jails, you can also equip powerful subweapons known as Bequeathed Formae, and you can also choose a Defensive Formae as well.. With regards to the Bequeathed Formae, I only got to see two of these in my demo: a Battle Axe known as Idris’s Conceit, and a Longbow called Statesman’s Longbow. I opted more for a strength build throughout most of my demo time, so I primarily used the Battle Axe, and it certainly was a difference- maker in fights where I would get swarmed by enemies. All I needed to do was create some space to account for the lengthy windup, and boom. Once it hit, it would create a temporal field that slowed everything down, making it easy to clean up the survivors.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the Defensive Formae, you’re able to basically choose whether you want a standard block, a parry, or a dodge, with a couple of others thrown in there with some slight differences in how they perform. Im a huge fan of all these changes, as they allow even finer tuning of a build to your personal preference without becoming too overwhelming or complicated. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>The Big Question</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the most common things that always gets discussed anytime there’s a new soulslike in town is how difficult it is, so let’s talk about it. For the most part, I got through this demo without much issue. Granted, this was a provided save, so it’s hard to say how things would have been if I got to this point on my own playthrough with my own loadout, but Bandai Namco was very generous in giving us a wide selection of weapons, Blood Codes, and jails, and I never felt like I was particularly under- or overlevelled. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Code Vein 2 also smartly lets you decide on whether you want your companion to follow you and participate in combat like an AI coop partner, or whether you’d prefer to have them be assimilated into you, providing you with specific buffs, but without giving you the benefit of another body to deal damage or distract enemies. It’s a great trade-off that allows Code Vein 2 to maintain the companion element that makes it such a distinct soulslike in the first place, while also allowing players who enjoy tackling these challenges as a solo player to do so without feeling like they’re being severely punished.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Where the difficulty really turned up several notches was in the two boss battles that I got to experience.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Where the difficulty really turned up several notches was in the two boss battles that I got to experience. These were true tests of skills and reflexes and took nearly half of my allotted three hours of playtime, and that’s without even delivering the final blow against the second one. The first boss could simply wipe out my health with just one or two hits, while also afflicting me with the acid status effect, which would deal damage over time. My windows to punish were very small, making me opt for a strength-oriented build so I could land a powerful and chargeable overhead slash with my greatsword to make the most out of those opportunities. Eventually, I prevailed, only to be hard stuck against the second boss. This boss was fast, had an extremely dangerous second phase that I didn’t get to see enough of to really learn its new attacks, and had the nasty habit of electrifying the floor and inflicting bind on me, which would paralyze me long enough for the boss to land another free attack.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite the difficulty spike, I loved both these encounters, and while I'm a bit salty that I couldn’t finish the job at the preview event, I’m looking forward to the runback once I get the full game in my hands and can attempt the boss with my own personal build. Overall, Code Vein 2 is shaping up to be a marked improvement over the original in just about every area. We’ll see if Bandai Namco is able to stick the landing when this soulslike sequel releases on January 30, 2026 for PlayStation 5,  Xbox Series X|S, and PC. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Mitchell Saltzman is an editorial producer at IGN.
