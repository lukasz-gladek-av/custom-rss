		<p>After a year of Epic Store exclusivity, the Witchfire Early Access has been released on Steam with a further 9-12 months expected before a full launch. While some may scoff at such a lengthy spell before full release, there is plenty of content to get your teeth into in the current build. Given the high difficulty level of the game it is also going to take most players a considerable amount of time to even scratch the surface of what there is to offer. Whether this difficulty appeals or not depends on what you want from a game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Witchfire - Official Early Access Showcase 2024 Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ts1ZZkx2d1s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>If there’s one thing that immediately stands out, it’s that Witchfire already looks fantastic, the various environments benefiting from a dark and Gothic aesthetic that perfectly suits the medieval vibes of the game. Guns have a good feel to them with weighty sound effects and an atmospheric ambient soundtrack filled with chants provides the backdrop. While each area can feel a little constrained, the overall enemy variety is good, with most of them being forms of demonic knights or skeletons, but presenting a challenging mixture of ranged opponents and those that like to get close up and dirty.&nbsp;Mobility is the key to success and it is not unusual to get wiped out in short order if you get stuck.</p>


<p>To traverse the environment and engage in combat you have a double jump, a dash and a slide. Taking full advantage of all of these is necessary to survive and it may be worth rebinding some controls to suit. I changed dash to double tap movement buttons which felt far more intuitive to me than the default setting. Double jump can be particularly useful for finding a good camping spot to pick off enemies, but even this approach isn’t foolproof as teleporting melee enemies can easily reach you if you stay still for too long.</p>


<p>There are a range of classes that are suited to different approaches, from close up shotgun carriers to those more focused on magic and sniping from afar. Regardless of the class you choose you can change up your loadout as you unlock more weapons and I tended to switch between a bolt action rifle and a shotgun to cover most eventualities. As you use a weapon you can also unlock upgrades that give it unique abilities. Such upgrades do take a considerable amount of grinding, however, so it is tempting to stick to the same loadouts throughout.</p>
<p>As you progress through the game you can also unlock a powerful demonic weapon that has more scarce ammo and various equipment that can provide further bonuses, though a lot of these are gated behind levelling up your character.</p>
<p>Your central character level can be increased through the witchfire that you collect from foes and crystals. This works identically to the classic souls mechanic from FromSoftware titles with it being lost on death unless you return and collect it. Unlike the Souls games, though, Witchfire has a central hub and portals to different levels that you gain access to as you complete each one. There are extra areas to return to as you gain greater knowledge and earlier levels can be used to grind for levels and resources.</p>
<p>Alongside your character level you can also increase the Gnosis stat, but this is a double-edged sword. It opens up further areas and equipment but increases the difficulty of every level and it is easy to find yourself overpowered if you rush this process.</p>

<p>The overriding impression of Witchfire is that it is a very difficult game. Ammo is relatively scarce, enemies are plentiful and hard hitting and it is easy to find yourself dying in short order. The roguelike aspect does enable you to slowly improve and develop your character but until it clicks you will find yourself repeating the same starting areas over and over. Once you get past these and unlock more weapons and locations it becomes a much more engrossing title though so persistence does pay off.</p>
<p>If you’re up for the challenge then Witchfire is an Early Access game worth getting onboard with, but if not then you might want to wait for the full release to see if the developers fine tune the balance a little more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-xbox-series-s-impossible/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>STALKER 2 developer GSC Game World initially thought an Xbox Series S version of the game would be impossible, but now it thinks that any modern game can run on the system with the proper optimization.</p>
<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/stalker-2-interview-xbox-game-pass-xbox-series-x-s-dlc-expansions">Windows Centra</a>l, GSC Game World discussed the least powerful current generation system, saying that, at first, they thought an Xbox Series S version of the game would be impossible due to the game's many mechanics and the system's lower specs compared to the other current generation systems. But as the studio started optimizing and adding new features for streaming information, they squeezed every megabyte from every piece of system content they could, ultimately making this version of the game possible.</p>
<p>Following this experience, the STALKER 2 developer believes that every modern game can run on the Xbox Series S with proper optimization. The experience also boosted the studio's optimization expertise, benefiting the PC version of the game as well, making it a lot more performant and lowering the minimum system requirements, which are rather low for a modern game.</p>
<p>Speaking further about the STALKER 2 console release, the studio confirmed the game runs at 60 FPS on Xbox Series X, with some small dips into the upper 50 FPS range during gameplay and bigger drops during narrative scenarios that have no impact on the experience, but they also hope to optimize the game further either before or after launch. On Xbox Series S, the team decided to go with 30 FPS gameplay despite being able to hit 60 FPS, albeit inconsistently. However, the studio considers a 60 FPS Performance Mode possible, though it wasn't specified if it would be available at launch or after the game releases next month.</p>
<p>STALKER 2 launches on November 20th on PC, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. You can learn more about the game by checking out our <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-gamescom-qa-gsc-game-world-talks-about-the-final-rush-to-launch/">Gamescom interview</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exodus-sci-fi-rpg-gets-new-cinematic-trailer-narrated-by-matthew-mcconaughey.1011168/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/exodus-sci-fi-rpg-gets-new-cinematic-trailer-narrated-by-matthew-mcconaughey/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Archetype Entertainment has published a new cinematic trailer for its upcoming debut game, the sci-fi RPG EXODUS. The trailer is narrated by famous actor Matthew McConaughey, who appeared on the stage of The Game Awards 2023 when the game was first <a href="https://wccftech.com/exodus-is-an-epic-sci-fi-rpg-from-bioware-vet-james-ohlen-features-matthew-mcconaughey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a>.</p>
<p>McConaughey introduces one of the most ominous enemies players will find in the game, the Celestials humans call Mara-Yama:</p>
<p><em>Do you know what fear is? The Mara-Yama do. They thrive on it. These monstrous Celestials haunt the darkest corners of the cluster, hunting for isolated targets. Unfortunately for their victims, the Mara-Yama are interested in more than just stealing cargo. They want minds, memories, emotions. The more twisted and tortured, the better. Captured prey will be subjected to intense psychological torment before being neurologically drained. Those rare few who the Mara-Yama allow to survive and escape often never return to space, for they know too well the terror that lurks out there, in the dark, between the stars.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>We also learn the name of McConaughey's character in EXODUS: C.C. Orlev. According to the press release, he's a rather infamous citizen of Centauri, an outsider who knows many secrets and may be willing to share them, although his true motivations remain unclear.</p>
<p>EXODUS takes place in a sci-fi setting where humanity left a dying Earth in the 23rd century, looking to resettle in the Centauri cluster, where hundreds of habitable worlds had been found through probes and long-range scans. While some of the ark ships did reach the cluster and set up a beacon signal, many others were lost in space for a long time. By the time they finally found their way to Centauri, tens of thousands of years had passed for the original settlers, who had, by that point, evolved into a wholly different species (with the help of genetic engineering) called Celestials. The Celestials have come to see humans as primitives, and some of them, like the Mara-Yama, hunt humanity outright.</p>
<p>The only ones to effectively fight back are the Travelers. These brave explorers journey across the stars, unearthing ancient technologies on extinct Celestial civilizations in the hope of using them in the war. However, Travelers are subject to the so-called Time Dilation during their interstellar journeys. Since their spaceships run at the edge of lightspeed, mere hours or days for them can equate to years or even decades for those left behind.</p>
<p>With each journey in EXODUS, players will be confronted not only by the dangers across the inhospitable Centauri cluster but also by the emotional toll of your absence on those you love. Each choice made during those travels will be magnified by the inescapable reality of Time Dilation, and the cost and consequences may be paid by your entire civilization and the friends and family you left behind.</p>
<p>It's an intriguing concept that sits at the foundation of the extensive lore <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-bioware-writer-joins-archetype-entertainment-says-bioware-has-become-corporate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">created by accomplished writer Drew Karpyshyn</a> (known mostly for the original Mass Effect trilogy).&nbsp;Archetype Entertainment, owned by Wizards of the Coast, was <a href="https://wccftech.com/archetype-entertainment-is-a-new-wizards-of-the-coast-studio-working-on-a-sci-fi-rpg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">founded</a> in early 2020 by fellow Karpyshyn colleague James Ohlen, a 20-year BioWare veteran who worked on Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter Nights, Jade Empire, Dragon Age, and Mass Effect.</p>
<p>EXODUS has no release date yet, but you can start&nbsp;<span>exploring its sci-fi IP with the newly released book&nbsp;<a href="https://amzn.to/3Nsi6Jb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Exodus: The Archimedes Engine</a>, written by </span>Peter F. Hamilton.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/io-interactive-publishing-ex-rockstar-thriller<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Hitman&nbsp;</em>developer IO Interactive has announced that it's moving into third-party publishing, and its inaugural project on this front is a game created by ex-Rockstar legend Leslie Benzies.</p>
<p>The studio will be publishing&nbsp;<em>MindsEye</em>, a "cinematic AAA story-driven action-adventure thriller" from Benzies' outfit Build a Rocket Boy. You might know that studio's name better from&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-gta-lead-everywhere-beta"><em>Everywhere</em></a>, its flagship sandbox <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everywhere-gameplay-footage">game creation toolkit</a>.</p>
<p>This will serve as IO's first third-party publishing endeavor; up until now, the studio has mainly been known for its development efforts on the&nbsp;<em>Hitman&nbsp;</em>franchise, as well as on other games like&nbsp;<em>Mini Ninjas</em>,&nbsp;<em>Kane &amp; Lynch</em>, and an <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/developers-of-hitman-franchise-are-making-james-bond-game">upcoming <i>James Bond&nbsp;</i>game</a>.</p>

<p>It doesn't sound like IO will be publishing&nbsp;<em>Everywhere</em>; for now,&nbsp;<em>MindsEye&nbsp;</em>is the only collaboration between IO and Build a Rocket Boy, and it's also the only game IO is currently publishing that it isn't also developing.</p>
<p>Benzies describes&nbsp;<em>MindsEye&nbsp;</em>as his studio's "first AAA premium game and ever-evolving universe", praising IO's "strong understanding of community culture, premium action-adventure games, and...best-in-class publishing team".</p>
<p>On IO's part, CEO Hakan Abrak says his studio and Build a Rocket Boy are "like-minded" in that they both "aim to create a bond and a long-term relationship" with their communities, calling the publishing agreement "a significant milestone for IO Interactive".</p>

<p>You are Jacob Diaz, and you must unlock the secrets of your past across a "series of dangerous covert missions". In essence, it sort of sounds like what would happen if you took the open-world between-mission parts out of&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto</em>, which feels somewhat appropriate for Benzies' Rockstar past.</p>
<p><em>MindsEye&nbsp;</em>still doesn't have a release date, so we'll have to wait and see what kind of fruit this collaboration with IO Interactive bears.</p>

The Analogue 3D will launch early next year (the company says Q1 2025) and will cost $249.99. It comes in either black or white, and <a href="https://store.analogue.co/">preorders</a> kick off on October 21st at 11AM ET.</p><p>In addition to the timing and price, Analogue also released the first images of the console:</p><p>First <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/16/23915941/analogue-3d-nintendo-64">announced at the beginning of the year</a>, the Analogue 3D is a modern take on the N64, similar to previous Analogue consoles covering the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/1/31/14451542/analogue-nt-mini-nes-review">NES</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/2/7/16981722/analogue-super-nt-snes-nintendo-review">SNES</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/10/16/17967790/analogue-mega-sg-sega-genesis-mega-drive-price-release-date">Sega Genesis</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22831589/analogue-pocket-review">Game Boy</a>. The new console can render classic games in 4K and includes multiple display modes to mimic the look and feel of a CRT display. Analogue says it’s “designed with a bespoke, purpose-built 4K upscaler.”</p><p>The company says the Analogue 3D is 100 percent compatible with the N64’s cartridge library (it’s also region-free) by utilizing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22323002/mister-fpga-project-retro-computer-console-early-pc">FPGA technology</a>, which allows it to function like the original console. This is good news for the N64 in particular, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22746897/nintendo-switch-online-n64-emulation-quality-bad">which has proven notoriously hard to emulate</a>.</p><p>The Analogue 3D supports Bluetooth, has four original controller ports, two USB ports, an SD card slot, and a new operating system dubbed 3D OS, which you can get a glimpse of below:</p><p>It doesn’t come with a controller, but 8bitdo has created an updated version of the N64 gamepad — minus the third prong — that is being sold separately for $39.99. You can see it in the photo at the top of this article. It has a Hall effect stick and is also compatible with the Switch, Android, and PC. You can also just use any original N64 controllers you have lying around.</p><div><p>The reveal comes during a particularly interesting time for new video game hardware. Sony is about to launch <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/25/24253649/ps5-pro-preview">the PS5 Pro</a>, while Nintendo has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24051677/nintendo-switch-2-pro-rumors-news">a new console on the horizon</a> along with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/9/24265984/nintendo-alarmo-alarm-clock-date-price">a $99 alarm clock</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The company known for its sprawling open-world RPGs was testing Microsoft’s new downloadable content delivery system for the Xbox 360 and wanted to try selling a small piece of game content a la carte. The infamous horse armor was born. </p><p>Nesmith said he no longer remembers the exact sales figures for the add-on, but remembers it being a lot. “It must have been  in the millions, it had to be millions,” he said. As companies have proven with microtransactions time and again in the decades since, a vocal backlash means little if players still open their wallets. Microtransactions, or “recurring revenue” as some companies prefer to call it, now dwarfs boxed game sales at many of the biggest game publishers.</p><p>“Both Bethesda and Microsoft were caught flat-footed at the response to it, [we] did not anticipate that at all,” Nesmith told <em>VideoGamer</em>. “Only in hindsight could it be seen that that’s not what people wanted and that we basically thumbed our nose at them without realizing it. So, part of the Horse Armor story is you’re going to make mistakes when you’re the first one in the water on something like that.”<br></p><p>Bethesda ended up shipping tons of other microtransactions for <em>Oblivion</em> but most were more substantive, including a Wizard’s Tower where players could live and grow plants. “We found that the price isn’t really the issue,” Bethesda VP Pete Hines <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20070328173716/http://www.gamesindustry.biz/content_page.php?aid=23597&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070328173716/http://www.gamesindustry.biz/content_page.php?aid=23597" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said at the time</a></span>. “People just want to feel like they’re getting a good deal.

Max has been enigmatic with her new friends, so Safi is grilling her on her past and demands some answers. This is the segment that lets the player determine <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure-max-endings-chloe-1851538397&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure-max-endings-chloe-1851538397">which of the original <em>Life Is Strange </em>endings is “canon” to them</a></span>, as well as solidify the nature of Max and Chloe’s relationship. Were they best friends or high school sweethearts? That’s up to you to decide, but it looks like there’s no version of events where Max and Chloe are still together, and Chloe either died at the end of the first game, or the two girls split up.<br></p><p>In a vacuum, this development could make sense. People grow apart, especially friends and significant others from high school. But given what Max and Chloe went through together in the first <em>Life Is Strange</em>, it does not sit well with fans that their relationship would be discarded off-screen.</p><p>Chloe’s reasoning for leaving Max is apparently due to the time-traveling photographer’s inability to move on from the events of the first game. This is part of Max’s arc in <em>Double Exposure</em>, as she has sworn off using her time-rewinding abilities after they had catastrophic consequences. It seems like Max is dealing with a lot of trauma from her past, even many years later, and if Chloe is alive, her inability to move forward is what broke down the relationship, according to a letter the player can find. Not that the explanation is satisfactory to everyone.</p><p>Ultimately, we still don’t know if Chloe’s role in <em>Double Exposure</em> is just a dialogue option and a postcard because the full game isn’t out yet. But given how big of a reveal this is for longtime fans, I have to wonder if releasing the sequel in pieces was the wisest option. If Chloe does show up and things are different by the end of the game, I imagine some fans would be more willing to sit with and examine this development. Or maybe this reveal makes more sense in the context of the full game. I’ll hold judgment until I see the game through to the end, but I’m not surprised that fans aren’t thrilled to find these characters in such a different place from where they left them. We’ll know more when the rest of the game is out on October 29.<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Capcom has announced that the Resident Evil 4 remake has hit yet another sales milestone. In a post on <a href="https://x.com/dev1_official/status/1846479698232324198" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a> on Wednesday, it was revealed that Resident Evil 4 has sold 8 million copies since its March 2023 release.</p>



<p>“To you, the 8 million-plus agents, thank you from the bottom of our hearts,” Capcom said.</p>



<p>Prior to this update, the studio announced that the game reached 7 million within its first year on the market. The game also sold <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-remake-3-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">3 million copies within its first two days</a>.</p>



<p>For comparisons sake, the original Resident Evil 4 sold 13.3 million copies per <a href="https://www.vgchartz.com/game/227460/resident-evil-4/?region=All" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VGChartz</a>. So, while the remake is behind the total sales of the original, it’s only been on the market for 19 months as of writing. The latest data on the original’s sales is from 2020, 15 years after its release.</p>



<p>In total, the Resident Evil 2 remake remains the best-selling of the Resident Evil games, per <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/business/million.html#tab1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Capcom</a>, at 14.2 million copies. While Resident Evil 5 technically sold more at 14.8 million, Capcom treats them as separate releases due to being seven years apart and on separate console generations at the time.</p>



<p>Are you one of the 8 million who have purchased the Resident Evil 4 remake? Let us know down below, and take the discussion to the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>. </p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> EXODUS - Mara-Yama Cinematic Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>In the spirit of spooky season, the new trailer focuses on a terrifying type of Celestial known as the Mara-Yama: an enemy encountered in the dark void of space that combine both body and psychological horror in one. The sadistic Mara-Yama prey on isolated travelers in the desolate regions of space, inflicting psychological torment as they harvest minds, memories, and emotions.</p><p>Exodus is a sci-fi RPG that explores the concept of time dilation as the protagonist travels through space, with days of travel passing as decades back on their home planet. As The Traveller, players are tasked with stealing alien technology and weapons from the Celestials, including the Mara-Yama introduced above.</p><p>Archetype Entertainment is a new AAA studio formed by Wizards of the Coast to develop new IP outside of Wizards' popular D&amp;D and Magic: The Gathering franchises. The studio employed many ex-BioWare developers, including studio head James Ohlen.</p><p>Exodus is still without a release date, but will be available on PS5, Xbox Series X, and PC.</p>

                <p>Analogue has lifted the veil on its modernized Nintendo 64 console. Originally teased last year--exactly one year ago today, in fact--the Analogue 3D plays N64 game cartridges in 4K resolution. Like other Analogue devices, the 3D was built using FPGA to provide an authentic N64 experience while also allowing users to enjoy the benefits of playing on modern displays. It even supports all of the original accessories. But if you want to cut the cord and ditch the three-prong N64 controller, Analogue collaborated with 8BitDo on a new-style controller that looks quite lovely.</p><p>The Analogue 3D is designed to offer the "the essence of CRT" on a 4K TV. You can cycle through various display modes made to reproduce the effect of an old-school television set. There'll be two models available--one in white and the other in black--and the Analogue 3D is priced at $250. Preorders will begin on <strong>October 21 at 8 AM PT</strong>, and if the initial preorder window is anything like other Analogue releases, the console will likely sell out <em>very </em>fast. The Analogue 3D will begin shipping in Q1 2025.</p><p>Check out the Analogue 3D's design in the image slideshow below. The clean white and black color options appear to match the original white and black editions of the Analogue Pocket, the company's <a

certain display modes enabled, players can revisit their N64 game library in ultra high definition with faithfully reproduced scanlines, shadow masks, and other effects unique to CRT TVs. Analogue says the 3D offers 10X the N64's native 320x240 resolution without lag. The console is region-free and supports the entire N64 library.</p><p>The custom-built Analogue 3D OS takes cues from the Pocket with its Library and Memories hubs. Library is a catalog that displays a list of your games; a new entry is added to the list each time you load a cartridge for the first time. Memories is where your save states and screenshots are stored. You can save your progress at any time and jump back in at the same spot through the menu system.</p><p>In addition to the four controller ports on the front of the console, the console has an HDMI port, two USB ports, and an SD card slot on the back that supports SDHC cards up to 16GB. The Analogue 3D comes with an HDMI cable, USB cord, and a USB-C power supply. It has built-in Dualband Wi-Fi for firmware updates and supports both standard Bluetooth and Bluetooth LE.</p><p>Analogue says it spent four years developing a perfect way to experience N64 in FPGA for absolute accuracy. Ideally, this should be a massive step up when compared to N64 emulators.</p><p>Here's a closer look at all of the tech behind the Analogue 3D:</p><h3>Compatibility</h3><ul><li>Original N64 game cartridges</li><li>100% compatibility</li><li>Region free</li><li>Compatible with original accessories</li><li>Original style N64 cartridge slot</li><li>Built-in Expansion Pak capabilities</li></ul><h3>Video</h3><ul><li>4K HDMI output</li><li>NTSC &amp; PAL Support</li><li>Lag-free, zero signal degradation</li><li>Original Display Modes (CRT &amp; PVM</li><li>models)</li><li>Variable refresh rate</li></ul><h3>Audio</h3><ul><li>48KHz 16 bit PCM audio</li></ul><h3>Hardware</h3><ul><li>Two USB ports / charging / wired support</li><li>SD card slot including a 16GB SD card</li><li>Dualband WiFi with OTA wireless</li><li>3DO S updating</li><li>Bluetooth Classic and LE</li><li>Four original-style controller ports</li><li>Up to four players supported (wireless &amp; wired)</li><li>8BitDo 64 Controller updating via Analogue3 D System (wired)</li><li>3DO S (4K)</li><li>220k LE Intel Cyclone 10GX</li></ul><h2>8BitDo N64 Controller</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4385542-8bitdocontroller.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4385542" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4385542-8bitdocontroller.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4385542"></a><figcaption>8BitDo N64 controller</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4385542-8bitdocontroller.jpg"></figure><p>8BitDo's N64 controller will be sold separately for $40 and is also compatible with Nintendo Switch, Windows, and Android. It has D-input and S-input modes. The controller features all of the N64's inputs--joystick, C-buttons, an authentic D-pad, A/B buttons, R/L/Z triggers--in a similar layout but with a modernized form factor.</p><p>It also has a Hall Effect joystick with an original style gate, a marked improvement when compared to the infamous N64 controller joystick that was prone to stick drift and becoming "loose" over time. Like other 8BitDo controllers, there'll be a high level of customization that you can access through 8BiDo's Ultimate Software, allowing you to tinker with fine details.</p><p>If you'd rather play with original controllers, you can pick up <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DVZfI20jEa0c%26mid%3D24348%26u1%3Dsubid_value%26murl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fgaming-accessories%2Fcontrollers%2Fretro%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-64-controller-styles-may-vary%2F111903.html&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fanalogue-fully-unveils-its-modernized-n64-preorders-go-live-october-21%2F1100-6527188%2F%3Futm_source%3Dflipboard%26utm_medium%3Dactivitypub&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">preowned N64 controllers at GameStop</a> for $18 each.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/warcraft-iii-reforged-could-be-getting-a-major-update-soon-new-findings-suggest.1011102/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/warcraft-iii-reforged-major-update/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A big Warcraft III: Reforged update could be coming in the future, judging from some recent findings.</p>
<p>As reported on the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/something-might-be-happening-with-warcraft-3-reforged.1010307/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ResetERA forums</a>, <a href="https://blizztrack.com/view/w3d?type=versions">Blizztrack</a>, a website that tracks updates for all Blizzard games, shows that the game's internal Public Test Realm was updated yesterday to version 2.0.0 following a series of minor updates, suggesting that something big may be brewing, as every major version of any Blizzard game usually indicates a significant update. With the series' 30th anniversary being this year, it wouldn't be surprising to see a major overhaul of a game that was among the most controversial releases of the past few years.</p>
<p>Despite its issues, Chris still found Warcraft III: Reforged to be a valuable reconstruction of one of the most important RTS games ever released. You can learn more about the game by reading his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/warcraft-iii-reforged-review/">review</a>.</p>
<p><em>Warcraft III: Reforged isn't the game that was promised, but is still a valuable reconstruction of one of the most influential titles in the history of video games. This release is, sadly, riddled with bugs as well as marred by the terrible decisions of Blizzard, particularly that of the false advertising that persists now even after launch. However, despite this, there's little doubting that Warcraft III: Reforged has a compelling story that, even eighteen years on, remains one of the most engaging in the genre. The gameplay holds strong to this day and with the tweaks and upgrades, this is an undeniable diamond in the rough.</em></p>
<div>
<p>Warcraft III: Reforged is now available on PC via Battle.net.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-planet-crafter-planet-humble-dlc-update-released-to-address-feedback.1011099/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/planet-crafter-planet-humble-dlc-update<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Miju Games has released a brand new update for&nbsp;<em>The Planet Crafter</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Planet Humble&nbsp;</em>DLC, and the update is intended to address "most of the things" suggested by players as improvements.</p>
<p><em>Planet Humble&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/planet-crafter-planet-humble-dlc-release-date">released earlier this month</a>, and in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1284190/view/4506506224312960119" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a Steam post</a>, Miju says it's "humbled" by the volume of feedback received from players, and that it "succeeded" in some areas when it comes to player expectations of the DLC but "didn't" in others.</p>
<p>According to the post, Miju will "continue to refine" both of the planets available as part of&nbsp;<em>The Planet Crafter&nbsp;</em>and its DLC, and following that, more free updates will be released. There's a possibility of more DLC, but for now, Miju is choosing to focus on the base game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-planet-crafter-planet-humble-dlc-update-ice-planet.jpg?itok=QKNVa-sJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-planet-crafter-planet-humble-dlc-update-ice-planet.jpg?itok=tFd3qlkO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Planet Humble&nbsp;</em>has made some&nbsp;<em>The Planet Crafter&nbsp;</em>players happy, but there are plenty of suggestions for improvement.</figcaption></figure><p>So, what's actually changed as part of this update? First up, Miju has added 23 new "Starform Crates", which operate similarly to Golden Crates; they contain "high quality flower seeds" and "a newly-added Starform effigy".</p>
<p>You'll also find a new crashed ship to explore somewhere on Humble, as well as a new hidden bunker to discover, so if you're an exploration fiend, this is the update for you.</p>
<p>Damage has been removed in "big fog areas", and lots of texture and collision problems have also been fixed, so you should have a smoother experience with&nbsp;<em>Planet Humble&nbsp;</em>after this update is applied.</p>
<p>Several more resource nodes have been added, and a few more minor issues have been addressed as well. Hopefully, if you weren't entirely happy with&nbsp;<em>Planet Humble</em>, this update should go a long way towards remedying that.</p>

<p>If you haven't played&nbsp;<em>The Planet Crafter</em>, it's an open-world survival-crafting game in which you must terraform a planet in order to make it a livable environment for humanity.</p>
<p>To that end, you'll need to gather resources, construct the base itself, and then fill it with "oxygen, warmth, and pressure" in order to create a viable atmosphere. Despite the high stakes, Miju describes&nbsp;<em>The Planet Crafter&nbsp;</em>as "a chill experience", so it shouldn't be too stressful for you (and your friends, if you play in co-op).</p>
<p><em>The Planet Crafter&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1284190/The_Planet_Crafter/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, as is its&nbsp;<em>Planet Humble&nbsp;</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3142540/The_Planet_Crafter__Planet_Humble/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">DLC</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/halo-battle-royale-could-have-been-a-%E2%80%9Cgame-changer%E2%80%9D-says-former-dev.1011087/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/halo-battle-royale-cancelled-game/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>A former developer at Certain Affinity has said that Halo’s now-canceled Battle Royale mode could have been a “game change for the franchise.”</p>



<p>The news came via the LinkedIn profile (as spotted by <a href="https://xboxera.com/2024/10/16/halo-battle-royale-would-have-been-a-game-changer-for-the-franchise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">XboxEra</a>) of Mike Clopper, the Studio Design Director at Raven Software, who was previously a Game Director at Certain Affinity.</p>



<p>“MP Halo Infinite – I led a large team of designers working on a canceled Battle Royale mode for Halo. I believe this product could have been a game changer for the franchise. We loved playing it and working on it was a fantastic experience in spite of its cancelation,” his LinkedIn Profile reads.</p>



<p>It’s anyone’s guess why the Battle Royale mode for Halo Infinite was cancelled, but rumours surrounding the project have been going on for the past couple of years. The Battle Royale’s codename was Project Tatanka,&nbsp;and unfortunately, it’s likely never to see the light of day.</p>



<p>Earlier this month, Halo announced a massive rebrand, including changing the name of 343 Industries to Halo Studios and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-moves-to-unreal-engine-5-with-multiple-games-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">moving the Halo franchise to Unreal Engine 5</a>.</p>



<p>“If you really break Halo down, there have been two very distinct chapters. Chapter 1 – Bungie. Chapter 2 – 343 Industries,” studio head Pierre Hintze said. “Now, I think we have an audience which is hungry for more. So we’re not just going to try improve the efficiency of development, but change the recipe of&nbsp;how&nbsp;we make Halo games. So, we start a new chapter today.”</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/mpl-esports-series-one-billion-hours/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mpl-becomes-first-esports-series-with-one-billion-hours-watched.1011081/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/mpl-esports-series-one-billion-hours/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a monumental milestone, the Mobile Legends: Bang Bang Professional League has become the first esports series in history to reach a whopping <strong>one billion hours watched</strong>. This data comes from Esports Charts, which highlighted that records counting these figures stretch back to 2016.</p>



<p>This means that the MPL has beaten the League of Legends World Championship, the LCK, the Valorant Champions Tour, and The International to this sweet record – but they’re not too far behind. It’s expected that League Worlds will hit the one billion mark before the current tournament is up.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-immense-numbers">Immense Numbers</h2>



<p>In the <a href="https://escharts.com/news/top-esports-events-series-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report published by Esports Charts</a>, we get a look at some solid comparisons that highlight just how immense this achievement is for the MPL.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>To contextualise ML:BB’s achievement in the mobile gaming industry,<strong>&nbsp;the MPL has received about quadruple the viewership of the PUBG Mobile Pro League</strong>, which has a similar total Airtime to the MPL. It also recorded more than triple the watch time of Twitch Rivals, which not only has over 600 tournaments but appeals to the large, loyal audiences of famous internet personalities.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The success of ML:BB is a testament to the power of mobile gaming. We recently published a report outlining the growth of mobile esports viewership in the last few months – and it’s a figure that continues to grow.</p>



<p>Despite the game’s success, it’s hampered slightly by the lack of a profile outside of the Asian markets. It’s extremely popular in Indonesia and the Philippines, plus it’s building a following in LATAM and MENA, but it hasn’t hit with the EU and NA audiences or pro players yet.</p>



<p>Moonton Games continues to work on that, though. The MPL has been around since 2017, and it continues to expand today.</p>

<p>Rumors are continuing to circulate surrounding the release date of the upcoming Nvidia GeForce RTX 50 series graphics cards.</p>



<p>Nvidia appears set to announce a complete lineup of new RTX 50 Series GPUs in Q1 2025. According to the latest rumors, not only will the RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 launch in January, but four more cards will debut in early 2025 as well. </p>



<p>According to the Chinese forum Board Channels (h/t <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/rumors-suggest-nvidia-could-launch-rtx-5070-in-february-rtx-5060-series-already-in-march" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VideoCardz</a>), Nvidia will also launch the RTX 5070 and RTX 5070 Ti in February 2025. Those will be followed up by the RTX 5060 and RTX 5060 Ti in March.</p>



<p>It’s also mentioned that there is no current plan for a Super models in the near future.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The latest news reveals that the release dates for the NVIDIA RTX50 series are mostly confirmed. This time, the various models of the RTX50 series may be launched rather quickly, with a near-monthly release schedule. Based on the information available, the estimated release timeline is as follows:</p>



<p>The tentative release dates for the RTX50 series have been set. At CES in January 2025, NVIDIA will launch the RTX5090D and 5080 series. In February, the RTX5070TI and 5070 series will be released, followed by the RTX5060TI and 5060 series in March. This means the entire lineup will be released within Q1 of 2025. As of now, there are no plans for any SUPER models.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Rumors have been running about the pending launch of Nvidia’s next generation of graphics cards. From <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-to-launch-three-rtx-50-series-graphics-cards-at-ces-2025-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">their core counts and memory</a> details to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-rtx-50-series-leaks-reveal-memory-and-power-totals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how much power</a> they’ll consume, everything has been trickling out in recent months. However, this is the first time any mention of Ti variants has happened.</p>



<p>Please keep in mind that none of these rumors have been confirmed so take the information with a grain of salt for now. Nvidia “does not comment on rumor and speculation”.</p>



<p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang will give his keynote presentation at CES 2025 on January 6. The new graphics cards are expected to be revealed during the event where an official release date for the Nvidia RTX 50 Series should be announced.</p>

But I probably should be, because I am a huge fan of games that offer us various options for dealing with a story scenario – especially those where one seemingly small decision can have effects that ripple through the rest of your playthrough. That’s what this series (which began with 2007’s Shadow of Chernobyl and was built on in Call of Pripyat in 2009) is best known for, and it’s what stuck with me the most from my handful of hours with STALKER 2. I kept thinking about the decisions I had made and wondering if I had made a mistake by choosing a violent, guns-blazing approach and wondering if I should have tried a stealthy or even fully peaceful one, but STALKER 2 takes it several steps further. There are times you’ll have NPCs abruptly end a quest without rewarding you because you’ve looted the body of their dead friend, for example. Have that happen a couple of times and it’ll give you pause even when you’re doing the kind of routine task that you normally wouldn’t even think about. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>You’ll have NPCs abruptly end a quest without rewarding you because you’ve looted the body of their dead friend.</p></div><p>Our demo began with an Enter the Zone trailer cinematic before we were unleashed into a small field area covered by the darkness of night where we were hunting for anomalies. These are dangerous areas that have been disturbed in the irradiated area and can reveal powerful artifacts with special attributes on them. And on the graphics front, for both PC and Xbox, these areas look stunning on both platforms. </p><p>This introductory sequence has us meet Skif. We still don’t know much about Skif, but we did learn that he seems to be well-versed with the new technology of STALKER 2, such as the Gilka-1 detector that you can flip open and use to search for artifacts as it beeps louder and louder when approaching the correct area. STALKER 2 artifacts are basically small objects that give you benefits like a faster stamina recharge. While attempting to plant and charge a separate larger Topaz Scanner at three such anomaly locations, I’ll yadda-yadda-yadda over some spoilers here but after a dramatic moment, we wind up in the open-world section of STALKER 2 where our journey really begins – with a main quest that we quickly find which sent us on a search for an individual named Squint.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>But before discovering the Squint questline I was surprised by just how much could happen in the open world. One example was an encounter with some unsavory folks trying to attack a character bunkered down in their home. Once I took them out by sneaking around behind them and making quick work of them with a sidearm shot to the noggin I was introduced to a new NPC character. No matter who you meet in STALKER 2, the character models express emotion, and the somber mood is on full display as you sit around campfires on a brief break. This particular new character sent me on a quest to check on his friend, and a chain of other small quests unlocked because I opted to help this one individual who I could have simply walked past had I been mainlining the story missions. I found it interesting because it was an early example of how one small side-quest could begin branching out into a larger, and more involved story beat that I could have easily missed.</p><p>Not only are there human enemies to worry about which will usually have your standard arsenal, but there are also the larger more unpredictable Flesh Mutants, and Bloodsuckers who are extra deadly and can make short work of you if you’re not careful. As well as fields of poppy flowers to navigate (the latter of which sounds quite nice but will put you to sleep forever if you wander too far off the main pathways). Not only does this keep combat and the wastelands of the exclusion zone interesting, but it also offers moments of awe as you look out at the beautiful red sea of poppy flowers knowing you'll need to go in there and carefully navigate it to complete your objective.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>When I finally did find Squint, I was given two options: Confront him with violence and head back to base, or help him survive and be sent on a completely different story branch with him. At first, I took the violent approach, but when I realized it felt a bit anticlimactic to end the journey with a gunfight, so I loaded up a save just before the encounter and went the other way. I couldn’t help but remember the hundreds of hours I played Fallout 3 or Fallout New Vegas – some of my favorite games ever – and experienced that same lingering doubt as to whether or not I made the right decision in a given situation. It may not be special, and a lot of games have used this before, but I hadn’t realized how much I missed this level of nuance. While games like Cyberpunk offered interesting beats to explore, a lot of the stories wound up at the same place. I’m left hopeful that the branching paths can result in some wildly different results in STALKER 2’s case.</p><p>This brief session with STALKER 2, which seemed to start us at the very beginning of the game reminded me just how great a branching style of storytelling can be from a gameplay perspective. Specifically when it’s interwoven as it has been here with STALKER 2. I can’t wait to see what else is in store for the full experience and am able to discover just how far things can unravel.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I couldn’t help but remember the hundreds of hours I played Fallout 3 or Fallout New Vegas – some of my favorite games ever – and experienced that same lingering doubt as to whether or not I made the right decision in a given situation.</p></div><p>Beyond the branches of storytelling you can explore, and the pretty graphics, I also found it really refreshing to be challenged with managing resources like ammunition and food to ensure survival. If you don’t eat enough you’ll fatigue easier and that means worse aim or less stamina with which to run away from a conflict. If you run out of bullets your knife probably won’t cut it in many situations, but you can try to instead use the environment to your advantage by luring opponents into an anomaly or simply convincing them to let you “help” them from a better vantage point. This kind of resource management lends nicely to the overall feeling this oppressive world is trying to convey and it reminds you that every fight should be considered a calculated risk. Do I unload with my AK ammo, or do I try to use a bit of stealth here? Can I get away with using a pistol or do I need to get extra aggressive with an assault rifle for the bigger enemies? Do I tackle this during the night when I can use darkness to my advantage, or would I rather use the sunlight to my advantage for clearer sight? The fact that the designers at GSC Gameworld have struck a balance with how much they give you, at least early on, with the scenarios you’re put in feels like it’s in a great spot right now. Hopefully, that sticks for the rest of STALKER 2 and you don’t become overpowered by the end of the campaign, because this feeling of desperation is what it’s all about.</p><p>I’m left with an eagerness to get back into the world and see what other trouble Skif gets into. Even though November 20 is now less than two months away, STALKER 2 can’t come soon enough.

But obviously James Bond is a different IP. It's a huge IP. It's not our IP. It's actually the first IP that is not our original IP from ground up," Abrak says. </p><p>"But what's exciting about that project is that we actually got to do an original story. So it's not a gamification of a movie. It's completely beginning and becoming a story, hopefully for a big trilogy out there in the future. And equally important and exciting, it's a new Bond. It's a Bond we built from ground up for gamers. It's extremely exciting with all the tradition and all the history there is there together to work on this together with the family of creating a young Bond for gamers; a Bond that the gamers can call their own and grow with."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It's completely beginning and becoming a story, hopefully for a big trilogy out there in the future</p></div><p>IO Interactive has become famous for stealth games thanks to its work with the Hitman series, which is notable for its open-ended design and wry sense of humor (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/10/17/sean-bean-will-die-once-more-in-hitman-2">you get to assassinate Sean Bean!</a>). The owners of the James Bond IP were apparently <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/james-bond-owner-didnt-want-another-video-game-until-hitman-developer-pitched-project-007">leery of another game based on 007</a> given the franchise's mixed track record outside of Goldeneye, but IO Interactive was able to convince them otherwise. At the moment, the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hitman-franchise-on-hiatus-as-io-interactive-focuses-on-james-bond-game">Hitman franchise is on hiatus</a> while the studio focuses on other projects, but IO Interactive did release a compilation of the Hitman trilogy called <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/hitman-world-of-assassination">World of Assassination</a> in 2023.</p><h2>The James Bond franchise remains "extremely powerful"</h2><p>Since IO Interactive announced that it was working on a Bond game back in 2020, MGM has released No Time to Die, which was a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/no-time-to-die-review">generally well-received sendoff to Daniel Craig</a>. Craig's departure means that the Bond franchise is currently between Bonds, but Abrak says that the license is still very powerful.</p><p>"When we look at the movies, it's one of the top three IPs out there, it's extremely powerful also because it's been, what, almost 15 years since the last game. So it's been a long time. It definitely is something that is not overexposed in gaming. We actually see that as a strength that we can do something very special and hopefully... There's a lot of people out there who think about GoldenEye as the classic. And I love that game as well myself," Abrak says. </p><p>"I don't want to speak too big about it, but I just hope we'll do a thing that will define James Bond in gaming for years to come. And that is not only one game, but that we create a universe for gamers to own for many years to come that we can grow with that next to the Bond on the movies."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Abrak praised the producers of the films for being able to "reinvent Bond throughout the years and keep that IP relevant" and said that IO Interactive have "big, big shoes to fill." Like the legendary secret agent himself, a Project 007 reveal remains frustratingly elusive, but Abrak says that IO Interactive will share more in "due time."</p><p>"I don't have an update today, but believe me, it's itching here as well to be talking about it soon. So we are following our plans. The production's going amazingly well and we will soon be talking more about it. I know it was a little teaser, not a lot of information, but there's a lot of cool stuff coming up," Abrak says. "We are also very excited and when we are ready with that, we'll be opening up."</p><p><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat. Have a tip?

It was previously available only to those who hadn’t subscribed to Game Pass before.</p><p>Microsoft is clearly hoping to capitalize on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-wave-2-october-2024-lineup-headlined-by-call-of-duty-black-ops-6">the release of Black Ops 6 straight into Game Pass as a day-one title</a>, and it seems likely that hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people would have used the $1 offer to blast through the campaign and perhaps dip into Multiplayer and Zombies had it been available. IGN has asked Microsoft for comment.</p><p>The Game Pass tiers that include the release of Black Ops 6 are the $19.99 a month Game Pass Ultimate, or, if you’re on PC, the $11.99 a month PC Game Pass. The $14.99 a month Xbox Game Pass Standard tier does not include day-one releases, and so won’t include Black Ops 6.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Every Video Game Franchise Xbox Owns After Acquiring Activision Blizzard</h3></div></output><p>Black Ops 6 is the first Call of Duty game to launch day-one on Game Pass. It comes a year after Microsoft’s $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, which has also seen the likes of Diablo 4 and Modern Warfare 3 hit the subscription service, and will see StarCraft: Remastered and StarCraft 2: Campaign Collection arrive in November.</p><p>Black Ops 6’s launch straight into Game Pass is a big gamble for Microsoft. It hopes the power of Call of Duty will boost subscriber numbers and revenue (itself bolstered by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-price-hikes-were-inevitable-analysts-say"><u>the recent Game Pass price rise and restructure</u></a>), but it comes with the risk of losing sales of the full-price game.</p><p>While Xbox executives have insisted sales can be boosted by a game’s presence on Game Pass, some publishers remain unconvinced. Former Activision boss Bobby Kotick, for example, was always against putting Call of Duty into subscription services. Unlike Microsoft, console rival Sony does not release its new exclusives straight into its subscription service.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-on-potentially-bringing-call-of-duty-and-other-activision-blizzard-games-to-game-pass"><u>an interview with IGN</u></a> last year, Xbox boss Phil Spencer was asked how he’d handle his and Kotick’s different ideologies after the deal to buy Activision Blizzard closed.

However, GSC Game World spent time optimizing for the system and unlocked new "streaming" technology to help get the game running on Series S. Now, the studio believes not only will Stalker 2 offer a good experience on Series S, but the company maintains any studio can get their game running on Series S with enough time and resources.</p><p>"At first, we thought bringing Stalker 2 to the Xbox Series S might be impossible. We have such a big game with so many mechanics, a huge amount of things," the studio told <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/stalker-2-interview-xbox-game-pass-xbox-series-x-s-dlc-expansions" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Windows Central</a>. "It felt like this must be impossible to do. But then we start optimizing, adding new features for streaming information. Unreal Engine has a lot of features for this, but for our game, we really had to squeeze up every megabyte from every piece of system content we could, and now we did it."</p><p>The developer went on to say it's now "possible for any game to reach the Xbox Series S' memory limits." However, the studio admitted that not every team has the time or the resources to optimize for Series S, however.</p><p>Stalker 2 for Series S runs at a locked 30fps, compared to a goal of 60fps on Series X. It could drop to 55fps during intense sequences, and GSC said it's continuing to optimize to help improve this. For the Series S version of Stalker 2, GSC said it's possible for the game to reach 60fps, but it's not as consistent. "But we're looking to get a performance mode for Xbox Series S, to get it to 60fps. We think it's possible," the developer said.</p><p>Quite a few game developers from across the industry have commented on the Series S console's relative lack of power and how developers needing to support this system might be doing themselves a disservice.

            <p>
A new patch for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> on all platforms brings fresh fixes for the game's modding process, as well as several dozen other tweaks and improvements.
</p>
<p>
For Baldur's Gate 3 players who like to run multiple mods at once, developer Larian has said today's update will improve load times for those with various custom mods running at once. 
</p>
<p>
More amusing changes that caught our eyes include a fix for Wyll saying hello to you with a negative greeting, even if you're besties, and a fix for a potential crash that could occur "when going full disco on the DualSense lightbar". Funky!
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-out-next-week-on-pc-bringing-modding-support-and-more-evil-endings">Baldur's Gate 3 has had official mod support on PC</a> since August, but owners of the game's console and Mac versions have been able to join in the fun as of the beginning of October. An <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-says-baldurs-gate-3-console-mods-smashing-records-just-a-week-after-release">impressive 1.7m mods were downloaded over the first 24 hours of their release on consoles</a>, Larian has said. Meanwhile, over on PC, a frankly astonishing 22m mods have been downloaded since August.</p>
<p>
Find the full Baldur's Gate 3 Hotfix #28 patch notes below:
</p>
<p><strong>Modding</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>On PS5, the 'Continue' button will now work the same as the 'Load Game' screen in that it won't allow you to start a game if there are any mod issues.</li>
<li>On console, when loading a savegame that has unresolved mod issues, the Mod Verification Window will no longer keep asking you to re-download or uninstall mods when the action has already been taken.</li>
<li>Resolved an issue with mod dependencies not being loaded in the correct order after enabling/disabling some mods.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mod Manager</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the animated downloading bar not appearing in the Mod Verification Window after you click 'Download'.</li>
<li>Fixed the horizontal scrollbar on the Mod Details page not being vertically centred between the arrows that flank it.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug preventing you from opening the Mod Manager on PC when using a controller.</li>
<li>Fixed the button prompts in the Mod Details page not updating correctly when using a controller.</li>
<li>Fixed the filter tags in the Mod Manager not appearing in localised languages and made sure that the English string is shown as a backup in case there's an issue with fetching the translation.</li>
<li>The mod browser scrollbar now resets to the top when you navigate to a previous or next page.</li>
<li>On PS5, the Mod Manager now correctly reports the amount of remaining memory after uninstalling a mod.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash that could occur when changing pages in the Mod Manager.</li>
<li>Fixed clients on a multiplayer game getting caught in an enable–disable loop in the Mod Verification Window when trying to disable a mod that the host doesn't have.</li>
<li>Updated the 'Explicit Content' filter's name to 'Mature Content'.</li>
<li>Updated the name of the Mod Issues window to 'Mod Verification Window' to more accurately reflect what the window is for, and updated its description.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Improved loading times for players with many mods installed.</li>
<li>You can no longer add items to your wares even if they cannot become wares (e.g. pact weapons) by selecting them along with another item that can become a ware. This prevents a trade exploit where you could sell your wares and the bound items would not leave your inventory. Any more of these up your sleeves?</li>
<li>Fixed Honour Mode features, like Legendary Actions, carrying over to non-Honour-Mode games if you'd previously loaded an Honour Mode save.</li>
<li>On PS5, fixed the DualSense lightbar updating colours every single frame of the game when a new user logs in with a new controller.</li>
<li>Resolved an issue with Wyll opting for negative greeting nodes even when he does like you.</li>
<li>Fixed the character models becoming offset in the Trade UI when switching between trade and barter when using a controller.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Crashes and Blockers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a crash when trying to load into a playthrough rather than a particular savegame within that playthrough.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash that could occur when loading a savegame.</li>
<li>On PS5, fixed a potential crash when going full disco on the DualSense lightbar.</li>
</ul>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/startup-tales-wants-to-let-you-build-your-own-games-with-generative-ai-beginning-next-month.1011027/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/startup-tales-wants-to-let-you-build-your-own-games-with-generative-ai-starting-next-month/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>There's a new generative AI startup in town called <a href="https://tales.world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tales</a>, and its goal is to empower gamers and creators to essentially make whatever they want with mere text prompts. According to the press release, the technology is based on a Large World Model (LWM) called Sia. This LWM is allegedly capable of generating all the components of a video game, from environments, 3D models, and gameplay to NPC (non-player character) behavior - along with detailed metadata.</p>
<p>This Large World Model trains on gameplay data, video content, 3D assets, descriptive metadata and feedback over time. It's how the LWM understands how games are structured, thereby improving its ability to understand complex game elements and mechanics. With it, Tales can output fully functional games using 3D engines, spatial reasoning algorithms, and NPC behavior systems.</p>
<p>Following a simple text prompt such as "make a first-person shooter in space", the LWM can generate the requested game, which is instantly playable and can be subsequently customized. While conceived primarily for games, the technology could also be utilized to create virtual reality worlds, interactive experiences, and immersive educational tools.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Tales plans to involve the community in the training process of its LWM. They are launching a rewards-based incentive system where users can submit anything from gameplay footage to in-game assets and extensive environment descriptions. Tales also clarifies that it will be a 'fully transparent dataset,' tracked and documented to ensure provenance and preserve privacy.</p>

<p>Head of Product Jason Krupat says:</p>
<p><em>Tales truly feels like something out of a sci-fi film, and we can’t wait to make it a reality. The gaming industry is in desperate need of a revolution, and putting the power to create in the hands of gamers could be the start of a new era of entertainment that extends far beyond games. A lack of resources should never get in the way of a creative spark, and empowering creators in this way means so much to us.</em></p>
<p>While there are many possible applications of generative AI to gaming, there are several downsides and limitations to such an ambitious project as this one. To start with, there are the legal implications—the trailer already shows 'copies' of Horizon Zero Dawn, Death Stranding, Ghost of Tsushima, Detroit: Become Human, and The Last of Us, to name a few. How long will it be until Sony or others come knocking at Tales' door?</p>
<p>Moreover, while the games generated could look similar to an actual game on a surface level, they will inevitably be much more shallow in terms of gameplay mechanics and features, not to mention storylines or missions. Tales said the games would be 'customizable,' but to what extent? We don't know yet. Anyway, Tales promises to launch its generative Ai technology in early access next month, so we'll learn soon enough.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/plants-vs-zombies/plants-vs-zombies-3/news/soft-launch-announcement-15-oct?isLocalized=true" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement post on its website</a>, EA says that starting from October 15th (which is yesterday), in-app purchases won't be available anymore, and the game will also no longer be available to download, although you'll still be able to play it if you have it installed.</p>
<p>From November 15th,&nbsp;<em>Plants vs. Zombies 3</em>'s servers will go down, and you'll no longer be able to play the game across Android or iOS. That counts for all territories, too.</p>

<p>However, in the name of making the game "truly special", EA says it intends to put a "major overhaul" into effect, although it doesn't go into detail regarding exactly what that overhaul might entail.</p>
<p>EA thanks players for its "enthusiasm and feedback", which, given the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantsVSZombies/comments/1aljvmm/pvz_3_review/">volume</a> of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidGaming/comments/199hdmu/plants_vs_zombies_3_is_atrocious/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">negative</a> responses to&nbsp;<em>Plants vs. Zombies 3</em>'s aforementioned soft launch from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantsVSZombies/comments/19abigc/i_am_thoroughly_disappointed_with_pvz3_and_it/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">disgruntled players</a>, is certainly one way to put it.</p>
<p>Reading between the lines, that's probably the reason for this decision, although of course, EA and PopCap aren't going to admit that the game hasn't connected with people. Well, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantsVSZombies/comments/19aqd00/pvz3_soft_launch_an_update/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">not again</a>, anyway.</p>

<p>They have, however, confirmed that your coin balances will be saved "as long as you've connected your account through Google Play, Apple ID, or your EA account". Game progress, however, will be reset when the game does eventually relaunch.</p>

        <p>Asmongold slapped down for racist tirade</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Twitch have temporarily banned an account run by streamer Asmongold, otherwise known as Zack Hoyt, after he expressed genocidal sentiments about Israel's killing of Palestinian people in Gaza. <a href="https://x.com/Slasher/status/1846268530880118852">According to the eSports journalist Rod Breslau</a>, he's been sent to the naughty step for a grand total of two weeks, which I'm sure will be a huge inconvenience and will really teach him the error of his ways. Assuming Breslau's sources are accurate, it's a great demonstration of Twitch's tolerance for streamers with big audiences, the kind of slap on the wrist you'd expect from a platform that recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-reinstates-donald-trumps-account-following-permanent-ban-in-2021">reinstated Donald Trump's account</a> after banning him in 2021 for the charge of inciting an insurrection.</p>
<p><em>Content warning for hate speech in the paragraphs ahead.</em></p>
<p>You will almost certainly know the context, but in case you don't: in October 2023, several Palestinian armed groups led by Hamas, who govern the Gaza strip, broke through the border into Israel and carried out a massacre, killing over a thousand people including civilians and children. Israel's government and military have responded by mounting a year-long invasion of Gaza that has killed over 42,000 Palestinians and reduced the region to ruin. </p>
<p>All this builds on decades of Israeli containment of and intervention within Gaza, which a United Nations special rapporteur has <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2022/03/israels-55-year-occupation-palestinian-territory-apartheid-un-human-rights">argued is a form of apartheid</a>. The UN have repeatedly <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5y5zy1vvmlo">condemned Israel's killing of civilians</a>, together with the atrocities carried out by Hamas, who are still <a href="https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/hamas-took-hundreds-of-hostages-from-israel-where-are-they-now/jqe2346zk">holding a number of Israelis hostage</a>. Back in March this year, another UN special rapporteur <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/03/1147976">argued</a> that there are "reasonable grounds" for defining Israel's current operations in Gaza as genocide.</p>
<p>Asmongold appears to agree that Israel's actions are genocide, but he seemingly thinks the Palestinians deserve it, based on his own, sweepingly racist assessments of Islam and of Palestinian culture. </p>
<p>"If you want to consider it genocide as a systematic killing of a group of people, they have genocide built into Sharia law right now," Asmongold said during the stream, as preserved by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/streaming/asmongold-suspended-from-twitch-following-racist-tirade-about-palestinians/">PCGamer</a>. "So no, I'm not going to cry a fucking river when people who have genocide that's baked into their laws are getting genocided. I don't give a fuck. They're terrible people. It's not even a question. It's crazy that people don't see it that way. They'd be doing the same thing.</p><p>"These people are not your allies," he went on. "They're not the same as us. They come from an inferior culture that is horrible. It kills people for their identity, and it is directly antithetical to everything Western values stand for, and it is an inferior culture in all ways. It is that simple. No, I don't feel bad for them, I don't feel sorry for them, I don't care."</p>
<p>All of this is a clear infringement of Twitch's ban on hate speech. Here's an excerpt from their <a href="https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/Community-Guidelines">community guidelines</a>: "Twitch does not permit behaviour that is motivated by hatred, prejudice or intolerance, including behaviour that promotes or encourages discrimination, denigration, harassment, or violence based on the following protected characteristics: race, ethnicity, colour, caste, national origin, immigration status, religion, sex, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, serious medical condition, and veteran status."</p>
<p>Naturally, a number of people have lodged complaints about Asmongold's tirade. And of course, he has now apologised. "Looking back on it, I was way too much of an asshole about the Palestine thing," he wrote on <a href="https://x.com/Asmongold/status/1845982422275367189">Xitter</a>, adding "my bad" and "of course no one deserves to have their life destroyed even if they do things or have views I find regressive". In conclusion, "you guys deserve more than me saying stupid shit like that, I'll do better".</p>
<p>Twitch's ban only applies to Asmongold's secondary "Zackrawrr" account, but it also means he can't stream via his primary account either. However, he's still free to publish videos on Youtube, where he has about 4.85 million combined subscribers. Asmongold himself has <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/twitch-leak-reveals-the-sites-highest-paid-streamers/">reportedly earned many millions from Twitch</a>, more than enough on paper to ride out any temporary suspension of service.</p><p>All this is of broader relevance because Twitch, a streaming service that focuses on video games, is absolutely huge. It's one of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most-visited_websites">the most visited websites in the world</a>. As such, it's a prominent internet "town square" where the most-subscribed streamers can potentially shape the views of millions of people - as the management themselves acknowledged back in 2021, when they shut down Trump's account to avoid any further incitement to violence.</p>
<p>As Asmongold's colleague TipsOutBaby <a href="https://x.com/TipsOut/status/1846302400988303489">has discussed on Twitter</a>, referencing his own experience as a Muslim and child of Syrian immigrants, Asmongold's comments reflect long-established patterns of "calculated dehumanization" that create the conditions for bloodshed, consisting of the same language that is "used to justify wanton violence, genocide, and the destruction of our universal brotherhood". You'd think all that would warrant more than two weeks in the wilds. We asked Twitch for comment about all this yesterday - they haven't responded.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
