			<p>Today, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-aeternum-beta-starts-september-13/">highly anticipated update</a> of New World has been released and is now available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1063730/New_World_Aeternum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PC via Steam</a>. This is the first time that both console and PC players will be able to explore the haunting island of Aeternum, where there is a world full of danger and excitement but also plenty of opportunities for players to engage, whether it's as a solo player or grouping up with others. If you want to play the game with others, you'll have the opportunity to play with others using cross-platform online play, meaning you can team up with your friends who may be on a different platform to you.</p>
<p><iframe title="New World: Aeternum - Gameplay Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qK8jtTMHCRU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Those who are playing New World via PC can get New World: Aeternum at no additional cost as long as you have already bought New World and the Rise of the Angry Earth, which was a PC-specific expansion. For those who are on console, you will have to purchase New World: Aeternum, as Rise of the Angry Earth was never available for those on PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X|S, as this is the first time that the game is officially on console. However, with Aeternum now being released on console, players will finally get to experience the full base game as well as the Rise of the Angry Earth expansion.</p>
<p>"Millions of players have explored Aeternum on PC, and we're thrilled to welcome even more to New World: Aeternum with the console release," said Christoph Hartmann, Vice President of Amazon Games. "We have listened to player feedback and taken the time to create an unforgettable adventure that can be enjoyed either as a solo journey or together with friends across consoles and PC. New World: Aeternum is the definitive New World experience."</p>
<p>Aeternum is a major update to the title, as players will be able to explore new raid content where you'll have to explore the Hive of the Gorgons as a 10-person raid group where you have to face off against Broodmother Medusa herself, as she tries to raise an army of Hercyne.</p>
<p>For those who are looking for content that isn't grouping up with each other but rather pitted against each other, there is new PvPvE content where players get to enter the Cursed Mists in Cutlass Keys, where it's every player for themselves as you try to obtain rare loot. However, if you die, other players have the opportunity to snatch your loot away from you and walk away victorious.</p>
<p>If you want to get stuck into this title, New World: Aeternum is available to download digitally on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Steam for $59.99. If you want the Deluxe Edition, which includes the Corrupted Mauler Bear Mount and the Corrupted Soul Armor Skin, you can purchase it for $79.99.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-pc-specs-global-launch-timings</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon-age-the-veilguard-pc-specs-and-global-launch-timings-revealed.1010178/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-pc-specs-global-launch-timings<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA and BioWare have revealed what kind of PC specs you're going to need to run&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>, as well as the global launch timings for the game.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard/news/specifications-spotlight?isLocalized=true" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new post on its official website</a>, EA says it's designed&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>"with flexibility in mind", a philosophy that extends not only to the game's PC specs but also to its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-accessibility-options">accessibility features</a>.</p>
<p>Two sets of specs are available, one with ray tracing enabled and the other with ray tracing disabled, in order to accommodate both high-end machines and lower-spec PCs. Hopefully, a wide range of PC gamers will be able to play <i>The Veilguard&nbsp;</i>on release.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-pc-specs-bow.jpg?itok=iFzHgTwF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-pc-specs-bow.jpg?itok=eDmMdd1o 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>has been designed to accommodate a fairly wide range of PCs.</figcaption></figure><p>Here's a quick rundown of the&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>PC specs BioWare and EA announced today.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that all of these presets require at least 16GB of RAM, as well as 100GB of storage space (for which only the Minimum setting supports an HDD). You'll also need Windows 10 or 11 with 64-bit architecture and DirectX 12.</p>
<p>First up, here are the non-ray tracing presets.</p>
<h3>Minimum (1080p, 30fps, Low settings)</h3>
<ul><li>Intel Core i5-8400 or AMD Ryzen 3 3300X</li>
<li>Nvidia GeForce GTX 970 or GTX 1650, or AMD Radeon R9 290X</li>
<li>4GB VRAM</li>
</ul><h3>Recommended (1440p at 30fps or 1080p at 60fps, High settings)</h3>
<ul><li>Intel Core i9-9900K or AMD Ryzen 7 3700X</li>
<li>Nvidia GeForce RTX 2070 or AMD Radeon RX 5700XT</li>
<li>8GB VRAM</li>
</ul><h3>Ultra (4K at 60fps, Ultra settings)</h3>
<ul><li>Intel Core i9-12900K or AMD Ryzen 9 7950X</li>
<li>Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 or AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX</li>
<li>12GB VRAM</li>
</ul><p>Next, here are the specs you'll need if you want to play&nbsp;<em>The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>with ray tracing enabled.</p>
<h3>RT Selective (4K at 30fps or 1440p at 60fps, Ultra settings)</h3>
<ul><li>Intel Core i9-9900K or AMD Ryzen 7 3700X</li>
<li>Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 or AMD Radeon RX 6800XT</li>
<li>10GB VRAM</li>
</ul><h3>RT On (1440p at 30fps, Ultra settings)</h3>
<ul><li>Intel Core i9-9900K or AMD Ryzen 7 3700X</li>
<li>Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 or AMD Radeon RX 6800XT</li>
<li>10GB VRAM</li>
</ul><h3>RT On and Ultra RT (4K at 30fps, Ultra settings)</h3>
<ul><li>Intel Core i9-12900K or AMD Ryzen 9 7950X</li>
<li>Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 or AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX</li>
<li>12GB VRAM</li>
</ul><p>As you can see, the specs get pretty beastly the further down the preset list you go, so if you want to enjoy&nbsp;<em>The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>with ray tracing, you'd better have a top-of-the-range machine (or be prepared to fork out for an upgrade).</p>
<p>EA and BioWare have also revealed the global release timings for&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>, so here's when you'll be able to enjoy the game depending on where you are.</p>

SAG-AFTRA, which negotiates the interactive media agreement that governs video game performances, has announced that <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-and-video-game-companies-resume-negotiations">negotiations on the agreement will resume on Wednesday, October 23rd</a>.</p></div><p>SAG-AFTRA and members of the interactive media bargaining group — which includes video game companies like Activision, Insomniac Games, Take Two, Electronic Arts, and more — had been negotiating a new interactive media agreement for almost two years. In September of last year, SAG-AFTRA members <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/26/23890663/sag-aftra-strike-approval-video-game-performers">voted for strike authorization</a>, warning that a strike would be forthcoming if the two parties could not reach a deal. This summer, a strike was formally authorized and SAG-AFTRA members began picketing on July 26th. </p><p>The negotiations’ failure surrounded worker protections regarding the use of AI. SAG-AFTRA claimed that the bargaining committee <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/5/24213808/video-game-voice-actor-strike-sag-aftra">refused to grant protections to both voice and motion performers</a>. The bargaining companies disagreed saying that the protections offered were in line with industry standards.</p><p>Negotiations are resuming shortly after SAG-AFTRA announced that it was a<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/24/24253387/sag-aftra-strike-league-of-legends-formosa-interactive-riot-games">dding <em>League of Legends</em> to the list of struck games</a>. The union filed an unfair labor complaint against Formosa Entertainment, the company that provides voice acting services to<em> League</em> and other titles developed by Riot Games. SAG-AFTRA claimed the company attempted to circumvent the strike by hiring non-union talent. </p><p>Neither SAG-AFTRA nor the members of interactive media bargaining group has offered additional comments at this time.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
In the grim darkness of the far future, you will not have to worry about getting preyed upon by rival Space Marine chapters whilst duffing up the Tyranids, for there are no plans to add a PvPvE mode to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>. That's according to game director Dmitry Grigorenko, who observes that enjoyable PvPvE is the "holy grail" of game design, much-sought and seldom claimed. Balancing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooters</a> in which players fight both each other and the bots is tricky, especially in a game as prone to dousing the screen in giblets as Space Marine 2.

The comments in question were delivered unto <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/space-marine-2-no-plans-for-pvpve-saber-thinks-its-a-holy-grail-of-game-design">MP1st</a>. "PvPvE is a holy grail of game design," Grigorenko told the site. "A lot of studios are trying to find it and a lot of them fail. The truth is that it's a very very difficult task. It sounds great on paper, but when you actually start trying, it becomes apparent that it's very annoying when you fight other players only to get backstabbed by an AI opponent.</p>
<p>"This is why most of the games are trying to ensure that PvP and PvE aspects don't intersect that much, i.e. AI opponents are restricted to specific places on maps, etc," he went on. "It's a complicated mode to implement that would change the experience significantly, so I'm afraid there are no plans for it."
</p>
<p>
I've been writing a fair bit about Space Marine 2 and related topics behind the scenes, but I haven't spent any time in the game's PvP, so can't really comment on the reasonableness of all this. Still, it sounds like Space Marine 2 PvP is a lot more claustrophobic than, say, an extraction shooter such as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/beautiful-lights-mix-of-stalker-and-hunt-showdown-is-masterfully-eerie-but-i-do-wish-it-wasnt-an-extraction-shooter">Beautiful Light</a>. Slop the PvP and PvE pots together, and I imagine the outcome would be the wrong kind of bloody mayhem. Mind you, this game <span tabindex="0">does have Chaos Space Marines in it</span>. A bit of <span tabindex="0">battle-brotherly betrayal</span> would be perfectly consistent with the plot.

Those majestic trees, those quaint little stores, the rich history, and, of course, a beautiful hotel right on the shores of the lake itself.</p><p>It all makes for a special place for the whole family. Sure, it’s easy to get overwhelmed walking the streets of Silent Hill, but don’t worry; whether you’re new in town, or enjoying a return trip for the first time in years, we’ve got tips for how to enjoy your stay to the fullest.<br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f5a3f730fe7fad286397f5a5d31d1af7" data-recommend-id="image://f5a3f730fe7fad286397f5a5d31d1af7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Staring at a fence in front of a tunnel." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Staring at a fence in front of a tunnel." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Konami / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f5a3f730fe7fad286397f5a5d31d1af7" data-recommend-id="image://f5a3f730fe7fad286397f5a5d31d1af7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Staring at a fence in front of a tunnel." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While <em>Silent HIll 2</em> has changed a great deal in the last couple of decades, veterans do still have a minor advantage when wandering through town. The general layout is the same, though many of the stores and shops are now open for business, instead of just having health drinks inexplicably sitting on their doorsteps. If you remember where specific items were, try heading out that way anyway—either there’ll be something new at that location or, in a nice, understated bit of feedback, the game will actually shift to a different camera angle highlighting that location, with an audio sting and an unnerving breathing noise, just as a little nod to the old-schoolers out there.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="210c65048cd2ba663e349c2d071a95db" data-recommend-id="image://210c65048cd2ba663e349c2d071a95db" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Staring at the back of a car." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Staring at the back of a car." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Konami / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="210c65048cd2ba663e349c2d071a95db" data-recommend-id="image://210c65048cd2ba663e349c2d071a95db" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Staring at the back of a car." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>It’s important to come to Silent Hill well-prepared and well-hydrated as you stroll through its streets and roads. You, as an eagle-eyed traveler—one whose head might actually turn and face important items in the environment, I should add—might see a local supermarket or fast food joint, but, oh no, they’re not open! Instead of friendly fast food workers serving meals with a smile, you get leggy mannequin monsters serving pain, and <em>hopefully</em> that’s just a vertical smile where the face should be. Thankfully, the good citizens of Silent Hill are more than happy to assist fellow travelers by leaving a goodly supply of nutritional drinks and ammunition in their cars. You may need to bust out the windows to get to your supplies, but, hey, the price is right.</p><p>That doesn’t just apply to cars, though. Don’t get too precious about storefront windows and doors, either.

Though as an out-of-towner, sometimes a little noise is unavoidable—for your own safety and well-being, you should consider keeping your lights off and your radios off as much as possible to avoid one of your fleshy neighbors checking up on what’s causing all the commotion.</p><p>And as an added incentive for your cooperation, if you should pick up a radio and immediately turn it off before even encountering a local, there’s a trophy/achievement in it for you.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3af13c100bc85ac96f3bf7144bc9ef35" data-recommend-id="image://3af13c100bc85ac96f3bf7144bc9ef35" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Staring at a dead monster." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Staring at a dead monster." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Konami / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3af13c100bc85ac96f3bf7144bc9ef35" data-recommend-id="image://3af13c100bc85ac96f3bf7144bc9ef35" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Staring at a dead monster." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>A job worth doing is worth doing right, and that goes for anything, from grocery shopping, to building a house, to beating down an abominable fleshbeast until you start seeing white meat. But how do you really know for sure you did that last bit right, especially in a place where things have a terrible habit of coming back to life? Well, there’s a few things.</p><p>For starters, when it comes to most enemies, you’re going to have a devil of a time getting them down to begin with. Although while every enemy has their particular quirks, virtually all of them are at death’s door if you’ve gotten them off their feet. But your job’s not done yet, heavens no. You should stroll right over and make sure that enemy’s a goner by hitting them while they’re down with a melee weapon (Right Trigger by default). You’ll actually know you’re safe when you stop hitting them with melee weapons, and start stomping instead. If you’re dealing with groups, that single stomp should be your signifier that you can move on to the next problem. It’s as simple as that!*</p><p>*—except for the ones who spit acid because when those guys are down, they vomit more acid and can kill you in seconds—please don’t try to stomp them, they suck.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="30a9917604898b99a9248dea8b4b2bc1" data-recommend-id="image://30a9917604898b99a9248dea8b4b2bc1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1925" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Staring at a triangle-headed man through some blinds." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Staring at a triangle-headed man through some blinds." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Konami / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="30a9917604898b99a9248dea8b4b2bc1" data-recommend-id="image://30a9917604898b99a9248dea8b4b2bc1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1925" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Staring at a triangle-headed man through some blinds." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Silent Hill has everything you need for some big beautiful fireworks displays launched from the various pistols, shotguns, and rifles scattered throughout the world, but a special thing just doesn’t remain special if it happens all the time.

If you’re up close and personal, maybe steer the fight away from them, and be careful if they’re off to your right or left before you take a swing. If it’s a situation where a gun is involved, never fire if there’s a chance they might wind up in your way.

Zero</a>, is cutting its workforce after canceling “several” games “due to lackluster demand.”</p><p>The report also alleges Bandai Namco is sending workers to "oidashi beya," or “expulsion rooms,” where they’re given nothing to do. This, Bloomberg alleged, is “putting pressure on them to leave voluntarily.”</p><p>According to the site, Bandai Namco Studios Inc. (the video game development division of Bandai Namco) has moved about 200 of its roughly 1,300 employees to expulsion rooms and nearly 100 have resigned, with more expected to leave in the coming months.</p><p>Japan has strict labor-protection laws that make it harder to cut staff than in other countries, such as the U.S. Expulsion rooms are therefore sometimes used by companies to drive staff to become so disheartened that they resign voluntarily, and thus are ineligible for severance they would normally receive had they been made redundant.</p><p>In a statement given to Bloomberg, Bandai Namco denied pressuring staff to leave voluntarily, but did confirm the cancelation of games in development, and revealed some employees are now waiting to work on their next project.</p><p>"Our decisions to discontinue games are based on comprehensive assessments of the situation,” Bandai Namco said. "Some employees may need to wait a certain amount of time before they are assigned their next project, but we do move forward with assignments as new projects emerge. There is no organization like an ‘oidashi beya’ at Bandai Namco Studios designed to pressure people to leave voluntarily."</p><p>Bloomberg reports that Bandai Namco has suffered financially in much the same way other video game companies have post-pandemic, with big losses coming from write-downs tied to game cancelations. It alleged that Bandai Namco has recently stopped development on games that feature characters from Naruto and One Piece, “as well as a project commissioned by Nintendo Co.” This mystery canceled Nintendo game was not named.</p><p>Bandai Namco Studios has for a number of years developed games for Nintendo, including exclusives <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/super-smash-bros-ultimate">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokken-tournament">Pokkén Tournament</a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/new-pokemon-snap">New Pokémon Snap</a>. In November 2023, Bandai Namco announced the team it had set up to do contract development for Nintendo as Bandai Namco Studio 2 &amp; Studio S, promising more to come.</p><p>On the studio’s new website, a statement read: “Bandai Namco Studio 2 &amp; Studio S has been a studio specializing in contracted development projects. We have cooperated in the development of many world-class titles, such as Super Smash Bros, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and Mario Kart Tour.</p><p>“As a group of professionals who do not compromise on quality, we will continue to produce world-class titles in the future. We are looking forward to the participation of highly motivated creators.”</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

The method is commonly referred to as oidashibeya, meaning "expulsion room." The result has led to almost 100 resignations, but the company insists there is no such tactic in place.</p><p>"Our decisions to discontinue games are based on comprehensive assessments of the situation," a Bandai Namco representative said.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/lonely-mountains-snow-riders-demo<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://kotaku.com/lonely-mountains-goes-from-good-to-great-once-you-bike-1839438048" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Lonely Mountains: Downhill</em></a> is one of my favorite games, a mountain biking sort of racer/ sort of Zen exploration of a virtual wilderness. Developer Megagon is making a sequel, where you trade your bike for skis. There’s a demo out now, and I love it.</p><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2545360/Lonely_Mountains_Snow_Riders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders</em></a> has the same basic premise as <em>Downhill</em>: you start at the top of a mountain and need to get to the bottom. Instead of being a Spandex-clad little person on a little bike, now you’re a snowsuit-clad little person on little skis. The crux of a run is still about navigating a changing landscape, flying off jumps, taking tight turns, and exploring off the main path to try to find the optimal–or at least the most exciting–route down. Like the first game, there are challenges that unlock new trails, like finishing in a certain time or having under a certain number of crashes.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders - Announcement Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nPV7r1RY5bY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Both games are fairly simple to control, though <em>Snow Riders</em> adds some new features in the form of tricks you can pull off in the air, like grabs and spins. The full game will have a multiplayer mode, which I imagine skilled players will make look very fast and fancy but which I will use to crash into everyone and ruin their runs. I was impressed by how much <em>Snow Riders</em> keeps the vibe I love from <em>Downhill</em>, one of both stress and peaceful exploration, while the snow adds an excellent new element in the form of deep powder and the lovely way your little person sinks into a drift when you crash.</p><p>I crash a lot. Despite the hours and hours I’ve put into <em>Downhill</em>, I’m not the best player, never being able to stick to my plan in a high-stakes moment, or never quite being able to react fast enough to shave those precious seconds off my time or avoid calamity. I’m less into perfecting my runs in both games than I am chasing the thrill of exploring a new area for the first time. Both games situate their camera so a path is often full of surprises, zooming in or pulling out at just the right moment to give you a careful glimpse of what’s coming next while still keeping you on your toes. Even when I'm laser-focused on my goal, or when I've done a run dozens of times, I always feel like there’s some new path or detail to discover or smash into.</p><p>I love both games’ diorama-esque design, how they’re able to paint such evocative wildernesses with their blocky art style. The sound of the snow, like the whizz of your bike in <em>Downhill</em>, gives a calming vibe to what is often a high-speed game of brutal crashes and chaos.</p><p>The demo is part of yet another round of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam demos</a> that runs this week. <em>Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders</em> has a release date of 2024, which I hope is true. I will also humbly suggest that Megagon could combine both games by adding <a href="https://bikepacking.com/bikes/fat-bikes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fat bikes</a>, which is 100% a crossover I would play.</p><p><strong>Correction, 11:42am:</strong> The initial version of this article mis-stated that multiplayer was not available in the demo.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Today, BioWare has <a href="https://x.com/dragonage/status/1846212097400885490" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared </a>the detailed PC specifications for Dragon Age: The Veilguard. As a reminder, the game runs on the Frostbite engine just like its predecessor. Here's what you'll need to play the game if you don't want to enable ray tracing.</p>

<p>As you would expect, enabling ray tracing will require a much beefier PC configuration. The really worrying part is that for the most taxing preset, RT ON plus Ultra RT, Dragon Age: The Veilguard will require a massively powerful PC (Intel Core i9 12900K or AMD Ryzen 9 7950X, plus NVIDIA RTX 4080 or AMD RX 7900 XTX), while targeting only 30 frames per second at 4K resolution. Furthermore, the image confirms these performance targets include optional upscaling, so there's no solace to be found in that regard.</p>

<p>Perhaps the only hope for NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 owners is that BioWare only considered NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution rather than Super Resolution plus Frame Generation, which Dragon Age: The Veilguard is already <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-3-will-be-in-dragon-age-the-veilguard-avowed-and-final-fantasy-xvi-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> to support, in these performance estimates. We'll try to ask for clarification on the matter.</p>
<p>Anyway, BioWare also talked about the console specs. The PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X versions of the game will offer users the choice between fidelity and performance modes, which, as usual, will target 30 or 60 FPS, respectively. The PS5 Pro version of Dragon Age: The Veilguard has many improvements beyond that, as outlined by Maciej Kurowski, BioWare Studio Technical Director:</p>
<p><em>The game's Fidelity and Performance modes will both see improvements on the hardware, including improved resolution in 30FPS Fidelity and 60FPS Performance modes. Additionally, there will be various improved visual settings across 30FPS Fidelity and 60FPS Performance mode.</em></p>
<p><em>We have upgraded image quality thanks to Sony's new AI-based upscaler, PSSR. We’ve enabled Raytraced Ambient Occlusion (RTAO) in the 60FPS Performance mode, which previously was only available on the base PlayStation 5 with 30FPS Fidelity mode.</em></p>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard is out on October 31. The game won't offer any preload on PC, while Xbox Series S|X users have been able to preload since yesterday, and PlayStation 5 users will get to do it from October 29 at 9 AM Pacific Time. The reason for the lack of preload on PC is that there is no Denuvo DRM in the game.</p>

Anbernic hasn’t confirmed if a 2.4GHz USB dongle is included for gaming devices that don’t natively support it, but the controller can be used with a USB-C cable if you want to skip wireless connectivity altogether.</p><div><figcaption><em>The Anbernic RG P01 doesn’t appear to include switches on the back limiting the travel of its triggers for playing FPS titles.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Screenshot: YouTube</cite></p></div><p>The use of Hall effect sticks and triggers should help prolong the life of the controller, but there doesn’t appear to be switches on the back of the RG P01 limiting the travel of its triggers to improve reaction times for FPS games. The controller does include an extra pair of buttons behind its grips that can trigger preprogrammed macros when pressed individually or in sequence.</p><p>Anbernic has even included a six-axis gyroscope&nbsp;for playing Nintendo Switch games that support motion-based controls, plus RGB accent lighting around each joystick — a feature the company has recently <a href="https://anbernic.com/products/rg-406v">started to include on some of its handhelds</a>, like the RG 406V.</p><p>We don’t yet know what the RG P01’s battery life will be, when the wireless controller will be released, or how much it will cost. The controller’s features are comparable to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24185806/gaming-8bitdo-controller-ultimate-2c-hall-effect">8BitDo Ultimate 2C</a>. which debuted last June for $29.99, although the RG P01 includes support for more devices. If Anbernic is targeting a similar price, that advantage alone could make its first controller worth considering over 8BitDo’s budget-minded offerings.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The allure of the sea-green GameBoy screen is difficult to resist. Picking up from where Pokémon left off two decades ago, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/letalis">Letalis</a> is a bleepy-bloopy retro RPG about wandering from town to town and doing battle with dodgy local leaders to prove your worth. But you won't be doing the fighting yourself, God no. Leave that to the squad of Roman gladiators hiding in your back pocket. </p>

<p>It's not exactly like the Pokémon battles of yore, to be fair. Fights involve up to three battlers at a time, feeling a bit more like classic Final Fantasy. And their moves are determined mostly by whatever weapons they're holding. A shield will let them block and lower the damage of an incoming attack, for example. Some weapons slash multiple opponents in a single swing. Others cause enemies to steadily bleed health, or become dazed and miss a turn. </p>
<p>All fairly classic stuff then. Standing in for the elemental types of Fire, Earth, Water, et cetera are some different warrior classes with distinct fighting styles - Bandits, Centurions, Tritons, and... a Ronin!? How the Japanese warrior ended up in a world of ancient Roman arenas, I don't know. But it's no more outlandish than a yellow rat that shoots electricity from its cheeks. There are libraries in each town that will steadily explain how each fighter stacks up against the others, but to be honest I normally need a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pokemon_Type_Chart.svg">big child-friendly chart</a> to help me out with this stuff. Luckily, the fighting screen will show the word "advantage" when you inspect an opponent to show that your current fighter will draw extra blood.  </p><p>There are other subtleties fitting of turn-based biffing. Using the same attack twice in a row will result in half the usual damage. And you can level up your brawlers by killing foes of greater rank (the flashing "evolve" animation for this slaps me in the memories). You learn all these details by wandering around the first village, chatting to the folks bobbing up and down as they stand in the street. Ah, it's just like 1999, when understanding a game meant milking every drip of dialogue you could from the wise people of your hometown. </p>
<p>There is one more blood-soaked difference. Your fighters can die outright. No precious "fainting" or life-saving escapes to the Poké hospital here (though there is a lady who will cure you on the road for some cash). The permanent deaths of your team makes things a little more hardcore (and probably a bit grindy if things go badly wrong). But your fighters also regenerate health if you put them on the bench for a fight. </p>
<p>All in all, a neat injection of nostalgia. I will say it feels weird as hell to play GameBoy style games on a giant PC screen. If you have a SteamDeck though, you're sorted. This is another little treat we've found in our recent trawls through the great Steam Next Fest lagoon. Not sure when the full game is coming out, but you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2396200/Letalis/">play the demo now</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

However, those aren’t the most infamous things to come out of the entire saga. Allegedly, the files also include lore documents that have had fans reeling. If these are real, none of these stories have been released to the public officially, so they shouldn’t be considered “canon.” But, like much real-world mythology and folklore, these stories have elements that are a little fucked up if taken literally, rather than as the stuff of legend. So keep that context in mind when I tell you that there’s allegedly a story about a Typhlosion impregnating a human woman.</p><p>These mythological stories have been translated and are spreading around the internet, and cover concepts like “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_sin&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_sin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Original sin</a></span>” in the <em>Pokémon </em>universe, and the relationships between humans and Pokémon. They include stories about a person who had relations with an Octillery, another who a Vigoroth seemingly impregnated after killing baby Slakoths, and a story about a Typhlosion who disguises itself as a human man, kidnaps a girl, erases her memories of her past, and has a child with her. The Typhlosion story has been the uh, breakout, of these stories, and has sent fans of the Pokémon spiraling. Now, there are hundreds of memes and art about the situation.</p><p>The problem is, it’s unclear at this time if these stories were actually on a Game Freak hard drive somewhere, or if someone’s just taking advantage of all the chaos to spread misinformation. Whether or not they’re legitimate, they have undoubtedly embedded themselves in how people will talk about Typhlosion and other Pokémon included in these tales. But assuming they are real, there seems to be a disconnect between the intention behind stories like this and how the community is reacting to them. Some <em>Pokémon </em>fans are reading them as very literal and are making claims about Game Freak’s all-ages franchise having a hidden malevolence under the surface.</p><p>If you open up a book on Greek or Norse mythology, you’ll find plenty of stories like this withinthose pantheons, such as when Loki got impregnated by a horse. Despite that undeniable similarity to real-world myths, it hasn’t stopped some folks from pearl-clutching about these types of stories as if they’re somehow problematic or intended to be pornographic in nature. The pushback against that mindset has been strong and swift.</p><p>Ultimately, whether they’re real or not is immaterial to some people at this point, as the joke has become so prevalent that <em>Pokémon </em>fans will never be able to forget it. Typhlosion somehow got the worst of it, and if you’re a long-time fan of the Gen II starter, I’m sorry for the nonsense you will get for the rest of your life. I had the Hisuian variant in my <em>Pokémon Legends: Arceus </em>party so now I know I can never post a screenshot of that team again. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Ahead of the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fantasian-neo-dimension/" data-ref-id="5000-632909">Fantasian: Neo Dimension</a> on PC and consoles in December, legendary video game composer Nobuo Uematsu has announced that the game will feature his final video game soundtrack. "This is my final project as a composer of video game music," Uematsu said in a brief video message.</p><p>A self-taught musician with a career spanning decades, Uematsu is well-known for his contributions to the Final Fantasy franchise. While he had worked on other games before Final Fantasy, his musical contributions to the 1987 JRPG saw his star rise and he'd compose more music for subsequent games in the series. Beyond the Final Fantasy series, Uematsu has also worked on other big JRPGs over the years like Romancing SaGa, Chrono Trigger, and Fairy Fencer F.</p><p>Final Fantasy 7 is considered to have one of his best soundtracks, and Uematsu returned to the series for the Remake and Rebirth chapters to score new themes based on his original work. With a vast body of work, Uematsu has also created soundtracks for anime feature films, and in 2004, he left Square Enix to form his own production company, Smile Please, and the record label Dog Ear Records in 2006. In 2018, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-composer-takes-a-leave-of-absence-du/1100-6461913/" data-ref-id="1100-6461913">Uematsu stepped away from the industry</a> to focus on his mental and physical health.</p><p>A few years back, Final Fantasy creator and Fantasian producer Hironobu Sakaguchi mentioned that the RPG could be Uematsu's final video game soundtrack, due to health concerns. "Before we approached him to work on Fantasian, he was going through some health issues, and there were concerns if he was going to be able to compose everything or if it was even possible for him to work on this," Sakaguchi said to <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2021/03/03/fantasian-apple-arcade-game-mistwalker-hironobu-sakaguchi-interview/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mobile Syrup</a> in 2021.

                <p dir="ltr">Ahead of the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/redacted/" data-ref-id="5000-622841">[REDACTED]</a> (yes, that's actually the name of the game, brackets and all), I got to play a fairly substantial part of the upcoming isometric roguelike that takes place in the same world as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-callisto-protocol/" data-ref-id="5000-523747">The Callisto Protocol</a>. And though I can't talk about my impressions just yet, I can share a conversation I had with Striking Distance studio head Steve Papoutsis and creative director Ben Walker after playing the game. We discussed how the game started as a fun distraction that eventually became a spin-off of The Callisto Protocol, how the studio designed the Rival system to add a frantic undercurrent to each run of the game, and why [REDACTED] isn't launching in early access like many roguelike games are these days.</p><p dir="ltr">In [REDACTED], you play as a guard trying to escape Black Iron Prison during the events of The Callisto Protocol. There's only one escape pod left and there are other survivors--fellow coworkers or inmates called Rivals--all striving for that same goal. Each failed escape sees the guard die and join the infected, and you start a new run as another guard trying to escape. You can chase after the reanimated corpse of the previous guard you played as to recover some goodies but they'll have every upgrade you unlocked in that run, making them quite formidable in comparison to normal enemies. As you progress, you can try to slow the Rivals down to surpass them or kill them, but they'll be doing all they can to get rid of you too.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> [REDACTED] - Official Gameplay Reveal Trailer | Gamescom 2024</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">[REDACTED] is set to launch for PC on October 31.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>GameSpot: So let's address the obvious: What inspired a small part of the Striking Distance team to go from The Callisto Protocol's over-the-shoulder action-horror format to an isometric roguelike dungeon crawler in [REDACTED]?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Walker</strong>: It really came organically. We were finishing up the DLC for [The Callisto Protocol]. A small group of people just started working on mechanics and fun and shooting and stuff, and it just kind of grew. It kept growing and growing and growing. So things definitely turned more towards the fun aspect of it and not so many constraints. So we're just getting around with... We're always fans of fighters and top-down shooters and stuff, and so when we started getting into that speed of mechanics, we moved the camera up so we could see what we were doing, and then started adding the shooting layer in there.</p><p dir="ltr">And so that's really where it came from was some designers, a couple of engineers, just playing around and having fun. And then the rest of the team seeing it and adding to it. Art came in and they're like, "Hey, what about this really cool comic style?" Okay, that's great. VFX saw that and added their layer on top of it, and it just kind of gained a lot of momentum.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4383471-ss_103e88c3a67356747fd915cd1eac958aa0de3b67.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4383471" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4383471-ss_103e88c3a67356747fd915cd1eac958aa0de3b67.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4383471"></a><figcaption>Normal enemies go down pretty quickly but they swarm if you're not careful.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4383471-ss_103e88c3a67356747fd915cd1eac958aa0de3b67.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>Did [REDACTED] start as a sequel to The Callisto Protocol or did the connection to that game come later in development?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Walker</strong>: Yes. It's part of what we were doing when we were having fun and just playing around. We weren't really expecting it to go anywhere. We were just working on stuff internally. And so we started kind of not joking around, but having fun with the idea of, "Well, if there really was this zombie outbreak in a prison, what about all the other people? What about the people that work there? What about just the regular guards? What would they be thinking? What would they be going through?" And from that fun aspect [we went], "Okay, well they're probably like, 'Screw this, I'm out of here.'" They're not trying to save the world. They're not trying to do all these things that we do and have fun with in other games. We just looked at the other side of it. And so since [then], we were based [on] that line of thinking. In that TCP kind of universe, but it's a different kind of game altogether. One, we're really just focusing on cool characters and fun gameplay.</p><p dir="ltr">Yeah. Usually, things are a lot more structured and planned out and stuff. This one just kind of gained a life of its own, and so it was really fun to be a part of it because I definitely hadn't had that opportunity very often in my career.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4383472-ss_a14fc2fe83501d6b0fe6b8fa5c72b1992292cc35.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4383472" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4383472-ss_a14fc2fe83501d6b0fe6b8fa5c72b1992292cc35.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4383472"></a><figcaption>Combat in [REDACTED] is way faster than The Callisto Protocol.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4383472-ss_a14fc2fe83501d6b0fe6b8fa5c72b1992292cc35.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>Internally, how do y'all refer to [REDACTED]? Is it a sequel, prequel, something else...?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Papoutsis</strong>: No. No. I mean, for us, once we started gaining momentum and really digging in on the concept, it was really important for us to decouple it from anybody thinking it was a sequel or overly connected to it.</p><p dir="ltr">One of the things that's really important to us now that we've worked on it for a bit and we're getting ready to launch it is that it's accessible to anyone. So we didn't want to have a barrier that, "Oh, you need to play TCP in order to play this game." Or even vice versa.</p><p dir="ltr">They're two separate games. There's some very loose connection based on the location. But as Ben said, we're not trying to save the world. We're trying to get out. That was the whole idea that really clicked with us was, "Hey, if you went to work one day and all of a sudden there was a zombie outbreak, what would you be doing?" You'd be trying to find your way out of there as fast as possible. And oh, by the way, you got a bunch of coworkers and prisoners trying to do the same thing. And we just thought that sounded fun. That sounded different. It led into some of our unique mechanics like our rivals. It just really organically started to just fall into place, and the last thing we wanted to do was inhibit our creativity based on our previous game, which we do like our previous game, but this is a whole separate thing and we want it to be enjoyed on its own.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4383473-ss_bb03a71e171fadf7e8dc6fdead0a634b1ab8949d.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4383473" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4383473-ss_bb03a71e171fadf7e8dc6fdead0a634b1ab8949d.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4383473"></a><figcaption>The Rivals pack a mean punch if you try to confront them too early.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4383473-ss_bb03a71e171fadf7e8dc6fdead0a634b1ab8949d.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>Is that part of the reason for the Rival system? To differentiate this game from its roguelike contemporaries?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Walker</strong>: It was a system we hadn't seen anywhere before either. And so that's why we really put a lot of focus and effort into it because starting with the premise. What are these other people doing? They're racing. So trying to put the mechanics together behind that. We didn't want them to be in your way all the time, but we wanted them to be around and have their presence, but we also wanted them to be a threat. And so that kind of just naturally paired together well with that. We call it the rival attacks or the room modifiers. And for roguelikes, it's all about keeping the game fresh and not knowing what you're going to expect all the time. And so all of their attacks can happen in any different room, in any different combination. So it's just a matter of keeping things, the player always guessing a little bit.</p><p dir="ltr">And then, I don't know if you noticed. But if you get ahead of them in the race, they can't attack you anymore, so it's an incentive to keep ahead. They only attack you if they're in front of you.</p><p dir="ltr">Yeah, we try to put a lot of strategy into it too and put a lot into our builds as well because you can build towards attacking them better and just you being faster means you're naturally moving across the space quicker, and so we tried to add a whole layer there where you have to come in with different plans and different load-outs at different times.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4383474-ss_cd8b202b301668b338765052ebeb72013083c69e.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4383474" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4383474-ss_cd8b202b301668b338765052ebeb72013083c69e.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4383474"></a><figcaption>You have to keep moving to stay alive.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4383474-ss_cd8b202b301668b338765052ebeb72013083c69e.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>If you kill a Rival, are they gone, gone? Do you just not see them in a run ever again?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Papoutsis</strong>: There's a bit of a surprise, I guess. I don't know how much we want to give away. But it's a video game, so you're going to have the Rivals. They're not going to ever be gone, gone, but what happens to them, you have to play it and see.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>We've seen a few games in this genre over the past three years or so launch in early access first--why the decision to launch in full out the gate?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Papoutsis</strong>: Yeah. So I mean, it's interesting. You're right. There's a lot of different approaches right now in games. People doing early access, people doing betas, things of that nature. I think with us, the game started very organically and we just kept progressing along, and before you know it, we were like, "Hey, this thing's almost done." And I think if you're going to do something like an early access [release], it makes a lot of sense to build that into your plan. So you kind of know. We need to get to this state, then we do an early access, and then you kind of have a different, more almost community-driven development. But I think in the unique instance of this game, that didn't really factor in because we were just kind of going and making it.</p><p dir="ltr">I think there's a lot of value to that style of approach and there's a lot of games I enjoy that do that. But I think for REDACTED because it was more of this passion project that just came out of the blue in a way, we didn't have the opportunity to really put forward that kind of planning. The community-driven development of early access, that's a whole different mindset as well in terms of how you... Because if you're going to do something like that, these teams that do it, they do it really well. They're dedicated to being able to receive feedback and then take it in, ingest it, and modify and communicate, do all those things. But we were on a much different track when we started. So I think for us, the approach we took works, but I think there's a lot of merit in all those different approaches and they're all fun and different, and it's important that people do get a chance to experience those things. But with our game, hopefully, people are there on the 31st and just ready to hop in and play.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4383475-ss_ef8e91db5c447886d8c70513f504c997bffc6d5d.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4383475" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4383475-ss_ef8e91db5c447886d8c70513f504c997bffc6d5d.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4383475"></a><figcaption>There are boss battles beyond the Rivals.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4383475-ss_ef8e91db5c447886d8c70513f504c997bffc6d5d.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>In terms of story, does [REDACTED] tie into The Callisto Protocol in any way beyond both taking place in the same setting?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Walker</strong>: No. No. They're completely different. You don't need to know one to enjoy the other. We do have a lot of things that we were hoping the TCP players would notice and kind of just enjoy. But if you don't know what they are, it doesn't change the game. It's just like you said, "Oh, I recognize that. I remember that," for the people who enjoyed that other one. Timeline-wise is the only thing where this could potentially cross over, and this is right when the outbreak happens, but it's kind of a parallel universe type of thing, so there's no connection.</p><p dir="ltr">I think it was just because of the way the game naturally formed. We were playing around with some of the TCP weapons and stuff when we started, and so that's what was in our toolbox, and we started expanding on it. And at some point, it just felt wrong to change it because everything was going so well. And so it was just there from the start. And we've had this conversation a couple of times along the way like, "How did it cross over and this?" And so that's why we came... We didn't want to put Callisto Protocol or anything in the name; [we] knew it was completely different, and so it just felt wrong at some point to make it somewhere else.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4383476-ss_9934a372b79c87c13938eb12df4817247d98a2d4.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4383476" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4383476-ss_9934a372b79c87c13938eb12df4817247d98a2d4.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4383476"></a><figcaption>Sometimes there are just no good choices and you have to keep shooting and hope.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4383476-ss_9934a372b79c87c13938eb12df4817247d98a2d4.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>How did the art style and sound design come together? The comic book-inspired art and rock music makes for a very different vibe from The Callisto Protocol.</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Papoutsis</strong>: The inspiration for the art, I think it comes from a bunch of different places. I think a lot of the folks on the team really enjoy graphic novels and comics and things like that. And then, the other part of it was really trying to make it have its own visual identity. I think with The Callisto Protocol, it is a highly detailed, more photorealistic world. I'm very proud of the visual achievements the team was able to achieve there. But on this, we wanted it to feel different. We wanted it to have a different identity, more of an aggressive, frenetic, almost fast-type of feel to it.</p><p dir="ltr">And that art style really resonated with us as we looked at it. It was just like, "Wow, this looks really different." It fits into the general feeling we want players to have, which is primarily fun. That's the first thing. We just want people to have fun. We want them to feel the speed and the smooth controls, get to play with all the different experiments that they get. Everything really tied off of the controller.</p><p dir="ltr">And so having that visual identity just felt natural to that style and approach. So it just hearkens back to just older games. It just has more of an arcade-y style approach versus something that feels very serious and very deliberate, very photorealistic. And in a way, it was very liberating for the team because we're not constrained by those things. Somebody saying, "That's not what that looks like." In this world, it can look however we want it. And so I think that's very liberating in terms of your creative freedom with the art stuff.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Walker</strong>: With all the different colors and everything, it helped the gameplay out just like Steve was talking about, because we have these separations of what's going to do what to you, so everything's easy to read because things happen really, really fast. And so there's no room for subtlety in this. And that enabled us just to help pull all those gameplay elements and those different experiments together.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>This interview was edited for both brevity and readability.</em></p>

To celebrate, developers Neowiz and Round8 Studio have launched a new store stocked with limited-edition T-shirts, hoodies, and more.</p><p>The first wave of products includes six T-shirts, two hoodies, and one cap adorned with the Lies of P logo. All the designs feature contributions from the Lies of P team, and they reference events from the game, some of the graffiti found in the streets, and P's powerful arm prosthetics. For something a little smaller and more subtle, Lies of P fans can look forward to a pin that replicates the design of Monad's Lamp in 2025.</p><h3>Lies of P hoodies</h3><figure data-align="center"

looking for something related to Lies of P that isn't fashion, there are two other official items currently available to preorder. First up, music fans can check out the $75 Lies of P soundtrack on vinyl, as the limited-edition collection features gorgeous album cover art that looks like a Baroque-era painting. There's more of this fine painterly art inside of the trifold cover, and each of the three vinyl discs is designed to mirror the ones seen in the game with their black and gold finish. The entire Lies of P soundtrack is contained on them, and it's expected to ship out in early 2025.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4384032-lies-of-p-soundtrack.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4384032" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4384032-lies-of-p-soundtrack.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4384032"></a><figcaption>Lies of P vinyl 3XL soundtrack</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4384032-lies-of-p-soundtrack.jpg"></figure><p>There's also The Art of Lies of P, a 256-page art book containing a collection of concept art and creator commentary. If you're curious to see how Round8 Studio and Neowiz combined its Bloodborne inspirations with a rich world of grim design and deadly monsters, this is bound to be a great look behind the scenes of Lies of P.

Crafting a narrative that blends multiple timelines within a cohesive gameplay experience was one of our most ambitious challenges in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tenet of the Spark</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. In many scenes, players can switch between three distinct world-states. The primary modern-day world that anchors the narrative, and two past versions of the world that intertwine with it mechanically and narratively. This was obviously a very complicated and sophisticated problem to tackle design-wise. Today, I’d like to share our experience in overcoming the challenge of creating three distinct, overlapping game worlds within one cohesive narrative for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tenet of the Spark</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developing these worlds—with modern urban, Viking, and Aztec themes, respectively—was one of the most complex challenges our team faced. Our goal was to ensure that each world felt rich and immersive on its own yet still connected within the overarching story, all while allowing a seamless transition between these three environments without upending the game’s balance. Here’s how we approached this ambitious task.</span></p><p>Image via ROAR Games.</p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Building narrative connection">Building narrative connection</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Above all else, we’ve always envisioned </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tenet of the Spark</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> as a narrative experience, with the action and interaction conveying players from one emotional beat to the next. Maintaining clarity in delivering these emotional beats was a key part of the design. If we over-complicated the layered-world mechanic, it could render the story hard to follow, or run the risk of players missing out on important moments and twists. So we established some core design priorities.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To maintain narrative cohesion, we decided early to make the modern-day story of our protagonist the cornerstone and have the other elements built around it. The Viking and Aztec worlds would serve to move the main story thread forward and broaden the gameplay possibility space without becoming a focus. That said, this is also an action game, and we also believe the game should still feel satisfying even if a player chooses to skip all of those cutscenes we worked so hard on (please don’t), so the additional world layers are in part there to keep moment-to-moment action constantly engaging.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Balancing gameplay mechanics"><span>Balancing gameplay mechanics</span></h3><p>Image via ROAR Games.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The core concept of having three playable, overlapping worlds went through several major iterations. We initially envisioned giving the player total freedom to switch worlds at any moment, but not only would that have been enormously demanding in terms of art assets required, but it also diluted the focus on the main character’s story. Playtesters found themselves skipping large chunks of content or getting frustrated as they couldn’t figure out the world state required to continue. Other developers considered us masochists for effectively trying to make three games in a trench coat.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We also tried a time-limit system, where switching between states was a limited resource. Not only did this not help on the workload front, but it broke the game’s flow further and brought us further away from the experience we envisioned.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the end, we settled on a somewhat more restrictive but narratively and mechanically resonant solution. Switching would only be possible in combat and during contextually appropriate situations where using these abilities made narrative sense from the protagonist’s perspective. In these zones, switching can happen freely at the player’s demand, but the very fact that switching is possible becomes a hint that it’s required (or at the very least advantageous) to progress. We also use flashback cutscenes to forcibly switch between layers to ensure narrative cohesion.</span></p><p>Image via ROAR Games.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Given the different worlds, it was crucial for us to not only show the gameplay differences of each character—in terms of strength, combat styles, and enemies—but also to give each world its own unique interactivity. This interactivity reveals the protagonist's perception and ties the worlds together through a combinatorial experience. We aim to create gameplay that offers not just basic stances, ability sets, and skill trees for each character but also encourages players to view worlds as tools for solving challenges in arenas and other encounters.</span></p><p>Image via ROAR Games.</p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Distinct visual design">Distinct visual design</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While a massive undertaking, creating a world that can be viewed through three distinct lenses was a thrilling challenge for our art team. From the beginning of development, we set out to make the visuals as far from generic as we could. Each of the three worlds has its own visual language—detailed and chaotic in the modern era, shadowy, stark, and mysterious in the Aztec era, and harsh, natural beauty in the Viking realm.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We decided early on that historical accuracy could take a backseat to narrative resonance. Gritty realism is secondary to how the protagonist perceives these other worlds. This allowed us to break free from reality’s confines and really highlight when we found most impactful in each era, and showcase the aesthetics and concepts that we were most excited by.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Also, getting away from strict accuracy helped keep the gameplay design focused. Slightly more fantastical aesthetics proved very functional in terms of combat design. Enemy archetypes need to be readable across worlds while maintaining continuity, and interactive objects need to stand out in order to nudge the player into switching between worlds for an edge in combat. Each of the worlds needed to be visually distinct, have a shared design language in order to make switching seamless and offer mechanical advantages to the player. That’s a lot!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We’re all about details, fighting hard for them. Posters, graffiti, hidden clues—every little element in each world adds depth and reveals more layers for those who pay attention. We settled early on a heavily stylized aesthetic inspired by the Spider-Verse films, with actively unrealistic models and textures. Having a shared, stark aesthetic also helped unify the styles between worlds, and by narrowing down the world-switching mechanic to key zones, we’ve given ourselves room to focus on areas where anything is possible—in the most crucial moments for protagonist and player alike.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Level streaming technology as the foundation for seamless switching">Level streaming technology as the foundation for seamless switching</h2><p>Image via ROAR Games.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Needless to say, even limiting it to key areas of the game, having three worlds that can be switched between without interrupting game flow or system performance was a major technical endeavor. Each level is structured like a layered cake, consisting of multiple entities: geometry, global lighting, local lighting, and background elements. There are also shared levels for all three worlds—narrative, sound, gameplay, and blocking volumes that define common collision boundaries across worlds.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">During prototyping, we build the framework, breaking down the space into independent sections such as arenas, traversal zones, and exploration areas. This allows us to prioritize zones where seamless switching is possible. A well-designed location allows resources to be shuffled efficiently, ensuring optimal streaming at any given moment, preloading sub-levels during cutscenes and bottlenecks to avoid stutters or loading pauses during transitions.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Levels are compartmentalized and culled efficiently. Inactive or inaccessible areas are unloaded, freeing up resources to load upcoming content into RAM, enabling seamless world-switching. Loading the geometry of the new world takes priority, while unloading the old one happens last, allowing us to process visual transition effects smoothly. This system also benefits parallel workflows between departments—lighting, geometry, or interactivity—enabling simultaneous work without interference.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Loading the geometry of the new world takes priority, while the old world’s geometry is unloaded at the last moment, with a snapshot of the level saved in a RenderTarget. This gives us more flexibility and time to refine the visual transition effects between worlds. One of the key benefits of this system is the efficient parallelization of work across departments—whether it's lighting, geometry, or arena/level interactivity. The development process for a level runs simultaneously across all teams without causing performance bottlenecks.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Working with object collisions">Working with object collisions</h2><p>Image via ROAR Games.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The visual process of switching between three environments is a major challenge for artists, environment designers, writers and more, all while keeping within performance overhead tolerances. But making it consistently interactive through it all is a whole different set of problems. When you’ve got three separate worlds filled with their own objects and geometry, maintaining seamless gameplay between these spaces becomes a challenge.</span></p><p>Image via ROAR Games.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What happens if the player gets stuck between objects that don’t exist in other worlds after switching? Or if an object is too large, pushing the player and disrupting combat flow? To prevent this, we avoid generating collisions for individual meshes. Instead, we group all objects and arena boundaries into a single collision area. This shared collision zone spans all three worlds, ensuring seamless gameplay while allowing creative freedom with environmental art. Effectively, creating a single contiguous gameplay space where each object within can exist in multiple states.</span></p><p>Image via ROAR Games.</p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Inspiration">Inspiration</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Video games are an iterative medium, and nothing is created without knowledge of prior art. We stand on the shoulders of giants, drawing inspiration from the classic time-shifting level "Effect and Cause" in&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Titanfall 2 and</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;the similarly themed level "A Crack In The Slab" from&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dishonored 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Our inspirations extend beyond games as well, with the parallel storytelling in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cloud Atlas </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and the seamless transition between worlds in Tomorrowland being huge inspirations. Each of these has its own approach to the concept and were incredible technical and narrative feats of their time. We’ve still got plenty to discover and learn, but we hope that we’ll be able to carve out our own memorable piece of gaming history with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tenet of the Spark</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Thank you to the marvelous team at ROAR Games who helped me write this article.

            <p>
Tetris Forever, the latest interactive documentary compilation from Atari 50 developer Digital Eclipse, is block-dropping onto PC and consoles on 12th November.
</p>
<p>
Tetris Forever is the third entry in Digital Eclipse's acclaimed Gold Master Series - following on from this year's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/llamasoft-the-jeff-minter-story-review">Llamasoft: The Jeff Minter Story</a> and 2023's The Making of Karateka - and it aims to tell the "true story of Tetris" as the hugely popular puzzler marks its 40th anniversary.
</p>
<p>
As is the Gold Master Series' usual way, it'll do that through a mix of playable games, "over 90 minutes" of new documentary footage, plus archival materials - including videos, photos, and artwork - all charting Tetris' creation and evolution across five interactive timelines.

Game-wise, Tetris Forever includes "more than 15" single-player and multiplayer titles, some of which have never been officially available outside Japan before. That's alongside an "authentic recreation" of the very first version of Tetris (which was developed on a Soviet Electronika 60 computer system by Alexey Pajitnov in 1984), plus  Digital Eclipse's own Tetris Time Warp, a brand-new, four-player take on the classic puzzler that switches between the package's various included versions in real-time as a game unfolds. Here's everything else confirmed so far:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Tetris (Apple II/1988)</li>
<li>Tetris (Famicom/1988)</li>
<li>Hatris (Famicom/1990)</li>
<li>Tetris 2 + Bombliss (Famicom/1990)</li>
<li>Hatris (Game Boy/1991)</li>
<li>Hatris (NES/1992)</li>
<li>Super Tetris 2 + Bombliss (Super Famicom/1992)</li>
<li>Tetris Battle Gaiden (Super Famicom/1993)</li>
<li>Super Tetris 2 + Bombliss Genteiban (Super Famicom/1993)</li>
<li>Super Tetris 3 (Super Famicom/1994)</li>
<li>Super Bombliss (Super Famicom/1995)</li>
<li>Super Bombliss (Game Boy/1995)</li>
<li>Super Bombliss DX (Game Boy/1998)</li>
</ul>
<p>
Tetris Forever will be available for Switch, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC (via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3180240/Tetris_Forever/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/tetris_forever">GOG</a>) when it launches on 12th November.

			<p>The new <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-x-all-digital-announced/">Xbox Series X All-Digital</a> and Special Edition 2 TB models feature a shrunk-down version of the console's chip and some hidden upgrades that make them better than the launch model.</p>
<p>In a new video shared on YouTube today, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@austinevans">Austin Evans</a> took a good look at the new models, opening them up to offer a better look at all the changes under the hood. The most important of these changes is the inclusion of a 6nm SoC, which is capable of reaching the same clock speeds of the bigger chip found in the console's original model by using slightly less voltage and thus producing less heat, which made the cooling solution change from vapor chamber to a traditional heatsink possible without any loss in performance.</p>
<p>The smaller SoC of the new Xbox Series X models brings a reduction in power draw in both idle and gaming scenarios. According to the tests conducted by Austin Evans, an Xbox Series X launch model draws 61 watts in the dashboard, while the All-Digital and Special Edition models draw 28 and 51 watts, respectively. In an actual gaming benchmark using Forza Horizon 5, the results are not that different, with the launch Xbox Series X model drawing 167 watts on average, the All-Digital model 151 and the Special Edition 156, all with essentially the same thermals and noise. While the differences aren't massive, they can make a difference with heavy usage and in the long term.</p>

Microsoft has redesigned the motherboard on the white Xbox Series X and new 2TB models, shrunk the system-on-a-chip (SoC) down to 6nm, and switched to a new cooling solution.</p><p>YouTuber <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DEqyGpXK2fSU">Austin Evans spotted the changes</a> in a teardown of the new models and reported that the shrunken chip allows the new Xbox Series X models to run around 10 watts less than the original model at idle. </p><div><figcaption><em>The new Xbox Series X motherboard has been heavily redesigned.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Austin Evans (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqyGpXK2fSU">YouTube</a>)</cite></p></div><p>The motherboard on the new Xbox Series X models has been totally overhauled, with many components on the board simplified, shrunk down, or moved around. There’s no more shield over the SSD, and on the digital Xbox Series X, there’s a blank space where the disc drive usually is. You can’t easily retrofit a disc drive, either, as you’d have to solder on connectors for the drive.</p><p>The cooling for the updated 6nm chip has also been redesigned on these new Xbox Series X models. There’s no longer a vapor chamber, and Microsoft is using a more traditional copper heat pipe design instead. Evans found that the exhaust temperature and noise of these new Xbox Series X models hasn’t changed from the original, though.</p><div><figcaption><em>The new Xbox Series X 6nm chip.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Austin Evans (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqyGpXK2fSU">YouTube</a>)</cite></p></div><p>Evans found that the original launch Xbox Series X hardware runs at around 61 watts idle on the Xbox dashboard, but on the new 2TB special-edition model, this dropped to around 51 watts idle and just 38 watts on the digital Xbox Series X. During gaming, the original Xbox Series X runs at 167 watts, with the discless model at 156 watts and the 2TB model at 151 watts. </p><p>While a drop of up to 16 watts doesn’t sound like a lot, it will certainly make a difference for Microsoft’s Xbox Cloud Gaming power usage. Microsoft is already using Xbox Series X-like hardware in its data centers, and it’s reasonable to assume the company will use a mix of these smaller chips and redesigned cooling for efficiency purposes.</p><p>Ultimately, the redesigned internals of the new Xbox Series X models will make it less expensive for Microsoft to manufacture these consoles, and this updated hardware could make it more efficient to run Xbox Cloud Gaming servers.</p><p>The white discless Xbox Series X model goes on sale today, priced at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/d/xbox-series-x-1tb-digital-edition-white/8z1l85h2g116?activetab=pivot:overviewtab">$449.99</a>.

My name is Edwinus Evans Thirlwellus, Commander of the News Writers of the North, General of a small lonely box of unpainted Warhammer 40,000 Orc figures I was given for my 21st birthday, and loyal servant to the <em>true</em> emperor, Timmy Mallett. FATHER TO NO MURDERED SONS. HUSBAND OF NO MURDERED WIVES. OWNER OF A BRONZE SWIMMING CERTIFICATE AND A WHITE BELT IN KARATE. Eater of pizza that has fallen on the floor, like a whole minute ago! And I will have my vengeance, in this life or the next. Hah, it's much easier to make that last claim in a video game, rather than when standing in a literal circle of swords. The game in question is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dieseldome-oil-and-blood">Dieseldome: Oil And Blood</a>, and it is pretty good fun. There's a demo on Steam, for now is the time of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/event-brands/steam-next-fest">Next Fest</a>.

From "Dieseldome: Oil And Blood" you will hopefully deduce a few things. One, there is a dome. Two, the dome is full of oil - absolute lakes of the stuff, bubbling out of vast pipes in perilous proximity to wide trenches of simmering lava. Three, there is blood - here cunningly portrayed as being equivalent to oil, from which we might conclude either that Dieseldome is a searching documentary about the human cost of the climate crisis, or that you are some kind of stupid mechanical man. 
</p>
<p>
Continuing with these wanton free associations, your brain might drift to Mad Max 3: Beyond Thunderdome, aka the one with Tina Turner in. With the gibbering robot cherubs of insight nipping at your heels, your Sherlockian intellect might parkour backwards from the titular Thunderdome to its distant inspiration, the gladiatorial deathpits of Ancient Rome. Mind you, you've probably already deduced that Ancient Rome is involved from my crafty intro allusions. If you haven't - because you hate <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5i0u4jFmE78">Russell Crowe and all his works</a> - you will have no idea what I'm talking about, and I congratulate you on making it this far. OK, let's take this in an appropriately roguelikey direction and start from the beginning.
</p><p>
Dieseldome: Oil And Blood! It's an arena-based first-person shooter with roguelike power-ups. It's set in a world where "the Roman Empire never fell and instead went on to discover petrol". Good stuff! Succinct! Should have put that bit first. You are a cyborg gladiator, armed with an absolutely batshit gun that looks like a derrick having sex with a sink plunger, and you are fighting for the hearts and minds of the crowd. And also, to keep your own heart and mind inside your body. 
</p>
<p>
Helpfully, earning the crowd's affections earns you boons such as homing bullets, the ability to fart out an exploding warboi, increased chance of health drops, and some kind of homicidal clockwork eagle pal. I once parped out an exploding warboi whilst flying directly above a mad blimp covered in cyborg legionnaires, and let me tell you, I do not expect to have such a satisfying toilet experience again in this lifetime. The titular dieseldome is a crackpot Spartacan playground of ramps and runnable walls and launch pads, broken up into four zones that must be captured and defended. It's almost treacherously amenable to parkour, grabbing you by the collar and whisking you along the nearest surface at the slightest provocation. This is to your advantage, for to stay put and aim carefully is to perish. Embrace the flow! Try not to fall in the lava!
</p>
<p>
What else is there to say? Well, the tutorial demo makes it feel a bit naff at first: they slap invisible walls around you whilst teaching you to parkour, which makes zero sense. I honestly thought it was broken to begin with. My first two runs felt a bit underpopulated, a little dry. But then I broke the magic two-minute mark, and the game became respectably Doom-Eternal-esque - a question of frenzied backpedalling and strafing, strafing and backpedalling, right up to the moment when you backpedal straight into a tank.
</p>
<p>
Dieseldome doesn't have a release date yet. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2354640/DIESELDOME_Oil__Blood/">Read more on Steam</a>. "ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?" bellows Praetor Press Release, predictably but forgiveably. Yes, yes I am, for the moment, though I draw the line at "Romanpunk". Everything is punk nowadays, including things that mean the diametric opposite. There is probably such a thing as Torypunk! I can't bear to check, but I guarantee that there is!

Then, with a focus on House Va’ruun and their home planet of Va’ruun’kai, the story-based DLC launched and immediately plummeted, becoming one of Bethesda’s most poorly reviewed pieces of content to date. Within the span of a week, the expansion sat firmly in the ‘Mostly Negative’ territory on Steam, with thousands of upset fans speaking out against the lackluster DLC, poor writing, and shallow gameplay loop.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195805" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: September 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="338" data-playlist="195805,196013,195189" data-current="195805"><div><p>The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: September 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195805/195805_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195805/195805_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195805/195805_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195805/195805_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21320.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>There are, of course, many players out there—me included—who thoroughly enjoyed <em>Starfield </em>and <em>Shattered Space</em>. But it appears we’re in the minority. It’s far easier to find a negative review criticizing the game’s quest design, shallow exploration, and bland character arcs. Some say they encountered game-breaking bugs and glitches, though fortunately I didn’t experience any in my time spent on Va’ruun’kai.</p><p>One thing you’ll notice when looking through the following user reviews pulled from Steam is that, for the most part, it’s people who genuinely played the game. Sure, there are a few throughout with a handful of hours spent in <em>Starfield</em>, likely never making it past Kreet, but many have hundreds of hours. They gave Bethesda’s latest pseudo-RPG a hefty shot and found it lacking.</p><p>But as always, just because a significant part of the gaming population didn’t enjoy a game or an expansion doesn’t mean you can’t have fun with it. If you’re finding <em>Shattered Space</em> thoroughly enjoyable, then by all means, ignore the negative reviews and play the game!</p><p>Here’s a look at <em>Shattered Space</em>, as told by Steam

<p>Jagex is developing a new game set in the RuneScape Universe. </p>



<p>An open-world survival game, the new title is being built using Unreal Engine 5. The engine is a major change from the Runetek engine that is used to power RuneScape itself.</p>



<h6 id="h-read-more-gta-online-s-new-zombie-mode-brings-1-2-million-players-to-north-yankton">READ MORE: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-online-zombie-mode-ludendorff/">GTA Online’s New Zombie Mode Brings 1.2 Million Players to North Yankton</a> </h6>



<p>No other details about the game has been announced by Jagex. However, the studio is looking for players to alpha test the game.</p>



<p>“We know Jagex is at it’s best when we’re working with players, so we’re looking to recruit playtesters for our Closed Alpha,” the company posted via <a href="https://x.com/OldSchoolRS/status/1846174263348187432" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">social media</a>. </p>



<p>The Closed Alpha will only be available on PC, and “spaces are limited”, per Jagex. Those who <a href="https://jagex.questionpro.eu/a/TakeSurvey?tt=fvWINaQQ3dp1DM5vUztb3Q%3D%3D&amp;&amp;src=X" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wish to sign up</a> need to have active Discord and Steam accounts, as well. </p>



<p>Jagex was sold in February 2024 for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jagex-billion-dollar-buyout/">a reported $1.1 billion</a> to CVC Capital Partners. A new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jagex-billion-dollar-buyout/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chairman was then appointed</a> in March 2024.</p>



<p>At the time of his appointing as chairman, Marc Allera said that he was “looking forward” to helping achieve the goals and plans for RuneScape, Old School RuneScape, and “other titles”.</p>



<p>Are you going to sign up to playtest Jagex’s new open-world survival game based on RuneScape? Let us know in the comments or join the discussion in the official Insider Gaming Forums.</p>

            <p>Xbox and Bethesda will be sponsoring the BWT Alpine F1 team at this year's United States F1 Grand Prix with Indiana Jones-themed race cars.</p>
<p>The race takes place this weekend in Austin, Texas, with the collaboration ahead of Bethesda's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-everything-we-know-9408">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> out in December.</p>
<p>Both the cars and race suits worn by drivers Pierre Gasly and Esteban Ocon for the whole race weekend will feature "intricate details inspired by the game" including a map and other branded elements, reads an <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/10/15/indiana-jones-great-circle-f1-livery-xbox-alpine/?ocid=Parterships_soc_omc_xbo_tw_Video_lrn_10.15.3">Xbox Wire blog post</a>.</p>

<p>"Working with the Xbox team to bring alive the incredible Indiana Jones and the Great Circle livery for the United States Grand Prix has been fantastic," said Oliver Oakes, BWT Alpine Formula One Team, team principal.</p>
<p>"The new look will be right at home in the Austin setting this weekend. In the past year, our partnership with Xbox has reached new heights and this is our biggest activation yet. There's even more to come and I'm looking forward to getting my hands on a copy of the game when it comes out."</p>
<p>The Alpine team teased the collaboration earlier this week, with a truck travelling across the country. Here's a video of the journey and a look at the cars.</p>

<p>The blog post from Xbox states "for the first time in F1 history, a video game will be fully integrated with an F1 team", though it seems to be forgetting <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bizarrely-atlus-will-sponsor-haas-for-this-weeks-f1-singapore-grand-prix-in-honour-of-metaphor-refantazio">Atlus got there first a few weeks ago to celebrate the launch of Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>.</p>
<p>Now admittedly, Atlus simply had some extra logos rather than a new design, but they also had the Hulkenberg link so the collaboration made a bit more sense.</p>
<p>Can this new look inspire Alpine to victory? The new cars may be a striking orange-gold, but they won't be mistaken for McLaren at the back of the pack.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/15/life-is-strange-double-exposure-preview-alternative-time-travel/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Time is a concept that mankind has grappled with for… well… a long time. Is it just another dimension? Is it something that we perceive differently to other unknowable beings? Can it be manipulated? Certainly, that last one was proven true within the original <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/10/21/life-is-strange-episode-5-season-review/">Life Is Strange</a> some 11 years ago. A stand-out moment for interactive fiction and storytelling, Max Caulfield’s tale was personal, fantastical and overwhelmingly emotional, and in the process, completely rewrote developer Don’t Nod’s fortunes. We’ve since had a decade of those personal, unique stories, with sequels and off-shoots populating this world with a vibrant and diverse set of characters and journeys. Now, Deck Nine is ready to complete this particular time loop, returning once more to Max Caulfield’s tale in Life is Strange: Double Exposure.</p>
<p><iframe title="Life is Strange: Double Exposure – Announce Trailer (ESRB)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TOYz4NCFIXg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Just as with the original, music plays a huge part of the game’s appeal, and any preview that has you sitting at the opening screen just to listen to the song has chosen the right tone. Each chapter’s music is listed below the title, just in case you weren’t sure just how important it is to the game’s feel.</p>


<p>We join Max and her friend Safi as they indulge in a spot of urban exploration, breaking into a run-down bowling alley and taking pictures of the debris and decay littering it. It’s more on-rails than you might expect, with specific points of interest and the option to take snapshots appearing at select moments, rather than simply letting you loose in the space. Still, that control means that the conversation between Max and Safi feels natural and well-timed, without cluttering up the world with unnecessary interactions.</p>
<p>That specificity leads to having to interact with each point of interest before you can move the story on, at times making conversational choices, at others taking a picture. It’s a slow pace, but one that lets you get a feel for the characters, and for the world that we’re being reintroduced to.</p>


<p>As college students, Max and her friends’ conversation is suitably hip, cool, and natural, and just as the first game did, helps to put you firmly into Max’s shoes. In the process, you learn about her journey from saviour to traveller and finally to photography student. You can also choose her outfits, and influence her love life, though this isn’t voyeurism, it’s pure character-building. I’d forgotten how much Max’s story had meant to me originally, and rejoining her here was both a step backwards and forward in time.</p>
<p>That is, of course, an underlying notion, given the first game’s use of time, with Max’s powers of time manipulation lost to her at the outset of Double Exposure. It feels from the off that’s unlikely to stay the case for very long, and soon enough tragedy strikes, a murder completely upending Max’s world, providing the trauma needed to reawaken her powers and present them in some all-new ways.</p>
<p>Max is now able to rip the world back and forth, shifting between two distinct timelines, trying to prevent what happens in one from happening in the other, and figuring out what just happened. It’s a compelling way of tackling this style of mystery.</p>

<p>Visually, eleven years of technological improvements has helped to make Life is Strange Double Exposure a clear step up for the series, with a greater level of accuracy to both the characters and the spaces they exist in. The artwork that populates the first two locations is amazing, and it’s a further aspect of the series that’s well represented here.</p>
<p>Art, music, storytelling, emotion. The four key components of Life is Strange are here in full effect, and the return to Max’s story is hugely exciting after the time apart. We can’t wait to see where Deck Nine is going to take her, and us.</p>
<p><em>Life is Strange: Double Exposure is launching in full on 29th October, but those who pre-order with the Ultimate Edition are able to leap into the game from today, 15th October, and play chapters 1 &amp; 2.&nbsp;</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-mod-31-performance-improvement/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The latest version of one of the best Silent Hill 2 mods available online brings significant performance improvements with a minimal visual downgrade.</p>
<p>The 2.3 version of the Essentials mod by Hybred brings a 31% performance increase with its Balanced preset with minimal downgrade to visuals. Other presets offer better visuals at worse performance and even massive performance boosts of up to 99% with massive changes to visuals, allowing a wide range of system configurations to run the game with acceptable performance. You can download the mod from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/silenthill2/mods/23?tab=description">Nexus Mods.</a></p>
<p>Unfortunately, no mod is currently capable of fully addressing the stuttering issues that plague the Silent Hill 2 remake on PC.&nbsp;<span>As highlighted in a&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-pc-is-yet-another-unreal-engine-case-of-stutter-struggle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent analysis</a>, the game suffers from traversal stutters that are way too common in Unreal Engine 5 games and significantly impact the experience. It is a shame, considering how the Bloober Team exceeded all expectations with the game, as Chris highlighted</span>&nbsp;in his<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/"> review.</a></p>
<p><em>Silent Hill 2 is the best game Bloober Team has made. A faithful reimagining of the original, bringing it to the modern day without losing what made the original the best horror game ever, using modern game mechanics to improve where they could, and expanding on what was already an engrossing world. Without any shadow of a doubt, a resounding success, one that will likely come as a surprise to many.</em></p>
<p>Silent Hill 2 is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide.</p>

In addition to <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>, which only returned to the service this past May, <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> is also departing. That one stings, since I just started the first game with my kids over the weekend. Here’s the full list of 16 games leaving in October:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> (PS4)</li></ul></blockquote><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas - The Definitive Edition</em> (PS4 | PS5)</li><li><em>Teardown</em> (PS5)</li><li><em>Chorus </em>(PS4 | PS5)</li><li><em>Dragon’s Dogma: Dark Arisen </em>(PS4)</li><li><em>What Remains of Edith Finch </em>(PS4 | PS5)</li><li><em>Overcooked! 2</em> (PS4)</li><li><em> Superliminal </em>(PS4 | PS5)</li><li><em>Blasphemous</em> (PS4)</li><li><em>Moving Out</em> (PS4)</li><li><em>Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 + 2.5 ReMIX </em>(PS4)</li><li><em>Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue</em> (PS4)</li><li><em>Kingdom Hearts III </em>(PS4)</li><li><em>Kingdom Hearts: Melody of Memory </em>(PS4)</li><li><em>Mobile Suit Gundam Extreme Vs. Maxiboost On</em> (PS4)</li><li><em>Eiyuden Chronicle: Rising </em>(PS4 | PS5)</li><li><em>The Sims 4 City Living</em> [DLC]</li></ul></blockquote><p><em>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</em> is another noticeable departure. <em>Blasphemous</em> and <em>What Remains of Edith Finch </em>are both exceptional. <em>Teardown</em> is a surprisingly fun voxel-based destruction sim. <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>’s latest tour will have lasted only six months. And the<em> Kingdom Hearts </em>saga marks the latest wave of Square Enix RPGs to leave PS Plus. </p><p>Players have <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/1fnk0n6/here_are_the_games_that_are_likely_to_leave_in/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/1fnk0n6/here_are_the_games_that_are_likely_to_leave_in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">actually gotten quite good at predicting</a></span> which games will leave PS Plus when based on the six, 12, and 18-month cycles that most companies seem to sign deals for. Based on those metrics, fans were predicting that<em> Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart </em>and <em>Humanity </em>might not be long for PS Plus either. Seems like they’re here to stay for now. Consider this your six-month warning to play them if you haven’t already. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
