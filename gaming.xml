              <p>Fall is nearly here. People around my place are putting up Halloween decorations already. I’m leaving my windows open and going outside more. But I’ll try to stay in and enjoy some of the new games being added to the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog this month, like <em>The Invincible </em>and <em>Persona 5 Tactica.</em></p> <p><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/10/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-september-wwe-2k25-persona-5-tactica-green-hell-fate-samurai-remnant-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">On September 10, PlayStation officially announced</a> the next round of PS Plus Extra and Premium games that will be added to the subscription service’s game catalog. All of these newly revealed games will be available to start downloading and playing on September 16.</p> <p>I’m really happy to see <a href="https://kotaku.com/crow-country-indie-survival-horror-review-1851462202"><em>Crow Country</em> on here. This indie lo-fi retro survival horror game</a> caught my attention last year when it launched, but I never got around to playing it because there were (and still are) too many damn games. That made me sad, but now that it’s waiting for me on my PS5 as we enter Spooky Season, I’m going to try and play it. Another horror game included here, <em>Conscript</em>, also seems like a perfect Halloween game. Heck, even<em> Legacy of Kain: Defiance, </em>this month’s classic game<em>,</em> has some creepy, gothic horror vibes, too.&nbsp; If PlayStation is giving out two horror games in September, I’m hopeful that next month’s offerings will include even more spooky titles!</p>

 <p>Remember, to access, download, and play these games, you’ll need to be an active PS Plus Extra or Premium tier subscriber. Essential tier subscribers don’t get access to the game catalog. And if your subscription runs out in the future, you’ll no longer be able to play these games.</p> <p>Anyway, here’s the full list of games being added to PS Plus and its various tiers next week:</p> <h2>PlayStation Plus Extra And Premium</h2> <ul> <li><em>WWE 2K25</em> – PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>Persona 5 Tactica </em>– PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>Green Hell&nbsp;</em>– PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>Fate/Samurai Remnant&nbsp;</em>– PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>Crow Country – </em>PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>The Invincible – </em>PS5</li> <li><em>Conscript –&nbsp;</em>PS5</li> </ul> <h2><strong>PlayStation Plus Premium Only</strong></h2> <ul> <li><em>Legacy of Kain: Defiance –&nbsp;</em>PS5, PS4</li> </ul>

                <p>Rougelike deckbuilders aren't exactly a rarity, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-fable-manga-build-roguelike/" data-ref-id="5000-644496">The Fable: Manga Build Roguelike</a>, due out in November, is far from typical for the genre--in this game, you'll be able to build your own manga fight scenes.</p><p>The Fable: Manga Build Roguelike is an adaptation of sorts of Katsuhisa Minami's The Fable series, which follows a hitman known as "The Fable" as he tries to lie low and live a normal life for a year. That, predictably, doesn't go exactly as planned.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R397YlcIggo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/R397YlcIggo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Given the popularity of Sega's Like A Dragon series (formerly known as Yakuza in the West), a franchise also focused on a former Japanese mobster who gets pulled back into a life of crime, The Fable does seem ripe for a video game adaptation.</p><p dir="ltr">However, this is far from a straight adaptation. Featuring actual panels from the manga, the game instead uses The Fable's striking action panels like a deck of cards. To battle, players place an assortment of manga panels, each with properties like attack, defense, and move, into a certain order before watching a battle unfold according to the panels played.</p><p dir="ltr">There will be three characters, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, that players can use to create scenes. Series protagonist Akira is a highly skilled hitman capable of dealing damage up close and from a distance with firearms. His sister Yoko can surprise enemies with ambushes, while the hitman Suzuki specializes in traps and debuffs. Over time, players can upgrade their manga deck to make certain panels even more powerful.</p><p dir="ltr">Those looking for a challenge can take on the game's Puzzle Mode featuring one-page battle challenges, or play through scenes from the original manga reimagined as minigames.</p><p dir="ltr">"Not only will fans of the series enjoy it, but even those unfamiliar with the series can feel the same tension and ingenuity of battles that the manga delivers," developer Mono said in a press release.</p><p dir="ltr">Publisher Kodansha, which is also publishing The Fable: Manga Build Roguelike, began releasing English volumes of The Fable in 2024. The Fable: Manga Build Roguelike launches on PC via Steam and Nintendo Switch on November 5.</p>

<figure><a title="Pikmin" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3f52e354378f9/pikmin.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Motoi Okamoto, a former developer at Nintendo and now steward for the <strong>Silent Hill</strong> franchise at Konami, has taken to <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/at-nintendo-every-developer-is-a-director-if-you-make-excuses-you-get-removed-from-the-team-motoi-okamoto-says/">social media</a> to comment on whether game directors might be considered "incompetent" if they're unable to judge new ideas without first implementing them.</p>
<p>As covered by <a href="https://x.com/obakemogura/status/1964258913957925205">Automaton</a>, Okamoto – who worked on games such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/pikmin">Pikmin</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/luigis_mansion">Luigi's Mansion</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/wii_play">Wii Play</a> – describes a culture at Nintendo in which "everyone is a director", thus giving team members the agency to make decisions that might improve a game.</p><div><figure data-videoid="2FTBspZymlg" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38e8b0mkvzsx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTBspZymlg" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>He also says that implementing ideas and playtesting them is crucial to making a solid, fun product. As such, programmers who make excuses for not doing this – whether it be due to deadlines or monetary reasons – will be "removed from development teams without hesitation".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I’ve been seeing some takes along the lines of, ‘Can’t you tell whether a game specification is good or bad without implementing?’ and ‘Directors who can’t judge without implementation are incompetent.’ But at Nintendo, implementing and playtesting is precisely what matters – they don’t make decisions based on what they see on paper.</p>
<p>"Programmers who are lazy about implementing things, and project managers and programmers who try to avoid the trial-and-error process using deadlines and budget restraints as an excuse are removed from development teams without hesitation.</p>
<p>"If a programmer finds a spec boring, they’re free to just implement it in a way they believe will make it entertaining. That’s what professional game programmers do. It's a culture where everyone is a director."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He follows up by saying that Shigeru Miyamoto and Satoru Iwata, who are considered to be "sages" within the industry, maintained a very hands-on approach when it came to developing games, concluding that it's "plain arrogance" for some to make judgements without testing new ideas.</p>
<p>It's an interesting glimpse into the development culture at Nintendo, although it's worth considering that things might have changed slightly since Okamoto left. Still, ensuring new ideas are tested thoroughly to analyse their validity is a solid way to work.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Chief Rebel and Arc Games announced a slight delay to the early access launch date of <a href="https://wccftech.com/fellowship-hands-on-and-qa-a-game-all-about-mmo-like-dungeons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fellowship</a>, the 'multiplayer online dungeon adventure game'. It was <a href="https://wccftech.com/fellowship-early-access-release-date-october-open-beta-september/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously set for October 9</a>, but it'll now be available on Steam starting on October 16.</p>



<p>In the video below, Community Director Hamish Bode explained: </p>



<p><em>We made the decision recently to push back that early access date just a week. It's not a huge change, and I know that we all want to get in and play the game as soon as possible, but hopefully we can hold out just one more week. There are a couple of big reasons why we decided to do that. One, it gives the team a bunch more opportunities to implement all of the polish that they want to do. We've been privately play testing the game as you know, and we've made some pretty giant changes to the game that we really want to make sure are completely nailed down before we open the floodgates of early access. But there is a really big elephant in the room and we've always made the promise that we'll be as transparent with you as we can absolutely be. And that week is absolutely stacked with games, right? You've got things like <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-october10-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 launching</a>. I know people are looking at Legion Remix as well. It's just kind of a smart decision for us to push a week and give Fellowship the best possibility of getting recognized and hopefully getting the attention that I think we all agree that it deserves.</em></p>

</p></figure>



<p>The Fellowship Open Beta test will kick off on Steam on Thursday, September 18 and end on Tuesday, September 23. The servers will open and close at 10 AM Pacific Time. Supported regions include North America, Europe, and Asia. Players will be able to experience seven heroes, including two tanks, three DPS, and two healers. They can go on dungeon runs, both ranked and quick play, and take on challenging enemies to acquire epic loot. Compared to the Steam Next Fest demo from February, the Open Beta will introduce new gameplay systems, including a fresh take on matchmaking and group finding and an engaging progression system with weapons, gems, talents, crafting, legendary items, and more. </p>



<p>The Open Beta will also introduce a new dungeon, Urrak Markets, and new gameplay features, such as cosmetic customization. There will also be new gear, new mounts, and visual element improvements, as well as improvements to previous gameplay mechanics based on Steam Next Fest player feedback. Lastly, it will be a chance for the development team to test the improvements made to multiplayer matchmaking before the early access release.</p>

			<p>PlayStation has <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/10/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-september-wwe-2k25-persona-5-tactica-green-hell-fate-samurai-remnant-and-more/">announced</a> the games getting added to the PS Plus Extra and PS Plus Premium game catalogs for September 2025, which include titles like Green Hell, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/persona-5-tactica-review/">Persona 5 Tactica</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wwe-2k25/">WWE 2K25</a>.</p>



<p>If you are subscribed to the top-tier Premium level of PlayStation Plus, then you'll have eight new games to check out between both the PlayStation Plus Extra and PlayStation Plus Premium Classic's game catalogs. If you just have the middle-level PlayStation Plus Extra subscription, then you're getting seven new games in total.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-extra-premium-august-2025-mortal-kombat-1-marvels-spider-man-remastered/">Last month's additions</a> included games like Mortal Kombat 1 and Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered, along with a brand-new release of Sword and the Sea, which launched into the service. By comparison, this month is definitely far more hampered down, featuring four fewer titles and no brand-new launches.</p>



<p>Beyond the aforementioned titles, other notable inclusions for this month are the indie darling Crow's Country, the survival horror game Conscript, and The Invincible. The game getting added to the PS Plus Premium Classic's catalog this month is Legacy of Kain: Defiance.</p>

The bar for getting me to write up a new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> has never been higher. I don't care how many twists you throw into the formula, developers. I don't care how imaginatively you have reinvented the wheel of permadeath and unlocks. I am tired of this genre/wantonly adhesive cultural phenomenon. I wish for it to die in shame and ignominy.</p>
<p>You've made a roguelike in which attacks are performed by assembling a manga page, you say? Well... go on then. Here's a trailer for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-fable-manga-build-roguelike">The Fable: Manga Build Roguelike</a>.

"Each turn, you receive new panels," developers Mono Entertainment <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3187880/_Manga_Build_Roguelike/">explain on Steam</a>. "Placing them on the page creates your action sequence. Place panels according to the situation, build the ultimate page, and defeat your enemies!"</p>
<p>Taking damage tears holes in the paper, and you can't plug manga scenes into holes, so you'll ideally nobble all your enemies in a single turn, before they strike back. It would be lovely if the pages you assemble made sense and flowed properly as in an actual manga - it looks like there's some repetition, going by the trailer.
</p><p>
How do you unlock new varieties of panel for combat? By means of, amongst other things, "surreal little mini-game events", such as barbecuing fish and confronting bears, possibly because the bears are trying to eat your fish. There are three characters who together form a Streets Of Ragey ensemble. Akira is a hitman who likes guns and punching. Yoko is good at mobile attacks - behold her teleporting in the trailer. And Suzuki is some other kind of assassin who can lay traps.
</p>
<p>
There's a puzzle mode which gives you a limited selection of panels with which to complete an encounter, and a bonus mode in which Yoko and some "playboy" called Yuki have a drinking competition. I cannot read the Japanese dialogue in the gifs, so I can't currently give you any sense of whether Yuki is a massive creep, but odds seem fair.
</p>
<p>Some additional background: Mono Entertainment were founded by a New York University design graduate, and are also the creators of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2393890/IGNISTONE/">Ignistone</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2812120/Clock_Rogue/">Clock Rogue</a>. "The Fable" is an actual manga series published by Kodansha, with millions of readers: it's about a super-assassin capable of killing anybody in six seconds, who is trying to live a normal life at his boss's instruction.</p>
<p>
I've just realised that this is one of those dang deckbuilders as well - the manga panels are effectively cards, innit. Those fiends! They snuck that one right by me. Anyway, this one's launching on 5th November, and there's a demo on the way.

              <p><span>I’m always saying that Raichu, the evolution of </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>’s mascot, is a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-raichu-alolan-pikachu-anime-1851011570"><span>constant target of disrespect</span></a><span> from both The Pokémon Company and the community at large. Well, now some collectors with far more expendable cash than I’ll ever fathom are in a high-stakes bidding war to buy one of the electric mouse’s rarest cards. The fabled “Prerelease Raichu” card is up for auction, and the bids have already surpassed six figures.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000624736" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624736"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624736">© Heritage Auctions</figcaption></figure> <p><span>For those that don’t know, the “Prerelease Raichu” card is the stuff of legend. According to reports dating back to the late ’90s, around 11 copies of the original Raichu card with “PRERELEASE” text stamped in the corner of the artwork were accidentally produced by Wizards of the Coast employees. These cards were mixed in with pre-release Clefable cards that were given out at events in the ’90s, and they were supposed to have been destroyed, though a few were supposedly saved by WOTC workers. Back in 2023, CGC Cards </span><a href="https://www.cgccards.com/news/article/12277/"><span>certified two of the Raichu cards</span></a><span>, confirming that they were indeed legitimate. Now, one of these legendary cards is up for auction on </span><a href="https://comics.ha.com/itm/memorabilia/trading-cards/pokemon-raichu-14-unlimited-base-set-prerelease-psa-trading-card-game-ex-mt-6-wizards-of-the-coast-1999-holo-rare/a/7424-36062.s?ic4=GalleryView-ShortDescription-071515"><span>Heritage Auctions</span></a><span>, and as of this writing, its current bid is a whopping $135,000.</span></p> <p><span>It’s certainly not the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/logan-pauls-latest-stunt-paying-6-million-for-rare-pi-1848743633"><span>most money anyone’s ever paid for a </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>card</span></a><span>, but it is a pretty cool piece of history that probably should go somewhere other than a WOTC employee’s attic. As of right now, only a couple of these rare misprints are accounted for. It’s entirely possible some of these Raichu cards have been lost or destroyed in the past 25 years, but at least someone might be able to save and preserve one of them. Someone with more money than I’ll probably see in this lifetime. What do you think it’s like to be so rich you can just drop six figures on a </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>card? At least it’s being spent on my underappreciated favorite. $135,000 isn’t nearly enough for you, Raichu. Someone raise the bid. Put your money where your mouth is.</span></p>

              <p>After seven long years, <i>Hollow Knight: Silksong</i> has finally left the realm of games we’re always hoping to see at some event or showcase. Silkpost no more. We can all finally play <i>Silksong–</i>and for just 20 bucks at that!</p> <p>With a few days of playtime under their belts, folks have flocked to the internet to opine, elating over finally getting to play such a long-awaited game, and despairing over a surprisingly steeper learning curve than some were expecting.</p> <p>So let’s turn our attention to the Steam reviews section of <i>Hollow Knight: Silksong</i> to see how it’s faring with the chorus.</p> <p>At the time of writing, <i>Silksong</i> is enjoying a “Very Positive” status for its English-language reviews. Fans have rushed in to share their enthusiasm for the long-awaited game. Those who aren’t as excited, as you might expect, are frustrated with not merely the difficulty, but how various challenges seem to feel like unfair “gotcha” moments. Many positive reviews, however, echo back that the game is much more manageable once you get deeper into the story and have amassed some more powerful skills.</p> <p>So let’s jump into some standout reviews, both of the silly and (somewhat) useful kind.</p> <hr> <figure id="attachment_2000624693" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624693"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624693">©

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Modern action cinema owes a lot to <em>The Raid</em> and <em>John Wick</em> as mythic revenge arcs littered with bone-crunchingly innovative action choreography that reshaped the genre. But somewhere along the way, their imitators forgot that martial arts movies used to be fun. Not just thrilling, but <em>fun</em>. Jackie Chan wasn’t scowling through grief; he was juggling inanimate objects and sliding down Christmas decorations. Jet Li cracked jokes between kicks. Bruce Lee had comedic swagger and soul mixed into his wataahs. Their films weren’t all Greek tragedies like today’s action cinema; they were action comedies, and they were glorious. Enter <em>Baby Assassins</em>.</p><p>While rewatching <em>The Raid</em>, finding myself nostalgically starved for old school action cinema, I stumbled upon <a href="https://tubitv.com/movies/100008053/baby-assassins" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Baby Assassins</em></a> on Tubi. This Japanese action comedy film trilogy didn’t just scratch my itch; it, and its upcoming Prime Video miniseries <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt32848814/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Baby Assassins: Everyday</em></a>, is my new obsession.&nbsp;</p><p>Directed and written by Yugo Sakamoto, <em>Baby Assassins</em> follows two assassins, Chisato Sugimoto (Akari Takaishi) and Mahiro Fukagawa (Saori Izawa), who are tasked with playing housemates to strengthen their work chemistry while partnered for their guild’s contract killings. The only problem is they’re both very different brands of weird girls who mix like oil and water. Mahiro, the hand-to-hand specialist, is a soft-spoken, game-obsessed, L Lawliet-type who struggles to make normal conversation without sounding so matter-of-fact that she might as well be an alien on her first day pretending to be human. Meanwhile, Chisato is a loud, extroverted gremlin of a girl who says whatever’s on her mind.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="BABY ASSASSINS Official Trailer | Criminal Action Martial Arts Adventure | Directed by Hugo Sakomoto" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M8OP0LM0lEg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Basically, <em>Baby Assassins</em> is an unofficial live-action adaptation of <a href="https://kotaku.com/video/lycoris-recoil-a1-pictures-john-wick-anime-1849350169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Lycoris Recoil</em></a>, a cute girls do hitman things anime by Cloverworks that <a href="https://x.com/Kojima_Hideo/status/1891804044974490108" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hideo Kojima</a>, acclaimed cinephile, <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2022-07-29/metal-gear-creator-stumbles-upon-lycoris-recoil-and-loves-it/.188097" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accidentally stumbled upon</a> and is <a href="https://x.com/AniNewsAndFacts/status/1840646611522789455" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rightfully obsessed with</a>. However, by the time I hit the second film, <em>Baby Assassins 2: Babies</em> (my favorite one), the series went further beyond <em>Lycoris Recoil</em>'s levels of “Are they?” sapphic underpinnings and went <a href="https://aftermath.site/green-yuri-nana-shojo-girls-love" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full-blown <em>Nana</em></a><em> </em>with how gay gay homosexual gay Chisato and Mahiro are for one another.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Baby Assassins: Nice Days | Epic Gun-Fu Fight Scene | 1080p" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YNTIDLj3XCw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Throughout the trilogy, I witnessed their dynamic evolve in real time from “stay out of my way” begrudging coworker to mutual-chin-cupping-to-wipe-away-blood-smears from each other's cheeks, intimate “don’t die on me” forehead-touching, and making goofy faces at each other during waist-high shootouts. The trilogy’s narrative arcs, which make up a majority of their runtime, boil down to “We try to get normal jobs. We try to pay rent on time. We try to enjoy our workcation birthday party without catching stray bullets.” It’s essentially a workplace wives version of <em>Meals on Wheels</em>, ditching the sigma male stoicism of <em>Wick</em>-clones for whimsy, cringe, and fruity roommate chaos.&nbsp;</p><figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><span><figure><figcaption>There is no heterosexual explanation for this. </figcaption></figure></span></figure><p>Instead of perpetuating the <em>Wick</em>-ification of action cinema, <em>Baby Assassins</em> mocks it. The girls openly clown on edgy one-liner villains and one-dimensional tough guys, calling out their cringeworthy lines in real time. As someone raised on Lee’s philosophy, Chan’s slapstick, and Li’s charm, <em>Baby Assassins</em> was a breath of fresh air because it’s rich with low-stakes hijinks and hard-hitting action choreography with coveted long shots to let its stunt crew, especially Izawa, show off their stuff uninhibited. All the while, it’s an action comedy that doesn’t take itself too seriously.&nbsp;</p><p>And, most importantly, the action slaps. Each film’s finale fight scene is like a hearty dessert at the end of a four-course meal—long takes, inventive choreography, and zero-overediting to be found. In fact, Mahiro’s stunt work is so phenomenal that <em>John Wick 4</em> director Chad Stahelski <a href="https://x.com/fuforthought_/status/1710257143264247949" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tapped her to do stunts for Rina Sawayama as Akira</a>. Takaishi, meanwhile, brings her anime stage production chops from <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/jibaku-shonen-hanako-kun-the-musical/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Toilet-bound Hanako-kun</em></a>, <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/fate-grand-order-the-stage-the-grand-temple-of-time-solomon-ars-nova/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Fate/Grand Order</em></a>, and <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/stage-play-demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Demon Slayer</em></a> to the role of Chisato, enriching her gun-girl persona with “oh, you know ball” levels of otaku insight and deep-pull observations. Chisato is also just based about most things, like Twitter being a hellhole.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Tubi/Shibuya Productions</span></figcaption></figure><p>Action movies could stand to be less of a downer, and <em>Baby Assassins</em> is the cure.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://newzoo.com/">Newzoo</a>, the global data firm that tracks videogame industry sales data and <a href="https://wccftech.com/20-of-worlds-gamers-drive-nearly-half-global-gaming-spend-north-america-europe-newzoo/">market trends</a> has published its <a href="https://newzoo.com/resources/trend-reports/newzoo-global-games-market-report-2025">Global Games Market Report for 2025</a>, which includes plenty of interesting trends and predictions from Newzoo, and also reveals that it'll be videogame consoles, not mobile, that leads the growth in this year's videogame market, thanks to a boost from the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>One of the major headlines in the report is that the videogame industry will reach $188.8 billion in revenue in 2025, a 3.4% growth compared to 2024. For the mobile portion of the market, it'll generate $103 billion this year, a 2.9% growth from last year, with mobile games still representing the biggest chunk of the industry's revenue at 55%.</p>



<p>Another interesting layer Newzoo points out is that videogame players will make up 60% of the world's population, with 3 billion players on mobile, 936 million on PC, and 645 million on consoles, making for a total of 3.58 billion players across all gaming platforms worldwide.</p>



<p>A chunk of those will, of course, be playing on Nintendo Switch 2, but even with consoles driving revenue this year, mobile players are still the dominating force when it comes to the worldwide videogame playing population.</p>



<p>Newzoo also includes predictions for what the industry will look like in the next three years, saying that by 2028, the total market revenue will grow to $206.5 billion, with consoles predicted to have the biggest growth, not just from new hardware, but new major game releases like the coming Grand Theft Auto VI launch. Between consoles, PC, and mobile, Newzoo predicts consoles will have the most revenue growth at 4.7%.</p>



<p>Newzoo's player predictions for 2028 have console players growing to 688 million, and PC players passing the 1 billion mark for the first time in the industry's history. However, mobile players will still grow the by the largest amount, and at a faster rate than PC and console player growth.</p>



<p>"<em>2025 shows a market that's maturing - but no stagnating</em>," Newzoo writes in its concluding thoughts. "<em>Growth is there, it's just harder won. The winners will be the ones who lean into timing, retention, and ecosystem strength, not just the raw pursuit of new players</em>."</p>

            <p>
Look, we all know <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a> is a weird little series. You can torture your Sims, meet fairies and werewolves and vampires, have half alien babies. So I feel like I shouldn't be all that surprised by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4's</a> next expansion pack, Adventure Awaits, seeing the return of imaginary friends. And yet here I am, taken aback and slightly horrified by the game's interpretation of imaginary friends in its first gameplay trailer.
</p>
<p>
I truly find them existentially uncomfortable. Imaginary friends come in the shape of four different dolls that can morph into humanoid creatures that will keep your Sim child company if no one else will. You can choose between four different personalities for them too, which includes Goofball, Creative, Competitive, and funniest of all, straight up Evil.

</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGUB3nrq4ec" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>


<p>
Worst of all, if your Sim child bonds with the imaginary friend enough, they can Pinocchio-style turn into a real human. A lot of ethical questions being raised here I'm not confident the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">simulation</a> game will answer, and quite honestly I don't know if I'd want them around my own kids (NB: I don't have any, but let's imagine I do for this joke to land).
</p><p>
That's not what the expansion pack is solely about, though, in fact it's mostly not about getting your children to create human life. Adventure Awaits also introduces three new neighbourhoods for your Sims to explore, with activities like fishing in mountain streams, sharing campfire stories, or just having a romantic retreat. This comes with a new feature, Scheduling Getaway, which allows your Sims to plan weekend trips or summer holidays. Alternatively, with the game's new Custom Venues and Getaway System, you can make your own getaway spots for your Sims to hang out in.
</p>
<p>
At least those retreats sound like a nice reprieve from the horrors presented by the imaginary friends. In any case, Adventure Awaits is out October 2nd, so you don't have to wait very long.

            <p>Have you brought batteries for your torch? Good. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>'s Deep of the Night update's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreigns-evil-deep-of-night-mode-gets-a-release-date-but-some-people-are-already-playing-it">primed to arrive in the wee hours of tomorrow, September 11th</a>, and there's a pretty hefty balancing patch to dissect before it arrives.</p>

Well, maybe concerned is the best way to put it. You see, the word increased is used an awful lot in relation to stuff you can do hurt an enemy. That seems fishy. Just what have you got planned to make lives miserable again once Deep of the Night drops at 2:30AM BST, FromSoft?</p>

<p>Let's start with version 1.02.2's batch of changes to each of the Nightfarer classes aside from Ironeye, who's presumably been left out because he must already be perfect. Wylder's gained more poise while casting claw shot, which now dishes out more stamina damage to blocking foes. The strength and dexterity gains Guardian earns on levelling up have been boosted, as has the range of their steel guard passive.</p><p>Duchess' dexterity gain on level up has also risen, some of her dagger attacks are more powerful, and her finale ultimate art has had its duration lengthened. The trade-off is a decrease in her two-handed dagger’s second heavy attack damage. Raider's greataxe and great hammer-induced stagger, Recluse's Magic Cocktail spells, and Executor's cursed sword attacks have all gotten more effective. Oh, and you can now walk straight through Revenant’s spirits, Helen and Frederick. I'm not sure whether that last one counts as a buff or nerf - let's call it a quirk.</p>
<p>On top of that, the stagger damage inflicted by dual-wielded jump attacks has been boosted across the board for small and medium arms, while it's been dialled down for larger weapons.</p>
<p>Flipping across to the everdark sovereigns, the famously tough Equilibrious Beast has gotten the most adjustments. "We have confirmed an issue where condemned Nightfarers summoned during this fight may not be rendered under specific conditions," Fromsoft also note in relation to that boss, promising to address that problem down the line. Aside from that, Sentient Pest and Darkdrift Knight look to have gotten slightly more powerful.</p>
<p>The Night’s Tide will also now dish out more damage after you beat the second night boss. A PC-specific tweak worth noting is that FromSoft reckon they've improved <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-tips-tricks">Nightreign</a>'s stability "in some environments", so hopefully you'll find things run more smoothly in the Deep of the Night.</p>
<p>Right, there we go. Best of luck rolling in the deep. Assuming you've not jumped in early thanks to mods.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/anker-75w-car-charger-with-dual-device-support-goes-for-peanuts-in-a-trending-amazon-deal-stock-moving-quickly.1293840/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Forgive us for making a sweeping assumption, but we’re going to take a stab and say your car’s phone-charging situation could use a massive upgrade. Maybe your USB ports are located in that impossible to reach compartment behind the shifter, or your overly long cord is constantly getting in the way. Any shortcomings you might be dealing with are instantly fixable for a tiny price while <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4021/">Amazon is running this limited-time $25 deal on the 75W Anker Nano Car Charger</a>.</p>
<p>The Anker Nano plugs into your car’s cigarette lighter and charges two devices independently, one via the 45W built-in retractable USB-C cable, and another via the open 30W USB-C port. The retractable cable extends to 29.5 inches, so anyone in the first 2 rows of your vehicle can access it. It’s also not just for smartphones — any USB-C device from your wireless earbuds to your laptop can get a rapid charge while you drive.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4021/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>NoMore Cable Drama</h2>
<p>Finding the perfect USB-C cable to reach from your car charger to your hands-free phone mount must be some kind of dark art, because they all seem to be either too short to reach or so long that they get in the way of your car’s touchscreen or other parts of the console. The retractable USB-C cable built into the Anker Nano Car Charger is, to put it mildly, an ingenious way to keep the car’s cockpit neat and organized, and it’s tested to endure over 10,000 retractions.</p>
<p>The second port in the Anker Nano Car Charger is tailor made for the front passenger, which beats having to split charging time on long drives. No matter how you share the two fast-charging ports of the Anker Nano Car Charger, there’s enough juice to take an iPhone 15 Pro from 0% to 50% in just 25 minutes, and a 2022 MacBook Air from 0% to 50% in 34 minutes. Android devices with USB-C charging ports are also compatible.</p>



<h2>Power Delivered Safely</h2>
<p>Anker bolsters the fast-charging power of the Nano Car Charger with the safety features they are famous for. Built-in ActiveShield 3.0 technology protects your devices from damage caused by overcurrent, overvoltage, and under-voltage, and also constantly monitors its own temperature and the temperature of your devices.</p>
<p>The hardest part of this whole deal isn’t the fast charging or the even the retractable cable. It’s the price — even without this Amazon deal, the Anker Nano Car Charger’s regular price is a modest $40. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4021/">But with this limited-time deal taking that down by 38%, it’s safe to say the Anker Nano is the best $25 charger you can find.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>We’re coming up on the first anniversary of Nintendo’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/palworld-pokemon-company-lawsuit-nintendo-pocketpair-1851652124"><span>lawsuit against Pocketpair</span></a><span>, the developer of the edgy “</span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>with guns” survival game </span><i><span>Palworld</span></i><span>, on the grounds of patent infringement. Though many people called out </span><i><span>Palworld</span></i><span> for its </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-palworld-ai-art-copyright-law-pocketpair-1851186580?_gl=1*21id2z*_ga*MTk4MjkyODk2OS4xNzExNTYxOTM0*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNjcwMzk2My4xODguMS4xNzI2NzA0MDI1LjYwLjAuMA.."><span>suspiciously familiar character designs</span></a><span>, Nintendo and The Pokémon Company went after Pocketpair not for the appearance of its creatures but for </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-pokemon-palworld-patents-lawsuit-pocketpair-1851692965"><span>in-game mechanics</span></a><span>, such as aiming and firing an “item” at a character in a field to trigger combat, capturing creatures in the wild, and riding on creatures you can swap between easily in an open world. These are extremely broad and non-specific, and if Nintendo felt like it, the company could easily go after plenty of other games beyond </span><i><span>Palworld </span></i><span>on those grounds. Nintendo and The Pokémon Company aren’t done patenting vague concepts in the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>series, though, as the companies have just patented more mechanics in a development that could affect the entire monster-taming genre.</span></p> <p><a href="https://gamesfray.com/last-week-nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-received-a-u-s-patent-on-summoning-a-character-and-letting-it-fight-another/"><i><span>Games Fray</span></i></a><span>, a site dedicated to reporting on patent law and other legal issues in the video game industry, reports that Nintendo has received a U.S. patent for the mechanic of “summoning a character and letting it fight another.” The step-by-step breakdown of what this entails reads as follows:</span></p> <blockquote><p><span>(1) A non-transitory computer-readable storage medium having stored therein a game program, the game program causing a processor of an information processing apparatus to execute:</span></p> <p><span>(2) performing control of moving a player character on a field in a virtual space, based on a movement operation input;</span></p> <p><span>(3) performing control of causing a sub character to appear on the field, based on a first operation input, and</span></p> <p><span>(4) when an enemy character is placed at a location where the sub character is caused to appear, controlling a battle between the sub character and the enemy character by a first mode in which the battle proceeds based on an operation input, and</span></p> <p><span>(5) when the enemy character is not placed at the location where the sub character is caused to appear, starting automatic control of automatically moving the sub character that has appeared; and</span></p> <p><span>(6) performing control of moving the sub character in a predetermined direction on the field, based on a second operation input, and, when the enemy character is placed at a location of a designation, controlling a battle between the sub character and the enemy character by a second mode in which the battle automatically proceeds.</span></p></blockquote> <p><span>Again, this is a pretty general idea that is utilized in plenty of other games, from monster-taming rivals like </span><i><span>Digimon</span></i><span> to more general games like </span><i><span>Final Fantasy</span></i><span> that include summonable creatures. It seems unlikely that Nintendo would suddenly start going after partners like Bandai Namco or Square Enix, who have released games on Nintendo platforms without issue, but on principle, Nintendo patenting vague mechanical ideas as a means of monopolizing a genre is a shitty look, and rubs against the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>franchise’s image as something wholesome and joyful. Not that the facade hasn’t already fallen multiple times at this point. The Pokémon Company has so many problems with things like the quality of its games and with making decisions that enable scalpers to capitalize on its merchandise, problems it never really addresses because it’s too successful to fail. It sure has time to patent fairly standard video game mechanics to help it corner the market, though.</span></p> <p><span>The </span><i><span>Palworld </span></i><span>lawsuit is ongoing, though Nintendo did </span><a href="https://screenrant.com/nintendo-palworld-lawsuit-update-pantents/"><span>make some changes to the phrasing of the suit</span></a><span> back in July.</span></p>

      </div>
<p>Kojima is personally hosting the event, but we don't know yet what will be discussed.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pacific-drive-whispers-in-the-woods-expansion</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pacific-drive-whispers-in-the-woods-expansion-promises-new-secrets-and-more-this-year.1293792/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Pacific Drive&nbsp;</em>developer Ironwood Studios and publisher Kepler Interactive have announced&nbsp;<em>Whispers in the Woods</em>, a brand new DLC expansion that will introduce new story elements, new anomalies, and much more.</p>

<p><em>Whispers in the Woods</em>, which is due out sometime this year, is distinct from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pacific-drive-endless-expeditions-update" rel="nofollow">previous</a> free <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pacific-drive-update-customization" rel="nofollow">updates</a> for the driving roguelike; it looks like it'll be a fully paid expansion that will bring a significant amount of new content to the game.</p>

<p>Per its Steam page,&nbsp;<em>Whispers in the Woods</em>&nbsp;will bring a new "8-12-hour story" to&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive</em>, and it'll be fully voiced as well, with new characters to get to know. Not only that, but you can jump into the expansion from either a new or an existing save, so even if you have a save file that's close to the game's conclusion, you can still play.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pacific-drive-whispers-in-the-woods-mist.jpg?itok=E0dd8I5w 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pacific-drive-whispers-in-the-woods-mist.jpg?itok=puW9ZR4G 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pacific Drive</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Whispers in the Woods&nbsp;</em>expansion will get weird sometime this year.</figcaption></figure><p>You can also look forward to new maps and new junctions to explore, as well as unique resources to gather, and you'd better believe that new anomalies will be springing up across those maps to hinder (or perhaps help!) your progress.</p>

<p>Naturally, there will also be new cosmetic elements for you to add to your car, so if you didn't feel like your janky 70s wagon was already kitted out enough, then this DLC has you covered.</p>

<p><em>Whispers in the Woods&nbsp;</em>is also introducing a new system to&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive&nbsp;</em>in the form of Artifacts, which Ironwood and Kepler say will "create mysterious changes and effects to you and the world around you".</p>

<p>You'll need to carry Artifacts in order to survive the expansion's new areas and dangers, but doing so also "increases the challenge you and your car will face", so you'll need to weigh up how much risk you want to take.</p>




<p>We don't have a release date for&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Whispers in the Woods&nbsp;</em>expansion yet, but it'll presumably be available across all platforms on which the game can be found when it does arrive. In the meantime, you can remind yourself of what our very own Will thought of the base game by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/pacific-drive" rel="nofollow">checking out their review here</a>.</p>

            <p>Historical <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ara-history-untold">Ara: History Untold</a> will get new culture mechanics in its 2.0 update, developers Oxide Games and publishers Stardock have announced. As with culture features in certain Civilization games and - well, the only other specimen that comes to mind right now is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sins-solar-empire">Sins Of A Solar Empire</a>, this will allow you to claim territory without firing a shot, by dint of being way fancier and more refined than all those yokels across the border. Should the aforesaid yokels remain unmoved by your splendour, there's also a new Agitator unit that can be sent into foreign parts to foment rebellion.</p><!--more-->
<p>Agitators aside, the Revolutions update introduces a bunch of military units specific to each civ, such as Japanese Samurai and Mongol Horse Archers, and treats leader characters to a revamp with distinct traits and abilities.</p>
<p>They've introduced more "realistic natural resource clustering" for map generation together with revised rules for trade, and boldly claim to have made the AI smarter. But returning players may be most beguiled by the hot and spicy talk of cutting down on micromanagement. They've replaced the old production queues with "smarter stockpile and priority controls, freeing players to focus on high-level strategy". Filth!</p>
<p>All of which sounds like it might go some way towards addressing Sin's criticisms in our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ara-history-untold-review">Ara: History Untold review</a>. "Empire-building re-envisaged as managing elaborate production chains, then re-re-envisaged as another 4X with repetitive micromanagement and weak, bland AI," was her brusque summary. It sounds like the bulk of the audience agreed, for the Revolutions update boasts of being heavily inspired by player feedback.</p><p>How does Culture work in Ara? It's a new quality of life category that generates Influence, this being a currency that can be spent on cultural traits and territory expansion, saving you the need for armed invasion.
