But I’m here to yell about <em>Slay the Princess </em>and <em>We Are OFK</em>.</p><p><em>Slay the Princess </em>is a visual novel that puts you through multiple loops of the same moment. You don’t know anything about who you are or the world you’re in, but you’re told you must enter a remote cabin and descend to its basement. Once there, you’ll find a princess trapped there in isolation. According to the narrator, if she is able to escape this prison, she will bring about the end of the world. How you choose to proceed, whether that’s by using a knife to end her life, talking to her, freeing her, or doing nothing at all, will bring you into one of several diverging paths. But no matter where those paths lead, they all circle back around to you walking toward the cabin again and making a decision about what you’ll do next. <em>Slay the Princess</em> is all about the horror of being known. Through multiple loops, you and the princess will come to understand one another, and it leads to some shocking, fascinating places as each loop shows you new variations of the horrors you’ll enact upon one another.</p><figure id="" data-id="5703060f08638142f6befdcdfce7ed66" data-recommend-id="image://5703060f08638142f6befdcdfce7ed66" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Itsumi drives her car." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Itsumi drives her car." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Team OFK</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5703060f08638142f6befdcdfce7ed66" data-recommend-id="image://5703060f08638142f6befdcdfce7ed66" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Itsumi drives her car." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>On the opposite end of the spectrum, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/we-are-ofk-kotaku-review-adventure-visual-novel-music-1849425358&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/we-are-ofk-kotaku-review-adventure-visual-novel-music-1849425358"><em>We Are OFK</em></a></span><em> </em>is all about the horror of not knowing fuck all about shit. The adventure game by the conglomerate of writers, designers, musicians, and more called Team OFK, often feels less like a video game than it does an interactive musical television show. The experimental, episodic series is an introspective look at four friends trying to figure out who they are artistically while also trying to survive in corporate America. If you feel like capitalism is sucking the joy out of art and making it hard to maintain your personal relationships, <em>We Are OFK </em>is the video game for you. I played it when things were getting very bad at my last job and it really hit.<br></p><p>All four games are worth your time, and I love that someone used the word “slay” to bring together these four pretty distinct and unrelated games because that word can mean two very different things depending on who says it. Whether you want to murder something or serve cunt, this bundle has some bangers that let you do both.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On Thursday, EA Sports released the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/college-football-25-gets-first-major-title-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first major title update</a> for College Football 25. The update included hundreds of fixes and changes to the game, but it also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/college-football-25-update-causes-new-bugs-in-dynasty-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brought with it a few substantial</a> bugs within College Football 25’s Dynasty mode.</p>



<p>On Friday, however, EA Sports took the game’s servers down for a short period in order to fix the issues with College Football 25’s Dynasty mode. And, according to posts on social media, some of them have been fixed, specifically for online dynasties.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We are back with some updates!</p><p>Server maintenance was completed earlier today to address the issues mentioned above for ONLINE Dynasties.</p><p>For OFFLINE Dynasties, a Title Update will be required to resolve these issues.

</div></figure>



<p>“Server maintenance was completed earlier today to address the issues mentioned above for Online Dynasties,” the game’s <a href="https://x.com/CFBDirect/status/1821983511907319966" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official developer account</a> posted. </p>



<p>“For Offline Dynasties, a Title Update will be required to resolve these issues. Our team is currently working to include these updates and more in our next Title Update.”</p>



<p>Regarding the larger Schemes and Playbooks issue, EA says that it won’t retroactively fix any player who may have had their rating and/or archetype changed from a switch. That said, it is “safe to use Schemes and Playbooks menu to change your playbook!”</p>



<p>In addition to this hotfix, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-to-expect-the-next-college-football-25-title-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dates are already seemingly scheduled</a> for the next set of title updates for College Football 25.</p>

Tortellini defeated Radahn by using custom software with a machine-learning algorithm that tracked the fish's movement as it swam in its tank. It's also worth pointing out that the fish tank was digitally mapped out, and the game would respond based on where Tortellini swam.</p><p dir="ltr">Even though Tortellini was the one to slay Radahn, the fish did have some help. PointCrows ensured their character was properly equipped for the fight, and by the time they got to the final boss, their tarnished was level 713. Some of the buffs Tortellini used during the final fight included the Blessing of the Ertree, the Golden Vow spell, and the Iron Jar Aromatic. Despite being such a massive level, it's still impressive to see a fish defeat one of the most challenging bosses in the game.</p><p dir="ltr">This wasn't the first time Tortellini played Elden Ring, either.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-adin-ross-donald-trump-kick-stream<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>To kick off yet another eternity-spanning week in noted crumbling empire America, Kick streamer Adin Ross <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/adin-ross-interviews-trump-gifts-cybertruck-rolex-rcna165225" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">turned over his broadcast to Donald Trump</a>, the Republican presidential candidate who <a href="https://aftermath.site/how-should-we-talk-about-the-trump-thing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">almost got assassinated</a> a few weeks ago, but in a way that caused pretty much everyone to immediately forget. Antics of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/06/trump-adin-ross-tesla-rolex" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">debatable legality</a> ensued. On this week’s Aftermath Hours, we talk about that.</p><p>We begin the show by reflecting on the legacy of Game Informer, a magazine whose 33-year run unexpectedly <a href="https://aftermath.site/game-informer-has-been-shut-down" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">came to an end</a> late last week when GameStop unceremoniously laid off its entire staff and <a href="https://aftermath.site/game-informer-archives-closed-illegal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">took down its website’s archive</a>. GI’s own staff <a href="https://aftermath.site/game-informer-closed-layoffs-eulogy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eulogized it better than we ever could</a>, but there’s no harm in adding a few more fond memories to the pile.</p><p>Then we discuss the parasocial pivots of both the Trump and Harris campaigns, with the former appearing on the broadcast of the aforementioned sycophantic Kick streamer – who gifted Trump an expensive watch and a Cybertruck with his near-death experience emblazoned on it – and the latter embracing Brat Summer, a social media phenomenon born of resurgent pop star Charli XCX. Also, people apparently want vice presidential candidate <a href="https://aftermath.site/tim-walz-esports" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tim Walz</a> to be their dad. Everyone’s being super normal about this! I’m sure it will definitely not hamper their ability to criticize and pressure their aspiring presidential pals when the time comes!</p><p>After that, we welcome <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/borderlands" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Borderlands</em></a><em> </em>into the pantheon of bafflingly bad video game movies by talking about all the other ones, of which there have been approximately one million. Paradoxically, though, there has been one good <em>Borderlands </em>movie: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/330830/Tales_from_the_Borderlands/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Tales from the Borderlands</em></a>, a cinematic narrative game that came out years ago. Go watch/play that instead.&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can someday stream with every currently-living president – and also some of the dead ones.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation:</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>It’s the only thing that’s convinced me that Trump might be cooked. Once you’re on Adin Ross’ stream, you are slotted into a particular genre of human being, and you can’t escape. Because he’s just a butt sniffer. He was doing that on the stream [with Andrew Tate]. He’ll suck up to anybody. If you allow that into your circle, you’ve conceded that you let people suck up to you. And that’s disgusting.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Yeah, although at the same time, I feel like far-right figures love that shit. That’s the whole thing: You’re an authoritarian, and you surround yourself with suck ups.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>Yeah, but the quality of suck up matters, right? Adin Ross is not a pedigreed suck up. It’s not like hanging out with Ye, who’s still a celebrity even though he’s an insane person. If you hang out with Ye, you’re hanging out with someone who has at one point in time been culturally significant. That is not something you can say about Adin Ross. He’s been a loser the whole time. He just had a lot of Twitch followers, which is not that cool.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> Is this the first time that a politician has been on Kick?</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> In terms of big names, definitely. Aside from Trump’s own channel, he never appeared on Twitch. I can’t really think of another instance like this [on Kick or Twitch]. The best point of comparison – a politician appearing on a livestreaming platform with a content creator – is probably when <a href="https://kotaku.com/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-streams-on-twitch-with-hasan-p-1845431479" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AOC streamed <em>Among Us</em></a> with a bunch of people from the Twitch and YouTube ecosystems, including Hasan Piker, Pokimane, and others who are generally left leaning.</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>That was explicitly not an interview, also. That was her playing a game on Twitch. This was different in that it was framed as an interview, even though it’s definitely hilariously not an interview at all. It’s just pathetic stuff. It’s sad to watch. It doesn’t make him look powerful. That’s what I mean when I say that Adin Ross is the wrong pedigree of suck up. It makes Trump look pathetic because he’s glomming onto the energy of this pathetic little worm. He’s like Grima Wormtongue in<em> Lord of the Rings</em>,<em> </em>which I recently rewatched. But that’s what it feels like!</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Also, Trump is doing it seemingly because his son, Barron, was like “Hey dad, there’s this guy. You should go on his stream.” And Trump was like “Well OK, if you think so, because I guess I have to beat Brat Summer now.”</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>Just the idea of Barron Trump knowing who Adin Ross is, that’s the most loser-y loser shit I could possibly think of. You are taking advice from a teenager, my man. Come on. … Just seeing him on the stream, and when they gave him the wrapped Cybertruck, it’s like, god, you guys look like losers.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Adin Ross gifted two different things to Donald Trump: a very expensive watch – which I’ve seen people estimate cost between $50,000 and over $100,000 – and a Cybertruck emblazoned with the moment right after Trump got shot, where he’s raising his fist in the air. This reeks of desperation in so many different directions: both Adin Ross being like “Notice me, daddy! Look at how much thought I put into your presents” and then also Trump being like “I’ve gotta get the youths more interested in me because that’s a way to maybe shift this from being a deadlock.”&nbsp;</p><p>But I still find it telling in terms of how all of this works in that Trump is massively wealthy. Why would you get him presents? But again, Adin Ross is a born suck up. That’s what he does. And authoritarian figures love suck ups. They love people who will not question them in any way and who will instead be like “I’ll get you everything you could possibly want and even things you didn’t know you wanted.”&nbsp;</p><p>I feel like, in that way, Adin Ross is the perfect kind of useful idiot for the moment. He is somebody who’s not typically a political streamer – although he’s flirted with far-right ideologies in the past – but he has an audience of viewers who probably wouldn’t describe themselves as political. But if somebody like Trump goes on his stream, he models being a suck up to a powerful figure. These people who are young and uninitiated to the world of politics, they look at Adin Ross and say “Well I think he’s cool. I like him.” He’s somebody who’s palled around with all these famous people. He’s hung out with LeBron James’ son. He’s friends with all these rappers. And now he’s hanging out with Donald Trump and sucking up to him and demonstrating that that’s a cool and good and alright thing to do. Viewers might start to think “Alright, maybe that’s what I’ll start to do in my own life, too.”</p><p>Despite how fumbling and flailing all of this appears, it does give this impression to the audience that in the face of fascism, what you should do is kneel down and kiss the ring.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Yeah, it does also suck. Ultimately, it’s on Kick for allowing people like Adin Ross to stream. I don’t think we need edgy Twitch. It’s also clear that this website only exists as a front to get people to gamble. It’s <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikestubbs/2023/07/26/how-kick-plans-to-monetize-streaming-in-a-way-twitch-couldnt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">built by gambling money</a> and sustains itself on gambling money. It sucks, and I don’t think it should exist, and part of the reason I don’t think it should exist is that they don’t seem to have a problem with this stream that happened where crimes may have occurred.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

One big complaint is that the PG-13 film lacks the gore and violence found in the M-rated games. However, according to one person involved in the creation of the live-action adaptation, they filmed plenty of gory moments that didn’t make the final cut. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

Reviews have criticized the movie’s lack of humor, boring action, ugly sets, and bad casting choices. And many have wondered why the film is PG-13, considering the source material and the fact that Eli Roth is a talented horror director who likely would have been on board for a bloody <em>Borderlands </em>movie. Well, that was the plan at one point, according to the film’s stunt coordinator. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://screenrant.com/borderlands-movie-filming-method-rated-r-jimmy-odee-response/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://screenrant.com/borderlands-movie-filming-method-rated-r-jimmy-odee-response/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In a new interview with <em>Screen Rant</em></a></span>, <em>Borderlands</em>’ stunt coordinator Jimmy O’Dee confirmed that they shot the film with an R-rating in mind.</p><p>“We always knew that we were going to go either 15 or R rating, it’s 15 in UK, for a slightly mature audience,” said O’Dee. “So, we were blowing people’s heads off. And we were cutting feet off. We were doing all of that.”</p><p>O’Dee reiterated this point saying “But literally the idea and the brief was carnage, head cutting off, feet cutting off” and that he and the crew were told to “go for it” and that everything would be figured out in post-production. But then something changed and <em>Borderlands</em> became PG-13. </p><p>“But then, you know, a lot happens,” said O’Dee. “We shot that nearly three years ago, or we just finished it. So, I guess a lot happens in post, and they see where it’s going to go and what market they’re aiming for.”<br></p><p>You might be wondering if famous horror director Eli Roth was holding back on set. According to O’Dee, that wasn’t the case at all as Roth was upping the gore during production. </p><p>“It was funny, he was on the second unit, he came over, and he was like, ‘Uh... just cut the ankles off. Yeah, get the knife and cut the ankles and we will leave these stubs.’ It was kind of like there wasn’t enough gore for him sometimes.”<br></p><p>But it seems the higher-ups decided that the best chance <em>Borderlands </em>had was if it was PG-13 and more accessible to younger people who might love the games. However, considering a lot of this stuff was filmed, Eli Roth’s involvement, and the lackluster reviews, I’d not be shocked if an unrated version of the movie with more gore and extra scenes arrives in the future in an effort to make some more money off this misfire. </p><p>&nbsp;.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That’s exactly what’s happening now with this weekend deal discounting the <em>Final Fantasy 1-6 Pixel Remaster</em> bundle to $59.99 ($15 off) at <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.humblebundle.com/store/final-fantasy-i-vi-remastered-bundle">Humble</a> (PC), the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Ffinal-fantasy-i-vi-bundle-switch%2F">Nintendo eShop</a>, and <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0082-CUSA33837_00-FFBUNDLEPS4ENA06">PlayStation</a>.

The project in question is <a href="https://mattstark.itch.io/tramstertram">Tramstertram</a>. Aside from being a terrifying feat of punmanship, it's a browser-based building toy from Matt Stark, creator of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/viewfinder-review">really rather lovely Viewfinder</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Released a few hours ago, Tramstertram gives you a rotatable 3D scene with a choice of tiles to plonk down - townhouses, streets, tram rails, and parkland, all of which coalesce into larger structures when you slot them together. It's a homage to Townscaper, but not nearly as elaborate, just a small gift left on a digital windowsill for any passerby who, for whatever reason, might need to lose a few minutes enjoying the sight of a tramcar sparking and trundling along a row of trees.</p>
<p>Tramstertram comes with a small selection of prefabricated towns, including a fourth map that gives away the alchemy behind the tile combinations, and the ability to copy-and-paste a world code to share your creation. If you're not so keen on trams, Stark has extensive prior for this kind of thing. He's made similar building toys involving <a href="https://mattstark.itch.io/treehouse-canvas">treehouses</a>, <a href="https://mattstark.itch.io/fish-tank-greenhouse">fishtanks</a>, and <a href="https://mattstark.itch.io/coal-toy">mining carts</a>.</p>
<p>Nice note to end the week on, I think? If you need a bit more meat on these bones, keep an eye out for the "whimsigoth" cottage builder Tiny Glade, due for release this year - Kiera <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-made-the-witchy-cottage-of-my-dreams-in-tiny-glade">loved it</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/fallout-london-is-fastest-redeemed-game-on-gog-gets-new-update/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Fallout: London was released just two weeks ago and is the biggest mod to be created for Fallout 4, which completely transforms the game into a new world for players to explore, with new quests and voice actors. Since its release, Fallout: London has become the fastest-redeemed game on GOG, aided by the 60% off sale on GOG's Fallout 4: Game of the Year edition. Team FOLON have announced that there is now a brand-new update for Fallout: London that will fix a lot of the bugs and issues players have been experiencing.</p>
<p>The initial release of Fallout: London was highly successful, and patches were quickly released to address any bugs and crashes that players were experiencing. Team FOLON worked extremely hard on this project and continues to work on it by providing new updates to the game.</p>
<p>In the first 24 hours alone, the Fallout 4 mod was redeemed over 500,000 times, making it the fastest-redeemed game on GOG in its history.</p>
<p>While the mod did incredibly well on release, there were quite a few teething issues with the Steam version of the game, especially because Steam had the Next-Gen update, which players would have to figure out how to roll back to use the Fallout: London mod.</p>
<p>For those who have been dealing with difficulties, Team FOLON has personally taken the time to help players who have been dealing with issues while trying to set up the mod on their official Discord server. They also utilize the server to get feedback on how the mod is performing in the players' eyes.</p>
<p>With all the feedback and troubleshooting done so far, Team FOLON is releasing a<a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-london-team-folon-working-on-major-bug-fixes/"> new update</a> for Fallout: London, which brings many fixes to the mod. This includes fixes to broken quest lines, such as "Broken Angel" and "Heavenslayer."</p>
<p>In addition to fixing the broken quest lines, they tweaked certain perks, such as "Lab Rat" and "Railway Spine," making them more severe than they were previously. There are also some huge changes to the game's weaponry and a decrease in Rads in the River Thames from 250 to 169.</p>
<p>Previously, some voice lines for some of the characters were missing, and they have now changed that, added in the missing voice lines for Beefy and Smythe, and fixed ambient audio.</p>
<p>For those&nbsp;<span>who have been stuck in Fallout: London, GOG has released a post with instructions on<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-WymJLLvM4hHQZxUdLQriu6YagIlJyiR4YlrQfEk6_k/edit#heading=h.ql8e1asm5i1j" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;how to update to</a> the most updated version, which should significantly decrease</span> bugs. The instructions may seem slightly complicated, involving going into the Fallout 4 data folder and deleting specific files. However, it will be worth the effort once it's done.</p>

Besides rocking a bunch of nasty growths on their carapaces, <strong>Spore Chargers also emanate an acid-green fog that fills their immediate surroundings and obscures their exact location</strong>.</p><p>The first time I bumped into one of these things, I didn’t even realize it. Thanks to <em>Helldivers 2</em>’s various weather effects, I thought I was simply caught in one of the planet’s acid storms, which I knew <em>could</em> happen before diving into my mission. Before I knew it, I was running to an objective and could hardly see a few feet in either direction when a teammate called out that they’d spotted a Spore Charger among the dense fog.</p><p>Reader, I yelped when the thing finally popped out of nowhere. But thanks to that experience, I can now inform y’all on how best to proceed when running into a Spore Charger.</p><h2 id="h47880"><a id=""></a><strong>Where to find a Spore Charger</strong></h2><p>Much like the new Impaler, as well as most of the advanced variants of enemies, <strong>Spore Chargers are more easily spotted on higher difficulties. I first spotted one around a level 7 mission, and they likely begin to show up around level 6, which is dubbed “Extreme” in the game.</strong> This is around the time where the modifiers start suggesting massive enemies as well as heavily armored ones, and I do think these bad boys fit the bill.<br></p><p>As I already mentioned, they are pretty apparent from their appearance, but the telltale sign that you are about to face off with a Spore Charger is the fog that’ll quickly swallow you up. The fog moves <em>with </em>the Charger so they’ll always be at the heart of it, even if it’s difficult to tell up from down while you’re in there. That’s why we’re going to need abilities and weapons that lock on and pack a lot of strength in order to take them out easily.<br></p><h2 id="h47881"><a id=""></a><strong>How to kill a Spore Charger</strong></h2><p>Now because these things are so heavily armored, you’re going to want to pack something with explosive power. <strong>As far as weapon stratagems, bring an Expendable Anti-Tank rocket launcher, Commando, or a Spear if you think you’re going to have to deal with a Spore Charger. </strong>Much like with a normal Charger, blowing the protective shell off its face and then following up with a second shot should do the trick quite easily.</p><p>Personally, I might prefer a Spear due to the lock-on function. Given the nature of the Spore Charger’s passive fog, as well as the fact that it appears on difficulties where you’re often being swarmed, it’s good insurance to have a weapon that makes up for any human error. Just remember to give it some space, since the Spear has to first launch the rocket up into the air before it locks on and comes back down on it.<br></p><p>If you don’t want to have to deal with a Spore Charger head-on, there are actually a number of ways to get around that which put some of <em>Helldivers 2</em>’s underused stratagems to use. <strong>Both the Orbital Railcannon Strike and the Eagle 110MM Rocket Pods are going to be key to taking out Spore Chargers from a relatively safe distance. That’s because both stratagems will automatically lock on to the largest target in the area, rather than simply hitting the area marked by your beacon.</strong><br></p><p>These stratagems have always been helpful for enemy units that are constantly on the move, like Bile Titans and standard Chargers, but thanks to the Spore Charger’s ability to impair your vision, they are now handier than ever.<br></p><p>If you’re feeling particularly gung-ho and want to avoid using any stratagems—or simply run out because of how grueling your mission is—<strong>Spore Chargers do actually have more gaps in their armor than most other Chargers. Their sides are practically exposed thanks to the immense acidic growths, and the underside of their rear sports the same weak spot as every other Charger,</strong> but this approach will consume both ammo and time, which are a hot commodity in <em>Helldivers 2</em>.<em> </em><strong>Also be wary of killing them while you’re too close, as they do explode and spread their acid all over the place as they do.</strong> You’re much better off using any number of the above stratagems to quickly take out a Charger before it becomes a problem.<br></p><p>Now, I believe you’re ready to take on the bug front of the Second Galactic War and thank goodness for that. We need well-informed boots on the ground out there to bring the fight to those nasty bastards and really stick it to them. <br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The views around Bungie’s upcoming extraction shooter Marathon don’t appear to be all that good. In an appearance on the <a href="https://youtu.be/gnduZPaqx5Q?si=OoTOpVY5GDXUQqKq&amp;t=1892" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Friends Per Second</a> podcast, Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier was asked for a “temperature check” on the state of the game. And is response, as you could have expected <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-announces-major-layoffs-and-restructuring/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">after the past two weeks</a>, wasn’t all that positive.</p>



<p>“Not great from what I’ve heard,” he said. “There’s a reason that it was planned for this year and slipped a whole year.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Jason Schreier joins to talk Bungie cuts + Game Informer crew discuss closure | Friends Per Second" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gnduZPaqx5Q?start=1892&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>“People who I’ve talked to are a little pessimistic about it even hitting it’s current planned deadline, but we’ll see.”</p>



<p>Schreier added that he doesn’t know exactly when the current deadline for the game is, but it’s believed to be sometime in 2025.</p>







<p>“I mean, the sentiment I’ve heard is not great around it at least as of a few months ago,” he said.</p>



<p>The development of the Marathon reboot has been shaky, at best, over the past couple of years. The game had a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-early-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">specific gameplay loop</a> that included customizable characters only to change to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-heroes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">having a cast of “heroes”</a> to choose from instead. On top of that, Christopher Barrett, who was Marathon’s game director, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-replaces-marathon-game-director-with-former-valorant-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was replaced earlier this year</a> by former Valorant game director Joe Ziegler. The game even lost its executive producer not long ago, as well.</p>

Police officers investigating the scene later discovered a strange substance on Osmanova’s table, which was subsequently analysed and confirmed to be a form of mercury.</p><p>Exposure to mercury can be extremely hazardous and is capable of triggering a range of serious health problems affecting the lungs, eyes, and the digestive and immune systems. During a subsequent investigation, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wy1s1Q3knZA&amp;t=36s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">security footage emerged online</a> showing Osmanova’s opponent and rival in the competition Amina Abakarova allegedly spread a substance over the table.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Russian chess champion Amina Abakarova was caught on CCTV trying to poison her rival <a href="https://t.co/I23Wpar0nb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/I23Wpar0nb</a></p>— non aesthetic things (@PicturesFoIder) <a href="https://twitter.com/PicturesFoIder/status/1821669643330678986?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 8, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>The Republic of Dagestan's minister of sports Sazhid Sazhidov assured fans via a Russian-language Telegram post that Osmanova is not in a life threatening condition, while the Russian Chess Federation noted that “no one else was hurt” as a result of the poisoning attempt. However, Russian outlets have since reported that another woman and a competition organizer also become unwell following the alleged attack.</p><p>Russian media site <a href="https://rtvi.com/news/na-sorevnovaniyah-v-dagestane-shahmatistka-popytalas-otravit-soperniczu-chto-izvestno/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RTVI</a> reports Osmanova had known Abakarova since childhood, and that the two had grown to become rivals before falling out during a recent competition, in which the latter brought a phone to a competition, in violation of the event’s rules.</p><p>“Like many others, I am perplexed by what happened, and the motives of such an experienced athlete as Amina Abakarova are also unclear to me,” wrote Sazhidov in the <a href="https://t.me/minsportrd/13492" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Telegram post</a>, translated to English via machine translation. “The actions she took could have led to the most tragic outcome, they threatened the lives of everyone in the chess house, including herself.

In Spring you have limited options for crops compared to summer and fall, partially because one of the best crops isn't sold at Pierre's Store. That said, even when it comes to crops available from Pierre's Store, some of them are worth much more money than others.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Best spring crops</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4336402-springcrops2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4336402" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4336402-springcrops2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4336402"></a><figcaption>Strawberries are a valuable crop, but getting ahold of the seeds makes them a pain to grow in spring.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4336402-springcrops2.jpg"></figure><p><strong>The absolute best crop in Spring is strawberry plants, but these can only be purchased during the egg festival on Spring 13. For crops available the whole season, cauliflower offers the best profits compared to seed costs and time to grow. </strong>Crops like coffee beans are profitable, but only if you have enough kegs to convert them into coffee, with the same being true for unmilled rice.</p><p dir="ltr">While it is tempting to maximize your profits and only grow the most valuable crops, there are a few other factors to consider. First, if you are trying to complete the community center bundles, you will need to grow a few different spring crops to complete the spring crops bundle. Also, if you want to have a more consistent income, you might want to work on some crops that grow faster. Cauliflower might be the most profitable, but it takes 12 days to grow, so you will only get two big paydays during spring.</p><p dir="ltr">When it comes to strawberries, you can plant them as soon as you get them from the egg festival, but since these crops last all season and produce strawberries continuously, it's more worthwhile to save them for the next spring, or for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stardew-valley-how-to-unlock-the-greenhouse/1100-6524916/" data-ref-id="1100-6524916">Greenhouse</a>. <strong>Pierre's Store is closed on Wednesdays, so try to plan ahead and buy seeds early if a field is going to be harvested on that day.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-studios-to-continuously-release-hit-titles-says-sony/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Sony has declared that PlayStation Studios plans to "consistently and continuously" release hit games. Sony Interactive Entertainment strives to refine its development process and release schedules to ensure this is true.</p>
<p>This is surprising, considering PlayStation Studios has recently admitted to struggling to maintain sustainable profit margins despite its highly successful games. These games include the PC port of Ghost of Tsushima and The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered, but that hasn't been enough to stop layoffs at PlayStation Studios.</p>
<p>Over 900 roles were cut from PlayStation Studios during this process, with a new management structure created under joint CEOs Herman Hulst and Hideaki Nishino.</p>
<p>Sony announced its earnings in its first-quarter financial reports for FY2024 two days ago. In an <a href="https://www.irwebmeeting.com/sony/fast/20240807/sA7GHnQS/202503_1q_02_en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earnings call</a>, Sony discussed its willingness to strengthen its development schedule: "The Studio Business Group is strengthening its development schedule management and optimizing development projects to consistently and continuously release hit titles."</p>
<p>In addition to this, they are also working on "maintaining and expanding" the number of active PlayStation users while strengthening user engagement. By doing this, the aim is to "establish a stable earnings base," which is one of the number one priorities for PlayStation Studios.</p>
<p>While the PlayStation 5 has sold 61.7 million units worldwide, <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-61-7-million-units/">the console sales</a> are slowing down rapidly, faster than Sony was originally expecting. While it did make a profit in Q3 of FY2023 at $10.2 billion, its Operating Profits fell by 25.9% year-on-year.</p>
<p>In terms of game releases, it has been a relatively quiet year for PlayStation overall, as they haven't released any blockbuster-type games this year. Despite this, they have announced several console exclusives. These games include Concord, Astro Bot, and Lego Horizon Adventures.</p>
<p>In addition, the number of PlayStation Plus members has dropped, predominantly due to players' dissatisfaction with the selection of games they are given. While it is the beginning of August, PlayStation still has plenty of time to announce more upcoming blockbuster games. Still, we will have to wait and see whether they will do that or continue to focus on porting PlayStation exclusives over to PC, the most recent being Ghost of Tsushima.</p>
<p>Compared to other State of Plays, there was a lot of discourse around the latest State of Play, as people felt it was a bit lackluster compared to other showcases in the past. We can only hope the new schedule and developments they are planning don't lead to more layoffs.</p>

		<p>Ooooh, it’s the big spooky edition of What We Played, the one possessed by the Devil’s number. So, in the finest traditions of this feature, I asked everyone to not only tell me their gaming habits of the week gone by, but to also tell me their favourite thing about the Devil and/or the occult.</p>
<p>For me? Well, I kind of just think that pentagrams look neat and are fun to draw. It’s a bit like the ‘Cool S’, but more witchy and goth. Also, I think The Good Place could probably count here. I need to rewatch that show sometime!</p>
<p>My gaming this week has been anything but devilish… unless you think pirate cats are the work of the dark one. I wrapped up our review of the cute and fun action RPG action of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/06/cat-quest-3-review/">Cat Quest 3</a>!</p>

<p><strong>Jason’s</strong> favourite thing about the occult is a bit of silly wordplay, as he says “Dungeons and Dragons is a cult but is also good.” He should know, because he’s a fully fledged member, having played D&amp;D three times in the past week an had “a blast every time”. He’s also played an awful lot of Dome Keeper.</p>

<p>It’s “everything” occult for <strong>Nic</strong>, with the one caveat that the cult of Taylor Swift is “too intense” for him. And so he’s been burrowing back into MTG Arena, shifting back into the digital game after a spell – geddit? – of only playing paper. He has thoughts on the new Bloomburrow expansion, which “is phenomenally cute, but it turns out underpowered relative to what we’ve had recently. Its effect on the meta has been somewhat less than I had hoped!”</p>

<p><strong>Steve</strong> reckons that “demons have all the best tunes, but no full quantitative study has yet to be carried out regarding video games.” He’s been playing a decidedly un-fiendish mixture of games, including Kena: Bridge of Spirits, Dungeons of hinterberg, rattling through boomer shooter Bloodhound and the original Breath of Fire, and finally made a start on Spider-Man 2, since it was taking up SSD space on his PS5.</p>
<p>There was a little tickle of Destiny 2 for <strong>Tuffcub</strong>, of course, but he also finished off RoboCop: Rogue City, “and it was exactly what a RoboCop game should be, including rescuing cats. It’s not a perfect game, but it’s the perfect RoboCop game.” Meanwhile, his favourite devil-y thing is Lucifer the TV series: “One of the best TV police procedurals every created but with added demons and angels. Also Exploding Kitterns on Netflix which has lots of demons but also God is voiced by Tom Ellis. aka Lucifer from Lucifer.&nbsp; So he’s played both sides, ahem.”</p>
<p><strong>Gamoc’s</strong> favourite cult is the one from Hot Fuzz, but has he taken that “greater good” ethos across to his week of gaming? Not really. He played Red Dead Redemption 2, “which continues to try and make me not love it”, and then set foot into Mount and Blade Bannerlord, albeit with cheats on just so he could survive.</p>
<p><strong>Jim</strong> crammed in as much gaming as possible this week with a twosome of continuing his Cyberpunk 2077 playthrough with a stealthy Netrunner, and reinstalling For Honor to get his fix of hero battlers while waiting for Concord to release later this month.</p>

<p>And we’ll round things out this week with <strong>Miguel</strong> who’s been playing one of those 90s games that would’ve had your gran clutching her pearls for fear that your computer was actually filled with the Dark Lord’s minions – “I’m playing the new co-op Doom 1+2 re-release because I LOVE (killing) DEMONS AAAA 666!!!!!”</p>
<p><em>And with that, what have you played this week? Feel free to share your own devilish delights.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/9/24216887/intel-13th-14th-gen-raptor-lake-statement<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Intel has a big update on its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24216305/intel-13th-14th-gen-raptor-lake-cpu-crash-news-updates-patches-fixes-motherboards">crashing 13th and 14th Gen desktop CPUs</a> — including a hint that maybe, just maybe, it might be able to do something about chips that are already failing instead of requiring you to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/7/24215440/intel-13th-14th-gen-crash-raptor-lake-integrator-warranty-lenovo-dell-hp-acer-asus">return them</a>. </p><p>You can read its statement below in full, but here are the parts I find interesting:</p><p>Note: We still do not yet have an official answer on whether Raptor Lake laptop chips are vulnerable to the instability issues.</p><div><blockquote><p>Intel is currently distributing to its OEM/ODM partners a new microcode patch (0x129) for its Intel Core 13th/14th Gen desktop processors which will address incorrect voltage requests to the processor that are causing elevated operating voltage.</p><p><strong>For all Intel Core 13th/14th Gen desktop processor users:&nbsp;</strong>This patch is being distributed via BIOS update and will not be available through operating system updates. Intel is working with its partners to ensure timely validation and rollout of the BIOS update for systems currently in service.</p><p><strong>Instability Analysis Update – Microcode Background and Performance Implications</strong></p><p>In addition to&nbsp;<a href="https://community.intel.com/t5/Processors/Additional-Warranty-Updates-on-Intel-Core-13th-14th-Gen-Desktop/m-p/1620853">extended warranty coverage</a>, Intel has released three mitigations related to the instability issue – commonly experienced as consistent application crashes and repeated hangs – to help stabilize customer systems with Intel Core 13th and 14th gen desktop processors:</p><p>1. Intel default settings to avoid elevated power delivery impact to the processor (May 2024)</p><p>2. Microcode 0x125 to fix the eTVB issue in i9 processors (June 2024)</p><p>3. Microcode 0x129 to address elevated voltages (August 2024)</p><p>Intel’s current analysis finds there is a significant increase to the minimum operating voltage (Vmin) across multiple cores on affected processors due to elevated voltages. Elevated voltage events can accumulate over time and contribute to the increase in Vmin for the processor.</p><p>The latest microcode update (0x129) will limit voltage requests above 1.55V as a preventative mitigation for processors not experiencing instability symptoms. This latest microcode update will primarily improve operating conditions for K/KF/KS processors. Intel is also confirming, based on extensive validation, all future products will not be affected by this issue.</p><p>Intel is continuing to investigate mitigations for scenarios that can result in Vmin shift on potentially impacted&nbsp;<a href="https://community.intel.com/t5/Processors/Additional-Warranty-Updates-on-Intel-Core-13th-14th-Gen-Desktop/m-p/1620853">Intel Core 13th and 14th Gen desktop processors</a>. Intel will provide updates by end of August.&nbsp;</p><p>Intel’s internal testing – utilizing Intel Default Settings - indicates performance impact is within run-to-run variation (eg. 3DMark: Timespy, WebXPRT 4, Cinebench R24, Blender 4.2.0) with a few sub-tests showing moderate impacts (WebXPRT Online Homework; PugetBench GPU Effects Score). For gaming workloads tested, performance has also been within run-to-run variation (eg. Cyberpunk 2077, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Total War: Warhammer III – Mirrors of Madness) with one exception showing slightly more impact (Hitman 3: Dartmoor). However, system performance is dependent on configuration and several other factors.</p><p>For unlocked Intel Core 13th and 14th Gen desktop processors, this latest microcode update (0x129) will&nbsp;<strong>not&nbsp;</strong>prevent users from overclocking if they so choose. Users can disable the eTVB setting in their BIOS if they wish to push above the 1.55V threshold. As always, Intel recommends users proceed with caution when overclocking their desktop processors, as overclocking may void their warranty and/or affect system health. As a general best practice, Intel recommends customers with Intel Core 13th and 14th Gen desktop processors utilize&nbsp;<a href="https://community.intel.com/t5/Processors/June-2024-Guidance-regarding-Intel-Core-13th-and-14th-Gen-K-KF/m-p/1607807">the Intel Default Settings</a>.</p><p>In light of the recently announced&nbsp;<a href="https://community.intel.com/t5/Processors/Additional-Warranty-Updates-on-Intel-Core-13th-14th-Gen-Desktop/m-p/1620853">extended warranty program</a>, Intel is reaffirming its confidence in its products and is committed to making sure all customers who have or are currently experiencing instability symptoms on their 13th and/or 14th Gen desktop processors are supported in the exchange process. Users experiencing consistent instability symptoms should reach out to their system manufacturer (OEM/System Integrator purchase), Intel Customer Support (boxed processor), or place of purchase (tray processor) further assistance.</p><p><strong>FURTHER READING:</strong></p><p><a href="https://community.intel.com/t5/Processors/June-2024-Guidance-regarding-Intel-Core-13th-and-14th-Gen-K-KF/m-p/1607807">June 2024 Intel Default Settings Guidance</a></p><p><a href="https://community.intel.com/t5/Processors/Additional-Warranty-Updates-on-Intel-Core-13th-14th-Gen-Desktop/m-p/1620853">August 2024 Warranty Extension Details</a></p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The weekend bears down on us like a host of hissing, barrel-throwing psychics, but there is yet time for some brief updates on Remedy's Control 2, which Remedy say is coming along nicely. The same is apparently true of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/heres-a-second-very-tiny-look-at-remedys-co-op-control-spin-off">the multiplayer Control spin-off Project Condor</a> and the Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 remakes, on which Remedy are collaborating with GTA and Max Payne 3 developers Rockstar.</p><!--more-->
<p>As passed on by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/max-payne-1-2-remakes-are-in-full-production-control-2-is-now-in-a-playable-state/">VGC</a>, Remedy reveal in their latest <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/announcements/remedy-entertainment-plc-half-year-financial-report-january-june-2024-codename-condor-and-max-payne-12-remake-in-full-production-and-alan-wake-2-night-springs-expansion-launched/">financial report</a> that Control 2 has "progressed to the production readiness stage", following the delivery of "a build of the game showcasing several important features in playable form". They're now "scaling up" for full production. Teaser trailer with target visuals anytime, Remedy. I have yet to hear a telekinesis sound effect as gratifying as the one in Control. </p>
<p>The Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 Remake, meanwhile, has "progressed from production readiness to the full production stage". According to Remedy, the development team is currently working towards a version of the game that is playable from beginning to end. As for Condor - in which you seemingly join a scrappy group of federal agents, marooned within the Oldest House - "the development team has worked on multiple maps and different mission types, and we have organized a growing amount of internal and limited external playtesting for feature validation and feedback."</p>
<p>In February this year, Remedy acquired the rights to the Control franchise from 505 Games, giving them sovereign say over how and when Control games get published. Remedy also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/remedy-and-tencents-co-op-multiplayer-game-kestrel-has-been-cancelled">cancelled a Tencent collaboration codenamed Kestrel in May</a>, freeing up resources and people for their existing franchises.</p>
<p>Since then, the latest financial release explains, they've been "weighing self-publishing and related business models, as well as discussing different partner publishing opportunities" for both Control and the Alan Wake series. We can apparently expect to hear more "towards the end of the year". Here's my pitch for the future of Control: make a spin-off series based on CTRL+ keyboard shortcuts. CTRL+F could be a detective simulation, for example, while CTRL+O could be an open worlder, and CTRL-Alt-Delete is a special minigame I play with Alan Wake 2 as and when the raytracing gives my PC a seizure.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

There’s <em>Volgarr the Viking II</em>, the mega-powered hack-and-slash action platformer that will kill you, <em>a lot</em>, offering you the tremendous satisfaction of mastery as you eventually learn its perils and emerge victorious. And there’s <em>Abathor</em>, a somewhat less grueling (though by no means easy) barbarian side-scroller in which up to four players can tackle an epic journey across its dozens of increasingly wild and inventive stages. While both games are calling to me, I suspect that this weekend it will be the more immediately approachable <em>Abathor </em>I gravitate to first.<br></p><p>I was introduced to <em>Abathor </em>by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2217277843&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2217277843" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Twitch stream</a></span> from the always-entertaining Macaw45, a barbarian game connoisseur who, early on in the game, expressed mild disappointment with how plain its stages were. However, as the epic journey went on and on (and on), that disappointment gradually shifted to enthusiasm and awe as <em>Abathor </em>became more epic and crazed. In the days since, he has repeatedly gushed about how incredible the game finally becomes. I actually stopped watching his <em>Abathor </em>stream before he got too far, having decided that I wanted to experience its surprises for myself. This weekend, I intend to do that, at least when I’m not visiting the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://liretro.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://liretro.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Long Island Retro Gaming Expo</a></span> here in New York City. One thing’s for sure, it’s going to be an intensely retro-gaming-influenced weekend for yours truly, and I am stoked. —<strong>Carolyn Petit</strong> </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f2f36bc4632d9110383420b7b2770033" data-recommend-id="image://f2f36bc4632d9110383420b7b2770033" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ship combat in Cat Quest III." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ship combat in Cat Quest III." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Gentlebros</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f2f36bc4632d9110383420b7b2770033" data-recommend-id="image://f2f36bc4632d9110383420b7b2770033" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ship combat in Cat Quest III." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Play it on: </strong>PS5, PS4, Switch, Xbox X/S, Xbox One, Windows<br><strong>Current goal: </strong>Make this fantasy a reality</p><p>Look, I’ll be honest with you. So many of these entries I write are more wish than fact. They’re the games I <em>wish</em> I were going to be playing this weekend. And were life more generous, I totally would be! Sometimes I even do. But also, I have a child, and it needs to be taken to its swimming lesson at 9.15 a.m. Saturday, and then to its tennis club at 11, and then demands to be entertained in some manner throughout the afternoon, and by the time I’ve cooked dinner (chicken curry this Saturday) and got the smaller human to bed, the adult human demands I sit with her and watch shit on the TV. Then much the same for Sunday.</p><p>So, if a magic time fairy magically gives me an expanse of child-free time this weekend, I would really like to play <em>Cat Quest III</em>. Admittedly I’ve yet to get very far with <em>Cat Quest II</em>, having completed the first game last year, but still, it looks lovely. I want to be playing that. —<strong>John Walker</strong></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1367079c813f54f41bf85fb0f73560f7" data-recommend-id="image://1367079c813f54f41bf85fb0f73560f7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Balloon arch!

If you’ve been through the kind of experience you know is going to fuck up your nervous system for several months to a year, you know that there’s a lot of built up emotional anguish that can sometimes feel impossible to get out.<br></p><p>So my plan this weekend is to induce a full-blown cry by getting back to <em>1000xResist</em>. I’ve unfortunately neglected the game for a few weeks, as I’ve gotten pulled around by other responsibilities. But the dystopian adventure game has already hit me in the gut multiple times just in its early chapters. I feel like I’m due a life-changing video game experience, and I can see it on the horizon with this game. —<strong>Kenneth Shepard</strong> </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b70931b5571b4d769a525f06ff95b520" data-recommend-id="image://b70931b5571b4d769a525f06ff95b520" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="You know, I've totally forgotten who this guy is, but he's defiantly holding up a fist with some magic light." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="You know, I've totally forgotten who this guy is, but he's defiantly holding up a fist with some magic light." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Larian Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b70931b5571b4d769a525f06ff95b520" data-recommend-id="image://b70931b5571b4d769a525f06ff95b520" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="You know, I've totally forgotten who this guy is, but he's defiantly holding up a fist with some magic light." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S<br><strong>Current goal:</strong> Restart the game and catch up to my old file</p><p>Truth be told, I’ve been a little jealous of everyone who’s fallen in love with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-bg3-review-dungeons-dragons-rpg-larian-1850726491&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-bg3-review-dungeons-dragons-rpg-larian-1850726491"><em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em></a></span>. It seems like it’s genuinely one of the best games ever, but I wouldn’t know since I’ve hardly played it. I’ve restarted it a few times across a few different platforms and I just <em>can’t</em> stick with it. Maybe it’s that I’m burnt out, but it’s absolutely impossible for me to conceive of sitting down anytime soon and sinking a hefty amount of time into anything, let alone <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>.</p><p>However, as sure as the drop in the weather and the changing of the color of the leaves, the fall season always makes me crave a deep RPG to sink my teeth into while I melt into my couch or bed. As we get closer to the all-time best season of the year, I’m beginning to set out my plan of attack.

I think this year might be <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>’s chance to climb into my pantheon of autumnal dungeon crawls. I’ve already reinstalled it, so even if I don’t commit right now, I <em>am</em> committing to all 122 GBs that are sitting on my console at the moment.

It’s still a lot of fun taking a small squad of robots into a hideout, killing everything in sight, and then stealing the loot before you get shot to shreds by overwhelming waves of reinforcements.

I’m not sure I’d have downloaded and played it, but after reading his review and other people’s thoughts on the game, I was curious. The pitch that it’s a PS2-like action-strategy game with simple base building and fun <em>Dynasty Warriors</em>-like combat intrigued me.<br></p><p>Since starting the game, I’ve been hooked. It’s not the best-looking game ever made, nor is it the most advanced thing I’ve ever played, but it does remind me of the random PS2 games I’d play back in the day. Back when I’d stroll through my local Blockbuster, looking for something new while my parents picked out a movie. <em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em> is the kind of game I’d see a few times over the course of a month or two, but never pick it up. Finally, I’d give it a shot probably because the games I wanted that week were already rented. And it was these random games that would sometimes blow me away. I can imagine a much younger Zack falling in love with this weird game about protecting a goddess and saving villages on a mountain. He’d get a kick out of it, even if he could barely pronounce most of the enemy names in it. —<strong>Zack Zwiezen</strong></p><p>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
