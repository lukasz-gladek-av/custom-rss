And<a href="https://www.kotaku.com.au/2024/05/gamestops-meme-stock-explodes-again-after-youtuber-roaring-kitty-returns/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> like its parent company</a>, EB Games is resorting to some really fuckin weird ways to try to stay in business.</p><p>Such as EB World PLUS, a new premium membership program that is asking people to pay AUD$49 a year to get a ramen bowl, a 5% discount off digital purchases (including most digital currencies and gift cards) and, best of all, a "buy 10 get one free" deal on all clothing.</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>INTRODUCING 📣 EB World PLUS!</p><p>Get more out of your EB World membership with amazing awards and benefits including free gifts, extra trade value, and MORE! Head instore or online from 9AM AEST tomorrow!</p><p>Unlock the power of PLUS! <a href="https://t.co/pMBsS0ad4T">pic.twitter.com/pMBsS0ad4T</a></p></div>— EB Games Australia (@EBGamesAus) <a href="https://twitter.com/EBGamesAus/status/1818547143210078695?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 31, 2024</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p>It is, in essence, a battle pass for a retail store. And like a battle pass in a game, it leaves free-to-play grinders who have spent years earning loyalty rewards as part of EB World (the chain's longstanding regular membership program) in the dust.</p><p>Even if you weren't an existing member, it's a stupid idea, and was instantly treated as such by the Australian gaming public, who flooded the replies of the announcement tweet with so many variations of "Yikes hard pass for me lol" and "This is the worst thing I've ever seen from you guys" that EB Games locked the thread down, leaving that initial wave of hostility frozen in amber forever, a fitting testament to a company and social media team that wrote the words "BUY 10 GET 1 FREE CLOTHING" and said yup, great idea, the kids will love this.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Luke Smith and Mark Noseworthy, two senior executives at Bungie, were both part of the recent round of layoffs, according to a new report. Speaking on his Game Mess Decides <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yszLbBLdM3Y" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">podcast</a>, Jeff Grubb confirmed that the duo were working on Payback, a new game set in the Destiny universe, but were let go as part of sweeping job losses at the now PlayStation-owned studio.</p><p>"[Smith and Noseworthy] were labelled as working on Payback. It was going to be the next big thing for Destiny, but not Destiny 3," Grubb said. "Luke Smith and Mark Noseworthy are no longer at Bungie. They were let go. They were caught in the executive and leadership shakeup mentioned in the blogpost. Payback has been shelved."</p><p><strong>[Update]</strong> Sources have clarified that Smith and Noseworthy's departure came as the Payback project was shut down, after which executive restructuring meant they had no path forward at Bungie. </p><p>Smith was executive director at Bungie and became a notable public-facing representative for the studio, having guided Destiny 2's narrative back to a place that excited fans and more clearly set up a long-term story for the sci-fi shooter. Noseworthy, meanwhile, was vice president of the Destiny universe and responsible for the overall strategy of Destiny as an intellectual property and a business.</p><p>GameSpot has contacted Bungie for a statement.</p><p>On July 31, Bungie executive <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-announces-mass-layoffs-less-than-two-months-after-destiny-2-the-final-shapes-launch/1100-6525438/#:~:text=In%20a%20blog%20post%2C%20Bungie,affecting%20more%20than%20100%20people." data-ref-id="1100-6525438">Pete Parsons confirmed the company is cutting around 220 people</a> from several departments. This number represents 17% of its workforce. A further 150 people are reportedly being moved around Sony Interactive Entertainment.</p><p>"Due to rising costs of development and industry shifts as well as enduring economic conditions, it has become clear that we need to make substantial changes to our cost structure and focus development efforts entirely on Destiny and Marathon," Parsons said. He also indicated that layoffs at "every level" of Bungie and that "most" of Bungie's executive or senior leader positions are impacted.</p><p>As part of the layoff announcement, it was also confirmed that Bungie is working on a brand-new game, but it is not Destiny 3 or Payback. Instead, this new sci-fi project will be developed at a new internal studio being set up within PlayStation.</p><p>The layoffs follow the release of Destiny 2's The Final Shape expansion, which was very positively received by fans. Although Destiny 2 remains one of the most popular games-as-a-service titles on the market, the significant job losses at Bungie have called into question what content players can expect going forward. According to Grubb, the larger expansions that Bungie has traditionally released are unlikely to return and players will instead be given smaller content packs.</p><p>Bungie is also working on a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-everything-we-know-about-bungies-extraction-shooter/1100-6514617/" data-ref-id="1100-6514617">new Marathon</a>, which is coming back as an extraction shooter.</p>

                <p>Often cited as the "best deal in gaming," <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-is-getting-a-price-increase-and-introducing-a-new-tier/1100-6524819/" data-ref-id="1100-6524819">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate is going up from $17 to $20 a month starting September 12</a>, but if you act fast, the Amazon-owned online retailer Woot is selling discounted <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kqzyfj.com%2Fclick-100770772-13142092%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fdigital-code-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-5&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fxbox-game-pass-ultimate-will-soon-cost-240-year-but-this-deal-drops-it-to-134%2F1100-6525487%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">prepaid Game Pass codes</a> that will save you a hefty chunk on the subscription service.</p><p>With the deal, you can grab a 30-day prepaid Game Pass Ultimate digital code for $13.49 (was $17) or a 90-day code for $36.49 (normally $51 at the Microsoft store). But that's not all--if you use the coupon code <strong>VIDEOGAMES</strong> at checkout, you'll get an extra $3 off your code. The coupon can only be used once, but that extra $3 helps make this one of the best deals on Game Pass you'll find. For comparison, after the price increase next month, three months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate will cost you $60, so this is almost a 50% discount based on the upcoming price hike.</p><p>This is a great deal even if you only grab one 30- or 90-day code, but the discount is a great excuse to load up on a few months worth of Game Pass Ultimate.</p><p>The current discount price works out to $143 for a year, or $435 for three years of Game Pass. When the price increase hits, a full year will cost $240 and three years will cost $720. At the time of writing, you can stack up to 36 months of Game Pass Ultimate in all countries where it's available, and Woot will let you order up to 24 codes (either 30-day or three-month versions) per customer. After September 18, you will only be able to prepay for 13 months of Gamepass. This won't affect any existing stacks that existing subscribers may already have. When the deadline passes in September, several other tiers of Game Pass will increase in price as well.</p><p>Other Game Pass price increases include PC Game Pass increasing from $10 to $12 per month, and the annual price of Xbox Game Pass Core is going from $60 to $75 a year. The $10 monthly subscription price will remain unaffected for that leaner gaming library.

Following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-developer-bungie-lays-off-220-staff-roughly-17-percent-of-workforce">yesterday's mass layoffs</a> at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> developer Bungie - in which 220 employees lost their jobs - a new report has claimed the cuts were a result of Bungie leadership 'overstating the studio's financial prospects' to Sony, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-buying-bungie-for-usd3-6bn">acquired the developer</a> in 2022.
</p>
<p>
That's according to sources interviewed by journalist Stephen Totilo, who, writing in his <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/">GameFile newsletter</a>, reports yesterday's job cuts were necessary to stem Bungie's continued financial losses. The studio is said to have repeatedly missed financial targets promised to Sony, and has reportedly lost money since the release of Destiny 2 expansion Lightfall in 2023.
</p>
<p>
Totilo claims yesterday's layoffs - the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2-developer-bungie-latest-playstation-studio-to-be-hit-by-layoffs">second round</a> of job cuts in less than a year - had long been planned, and "couldn't be avoided" even if this year's Destiny 2 expansion, The Final Shape, had "blockbuster performance". Bungie management reportedly concluded last year - amid poor sales and a dwindling Destiny 2 player base - it would need to "make deep cuts to show Sony's executives that it was taking its finances seriously", with the studio's autonomy - and management jobs - seemingly on the line if it failed to meet its targets.

<p>
That tallies with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2-staff-reportedly-worried-about-bungies-future">reports from IGN</a> last year, in which numerous Bungie employees told the publication the mood at the studio was "soul-crushing" as leadership implemented harsh cost-cutting measures, apparently in a bid to cling onto independence.
</p>
<p>
Totilo notes Sony's gaming division has reported slimmer profits in recent times, and that when Hermen Hulst and Hideaki Nishino <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-announces-two-playstation-ceos-to-replace-jim-ryan">replaced outgoing PlayStation CEO Jim Ryan</a> earlier this year, they wrote, "Expectations for us are high and we aim to drive improving profitability." However, Totilo's sources say employees have little animosity for Sony over the cuts, with many instead blaming Bungie management for promising unrealistic growth - an attitude reflected in staff social media posts <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inexcusable-current-and-former-bungie-employees-react-to-sweeping-layoffs">slamming studio CEO Pete Parsons</a> following yesterday's layoffs.
</p>
<p>
According to Totilo, Destiny 2 remains the only game currently making money for Bungie, and this year's The Final Shape expansion "sold less than Lightfall", despite its positive critical reception. That's a problem for a Bungie leadership still looking to prove it can turn things around to Sony, and perhaps not an easily solvable one. "The financials just don't work," one source told Totilo. "Destiny is an incredibly expensive game to make."

                <p>Just over a year ago, the performers in SAG-AFTRA went on strike against the major Hollywood studios and streamers over a variety of issues including a lack of AI protections. Now, the actors are on strike again against video game studios whom they claim have refused to offer the same AI protections that SAG-AFTRA secured following last year's strike.</p><p>"We've made deals with the studios and streamers," said SAG-AFTRA national executive director Duncan Crabtree-Ireland during an interview with the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/sagaftra-strike-video-games-ai-f3f18ad01c5b8f4d525a836aeb531447" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Associated Press</a>. "We've made deals without a strike with the major record labels and with countless other employers, which provide for informed consent and fair compensation for our members. And yet, for some reason, the video game companies refuse to do that and that's what’s going to be their undoing."</p><p>SAG-AFTRA members authorized a strike last week after negotiations between the union and the video game publishers dragged on for 18 months without a resolution. Some of the studios that the actors reached deals with last year, including Warner Bros. and Disney, have video game divisions as well. But that hasn't led to any movement on a new protections for the actors who lend their voices and likenesses to video games.</p><p>Until the strike is settled, SAG-AFTRA performers will not be able to perform any voiceover work for the video game companies. And to kick off the first major picket of the strike, the actors are protesting in front of Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank. That's where many of them spent a long hot summer in 2023 before a deal was finally reached for film and television performers the following fall.</p>

Desktop PC builder and retailer NZXT <a href="https://nzxt.com/news/flex">can ship you a whole gaming rig for as little as $59 per month</a> — as long as you provide your own mouse, keyboard, and monitor.</p><p>The Flex subscription program has been available for at least several months, based on <a href="https://nzxt.com/news/unleash-the-gamer-in-you-with-nzxt-flex-the-ultimate-pc-subscription-service">NZXT’s posts</a>, and the pricing and specs of the machines listed have changed over time. Now, it’s updating its three-tiered approach to PC renting with new specs, with its base <a href="https://nzxt.com/flex/player-one">Player: One</a> entry-level sub running $59 per month for a tower running an Intel Core i5 14400F and Nvidia RTX 4060 GPU. Stepping up to the mid-tier <a href="https://nzxt.com/flex/player-two">Player: Two</a> costs $119 per month for an AMD Ryzen 5 5600X CPU and RTX 4070 Super GPU, and the top-tier <a href="https://nzxt.com/flex/player-three">Player: Three</a> package costs $169 per month with an Intel Core i7 13700KF and RTX 4070 Ti Super. </p><p>All three tiers also require a $50 “setup and shipping fee” that will include the return label if you decide to cancel your subscription.</p><p>The NZXT site indicates that subscribers can expect to have a new or like-new Flex PC delivered within three to five days on a month-to-month term that’s free to cancel anytime. Customers will also have access to free replacements with 24/7 customer support if something should go wrong and guaranteed hardware upgrades every two years.</p><p>Two years is a pretty long period, and even with the cheapest Player: One model, you’ll have spent $1,416 to use that 4060 through 2026 (though, there should be a free upgrade at some point in that timeline). The Player: Three tier with 4070 Ti Super would cost $4,056 to rent for two years. </p><p>That’s the kind of money you could potentially spend to build your own 4090-level desktop that’s much more capable for 4K gaming. Woof.</p><p>We’ve reached out to NZXT for clarification on what the full specs are for each updated tier (including RAM and storage) and if subscribers have any incentives like rent-to-own pricing if they can buy their rented Flex computer.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Intel Corporation is reportedly going to lay off 15,000 employees, as the company makes drastic cuts. The company announced it will be seeking $10 billion in savings for 2025, which will lead to the layoffs of a large quantity of staff members.</p>



<p>Intel CEO, Pat Gelsinger, revealed the news of the lay offs earlier today to his staff, as the company is gearing up to make the cuts.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-intel-to-have-massive-layoffs-ahead-of-2025">Intel To Have Massive Layoffs Ahead Of 2025</h2>



<p>With competitors such as Nvidia on the market, Intel has decided to introduce a massive cost-saving plan, that will reportedly cost 15,000 employees their job.</p>



<p>In 2024, Nvidia was declared the world’s most profitable company as Intel missed its growth targets, according to Gelsinger.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Pat Gelsinger headshot</figcaption></figure>



<p>“Our revenues have not grown as expected—and we’ve yet to fully benefit from powerful trends, like AI,”&nbsp;said Gelsinger. “Our costs are too high, and our margins are too low. We need bolder actions to address both—particularly given our financial results and outlook for the second half of 2024, which is tougher than previously expected.”</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Our revenues have not grown as expected—and we’ve yet to fully benefit from powerful trends, like AI.</p>
<cite>Pat Gelsinger, CEO of Intel</cite></blockquote>



<p>So, where did all of Intel’s losses exactly come from?</p>



<hr>



<h3 id="h-challenges-faced-by-intel-foundry">Challenges Faced By Intel Foundry</h3>



<p>Intel also reported that a large reason for its losses in 2024 was due to challenges it faced revolving around the Intel Foundry. In fact, the Intel Foundry segment does not expect to see profits until 2027 at the earliest. </p>



<p>While Intel’s traditional business seems to be stable, it has still been impacted in recent days by heavy market demand for laptops and PCs. The company plans to produce a large amount of chips over the next year in hopes of competing with brands like AMD.</p>



<p>With a lowering share price, and many other issues revolving around Intel as of late, we can only hope to see the company bounce back, and that no more hard-working employees lose their jobs.</p>

It barely feels like five minutes since the last one, but, somehow, Gamescom is almost upon us again. Which means publishers are starting to detail their plans for the show - and in Microsoft's case, we <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/08/01/xbox-gamescom-2024/">now know</a> that'll include daily livestreams for those at home, plus over 50 playable games for anyone wandering the Koelnmesse's halls.
</p>
<p>
Attendees visiting Microsoft's Hall 7 Gamescom booth in person will find 50 games from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/xbox-game-studios">Xbox Game Studios</a>, Blizzard, Bethesda, and third-party partners, playable across 240 gaming stations. These include Age of Mythology: Retold, Ara: History Untold, Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a>: Milepost Zero, The Elder Scrolls Online: Gold Road, and Towerborne.
</p>
<p>
Playable third-party games, meanwhile, include Star Wars Outlaws, Space Marine 2, and the long-awaited Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl. A full list of games at the booth can be <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/events/gamescom">found here</a>.

<p>
And if you're wondering where Microsoft's flagship 2024 titles have got to, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-everything-we-know-9408">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a>: Shattered Space, and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/obsidians-avowed-reportedly-delayed-from-2024-to-early-next-year">reportedly delayed</a> Avowed will be present at the show but unplayable. Instead, all three games will be receiving "exclusive theatre presentations".
</p>
<p>
Additionally, those unable to attend this year's Gamescom can tune into three days of Xbox broadcasts live from the show floor. The first of these begins at 2pm BST/6am PDT on Wednesday, 21st August and will feature Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl, Atomfall, Age of Mythology, and more.
</p>
<p>
Then, starting at the same time on 22nd August, there'll be a look at Star Wars Outlaws, World of Warcraft: The War Within, Towerborne, and other titles, with Avowed, Ara: History Untold, and more getting a showing on 23rd August. Additionally, Bethesda is holding its own daily livestreams, and these'll kick off at 1pm BST/5am PDT each day.
</p>
<p>
Gamescom runs from 21st-25th August at the Koelnmesse in Cologne. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a>'s Gamescom Opening Night Live showcase kicks off the event on 20th August at 7pm BST/11am PT, and Eurogamer will be there with note pads, biros, and an eagerness to bring you news.

<p>Microsoft is planning for quite a lot of huge games to be shown off during this showcase, and the effort they are putting into the event isn't going unnoticed. Their effort comes at a time where the games industry is suffering a multitude of layoffs, with Bungie laying off 220 staff just the day before.</p>
<p>For Microsoft specifically, they have seen the layoffs of 1,900 staff, and have closed several Bethesda Studios, including the studio Tango Gameworks behind the iconic Hi-Fi Rush. In addition to Tango Gameworks, Arkane Austin was also shut down, the studio responsible for making Redfall.</p>
<p>However, in June, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-addresses-studio-closures-ign-live-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Phil Spencer</a> came forward to make a statement about the layoffs and said that he had to make "hard decisions" to be able to run a sustainable business. Some of the studio closures came as a massive shock, especially with the huge success of Hi-Fi Rush.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether gamescom will be a successful event for them, and whether it will help keep the business profitable, as Phil Spencer claimed in his statement, or whether the industry will continue to suffer from drastic cuts.</p>

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Uber Uniques are supposed to be the rarest, most powerful items in <em>Diablo IV</em> and they’re about to get completely reworked. Blizzard outlined <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-patch-notes-infernal-hordes-season-5-1851611347&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-patch-notes-infernal-hordes-season-5-1851611347">how each item is changing</a></span> in the upcoming Season of the Infernal Hordes to make the gear stronger across all builds. They’re also getting a new name.</p><p>The first thing to know about Uber Uniques in season 5 is that they are now going to be called Mythic Uniques. The second is that each one is getting major changes to its stats to make sure they can compete with the best Masterworked gear and feel meaningful and rewarding no matter which class you play as or which build you’re running. </p><p>Here’s the list of the eight current Uber Uniques getting overhauled, which have a small chance to drop in Nightmare Dungeons or can be crafted with Resplendent Sparks. The full changes are viewable in the above slide-show:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Tyrael’s Might </li><li>Ahavarion, Spear of Lycander </li><li>Andariel’s Visage </li><li>Doombringer </li><li>Harlequin Crest </li><li>Melted Heart of Selig </li><li>Ring of Starless Skies </li><li>The Grandfather</li></ul><p>Season of the Infernal Hordes goes live on August 6, adding a new wave-based mode, some more story questlines, and a ton of tweaks to classes, XP farming, and just about everything else in the game. It’s the big content update expected to carry players through to the Vessel of Hatred expansion coming to <em>Diablo IV</em> in October, and it comes after a massive overhaul of loot just last season.<br></p><p>Over a year into its life, the loot-driven action-RPG is arguably better than ever, even if it’s still not all some players had hoped, and might never be due to its modern, battle-pass-driven live service design. It’s still an excellent shut-your-brain-off-and-grind game, and it’s as good a time as any to start building a character for Vessel of Hatred. <em>Diablo IV</em> is also free with a paid Game Pass subscription on Xbox and PC, even if the price for those just got jacked up moving forward. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The narrative team has been all but eliminated. There are still tons of people supposedly left behind to continue working on <em>Destiny 2</em>, but these cuts signal shifting priorities at Bungie, and suggest that this game is going to be radically different moving forward.</p><p>According to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/live/h02ddwhq9uA&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/live/h02ddwhq9uA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Giant Bomb</em></a></span>’s Jeff Grubb, “different” is going to look like an entirely new content delivery method that might rub the <em>Destiny </em>community the wrong way. The cuts at Bungie appear to project a new vision of the live-service game’s future, a vision that moves away from large-scale expansions full of new areas, assets, and so on that have historically come about once a year. Instead, new content will dip into the studio’s existing resources—which appears to be in line with the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-episodes-next-year-1851530230&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-episodes-next-year-1851530230">planned updates for the rest of the year</a></span>—and be released in smaller “content packs.” In other words, the team is moving away from growing the game to simply keeping it running.</p><p>Bungie will continue supporting <em>Destiny 2 </em>with smaller releases while it gets <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marathon-shooter-best-vibrant-colorful-bungie-trailer-1850481359&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-shooter-best-vibrant-colorful-bungie-trailer-1850481359"><em>Marathon</em></a></span><em> </em>(due in 2025)<em> </em>off the ground and spins off an in-development title in a new franchise into a full-fledged studio under the PlayStation banner. But with a dwindling headcount—Bungie still has over 800 employees, but is down several hundreds since this time last year—and all these new projects, <em>Destiny 2 </em>is now just sitting in a sort of vegetative state, and it doesn’t feel like one it’ll stir from anytime soon.</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/bungie-ceo-layoffs-locked-account-destiny-pete-parsons-1851610118&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/bungie-ceo-layoffs-locked-account-destiny-pete-parsons-1851610118">Bungie Devs React To More Mass Layoffs: ‘My Whole Team Is Gone’</a></span></p><p>The hope appears to be to continue producing content for the live-service treadmill, but cut back on spending, which will be reflected in the size of future updates as well as the number of people actually working on <em>Destiny 2</em>. Despite repeated calls for Bungie to drop the game in favor of producing another numbered sequel in the franchise, <em>Bloomberg</em>’s Jason Schreier has <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/jasonschreier/status/1819075149360185737&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/jasonschreier/status/1819075149360185737" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">confirmed</a></span> that <em>Destiny 3</em>, which was believed to have been canned as part of these layoffs, was never in development in the first place.</p><p>To be clear, most fans assumed that after <em>The Final Shape</em>, <em>Destiny </em>would slow down as it ramped up new narrative arcs or a potential new game. Following the latest expansion, the studio reworked its seasonal model into an episodic one, cutting back from four seasons a year to three episodes. The episodes are divided into three acts each, which Bungie suggested would translate to even more content. But considering the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-episodes-seasons-changing-weekly-stories-1851583614&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-episodes-seasons-changing-weekly-stories-1851583614">tepid reaction to the relatively thin episode</a></span> that’s in progress, players are already beginning to feel like they’ve been led on by the studio and we’ve barely gotten outside of <em>The Final Shape</em>’s launch window.</p><p>Now that it’s been confirmed that no new game is on the horizon, the community is left with an increasingly convoluted and quickly aging game, a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-episodes-seasons-upset-echoes-1851564928&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-episodes-seasons-upset-echoes-1851564928">disappointing evolution of a busted content delivery model</a></span>, and no promise for something better in the near future. They’ve been stranded.</p><p>Moreover, discontent with Bungie continues to foment in the community over a lack of communication about this uncertain future. The studio has refused to outwardly commit to any future plans beyond what’s been announced, which consists of the next year’s episodes, and a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://v&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://v/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">content pack codenamed <em>Frontiers</em></a></span>. People want to be excited about the journeys to come. and more importantly, they want to know that <em>Destiny </em>is a thing they can continue to come back to. They want to feel like their investments in the series aren’t completely wasted. In return, Bungie’s leadership seems content to string them along in the hope that nebulous promises make good while they tear the studio apart looking for any remaining stones to bleed for a bit more money.</p><p>Paired with the confirmation that there is no numbered sequel in the works, the severity of these layoffs, the lack of meaningful communications, and a move away from expansions portend a grim picture for <em>Destiny. </em>Despite being billed as the end of the beginning, <em>The Final Shape </em>really is beginning to feel like the nail in the game’s coffin. There appears to be no certainty that <em>Destiny </em>will even be around in a few years, or that it’s a priority to the studio outside of being a cash cow riddled with microtransactions. So long as it can maintain a number of players who are actively playing (and more crucially, <em>spending</em>), Bungie seems to have placed any plans for <em>Destiny</em>’s continued growth on an indefinite hiatus. </p><p>Throwing further fuel on the fire, one person who wasn’t impacted by this week’s layoffs was Pete Parsons, Bungie’s CEO and the man who multiple former <em>Destiny </em>developers claim is largely to blame for the hard times the team’s fallen on. As developers were laid off earlier this week, repeated calls for Parsons’ job popped up from a number of senior developers who’d previously departed the studio, with one calling Parsons a “joke,” while another accused the CEO of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/bungie-ceo-layoffs-locked-account-destiny-pete-parsons-1851610118&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/bungie-ceo-layoffs-locked-account-destiny-pete-parsons-1851610118">turning <em>Destiny </em>into “a money pit with no return.”</a></span> Accordingly, it was discovered that Parsons, who players and employees now have to trust to steward the franchise and studio, has <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/bungie-pete-parsons-layoffs-classic-cars-sony-buyout-de-1851610196&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/bungie-pete-parsons-layoffs-classic-cars-sony-buyout-de-1851610196">spent more than $2.3 million buying cars</a></span> since Bungie was acquired by Sony.</p><p>I trust that the talented developers left behind are going to continue to try their hardest to take care of <em>Destiny</em>, a franchise I care for more than I like to admit. But it pains me to say that I don’t know if I trust Bungie’s leadership to ever enable it to be the best that it can be. And so as regrettable as it may be, it might be time to let <em>Destiny </em>go. At least until it’s in capable and caring hands again.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Infernal Hordes, however, is just the tip of the iceberg. A new type of dungeon meant to introduce some of the mechanics of Infernal Hordes, Hellbreach dungeons, will also be added. Completing these will progress a new Reputation track, The Mother's Gift, which has been overhauled compared to previous seasonal Reputations to have better rewards, more ways to earn reputation, and be the main way players will progress the seasonal storyline.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4s-bosses-are-getting-some-big-changes-in-season-5/1100-6525482/" data-ref-id="1100-6525482">Bosses are seeing some big changes</a>, the most notable being that world bosses will have a new mechanic called Resilience that will "normalize" damage in Diablo 4's open world and prevent them from being instantly killed by overpowered players. Season 5 introduces notable changes to XP rewards as well, with side quests, priority quests, and class quests rewarding more XP. Fighting monsters that are up to 30 levels higher than the player will reward progressively more XP, encouraging players to fight harder enemies (if they can handle it).</p><p dir="ltr">On the class front, Blizzard is keenly aware that Barbarians are considered to be the best class in the game, in large part thanks to having access to more item slots for Legendary Aspects. Blizzard will be looking to bring Barbarian down a notch while bringing up other classes to compensate. One way it will do that is by adjusting the amount of damage players gain from their core stat on a class-by-class basis. Barbarians will receive 1% additional damage for every 10 Strength, while Necromancer, Sorceress, and Druid will receive 1% more damage for every 8 of their core stat. Barbarian is seeing some significant adjustments to its Key Passives, but it's not all bad news, as Hammer of the Ancients, as well as various Barbarian Uniques, will receive buffs.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking of Uniques, a big part of Season 5 is making Uniques worth using again in a post-<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-diablo-4-loot-reborn-update-will-make-its-items-and-players-more-powerful-than-ever/1100-6523061/" data-ref-id="1100-6523061">Loot Reborn update world</a> where Legendary items are often a better pick. Blizzard has reworked nearly every Unique in the game to make them much more powerful and appealing to players. It's far too long of a list to detail in full here, but you can check out Blizzard's <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo4/24123440/diablo-iv-1-5-0-patch-notes" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official patch notes</a> for more details. The rest of the patch notes can be found below.</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo 4 Season 5 will be around a month shorter than previous Diablo 4 seasons, running for around two months instead of three. That's because Diablo 4's first expansion, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-coming-october-4-new-trailer-revealed/1100-6524085/" data-ref-id="1100-6524085">Vessel of Hatred, and Season 6 will begin on October 8</a>. The expansion will introduce a brand-new class to the franchise, the Spiritborn, guardians of the jungle that can summon powerful spirit gods to aid them in battle.

It seems aimed at leaning even more into the action RPG’s strengths of letting you blow up a whole screen full of enemies in mere seconds. </p><p>Out August 6 after weeks of being previewed on the PC-only public test servers, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo4/24123440/diablo-iv-1-5-0-patch-notes?blzcmp=blizzard-news&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo4/24123440/diablo-iv-1-5-0-patch-notes?blzcmp=blizzard-news" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the version 1.5.0 patch notes</a></span> for season 5 outline another host of refreshing changes ahead of the <em>Vessel of Hatred </em>expansion coming later in October. The masterworking material penalty for other players in the party entering The Pit is going away, the legendary drop-rate for monsters over level 100 in Helltides is going up, and basically every unique piece of gear in the game is getting a major rework. </p><p>Content-wise the big new thing will be <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo4/24119591/slay-endless-demons-in-season-of-the-infernal-hordes#Hell&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo4/24119591/slay-endless-demons-in-season-of-the-infernal-hordes#Hell" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Infernal Hordes</a></span> which are available in both the seasonal and eternal realms. Players complete other end-game activities to earn Infernal Compasses that initiate the wave-based horde mode. They select from various Infernal Offerings to augment the quality of rewards and difficulty of the enemies after each 60-second onslaught. During the overall run there are limited revives and special mini-bosses that spawn. Collecting Burning Aether during the event determines what rewards you can unlock at the end. At the end of every run, players face a random assortment of three different Fell Priests each with unique abilities. </p><p>The mode sounds like a lot of fun, though how well it performs will come down to just how engaging it is and whether the challenge and time required feels worth the level of rewards earned. Between overhauled Helltides, The Pit, and now Infernal Hordes,<em> Diablo 4</em> is putting together a nice buffet of different ways for players to grind XP and earn rare loot by using all of the powers they’ve unlocked and customized to just murder hundreds of enemies a minute. </p><p>Season of the Infernal Hordes is also adding multiple new questlines and over 50 additional unique and legendary pieces of gear to be discovered. Baneful Hearts are being made more plentiful in Helltides, experience earned from higher level enemies is going up, and of course there’s a new battle pass for cosmetics and other unlockables. Some of the biggest changes to existing content, however, is an overhaul of uniques, including uber uniques which will now be called mythics, to make them feel more special. </p><p>“With Season of the Infernal Hordes, we wanted to make Uniques special again, in pursuit of equalizing all builds across the game,” the developers wrote earlier this week. “Our goals were to make build-defining uniques the best item for the skill they support, and for their corresponding affixes to have values that are best in that slot. Considering Uniques can’t be tempered, we wanted them to feel competitive to affixes that can be tempered.”</p><p>The patch notes for season 5 show how each of the existing uniques will change. Doombringer, for example, will increase health by a bigger percentage, healing per lucky hit, damage reduction, and overall damage output. Harlequin Crest will increase maximum life and cooldown reduction more, as well raise armor by a ton. It’ll take a while to see how all of the changes cash out, but uniques are already looking a lot more impactful and powerful on the whole. </p><p>Here’s the full list of patch notes for version 1.5.0 in Season of the Infernal Hordes: </p><div data-type="BlockQuote"><h3 id="h53177"><a id=""></a>Game Updates</h3><h4 id="h53178"><a id=""></a>Infernal Hordes</h4><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Distinct audio queues have been added to signal the beginning and end of a wave.</li><li>The number of waves has been tuned.Tiers 1-3: 6 WavesTiers 4-5: 7 WavesAll other tiers remain unchanged.</li><li>The wave timer has been reduced to 60 seconds.</li><li>The number of Monsters encountered has been generally increased across the board.</li><li>The Health Pools of the Council and other Bosses have been reduced.</li><li>Infernal Compasses can now be acquired more frequently and through more means.Tier 4-5 Compasses can drop in High Tier Nightmare Dungeons.Tiers 4-8 Compasses now naturally drop in high tier Pit runs.Tiers 4-8 Compasses will now rarely drop in Helltide and from Whisper caches after completing these tiers of Nightmare Dungeons or Pits.

                <p>Is it really a Call of Duty game without some zombie options? <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2024-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6523361/" data-ref-id="1100-6523361">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> isn't going to break from that tradition when it launches this fall. Activision Blizzard developer Treyarch already announced that there will be round-based zombie action in Black Ops 6. Now, Treyarch is offering a few ominous teasers about the mayhem ahead.</p><p>The official Call of Duty account on X has a brief video that directs fans to go to <a href="https://thetruthdies.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">TheTruthDies.com</a>, with only a brief glimpse of zombies. But it only gets weirder from there.</p><p>The website features a TV screen that offers a scrolling program menu and six different channels that be accessed, but only two of the channels currently have anything that can be seen. Each channel is initially innocuous before the music shifts into a scarier key and flashes of a grotesque bunny plushie appear with menacing laughter. The program menu also shifts to display prisoners in cells who don't look like they're infected... at least not yet.</p><p>The prevailing theory online is that the prison setting will be one of the two zombie maps that will be available when Black Ops 6 launches. But until Treyarch releases more details, we can only speculate how or if that location will be utilized.  </p><p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will be released on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC on October 25.</p>

                <p>The next Destiny game, codenamed Payback, was reportedly canceled a while ago, and it looks like Sony will be supporting Destiny 2 for the near future.</p><p>According to Bloomberg's <a href="https://x.com/jasonschreier/status/1819075149360185737" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Jason Schreier</a>, Destiny developer Bungie was reportedly working on Payback, which was a spin-off. However, the project was reportedly canceled a while ago and only "very early work" was done on it. Schreier also clarified that a "Destiny 3" was not canceled because it was never in development anyway.</p><p>Giant Bomb's Jeff Grubb said on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/h02ddwhq9uA?si=_PqjluvwffhewBaN&amp;t=950" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Game Mess Mornings</a> that reportedly Bungie referred to Payback as "the next Destiny" and not Destiny 3, but it was indefinitely shelved. "Either way, let's be clear, a 'Destiny 3' or 'next Destiny' is just not the thing that they are going to be coming out of this looking toward let alone working on in any real way," he explained.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02ddwhq9uA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/h02ddwhq9uA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Additionally, Bungie is reportedly committed to supporting Destiny 2, but future content updates will be significantly smaller compared to the large expansions that the game has had in the past like the most recent The Final Shape. Reportedly, Bungie refers to them internally as "content packs" now.</p><p>Bungie laid off more than <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-announces-mass-layoffs-less-than-two-months-after-destiny-2-the-final-shapes-launch/1100-6525438/" data-ref-id="1100-6525438">200 people yesterday</a>, with some remaining employees transitioning to internal positions within now-parent company Sony as well as creating a new studio to work on a new action game. According to Grubb, Bungie reportedly still expects its extraction shooter, Marathon, to still hit its 2025 release window.</p>

            <p>
<strong>UPDATE 10.06pm:</strong> Following a bit of an "oopsy" on developer FuturLab's part, Steam users now have an additional two <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/powerwash-simulator">PowerWash Simulator</a> levels to blast into a state of cleanliness alongside today's intended cruise ship release.
</p>
<p>
It's not <em>entirely</em> clear how the mishap occurred, but it started after Steam users began reporting they were unable to play PowerWash Simulator's cruise ship DLC following its release earlier today. Then, while FuturLab was orchestrating a fix, the game's <em>next</em> update - The Muckingham Files 4 - managed to work its way onto Valve's store ahead of schedule.
</p>
<p>
As a result, Steam users now have access to two additional PowerWash Simulator jobs: they can hose down crypto enthusiast Devon King's vandalised modern mansion, as well as pilot Floraine Perez' fire plane - which is looking a bit worse for wear after a flight over Mount Rushless.
</p>
<p>
"As this is Steam only (for now, sorry) please just pretend it didn’t happen," FuturLab <a href="https://x.com/PowerWashSim/status/1819103826139353159">noted on social media</a>. "We'’ll have info on other platforms soon."
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>ORIGINAL STORY 9.09pm:</strong> PowerWash Simulator is the game that keeps on giving, and I don't just mean giving me a delighted Pavlovian tingle every time it makes a "ding" sound. Nope, developer FuturLab has just released another free update and it's the perfect summery excursion as the sun beats down.
</p>
<p>
Arriving less than two weeks after PowerWash Simulator's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/powerwash-simulator-gets-two-new-maps-as-part-of-free-update">previous free update</a> - which added the Aquarium and Submarine as two new areas to squirt upon - the wash-'em-up's latest update whisks players away from the town of Muckingham's mainland and deposits them out at sea. Specifically, onto the Crab Bay cruise liner's sundeck following a "rather messy departure".
</p>
<p>
"Ticked off tourists, fried foods and greedy gulls do not make for most folks' idea of a dream holiday," explains FuturLab <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2736330/PowerWash_Simulator__Cruise_Ship_Sun_Deck__Summer_2024/">over on Steam</a>, "but you are not most folks. If the destination is dirty, you're on board! With the sun on your back and cool mist on your visor, cleaning up feels like a breeze. Say 'bon voyage' to dirt as you slough off the remnants of an avian air assault, revealing the vivid sun deck beneath. Ahhh, so satisfying."

<p>
And for the full, summery effect, players can also don the new custom summer suit - complete with eye-catching floral design - alongside the matching summer gloves and power washer skin. As a reminder (because this caught me out last update), today's new map is being released as free DLC that you'll need to manually download from your platform store of choice.
</p>
<p>
All this follows the launch of PowerWash Simulator's latest paid expansion, the Lewis-Carroll-inspired <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/powerwash-simulators-alices-adventures-dlc-gets-july-release-date">Alice's Adventures DLC</a>, back in June. And as for what's next, that's still TBC, but FuturLab promises "more to come very soon" as part of the game's two-year anniversary celebrations - and its <a href="https://x.com/PowerWashSim/status/1676168982347251713">updated 2024 roadmap</a> says to expect further free content in "Q4".

<div>
<div><p>Wizards of the Coast has announced a new Secret Lair superdrop for <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a>. This latest batch celebrates a pivotal milestone for the world's most popular fantasy TTRPG, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>. It is the aptly named Secret Lair x Dungeons &amp; Dragons 50th Anniversary Superdrop.</p>

<p>According to an official press release, the Secret Lair x Dungeons &amp; Dragons 50th Anniversary superdrop is a series of five limited edition drops. Each of these drops will feature artwork and characters from the rich fifty-year history of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/secret-lair-x-dungeons-dragons-50th-anniversary-karlach-fury-of-avernus-card-artwork.jpg?itok=JgQXLFkG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/secret-lair-x-dungeons-dragons-50th-anniversary-karlach-fury-of-avernus-card-artwork.jpg?itok=eNih0_er 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The name of those five drops are as follows:</p>
<ul><li><em>Secret Lair x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: An Exhibition of Adventure</em></li>
<li><em>Secret Lair x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Astarion's Thirst</em></li>
<li><em>Secret Lair x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Karlach's Rage</em></li>
<li><em>Secret Lair x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Death is in the Eyes of the Beholder I</em></li>
<li><em>Secret Lair x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Death is in the Eyes of the Beholder II</em></li>
</ul><p>This isn't the first time <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> has crossed over with <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>. There have been two different sets in the popular card game set in the TTRPG setting: <em>Adventures in the Forgotten Realms</em> and<em> Battle for Baldur's Gate</em> respectfully.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/secret-lair-x-dungeons-dragons-50th-anniversary-astarion-the-decadent.jpg?itok=MXSZ_Wq3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/secret-lair-x-dungeons-dragons-50th-anniversary-astarion-the-decadent.jpg?itok=sqKuFWp5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This is important because some of the cards in the Secret Lair x Dungeons &amp; Dragons 50th Anniversary superdrop may be reprints of cards from these sets with alternative artwork. This is supported by two cards featured in the press release, <em>Karlach, Fury of Avernus</em>, and <em>Astarion, The Decadent</em>, both of which were featured in <em>Battle for Baldur's Gate</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“This is a special year for <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> fans, and we couldn’t think of a better way to celebrate 50 years of such an amazing game than by bringing our two games together,” said Mark Heggen, Vice President of Collectibles, <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>. “Each of these Secret Lair drops represent the legacy and impact of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> and it’s thrilling that <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> fans can be part of this celebration.”</p>
<p>"It's always incredible to see iconic <em>D&amp;D</em> art, monsters, and characters come to life on Magic cards! These Secret Lair cards capture the essence of D&amp;D, giving fans of both games something truly special to add to their collections," said Jess Lanzillo, VP of Franchise and Product for <em>D&amp;D</em> at Wizards of the Coast. "Whether you're a <em>D&amp;D</em> fan, a <em>Magic</em> enthusiast, or both, these drops offer a unique way to celebrate and connect with these games that have brought fans so much joy and community for decades."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each drop in the Secret Lair x Dungeons &amp; Dragons 50th Anniversary Superdrop will be sold in both non-foil (MSRP $29.99) and foil (MSRP $39.99). It will go on sale August 27.&nbsp;</p>
