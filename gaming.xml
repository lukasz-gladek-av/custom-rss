                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/relooted/" data-ref-id="5000-681702">Relooted</a> has been a big surprise for me. Trailers for the game seemed to advertise the sidescroller as a parkour-driven platformer game, but after playing it, I realized that it's first and foremost a <em>heist </em>game. While nabbing your prize and skillfully maneuvering through obstacles to reach the goal as fast as possible is a core part of the gameplay loop, the far more important component is the actual planning and setup stage that occurs beforehand, where you take on the role of a crew's mastermind and plan out every step of the heist.</p><p dir="ltr">Set at the end of the 21st century, Relooted sees you play as Nomali, who puts her intelligence and acrobatic prowess to good use when she gets roped into heading up a crew of everyday citizens turned thieves. The crew plans on breaking into museums and mansions across the West to steal back the African artifacts locked away in vaults. Not for personal gain, of course, but to return them to where they rightfully belong.</p><p dir="ltr">Each mission begins with you mapping out the target, identifying which doors will lock when the alarms sound, which windows you can break through, where a zipline can be placed, and other aspects of the heist. During this planning stage, you can move certain objects too, like tables that can be placed to keep a door from fully closing, or put into a spot to act as a vault to reach otherwise unreachable ledges. Once you take the artifact, the alarms will sound and you'll have only a few seconds to make your getaway. Your job is to prepare enough so that the parkour challenge in front of you is quick and doable, and most missions don't have a singular solution.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmPIK9z9lDI" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OmPIK9z9lDI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">From what I've played, it makes for a fulfilling, puzzle-driven experience that rewards you for experimenting and trying to solve a heist in your own way. I really enjoyed the half-hour of the game I've played, falling in love with Relooted's setting, characters, and gameplay loop. It's currently one of my most anticipated games of 2025, largely for how good it felt to see my well-laid plans culminate in perfect escapes or adaptation in the moment resulting in nail-biting close calls.</p><p dir="ltr">Ahead of Relooted's release, I spoke with a few members of South African studio Nyamakop to discuss the game's futuristic African setting, development, and heist-driven gameplay. The game is set to launch for Xbox Series X|S and PC--it doesn't yet have a firm release date.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>GameSpot: While the Afrofuturism setting has a decent foothold in pop culture, a futuristic Africa doesn't. Where does the team start from when crafting this world and these characters, and how do you avoid just using Afrofuturism themes and tropes? </strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Creative Director Ben Myres</strong>: So on the visual design side of the stuff, [narrative director Mohale Mashigo], me, and Bongane [Mahlangu], our art director and our concept artist, used to have some very intense battles and fights over how the character should look. Because there are some references, but there aren't a lot. You have to basically know concept artists on the continent that are imagining future Africa and just be able to find them on Pinterest and stuff. But there's this tension between how ritualistic you want the characters to look.</p><p dir="ltr">You also need to consider the functionality of the outfits. They are running and doing a heist at the end of the day. So it needs to be functional but maybe not too functional--it still needs to be cool. And then you also need to [consider] how far in the future [the game is]. How futurist can we make it as well? Is it completely alien? But if you do that, then some of the African and local place references become harder to spot for the people who know them and see them.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Mohale Mashigo</strong>: Some inspiration also came from contemporary African designers.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4527338-re2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4527338" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4527338-re2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4527338"></a><figcaption>Relooted takes place in the future near the end of the 21st century.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4527338-re2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>In terms of the makeup of the team, are y'all all in this same location?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Producer Sithe Ncube</strong>: A lot of people are based in Johannesburg. Some people are based in Cape Town, but we also have people [elsewhere], like a 3D artist in Ethiopia. But even among the people who are working on the game, there are people [of] different backgrounds. I'm originally from Zambia. When I started on this, I was living in Port Elizabeth and now I'm in Johannesburg. We also had people work on the game from Ghana [and] Nigeria. And the voice actors are also from [all over]. They have different backgrounds as well, all of which are pretty close to the backgrounds of the actual characters.</p><p dir="ltr">For me personally, even before I started working on this project, I've been very interested in what people are doing in other parts of Africa in terms of game development.</p><p dir="ltr">I'm always very curious to know about them [and] how [their heritage and background] actually lends itself to the game. Because there are some instances where it's like, maybe we need a pronunciation for this type of thing. And you can ask someone who's very close with someone in the team or even just someone within the team.</p><p dir="ltr">Even the environment art [is affected]. Someone told me that they really like the rooftops in our game and I was like, "What?" I've literally never heard anyone comment on rooftops, but they said, "Yeah, you can see that it's purposely African. It's good."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4527339-re3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4527339" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4527339-re3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4527339"></a><figcaption>Each artifact that you recover is real, and Relooted details the origins of each mark you go after.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4527339-re3.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>I love that though! I love that there's just someone out there that's like, "You know Relooted? You know that game? Awesome African rooftops. Peak authenticity when it comes to rooftops." Speaking of the rooftops--you spend a lot of time running along them as you plan stuff out. Does the game ever put limits on that planning stage, like the amount of time you can take?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Myres</strong>: I think we thought about doing it at some point. I think we might've even had versions where we tried it out, but what we're looking at is trying to essentially adapt the heist filmic structure to a game. And to do that you almost have to focus on just one part of the structure because of just the way games work. And the part we really wanted to focus on recreating was being in a heist montage from a heist film and usually in films you as the viewer don't know the plan until the end and you watch them go through the plan, but in games you can't necessarily do that. You can't have all this hidden information from the player.</p><p dir="ltr">So we had to focus on allowing the player to figure out the plan so that when they're executing it, they understand what they've been doing. So as a result, we realized that putting that time pressure there might weaken that aspect of it because you won't understand the plan as well. And there are often some pretty hard levels where if you've missed a certain step in at least the core path, there aren't a lot of ways out. So we tested that idea [of a time limit], but it just ended up ruining the sort of rewarding feeling that you get when you're executing and flowing through a plan that you've made up yourself. You feel like a genius, like, "Damn, this is my plan."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4527340-re1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4527340" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4527340-re1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4527340"></a><figcaption>Before you jump into the thick of things, you need to plan the heist.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4527340-re1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>When it comes to heist games, I think there's this almost innate draw to add new tricks and tools so missions can grow increasingly complex. When it comes to Relooted, when do you stop gaining new tools? And does the game hit a sort of stable level of complexity when that happens?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Mashigo</strong>: So each team member is essentially the tool that you need and you have to [recruit them]. In the story, you'll see that, "Okay, I probably can't use the locksmith Trevor only by himself," and then narratively, it'll be like, "Well, you need to go find somebody else," and you acquire [each member] slowly, but eventually you learn how to use the team better. As the levels get bigger, [you begin to realize that] they can't be everywhere. They're only human. They're not magical. And then you have to decide, "I have to put him here because I think I can go through there and maybe she'll be there." And so your tools are your team actually, so you feel like you're working with people.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Myres</strong>: I'm trying to think when does that end exactly? When does Lusa join the team?</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Mashigo</strong>: It ends in the beginning of Chapter 6. That's when she joins.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Myres</strong>: Yeah, so it's like the beginning of Chapter 6 of the eight chapters [when] you get the last crew member and then there are some absurd or at least one very absurd level that you have to play [after that]. It's quite complicated. So it does get more complicated, but I think it almost asks you to be more tactical and there's one level towards that [point], somewhere in those chapters that is very elaborate and complex.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Mashigo</strong>: It's a monster.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Myres</strong>: The demo you played is very compressed because we wanted people to be able to see the best part of the game in a shorter period of time, but it takes quite a while to build up to that in the actual game because there's so many small, tiny mechanics that you have to understand in order to execute a heist fully. But the game is actually quite a slow burn of increasing complexity--at least until chapter six. And then at some point between Chapter 6 and Chapter 8, we just throw [in a monster level].</p><p dir="ltr"><em>This interview was edited for both brevity and readability.</em></p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4</a> recently received new cosmetic bundles as part of the launch of Season 9, and while they are much cheaper than the usual skins and cosmetics offered in the in-game shop for Blizzard's ARPG, players don't seem too impressed with the value.</p><p dir="ltr">Each class has received a new cosmetic bundle labeled in the in-game shop as an "Essentials Pack." These cosmetic packs contain six skins for that specific class for only 500 Platinum, which roughly equates to $5. That makes these class bundles some of the most affordable microtransactions offered in Diablo 4 to date, as most of the game's cosmetic bundles (like its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-berserk-crossover-is-a-huge-wasted-opportunity/1100-6531373/" data-ref-id="1100-6531373">limited-time Berserk cosmetics</a>) often cost $25 or more.</p><p dir="ltr">Players on places like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1lpamvl/new_store_deal_6_skins_for_500_plat/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=action_bar&amp;embed_host_url=https://www.icy-veins.com/d4/news/new-diablo-4-store-deal-offers-6-skins-for-just-500-platinum/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a>, however, aren't too impressed at the value of six skins for $5, as the outfits look mundane when compared to Diablo 4's pricier cosmetics. Some on the Diablo 4 subreddit point out that the skins look to be modified or reskinned versions of armor that already exists in-game for free, though some sets come with a unique helmet or other changes. One player in the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1lpamvl/comment/n0v3i9h/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">comments</a> points out that they already own some pieces of these bundles despite having never bought any cosmetics, instead having acquired them through playing the game and dismantling items to acquire the transmog. For those who have already acquired some of the cosmetics in the bundles just by playing the game, the bundle price decreases slightly.</p><p dir="ltr">With the skins looking so similar to that of transmog options already present in Diablo 4, some players are wondering why they weren't simply included for free, while others think $5 is a fair asking price. Others, however, think $5 is far too steep for slightly altered items they may already own.</p><p dir="ltr">It's not the first time players have criticized Diablo 4's microtransactions. More recently, players have taken issue with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-battle-pass-overhaul-isnt-going-over-well/1100-6531240/" data-ref-id="1100-6531240">Diablo 4's revamped Reliquary battle pass system</a>, which grants fewer rewards and less premium currency than before. Since the Reliquary system's debut as part of Season 8, players have discovered the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-new-reliquary-battle-pass-system-is-even-worse-than-players-originally-thought/1100-6532514/" data-ref-id="1100-6532514">battle pass is even worse than originally thought</a>, as previous issues have compounded with poor UX design, pricey bundles, and confusing wording.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard said it has heard the negative feedback regarding the Reliquary system and will be looking to make changes in the future, but those changes didn't come in time for Season 9. In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1kt05z4/comment/mtsld3l/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">comment</a> on Reddit earlier this year, Diablo director of social and content marketing Adam Fletcher said the goal of the Reliquary system is to add cosmetics for all players, not just those who pay more money, and that Blizzard will look to bring "better options and value" when it comes to cosmetics tied to crossover events.</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo 4 Season 9, which brought <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-9-will-bring-big-permanent-changes-to-nightmare-dungeons/1100-6532690/" data-ref-id="1100-6532690">permanent changes to Nightmare dungeons</a> and lets players <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-9-will-let-players-build-their-own-spells/1100-6531782/" data-ref-id="1100-6531782">craft their own Horadric spells</a>, launched July 1 and is slated to end on September 23. Old-school Diablo fans may also have something to look forward to, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cryptic-diablo-2-anniversary-tweet-is-giving-fans-hope-for-new-content/1100-6532876/" data-ref-id="1100-6532876">Blizzard seems to be teasing new Diablo 2 content</a> might be on the way.</p>

Most of us here at <em>Kotaku </em>own the thing and have been playing it over the past four weeks. Now that we’ve had extensive time with the Switch 2, what do we think about it? How has Nintendo’s follow-up to one of the most revolutionary video game consoles of all time turned out? We gathered everyone on staff with a Switch 2 and asked them to weigh in on a few topics.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0baa1469b490b61470f1c432195fc892" data-recommend-id="image://0baa1469b490b61470f1c432195fc892" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Luigi drifting." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Luigi drifting." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0baa1469b490b61470f1c432195fc892" data-recommend-id="image://0baa1469b490b61470f1c432195fc892" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Luigi drifting." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Like most folks, the Switch 2 game I’ve put the most time into is <em>Mario Kart World</em>, though not as much time as you might think. A lot of my time with the Switch 2’s launch line-up has also involved booting up <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, being like, “Oh wow, this works pretty well,” then closing it out. <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> on a handheld is the kind of sicko shit that should have me glued to my Switch 2, but once the novelty wears off, I remember I’ve played it fairly recently and it can’t maintain my attention for that long. Funnily enough, the game I’ve spent the most time playing on my Switch 2 is a Vita game from 2015. Shout-out to <em>Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth</em>. It’s a bit telling that Switch 2 games aren’t really what I’m playing on my system. While it’s certainly not set up to fail in the same way, the launch line-up of mostly older games that put the system’s jump in power front and center is giving Wii U. These games are great, they run well, and it’s nice to have them on something I can play on a plane. But I’m waiting for <em>Donkey Kong </em>and the Switch 2 version of <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>. — <strong>Kenneth Shepard</strong></p><p><em>Mario Kart World </em>is really, really good! It’s a blast to play with friends or by yourself. It looks sharp, performs perfectly, and even includes a nifty open world that’s fun to explore. And uh, well, ummm, I guess there were some other games, too. But nearly every game available on Switch 2 at launch was something I’ve played or could play on another, more powerful platform. Yes,<em> Cyberpunk 2077</em> looks nice on a Switch 2, but I’ve got it on PC. And Xbox Series X. I think when the dust settles and we look back on the Switch 2’s launch, it will be clear that it’s one of the weakest debut line-ups in Nintendo history. -<strong>Zack Zwiezen</strong></p><p>The launch lineup always felt weak, but a month with the new hardware has made that fact inescapable. My<em> Mario Kart World </em>excitement (and that of my kids) petered out after the first couple of weeks. I think <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and <em>Hitman: World of Assassination</em> both run decently—much better than PS4/Xbox One games did on the Switch 1. <em>Street Fighter 6</em> plays well on the Switch 2 as well. It’s far from ideal-looking, but I hope many more people now experience last year’s excellent <em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em> thanks to the Switch 2 port. But between Game Pass (<em>Rematch</em>/<em>The Alters</em>) and <em>Elden Ring: Nightreign </em>and<em> Death Stranding 2</em> on PS5, I’ve barely touched the new console this last week. Does<em> Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom </em>look better than ever? It sure does, but I already played over 100 hours of it on Switch 1. — <strong>Ethan Gach</strong></p><p>Though I bought <em>Street Fighter 6 </em>for my Switch 2 and am still looking forward to playing through its RPG-lite story mode, World Tour, at some point, the two games in heaviest rotation on my Switch 2 have definitely been <em>Mario Kart World </em>and <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>. <em>MKW </em>is a delight. Every time I fire it up and see Mario or Wario or Wiggler or some other character tooling around in that bright, inviting landscape, I just feel good, ready to hit the open road. Still, now that I’ve gotten gold in most of the game’s single-player cups and knockout tours, I’m not playing it as regularly as I did initially. I do still enjoy jumping in sometimes to try to defeat another Nintendo-provided ghost racer in a time trial or to tackle a few more P-Switch challenges, though. And I’m always down to hop into online action with friends, where the game really shines.</p><p>But, oddly, it’s not a Nintendo game that’s keeping me most occupied with my new Nintendo console—which definitely makes this a departure from a typical Nintendo launch for me. Instead, it’s <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>. I have my issues with this game but it plays great on Nintendo’s handheld hybrid, and I love smoothly shifting from a Night City session on my TV to a bit of gameplay in bed. As much as I’m in awe of the port, though, which indicates to me that the Switch is capable of some very impressive things, it is odd and arguably not great that the strongest thing available out of the gate on the Switch 2, for me at least, is a game that’s several years old and available on numerous other platforms. Of course, it’s early days yet, and <em>Donkey Kong Bananza </em>is just a few weeks away. But I hope Nintendo has a few other surprises up its sleeve to give these first few post-launch months a little more oomph. — <strong>Carolyn Petit</strong></p><p>There were launch games? I don’t think I can count five-year-old ports in that category, so we’re pretty much left with <em>Mario Kart</em>, and…ehh. It’s quite something when adding an entire open world still leaves the game feeling far too much like other recent entries, and as such, it has made the Switch 2 itself feel so utterly unessential on launch. That’s the word I keep coming back to, when friends ask if it’s worth buying one for themselves or their kids. Honestly, right now, it’s just inessential. I really hope that will change once <em>DK</em> is out. — <strong>John Walker</strong></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fb493a3f5158cef82e3505901f3b5553" data-recommend-id="image://fb493a3f5158cef82e3505901f3b5553" data-format="jpg" data-width="2397" data-height="1350" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Switch 2 with the Joy-Cons detached." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Switch 2 with the Joy-Cons detached." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fb493a3f5158cef82e3505901f3b5553" data-recommend-id="image://fb493a3f5158cef82e3505901f3b5553" data-format="jpg" data-width="2397" data-height="1350" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Switch 2 with the Joy-Cons detached." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The Switch 2 feels hefty, but also, maybe <em>too</em> hefty. The original Switch felt mostly fine, but its Joy-Cons were about as sturdy as a children’s toy. Switch 2’s controllers feel expensive and premium, and the bigger screen does feel like a pretty sizable upgrade from the Switch. The downside is that the Switch 2 is heavy enough to give me wrist pain when I’m holding it for too long. As such, I try to play mine in tabletop mode as much as possible when I’m in bed, and the Joy-Cons are the perfect controllers for a side sleeper who sets the Switch 2 up on its kickstand next to his pillow. The Switch 2 feels like a high-end device, but it comes with drawbacks to my wrists. — <strong>Kenneth Shepard</strong></p><p>The Switch 2 looks great and feels even better, at least relative to the Switch 1. I don’t like that the back panel still flexes and feels hollow, and the Joy-Con are still a bit too wobbly for my taste. I wish there were some great third-party portable-mode alternatives for the Joy-Con right now, but because of the magnetic locks it seems like Hori and others will need a minute to develop the Switch 2 versions of their Switch 1 controllers. Also the screen blur feels like I’m drunk. Just kidding, I actually can’t tell at all. Despite the technical tests revealing staggeringly slow refresh speeds for the Switch 2, I’ve had zero complaints so far. I love that the screen is edged this time too, instead of the rounded surfaces of the original. — <strong>Ethan Gach</strong></p><p>I’m no <em>Digital Foundry</em> so my understanding of what’s actually inside the new box is limited, but it sure <em>feels</em> better. It’s a joy to play <em>Metroid Prime Remastered</em> and not have to wait for the doors to open after shooting them. As for the Switch itself, it feels very solid, the kickstand feels sturdy, and there’s nothing cheap or tacky about it. But, like its only launch game, it certainly suffers from looking and feeling far too much like what we already had. — <strong>John Walker</strong></p><p>I’m not the type to scrutinize my device’s screen for faults or to measure frame rate on one platform against another, so I’m not really the person to ask serious questions about hardware quality. I can say that I have no complaints; the device has a sturdy heft to it, the screen is—to my eyes—bright and captivating, and the Switch 2 Pro Controller feels like a natural extension of my hands. — <strong>Carolyn Petit</strong></p><p>The OG Switch felt like a cheap toy in my big, dumb hands. In less than a week, the kickstand on my Switch broke, and it flapped open when I tried to hold it as a handheld. One of my Joy-Cons succumbed to stick drift and had to be taken out back. It never completely failed on me, and it was always charged and ready for me to play it. But using the Switch was a disappointing experience for me.</p><p>Switch 2, on the other hand, is wonderful. It feels like a high-end tech device, which is nice considering its daunting price tag. The kickstand is strong. The Joy-Con feel better. Everything feels better. The screen is also bigger. The whole unit just sits more comfortably in my massive, chunky hands. And that’s all I wanted. -<strong>ZZ</strong></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5c1fe1e7bc6256b6c00c2c1f7f41e8dd" data-recommend-id="image://5c1fe1e7bc6256b6c00c2c1f7f41e8dd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot of the Switch 2's main menu." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of the Switch 2's main menu." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5c1fe1e7bc6256b6c00c2c1f7f41e8dd" data-recommend-id="image://5c1fe1e7bc6256b6c00c2c1f7f41e8dd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot of the Switch 2's main menu." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The Switch 2’s user interface and home screen are essentially carbon copies of the OG Switch. Some are disappointed by this, but I like it. For so long, consoles have tried to reinvent the wheel with each new release. And so each new console generation brings fresh menus that have to be updated and improved, as they often lack key features and options found in the old UI. But with the Switch 2, Nintendo took a page from Xbox and just copied the old UI, improved it in some small ways, and called it a day. Would I like some new themes? Sure. For now, though, the UI and menus work perfectly, and I didn’t need to relearn everything. That was nice. -<strong>ZZ</strong></p><p>I guess you don’t have to fix what isn’t broken, but it was kind of funny to boot up the Switch 2 and see its menus look exactly like those of the first system. This is pretty standard fare for tech these days. You boot up an old iPhone, and its screen looks pretty similar to a brand-new one. However, this doesn’t happen as much with game systems. The UI of most video game consoles looks noticeably different from that of its ancestors. Though the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S kept visual elements from their predecessors, they weren’t carbon copies of the last generation. The Switch 2’s menus are faster and snappier, but if you put a gun to my head and showed me both screens side-by-side, I’m not sure I’d be able to differentiate between the two. — <strong>Kenneth Shepard</strong></p><p>It’s fine? Hardly anything is different. The responsive eShop is nice but I’m betting performance on that does not hold up even by the end of the first year. And there’s still so much negative space in the home menu and no way to customize it. Sigh — <strong>Ethan Gach</strong></p><p>I genuinely found the Switch 2’s UI to be profoundly disappointing. Psychically upsetting, even. There’s always that horrible moment after you’ve bought a new phone, spent all that money to buy a slightly improved rectangle, then transferred across all your stuff to realize it now just looks like the phone you already had. That was exactly my experience with the Switch 2. I did the data transfers as instructed on first booting, and then had this gut-punch moment when I looked down and saw…my old Switch. Same games, in the same order, in the same layout, with the same poorly labeled on-screen buttons. For god’s sake, they could at least have given it a punch-up, just <em>something</em> new. — <strong>John Walker</strong></p><p>Nintendo knows how to be subtly charming, using cute little blips and blops to lend a sense of laid-back fun to UIs that prioritize simplicity, elegance, and ease of use. The Switch 2’s are basically a redux of the original Switch’s in this regard, and why not? That all worked fine. (Well, the eShop certainly didn’t, and it’s great to see it running so much more smoothly and quickly here, but the basic design worked fine, and that’s largely unchanged.) I do hope Nintendo gives us more options for themes at some point, as I’d love to finally have a home screen on my Switch that boasts more personality. But I’m not disappointed with what’s here, even if it does feel like a bit of a missed opportunity to drive home the feeling that you’re using a new, more powerful device than the one you’ve been using for the past eight years. — <strong>Carolyn Petit</strong></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="aa7a4dba172d452b3bf43437ff553648" data-recommend-id="image://aa7a4dba172d452b3bf43437ff553648" data-format="jpg" data-width="1596" data-height="896" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A bunch of people playing Mario Kart with cameras on." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A bunch of people playing Mario Kart with cameras on." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="aa7a4dba172d452b3bf43437ff553648" data-recommend-id="image://aa7a4dba172d452b3bf43437ff553648" data-format="jpg" data-width="1596" data-height="896" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A bunch of people playing Mario Kart with cameras on." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The Switch 2’s online features fall into the same trap as my PlayStation 5’s do, in that it’s so much simpler to connect with people on external apps, I don’t use the ones built into the system. The C button opens up GameChat, but it’s not as convenient as hopping on a Discord call and using better mics and cameras. It’s funny watching your friend’s camera shake when you hit them with a Blue Shell in <em>Mario Kart World</em>, but I can’t see myself using any of these internal systems when I’ve grown so accustomed to better, easier services to keep in contact with friends, regardless of if they’re playing a Switch 2 game with me. — <strong>Kenneth Shepard</strong></p><p>Once, while I was playing <em>Mario Kart World </em>with Zack and his wife Sarah, I hit him with a red shell as he sped past me. Not only did this make his kart spin out; it also made the live feed of his face, which was hovering above his kart thanks to the webcam he hooked up, spin around as well. What more could you want in a new console’s online features? GameChat owns, and I look forward to using it a lot more in the months and years to come. — <strong>Carolyn Petit</strong></p><p>Here’s something I never expected: To be impressed with a Nintendo console’s online features. The real star of the show is GameChat, which at first glance looked like a crappy Discord knock-off. And to be fair, it kind of is, but it also works brilliantly. I was able to play <em>Mario Kart</em> with my wife and I, sharing a TV, and two other people online. And it just worked.</p><p>We could chat to them and they could talk to us with no headset needed. I could even see their gameplay via the share screen feature. Their faces even appeared in the game thanks to the Switch 2’s webcam support. As someone who doesn’t use Discord much, having all this built into the console is nice and makes playing games online with our buddies so much more communal and friendly. -<strong>ZZ</strong></p><p>I honestly don’t know. I’ve only ever hit the C button by mistake, as the last thing I want is other people interfering when I’m trying to play video games. I guess I’m glad the device can run its own god-awful store software this time, though? — <strong>John Walker</strong></p><p>I tested out the GameChat and video share features and found them to be somewhere between barebones and a fun novelty. Quality aside, simply using the system still isn’t as easy or intuitive as what’s on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, and nothing beats Discord for cross-platform hangs (at least for now). Until Nintendo does something really creative with it, it feels like a function I’ll barely use because that’s not what I play on my Switch 2 for. —<strong> Ethan Gach</strong></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="027ba490f5b0ba39e4773858cdb30cd4" data-recommend-id="image://027ba490f5b0ba39e4773858cdb30cd4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1498" data-height="838" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A group of Switch 2s arranged in a circle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A group of Switch 2s arranged in a circle." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="027ba490f5b0ba39e4773858cdb30cd4" data-recommend-id="image://027ba490f5b0ba39e4773858cdb30cd4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1498" data-height="838" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A group of Switch 2s arranged in a circle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>I like my Switch 2, but it has mostly slipped comfortably into the same space in my life as the original Switch did. Sure, it’s a better One of Those, but that’s all it feels like right now. Without a big gimmick or game-changing shift, it’s the same thing with a bigger screen and heavier Joy-Con. I’m glad I got it, though. I was willing to pay half a grand for a device that would likely play <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> with fewer framerate dips and that would give me a new way to play <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>. I’m playing the thing pretty consistently, but I forget that it’s a shiny new thing most of the time. It is the most “phone upgrade” console leap I’ve felt in years. It’s a better-running Switch, for good and for ill. — <strong>Kenneth Shepard</strong></p><p>Incredibly mid! I think I’m more down on the Switch 2 than most, but it’s been a pretty underwhelming first month for me. After the initial dopamine hit of a new Nintendo handheld wore off I was left with a device that is markedly better but doesn’t have anything for me to really dig into yet. Hopefully, <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> turns that around. There’s certainly plenty of other Nintendo games coming out this year. But right now it feels more like I just went from the DS Lite to the DSi XL. The Switch 2 is nice to have but hard to justify. I look forward to singing its unqualified praises in a year, or when the OLED model inevitably arrives in 2028. — <strong>Ethan Gach</strong></p><p>One month in, I’d describe myself as tentatively very happy with my Nintendo Switch 2. It feels like a device that’s bursting with the potential to deliver terrific online experiences and absorbing single-player ones. <em>Mario Kart World</em>, with its support for up to 24 racers at once, and <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, with its wonderfully destructible environments, suggest that Nintendo is trying to demonstrate, right out of the gate, what sets the Switch 2 apart from its predecessor. But its future beyond <em>Bananza</em>’s release also feels pretty ill-defined at the moment, and whether or not it will continue to get the support it needs in order to make this first year a strong one remains an open question. Hopefully we’ll get a Direct this month to fill us in on what we can look forward to in the near future, and I can go from being tentatively pleased with my purchase to simply pleased. — <strong>Carolyn Petit</strong></p><p>I’ve already forgotten I own a Switch 2. It has become the new Switch and quickly has evolved into “my Nintendo console behind the TV.” In some ways, that might sound bad. I spent a lot of money on a device that has already disappeared into the background. Yet I see it as a positive. It shows that Nintendo succeeded at making a new console that was basically like your old one, but bigger, faster, and better in most ways. You don’t have to teach your kids how it works, buy new accessories for it, or rearrange your living room to make it work. It’s just a Switch, but nicer.</p><p>That does mean the Switch 2 isn’t a revolutionary device that will change how you play games. Instead, it will slot right into your daily gaming schedule, and the only time you’ll remember you upgraded is when you boot up something like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and go “Oh right, the old Switch couldn’t do this.” Mission accomplished, Nintendo. –<strong>ZZ</strong></p><p>I’m happier than the tone of my entries here would suggest. These headings just happen to highlight my areas of frustration. As a gaming device, I’m really pleased with it, albeit through a grey lens of annoyance given that my happiness is mostly because of improvements to things the original Switch was crap at. I wish Nintendo had been more imaginative here, even though sales have demonstrated that the company certainly <em>financially</em> made the right choices. I wish it were weirder, and I desperately wish Nintendo were not so hubristic as to have launched it with almost nothing new to play. But they’ve already sold over 5 million of them, so I doubt they’re looking for my advice on matters. — <strong>John Walker</strong></p></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-impressions-launch-games-comparison-1851785748]]></content:encoded>

<p dir="ltr">A lot has happened in the past decade for Rocket League. Within a month of launching in 2015, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rocket-league-passes-5-million-downloads/1100-6429303/">the game passed over 5 million downloads</a>.

            <p>
Apple is appealing the €500m (£429m) fine it received from the European Union in April over the restrictions it places on app developers wishing to use alternative purchase methods, insisting the punitive measure is "far beyond what the law requires".
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/apple-slapped-by-500m-eu-fine-for-app-store-practices-that-deter-alternative-payments-third-party-stores">European Union hit Apple with the fine</a> after accusing the company of violating its Digital Markets Act (DMA), a <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-markets-act-ensuring-fair-and-open-digital-markets_en">piece of legislation</a> intended to ensure major tech platforms behave fairly and in a way that doesn't stifle competition. Specifically, the EU had taken issue with Apple's "anti-steering" practices, which restrict iOS app developers' ability to link to alternative purchase methods away from its own App Store, where it takes a 30 percent cut.
</p>
<p>
At the time the fine was announced, the European Commission (the EU's executive branch) said the restrictions Apple imposed on app developers meant they weren't able to "fully benefit from the advantages of alternative distribution channels outside the App Store", while customers were similarly unable to "benefit from alternative and cheaper offers as Apple prevents app developers from directly informing consumers of such offers". Apple was then given 60 days to "remove the technical and commercial restrictions on steering and to refrain from perpetuating the non-compliant conduct in the future", or it would face further fines.
</p>
<p>
Apple responded by claiming it was being "unfairly targeting" by the EU, and that the measures it was being asked to implement were "bad for the privacy and security of our users, bad for products, and force us to give away our technology for free." It also promised to appeal the fine.
</p>
<p>
And that appeal is now underway. As <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/07/apple-appeals-eu-fine-app-store">reported by The Guardian</a>, Apple called the €500m fine "unprecedented" in a statement announcing its appeal to the EU's general court today, insisting it goes "far beyond what the law requires." The company added its appeal will demonstrate the European Commission is "mandating how we run our store and forcing business terms which are confusing for developers and bad for users." Apple reportedly also accused the commission of unlawfully expanding the definition of steering to include the ability for developers to promote offers inside an app, in addition to being able to link to an external website.
</p>
<p>
Apple (which also <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/ga/ip_24_1161">recieved a €2bn EU fine in March</a> for its "abusive" App Store rules) overhauled its App Store guidelines last month in a bid to curtail further action by the EU, introducing two new commission tiers for in-app purchases. At Tier 1, Apple will take a five percent commission, while only providing basic App Store features to developers, including app reviews and privacy labels. The likes of automatic app updates and automatic app downloads are not included. Tier 2, meanwhile, is the default tier and offers access to all App Store services for a 13 percent commission on in-app purchases.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, from 1st January next year, Apple is introducing a new Core Technology Commission of five percent on all digital goods and services sold on the App Store and alternative marketplaces. This replaces the company's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-returning-to-ios-says-epic-as-apple-agrees-to-alternative-app-marketplaces-in-eu">earlier, controversial Core Technology Fee</a>, which the EU also criticised in March, saying it "disinsentivised" App Store developers from using alternative app distribution channels and "failed to comply" with Apple's obligations.
</p>
<p>
Earlier this month, European Commission tech boss Henna Virkkunen said the <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-tech-tariffs-us-brussels-trade-commissioner-maros-sefovic/">EU wasn't prepared to negotiate on the rules</a> outlined in its Digital Markets Act, Digital Services Act, and AI Act, despite pushback from the Trump administration and US tech companies.

That said, shoutout to the current 5th place record holder for using Wiggler.</p><hr><h2 id="h3068"><a id="2"></a>Flower Cup</h2><p><strong>Desert Hills: Bowser</strong>’s super heavy stats dominate here. The Reel Racer will help you contend with the sandy terrain.</p><p><strong>Shy Guy Bazaar: </strong>Lightweights reign supreme through these winding tight corridors, with most record holders opting for <strong>Baby Mario</strong>. The Baby Blooper kart is popular here.</p><p><strong>Wario Stadium: </strong>Another showcase for lightweight characters, with <strong>Baby Daisy </strong>being the popular pick here. That said, the Reel Racer is currently a popular pick here too.</p><p><strong>Airship Fortress: </strong>Not to sound like a broken record, but lightweight characters once again win out here. <strong>Baby Mario </strong>dominates on bikes like the Mach Rocket, though Goomba is a surprisingly competitive pick here too.</p><hr><h2 id="h3069"><a id="3"></a>Star Cup</h2><p><strong>DK Pass: </strong>Super lightweights once again reign supreme here, but interesting enough, the dominant character here is <strong>Para-Biddybud</strong>. Baby Daisy also works here, and bikes like the R.O.B H.O.G fare well on these snowy peaks.</p><p><strong>Starview Pea: </strong>It’s another peak, but a different optimal character. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-bowser-jr-wario-waluigi-koopa-shy-boo-1851785552&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-bowser-jr-wario-waluigi-koopa-shy-boo-1851785552"><strong>Bowser</strong></a></span><strong> </strong>on the Reel Racer occupies nearly every fastest time recorded here.</p><p><strong>Sky-High Sundae: Wario </strong>is your go-to if you’re doing laps around these treats.

More like King Koopa Troopa Beach, because <strong>Bowser </strong>holds all the fastest times here. Interestingly enough, trucks like the Chargin’ Truck perform well.</p><p><strong>Faraway Oasis: </strong>Funny enough, this course doesn’t have a clear “best” combo. The current record holder uses <strong>Penguin </strong>atop the W-Twin Chopper bike, but Bowser, Mario, and even Birdo are all used in close runner-up rankings.</p><p><strong>Crown City: </strong>Yes, this is the second time Crown City has appeared in a cup. To refresh your memory, <strong>Wario</strong> in the Hot Rod is the top pick.</p><p><strong>Peach Stadium: </strong>Current record holders predominately use <strong>Wiggler</strong>, typically paired with the Big Horn truck.</p><hr><h2 id="h3071"><a id=""></a></h2><h2 id="h3072"><a id="5"></a>Banana Cup</h2><p><strong>Peach Beach: </strong>Peach Beach, similar to the Koopa Troopa Beach, favors <strong>Bowser</strong>.

However, all of them have used the Reel Racer to get there.</p><p><strong>Dino Dino Jungle: </strong>Now please hold your excitement, because I know how widely beloved this racer is, but <strong>Cow </strong>is the top pick for this course. What’s more, the best racers use the Li’l Dumpy truck here too. There couldn’t be a more deserving combo to succeed.</p><p><strong>Great ? Block Ruins: </strong>As you might expect from a track with so many tight corners, the super lightweights reign supreme. The likes of Para-Biddybud and Baby Daisy have achieved the fastest times, all while using relatively balanced bikes like the R.O.B H.O.G.</p><hr><h2 id="h3073"><a id="6"></a>Leaf Cup</h2><p><strong>Cheep Cheep Falls; </strong>It’s lightweight time again, except we’re not going for the lightest of the light characters this time around. <strong>Nabbit </strong>currently rules the falls while using the Reel Racer.</p><p><strong>Dandelion Depths: </strong>The heavyweights will plunge you furthest into the depths, as <strong>Wario </strong>using the Reel Racer is the dominant pick.</p><p><strong>Boo Cinema: </strong>In a huge change of pace, the best racer on Boo Cinema is none other than King-... nah I’m just playing, <strong>Wario</strong> using the Baby Blooper has all the top times here.</p><p><strong>Dry Bones Burnout: Wario </strong>and the Baby Blooper. Everywhere I go I see his face.</p><hr><h2 id="h3074"><a id="7"></a>Lightning Cup</h2><p><strong>Moo Moo Meadows: </strong>No fakeouts this time: <strong>Cow </strong>very appropriately is the top pick for Moo Moo Meadows. Surprisingly, the top vehicle choice here is the Dread Sled. I couldn’t think of a less appropriate kart to drive around a farm, let alone at top speed, but <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-direct-lore-pauline-cranky-kong-how-1851784745&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-direct-lore-pauline-cranky-kong-how-1851784745">let’s not apply logic to the Nintendo universe</a></span>.</p><p><strong>Choco Mountain: Bowser </strong>with the Reel Racer chews through this mountain the fastest.</p><p><strong>Toad’s Factory: </strong>Interestingly, the top times for this track are a tossup between our usual heavyweight champions: <strong>Wario </strong>and <strong>Bowser</strong>. That said, both of them use the Baby Blooper kart.</p><p><strong>Bowser’s Castle: </strong>This fearsome fiery world is a rare track where characters of all weight classes are in close contention. <strong>Wiggler </strong>does have the top spot, though. The B Dasher vehicle is a popular choice here.</p><hr><h2 id="h3075"><a id="8"></a>How to unlock Special Cup and Rainbow Road</h2><figure id="" data-id="c6532faba4da4d4aa894811ec57cd96e" data-recommend-id="image://c6532faba4da4d4aa894811ec57cd96e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Mario Kart World.

As you’d expect, <strong>Wiggler</strong> with the Big Horn still succeeds.</p><p><strong>Rainbow Road: </strong>Last but <em>certainly </em>not least, we have the majestic rainbow road. <strong>Wiggler</strong> is the king here, either using the Billdozer or the ever reliable Reel Racer.</p><hr><p>Those are all the tracks in <em>Mario Kart World</em>!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Karlach's greatest, rage-filled monologue is "the core of her" according to Samantha Béart.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Fan-favorite <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a> character Karlach is almost universally beloved for a number of reasons — chief among them, her cheery, sweet, and playful personality. But according to her voice actor Samantha Béart, that upbeat exterior belies something far, far darker, shaped by time spent in the bowels of Hell itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/samantha-beart-interview-karlach-baldurs-gate-3/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interview with The Gamer</a>, Béart spoke about their time playing Karlach, including the recording process and some very specific plot points. Béart specifically goes in deep on one of Karlach's late-game monologues, delivered after a character who has essentially ruined Karlach's entire life and future is finally dealt with.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Warning! </strong></em><em>Spoilers for Baldur's Gate 3 lie ahead. Read on at your own risk.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those who have played Baldur's Gate 3 and seen Karlach's story through know where this is going. Karlach is a tiefling who, prior to the events of the game, has spent a decade in Hell thanks to a fellow named Gortash, who sold her to an archdevil and replaced her heart with what amounts to a bomb that will eventually, inevitably kill her sooner rather than later.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That time in hell will really mess with a person, Béart says. So while most of the player's interactions with Karlach are jovial, that's Karlach making a choice to become someone better — it's not who she's always been.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“For me, [Karlach's story is] a redemption arc,” Béart said. “I think she was a piece of work in hell. She would have had to be [...] It was life in prison. That's where I was in my head with that, because otherwise, it's quite hard to relate it to something realistic. You just think about how people behave in those very small communities. Essentially, I think you can completely change to survive.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When the player finally slays Gortash, Béart as Karlach delivers an incredible monologue unleashing all the pent-up rage, sorrow, and fear that Karlach has felt from spending all that time in Hell and facing her own inevitable demise. It's a really fantastic scene, and according to Béart, that monologue is at the center of who Karlach is:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“That's the core of her. That's the bit of her she's been hiding until she can't anymore,” Béart explained. “It's a piece I auditioned with, so I always knew it was coming. When it did happen, all the gates were off. All the ugliness can come out. It was a very satisfying and cathartic experience to film."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Béart added that this side of Karlach is absolutely something they discussed with Larian during recording, so even during Karlach's most upbeat moments, that undercurrent of pain still exists, which is perhaps why Béart's performance throughout is so effective.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In fact, it's in no small part thanks to performances like Béart's that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-review">we gave Baldur's Gate 3 a 10/10</a>. "With crunchy, tactical RPG combat, a memorable story with complex characters, highly polished cinematic presentation, and a world that always rewards exploration and creativity, Baldur's Gate 3 is the new high-water mark for CRPGs," we wrote. Sadly, Larian recently said goodbye to active development on the game with its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-patch-8-notes-include-final-farewell-message-as-larian-looks-ahead">final major patch in April</a>, as the studio moves onto new projects.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Arcade Archives 2 Air Combat 22 Review - Screenshot 1 of 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157181/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>Namco's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ace_combat_7_skies_unknown_deluxe_edition">Ace Combat</a> series is one of the company's most enduring hits, and has been a solid part of its lineup for decades, selling over 20 million units in the process – yet the origins of the franchise are somewhat murky and certainly not as well known as, say, the <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/guides/best-ridge-racer-games-of-all-time-ranked-by-you">Ridge Racer</a> lineage.</p>
<p>This is somewhat ironic, as Ace Combat began life in the same fiery, amusement arcade cauldron as its car-based cousin – in fact, the very first instalment arrived in the same year that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/">Ridge Racer</a> was born: 1993. However, <strong>Air Combat</strong> was powered by Namco's System 21 polygonal arcade board, which wasn't capable of texture mapping; it would fall to its sequel, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/arcade-archives-2-air-combat-22">Air Combat 22</a>, to deliver an experience that offered more graphical impact. That's the game which is now part of Hamter's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/every-arcade-archives-game-on-nintendo-switch-plus-our-top-picks">Arcade Archives</a> series on Switch and Switch 2.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, Air Combat 22 used Namco's more powerful System 22 hardware, the same board which made the jaw-dropping visuals of Ridge Racer possible. The end result is a fascinating (if shallow) <strong>Top Gun</strong> simulator which laid the foundations of the Ace Combat franchise.</p>
<figure><a title="Arcade Archives 2 Air Combat 22 Review - Screenshot 2 of 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157170/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Air Combat 22 puts you in the cockpit of one of three planes — the Grumman F-14 Tomcat, Sukhoi Su-27 and the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor (all of them perform exactly the same) — and presents you with three game modes: Cadet, Topgun and Dogfight.</p>
<p>The Cadet mode is playable with or without a tutorial (the latter offers two branching pathways), and guides you through the basics of aerial combat, while Topgun is a far sterner challenge, giving three potential routes to the end and a far wider selection of objectives. Dogfight, meanwhile, places you in several one-on-one duels with the aim of surviving for as long as possible.</p>
<p>Your weapons are a Vulcan machine gun (with infinite ammo) and lock-on missiles (with finite ammo). Using the latter requires you to have a solid lock on your target (the missile literally won't fire until you do), but even then, you might not score a hit, as some enemy planes are capable of releasing countermeasures.</p>
<figure><a title="Arcade Archives 2 Air Combat 22 Review - Screenshot 3 of 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157177/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Taking down enemies with the Vulcan bags you more points, but you need to get in closer to use it effectively. It's possible to accelerate and decelerate using the 'ZL' and 'ZR' buttons respectively, so you have quite a significant degree of control over your aircraft, despite this not being a 'serious' flight sim – something that would transition neatly into the console versions of Ace Combat which were spawned from this game and its 1993 forerunner.</p>
<p>Visually and sonically, Air Combat 22 certainly <em>feels</em> like a game from 1995, and arguably lacks the same impact as Ridge Racer does, even on modern eyes. Still, it runs at a smooth 60fps and controls really well, and it's certainly possible to spot the DNA of the franchise when compared to later entries. As such, fans of Ace Combat will find a lot to like here, even if it's rather basic in comparison.</p>
<p>Like Ridge Racer, Air Combat 22 is limited by the fact that it's very much designed as an arcade experience rather than a home console one, and expert players will see pretty much all there is to see in the space of a day or two. Unlike Ridge Racer, however, there's less reason to return as you don't have the appeal of shaving seconds of lap times, although there is an undeniable attraction to increasing your score and bettering your performance in the Dogfight mode.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Air Combat 22 is arguably more interesting as a historical artefact than it is as a video game, but that's not to say fans of Namco's series won't extract plenty of enjoyment from it. Like stablemate Ridge Racer, it's a very limited experience designed around short-burst 'arcade' play, but it's still entertaining enough to be worth your time and money; hopefully, it sells well enough for Bandai Namco and Hamster to bring other classic 1990s arcade titles to modern systems.</p></section>

They were nice side dishes but no grilled steak. Everyone appreciates a good potato salad or baked mac, but that’s not why they show up to the BBQ. It has been this way with Xbox for over a decade now. </p><p>There’s no shortage of great games but few are exclusive and none of them—not <em>Forza</em>, not <em>Halo</em>, not <em>Starfield</em>—have popped like the biggest exclusive blockbusters on PS5. Unable to conjure a killer app, it’s tried to buy them, starting with <em>Minecraft</em>, but the result is now that the most compelling parts of Microsoft’s portfolio are all available elsewhere.</p><p>If a family member, friend, or some stranger at GameStop asked me if they should get an Xbox, my answer would look like a spreadsheet full of if/then functions. The value proposition of Game Pass remains strong but increasingly mired in asterisks. Genre diversity abounds and there’s early console access to some of the biggest Steam hits around. There is something for everyone on Xbox if they know how, where, and when to look. My answer for whether to get a PS5 would be much simpler: <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em>,<em> God of War Ragnarok</em>, <em>Spider-Man 2, </em>a dozen remasters of <em>The Last Of Us</em>. </p><p>These are not the types of games everyone buys a $500 machine for, but they are definitely the types of games a particular kind of person might buy a $500 machine for. The type of person who buys relatively few games—a yearly <em>Madden</em> update and the new <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>—but doesn’t really discriminate between genres and has no franchise loyalty. They want the big, cinematic blockbuster with a gameplay hook just meaty enough to be fun but not so complex it starts to feel like work. These are the types of games that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://deadgame.substack.com/p/unlocking-the-cheat-codes-to-geoff&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://deadgame.substack.com/p/unlocking-the-cheat-codes-to-geoff" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">often win Game of the Year at Geoff Keighley’s Game Awards</a></span>, and they just happen to be the type Sony spent the PS4 generation specializing in. </p><figure id="" data-id="23ed8e3a39523204422d2930f994124a" data-recommend-id="image://23ed8e3a39523204422d2930f994124a" data-format="png" data-width="1269" data-height="706" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Phil Spencer appears on stage at E3 2018.

A new <em>Fable</em>, first revealed before the Xbox Series X/S launched, remains a year out.</p><p>The Xbox 360 surged to prominence thanks in part to Bungie’s <em>Halo</em> and Epic Games’ <em>Gears of War</em>. Neither franchise has been the same under Microsoft’s in-house teams. That might be part of why the company keeps acquiring new ones rather than trying to build them itself. But the results have been just as uneven. “If that were the only reason for this wave of cancellations and layoffs, it would be a terrible shame, but a rational reality,” <em>Polygon</em>’s Oli Welsh <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/analysis/610779/microsoft-layoffs-perfect-dark-everwild-mismanagement&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/analysis/610779/microsoft-layoffs-perfect-dark-everwild-mismanagement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote last week</a></span>. “But the darker cloud hanging over the story is that Microsoft has—consistently and repeatedly, over decades—shown it has no aptitude for running the creative industry it just bought half of.”<br></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/latest-round-of-mass-layoffs-at-xbox-begin-with-200-job-1851785492&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/latest-round-of-mass-layoffs-at-xbox-begin-with-200-job-1851785492">A year before he began laying off thousands of staff</a></span> across Xbox’s now-sprawling empire of studios and publishers, Phil Spencer suggested Xbox’s fate was set in stone. The Xbox One generation was too disastrous to recover from. Players were now locked in. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-phil-spencer-interview-starfield-ps5-console-war-1850404446&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-phil-spencer-interview-starfield-ps5-console-war-1850404446">He called it “[the] worst generation to lose.”</a></span> That logic paved the way for Microsoft’s pivot away from hardware and toward becoming a third-party publishing platform hitched to subscription and cloud gaming. “There is no world where <em>Starfield </em>is an 11/10 and people start selling their PS5s,” he said in 2023.  “That’s not going to happen.” But <em>Starfield</em> wasn’t an 11/10 or even a 9/10, so we’ll never quite know. It was a convenient time for the quality of exclusives to stop mattering. </p><p>Having watched the Switch cruise to being the second best-selling console of all time purely on the back of first-party exclusives like<em> The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>, <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em>, and <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>, I’m not convinced that the games don’t matter.

If you stop, they definitely won’t. </p><p>“I’m proud to introduce the creation of a brand new Microsoft studio, The Initiative, led by Darrell Gallagher, a visionary storyteller who has worked across some of the most iconic franchises for over 20 years,” Spencer said back at E3 2018. “This new Santa Monica studio is building a team of world-class talent to create groundbreaking new game experiences.” It was a play for GOTY blockbusters right in PlayStation’s first-party backyard. The Initiative would have “the resources, the platform, and the creative independence to take bigger risks and create  even bolder worlds.” Apparently the risks were too big and the worlds were taking too long. <br></p><p><em>Correction 7/7/2025 3:04 p.m.: </em>Psychonauts 2<em> came day-and-date to PS5 as well as Xbox Series X/S. </em></p><p><em>.</em></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/xbox-perfect-dark-halo-gears-war-fable-ps5-1851785732]]></content:encoded>

I’ve only seen it offer one unconnected track at most among the listed choices. Picking Random in an online lobby <em>before</em> the recent update always resulted in a three-lap experience. After the update went live, picking Random now incorporates the chances of getting a connecting track from your current location. We don’t know what the odds are for anything, but most people are seeing the intermission tracks a lot more often.</p><p>I’m of the mindset that the function was likely bugged before. Choosing “Random” to limit the choices down to specifically closed-lap races doesn’t sound right when you think about it. This might be a case of something being fixed at the expense of being less fun. Then again, this game gives you vague settings labeled “Connected” and “Open” so who can say how the hell any of this is meant to work. <strong>For now, your safest bet for racing some simple laps online is to select an unconnected track whenever it’s a choice.</strong> If you don’t like the track or maybe don’t even get an unconnected option, go with random and pray for the best.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-bowser-jr-wario-waluigi-koopa-shy-boo-1851785552&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-bowser-jr-wario-waluigi-koopa-shy-boo-1851785552">Here’s Every <em>Mario </em>Villain Outfit You Can Collect In <em>Mario Kart World</em></a></span></p><p>Here’s hoping that <em>Mario Kart World</em> is updated in the future to make this easier and not more difficult…again.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The question of Game Pass profitability has been debated within the games industry ever since the debut of Microsoft's subscription service in June 2017. The way many saw it, Microsoft could use its near-endless pockets to subsidize the service for a while, but not forever. At some point, Game Pass had to become profitable on its own.</p>



<p>Over time, Microsoft has always maintained that Game Pass was indeed profitable and sustainable. In December 2019, Phil Spencer, head of the gaming division, <a href="https://wccftech.com/phil-spencer-on-xbox-game-pass-sustainability-its-doing-very-well-for-us-and-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>:</p>



<p><em>The only concern I ever see is people saying, "Is it sustainable? Can you continue this?" I'll say, Xbox Game Pass right now is doing very well for us and the people who are in it, and it's something … I think it's going to be really interesting, as Xbox launches next year, and it will be an interesting thing as people think about, "Wait a minute, I already have this library of games on this platform." We've never had a console that's launched with a library of games that people are going to have available day one.</em></p>



<p>However, between the slow growth of the subscriber base and the recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">studio closures and layoffs</a>, Game Pass is once again under fire by <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-bet-wrong-horse-subscriptions-says-analyst/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">analysts</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-pass-unsustainable-harmful-industry-arkane-founder/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">developers</a> alike who believe that Microsoft may have bet on the wrong horse and that ultimately, it won't be sustainable in the long run.</p>



<p>Now, Chris Dring, former GamesIndustry.biz Editor in Chief and now co-founder of The Game Business, has shared some important details on how Microsoft is allegedly calculating the profitability of the subscription service. Writing on X, he <a href="https://x.com/Chris_Dring/status/1941918116218638368" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>:</p>



<p><em>So costs associated with the Game Pass business is fees paid to third-parties, marketing, service costs… and by that measure, it’s profitable. What they don’t count is the lost revenue that Xbox’s first-party studios are seeing as a result of the service. I have to imagine if first-party studios received similar compensation, that profitability might not be correct. </em></p>



<p>Dring later clarified that he explicitly asked for clarification and was told that first-party costs were not included. Needless to say, that changes a lot, especially now that Xbox first-party studios include not only the likes of The Coalition, Halo Studios (formerly 343 Industries), et cetera, but also Bethesda and Activision Blizzard, two large publishers that own some of gaming's most prized intellectual properties. There's inevitably going to be some lost revenue by putting the likes of Call of Duty, Diablo, and DOOM on a subscription service like Game Pass from day one. How long Microsoft can afford to keep doing that remains to be seen.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/andrew-webster">Andrew Webster</a> <span>is an entertainment editor covering streaming, virtual worlds, and every single Pokémon video game. Andrew joined The Verge in 2012, writing over 4,000 stories.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>A bigger, more powerful Switch means bigger, more intensive games that take more time and money to make. But as development costs skyrocket across the industry, Nintendo seems to have a plan to keep things in control <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686603/nintendo-switch-2-review">as it transitions into the Switch 2 era</a>.</p><p>In response to a question during <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/qa2506e.pdf">a recent shareholders meeting</a> about the increased costs of making games for its new console, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa admitted that “recent game software development has become larger in scale and longer in duration, resulting in higher development costs. The game business has always been a high-risk business, and we recognize that rising development costs are increasing that risk.”</p><p>However, he said that Nintendo’s development teams are “currently devising various ways to maintain our traditional approach to creating games amidst the increasing scale and length of development. We believe it is important to make the necessary investments for more efficient development.”</p><div><p>“The game business has always been a high-risk business.”</p></div><div><p>The early lineup of first-party Switch 2 games has already shown Nintendo being more ambitious with its franchises on the enhanced hardware. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/interview/678097/mario-kart-world-nintendo-switch-2-interview-kosuke-yabuki"><em>Mario Kart World</em> introduced an open-world structure to the long-running racing series</a>, while the upcoming <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/694183/donkey-kong-bananza-preview-switch-2"><em>Donkey Kong Bananza </em>adds an impressive destructive element to a more traditional 3D platforming experience</a>. This has come with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/642868/nintendo-switch-2-price-console-games-accessories">increased costs for consumers</a>; <em>World</em> sells for $79.99, $10 more than most Nintendo games, while the Switch 2 itself is $449.99, a $100 jump over the Switch OLED. (In response to a question about these prices making it harder to reach younger audiences, Furukawa said that Nintendo is “closely monitoring to what degree the price of the system might become a barrier.”)</p></div><p>Of course, Nintendo is not alone, and the increased scale of game development has been disastrous for many of its competitors. Just last week <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/697125/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-2025">Microsoft’s gaming division was hit hard by layoffs and game cancellations</a>, while high-profile games like <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/675923/black-panther-cancelled-cliffhanger-studios-shut-down-ea">Black Panther</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24282900/sony-shutting-down-concord-firewalk-studios">Concord</a></em> have been shut down alongside their development studios. Nintendo has been one of the rare exceptions in the floundering game industry, but keeping that up will become increasingly challenging as games get bigger. Then again, Furukawa offered one concrete way of combating this: more smaller games.</p><p>“We also believe it is possible to develop game software with shorter development periods that still offer consumers a sense of novelty,” Furukawa said. “We see this as one potential solution to the concern aboutrising development costs and software prices, and we will explore it from various angles within thecompany.”</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/699429/nintendo-switch-2-game-development-costs]]></content:encoded>

Sure, before that, Duke had starred in some genuinely good games in the ‘90s, like <em>Duke Nukem 3D</em>. Since then, the famous (?) character has mostly stayed dormant. (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/VIZ4v5_j6aE&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/VIZ4v5_j6aE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">He did appear in a digital pinball table in 2023</a></span>.) But he’s finally back. Not in a new game, oh no, but instead as a sad crossover character in a free-to-play game featuring tanks. </p><p>Over the weekend, <em>World of Tanks</em> announced that Duke Nukem was going to be part of the game’s latest battle pass. They did so with a reveal trailer that harkens back to<em> Duke Nukem 3D</em>. It also features John St. John voicing Duke once more, a role he’s had since 1996. But this time, John barely sounds interested in what he’s reading. It’s the same lines again. At one point, Duke Nukem shouts “Shake it, baby!” at a tank. Mr. Nukem, are you okay? </p><p>Anyway, the new Battle Pass Special: Heroes’ Paths event starts on July 10 in <em>World of Tanks</em> and runs until July 21. Actual video game icon Lara Croft <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/4vpDPWJ9iRo&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/4vpDPWJ9iRo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is also part of the new pass</a></span>. Maybe one day her new game from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tomb-raider-lara-croft-crystal-dynamics-amazon-games-1849898949&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tomb-raider-lara-croft-crystal-dynamics-amazon-games-1849898949">Amazon will actually launch</a></span>? </p><p>Neither character makes a physical appearance in the game, as <em>World of Tanks</em> is about giant tanks fighting each other. So don’t expect Duke Nukem running around killing pig cops. Instead, the devs have picked two real-world tanks and modified them to better reflect Duke and Lara. Here’s how the developers describe Duke’s tank:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>[Duke’s tank is] the <strong>TS-6</strong>,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>a Tier IX U.S. assault heavy tank. A powerhouse of destruction, this tank mirrors Duke’s “all guns blazing” approach. It boasts a custom nuclear reactor, enhanced weapon systems, and aesthetic nods to Duke’s arsenal, including laser machine guns and grenade launchers. The tank’s design draws inspiration from classic Duke Nukem weapons such as the incinerator and fire extinguisher.</p></blockquote><p>No pricing information was included in the press release I received. The Heroes’ Paths battle pass is split into two chapters. One will provide 30 stages for Lara Croft, and the other will feature 40 stages for Duke Nukem. You’ll be able to unlock various cosmetics inspired by each character and their franchises. Hopefully, one of those is a good <em>Duke Nukem</em> game.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/duke-nukem-world-of-tanks-battle-pass-lara-croft-sad-1851785719]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">Just days after its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-adds-this-underrated-call-of-duty-game-today/1100-6532845/">Game Pass release</a>, Activision has taken the PC version of Call of Duty: WWII offline. The publisher didn't provide specific details on the issue, but the game's removal comes shortly after severe hacking claims.</p><p dir="ltr">Call of Duty players are pretty familiar with hacking situations in multiplayer and Warzone, but the ones seemingly plaguing the 2017 World War II shooter weren't the average variety of aimbots or wall hackers. The hacks reportedly being used in Call of Duty: WWII were RCE (Remote Code Execution) attacks, meaning players were losing control of their PCs through a security exploit. A similar attack happened to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dark-souls-servers-shutdown-after-exploit-allows-attackers-to-access-players-pc/1100-6499889/">Dark Souls 3 back in 2022</a>, which led to the entire trilogy being taken offline while the security issue was addressed.</p><p dir="ltr">Some Call of Duty players posted clips on social media to spread awareness on the hacking issue before the game was pulled, showing their PCs being hacked while playing WWII. One of the viral clips from the weekend comes from "<a href="https://x.com/wrioh75753/status/1940597447467979053" rel="nofollow ">Wrioh</a>," who shows an apparent RCE attack during a multiplayer match.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1941286795565728085" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">📢 Call of Duty: WWII<br>Call of Duty: WWII on PC Microsoft Store was brought offline while we investigate reports of an issue</p>  — Call of Duty Updates (@CODUpdates) <a href="https://twitter.com/CODUpdates/status/1941286795565728085?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 5, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">Activision didn't acknowledge these security risks with the game, and it instead made a <a href="https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1941286795565728085" rel="nofollow ">Twitter post</a> on July 4 to simply announce Call of Duty: WWII was brought offline on PC while it investigates reports of "an issue." There's also no mention of when the game will return to PC.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, there are still plenty of Call of Duty games available to play. Black Ops 6 and Warzone both feature the new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-4-reloaded-adds-beavis-and-butt-head-and-cel-shaded-maps/2900-6709/">Season 4 Reloaded</a> content, which includes new game modes, cel-shaded map variants, and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/call-of-duty-beavis-and-butt-head-event-all-weapons-skins-and-all-rewards/2900-6729/">Beavis and Butt-Head limited-time event</a>.
