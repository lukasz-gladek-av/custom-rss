            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Last year, <strong>EA</strong> announced that it planned to become a privately owned company, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-confirms-agreement-to-be-acquired-by-pif-silver-lake-and-affinity-partners-for-55-billion/">with the <strong>Saudi Arabia PIF</strong> and <strong>Silver Lake</strong> leading a '<strong>Consortium</strong>' of investors in a massive <strong>$55 billion</strong> buyout</a>. The buyout has already <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-shareholders-officially-approved-55bn-sale-to-saudi-arabia-pif-silver-lake/">passed the approval of the company's shareholders</a>, with the next and final step being getting the approval of global regulators, including the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC). As that process is ongoing, we don't know yet whether the FTC will choose to fight the acquisition or let it pass, but as many as <strong>46 members of the US Congress</strong> don't want the deal to go through without the FTC "<em>thoroughly</em>" looking it over.</p>



<p><a href="https://laborcaucus.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/laborcaucus.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/letter-to-ftc-on-proposed-acquisition-of-electronic-arts-ea.pdf">In an open letter</a> to the FTC chair, <strong>Andrew Ferguson</strong>, signed by 46 House Democrats led by the Labor Caucus co-chairs, <strong>Steven Horsford</strong>, <strong>Debbie Dingell</strong>, <strong>Mark Pocan</strong>, and <strong>Donald Norcross</strong>, the representatives express their "<em>serious concerns</em>" with the deal, and want it to be "<em>thoroughly reviewed</em>" as it comes under the FTC's purview. </p>



<p>"<em>We are writing to express serious concerns regarding the proposed acquisition of Electronic Arts (EA) by the Public Investment Fund (PIF), the sovereign wealth fund of Saudi Arabia, and private equity firms<br>Silver Lake and Affinity Partners,</em>" the letter begins. "<em>We are committed to preserving fair, competitive labor markets and safeguarding American jobs, and given the impact of this acquisition on workers, labor market concentration, and the long-term competitiveness of the U.S. video game industry, we urge you to thoroughly review this transaction</em>."</p>



<p>The letter goes on to cite the recent instability of the video game industry, which has suffered tens of thousands of job losses in recent years, EA's contributions to those layoffs, and the massive disconnect between EA's executive leadership and its median worker, highlighted by EA's chief executive officer, <strong>Andrew Wilson</strong>, taking home<a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ea-ceo-andrew-wilson-earned-260-times-more-than-the-median-worker-last-year"> <strong>260 times more</strong> compared to the median EA worker.</a></p>



<p>It noted concerns over the fact that the buyout comes with <a href="https://wccftech.com/20-billion-debt-ticking-time-bomb-ea-studios-says-analyst/">EA taking on <strong>$20 billion in debt</strong></a><strong>,</strong> which it says "<em>creates strong incentives for the acquiring firms to pursue further cost-cutting measures, including <strong>layoffs, offshoring, restructuring, or studio closures</strong></em>." The letter also expresses competition-based concerns, saying that the scale of the "<em>cross-ownership</em>" involved, were the deal to go through, "<em>presents risks of self-preferencing and anticompetitive coordination across these sports, sports-related talent, and sports related video game business lines. This could, consequently, restrict worker mobility and reduce bargaining power for employees throughout the industry.</em>"</p>



<p>The last major point the letter makes is one indicating that this merger, should it be approved, could violate some of the FTC's own antitrust laws regarding mergers that harm workers, suppress wages, and enable dominant firms to reduce labor demands. It then closes by saying, </p>



<p>"<em>We respectfully urge the Commission to conduct a thorough investigation into the labor market consequences of this proposed acquisition, including EA’s existing wage-setting power, the likelihood of post-transaction layoffs, the degree of labor-market concentration in relevant geographic and occupational markets, and the role of cross-ownership in shaping labor outcomes. Workers deserve a fair, competitive marketplace where their skills are valued</em>."</p>



<p>These 46 House Democrats are not the first to share these kinds of concerns over the buyout. The $20 billion in debt is <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-55-billion-deal-might-bring-massive-layoffs-ai-pivot-20-billion-debt/">something several other industry figures have already pointed to as a problem</a>, and that's even before getting into the creative concerns, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-claims-it-will-maintain-creative-control-if-55-billion-buyout-goes-through-saudi-arabia-silver-lake/">even as EA claims it will "<em>maintain creative control</em>" after the buyout</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/maxis-promises-the-sims-values-remain-unchanged-amidst-ea-saudi-arabia-buyout/"><strong>The Sims</strong> developer <strong>Maxis</strong> made a similar claim earlier this month,</a> saying its values will remain "<em>unchanged</em>" after the acquisition, a claim that players are struggling to believe. There's already precedent for <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fighting/it-doesnt-really-make-sense-that-soccer-star-ronaldo-is-now-a-fatal-fury-character-but-if-you-follow-the-money-you-can-see-how-it-happened/">the Saudi Arabia PIF allegedly impacting creative decisions in <strong>Fatal Fury</strong></a>, which itself is realistically a small matter in the grand scheme of things, since it can be boiled down to the Saudi Arabia PIF allegedly using its influence to put a sports icon it has financial ties to in this new video game it owns. Not the worst thing in the world.</p>



<p>But if the group were to have used its influence for a small, ultimately trivial matter like that, it's understandable that The Sims players would have concerns that core elements to the long-running life sim, like being able to act out whatever lifestyle you want, including ones that are considered criminal offences in Saudi Arabia, would change.</p>



<p>And while we've not yet seen reports of Maxis employees voicing their concerns, anonymously or not, <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioware-devs-reportedly-worried-55-billion-ea-buyout/">employees at EA's <strong>BioWare</strong> have already done so</a>. There's simply no getting around the fact that this deal has a lot of people, inside and outside of EA, seriously concerned.</p>



<p>Of course, these concerns could be all for naught, and the deal could go through, and all of the bad things people fear will happen won't actually happen. We won't know until the deal officially closes, and we won't see that happen until the FTC and other global regulators weigh in on the deal.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nintendo’s Games Are Special Because Its Teams Are Intergenerational]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/podcasts/aftermath-hours-podcast-super-nintendo-keza-macdonald/</link>
            <guid>1414633</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Nobody does it quite like Nintendo. When you’re playing a first-party <em>Mario</em>, <em>Zelda</em>, <em>Metroid</em>, or whatever else, there’s a feeling that other games can’t quite replicate – something akin to magic. But of course, magic isn’t real, and games are productions created by flawed human beings just like anything else. So what makes Nintendo’s so special? Part of it comes down to who’s still around, all these years later. On the latest <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/aftermath-hours/"><u>Aftermath Hours</u></a>, we talk about that.</p><p>This time around, we’re joined by Keza MacDonald – currently of The Guardian and formerly of Kotaku UK way back in the day – to talk about her new book, <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/753986/super-nintendo-by-keza-macdonald/?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Super Nintendo: The Game-Changing Company That Unlocked the Power of Play</u></em></a>. We discuss Nintendo’s vast history, dating all the way back to 1889, as well as how its innovative past gave way to the Switch 2 era, perhaps its most iterative yet.&nbsp;</p><p>Keza also tells us all sorts of stories about legendary figures like <em>Mario </em>creator Shigeru Miyamoto, who despite his sunny exterior, is actually a very intense boss. Also, that famous “a delayed game is eventually good, but a rushed game is forever bad” quote? He didn’t say it! Oh, while we’re dispelling misconceptions, Nintendo hasn’t avoided mass layoffs just because its executives are <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/13/nintendo-ceo-once-halved-salary-to-prevent-layoffs-why-thats-uncommon.html?ref=aftermath.site"><u>uncommonly forward thinking</u></a>. Thank <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24191650/nintendo-sega-from-software-japan-video-game-layoffs?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Japanese labor law</u></a> for that one. Then we dig into what makes Nintendo Nintendo, including the intergenerational approach it takes to both its characters and its staffing. Finally, we talk about our favorite journalism rabbit holes, of which we have many.&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Spotify</u></a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Apple</u></a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that Aftermath can also become an intergenerational enterprise, with sprightly youths reporting to 70-something versions of us decades from now (we'll be a lot crankier, though).</p>
<!--kg-card-begin: html-->

<!--kg-card-end: html-->
<p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Keza:</strong> That intergenerational nature of the market, I think, will safeguard Nintendo for a while, but also they have intergenerational teams. If you are the newest guy making <em>Mario</em>, you are sitting in the same team as Takashi Tezuka who made the first <em>Mario</em>. I think that is the case on every team. It’s always a mix of people who have literally been there for decades – maybe made the first game in that series – [and younger folks]. If you are struggling with a technical problem, you can go ask the guy who made that console. He’s over there. And all the documentation is apparently super tight. They’ve got incredible documentation of their own work.</p><p>I think this intergenerational development process is a key to why their games keep being so good. There’s both the insight and the institutional knowledge; the spirit of the game has remained kind of [the same]. <em>Zelda </em>is a good example. It feels sort of the same. The core of it is the same as it has been for decades. How do they do that? It’s because they keep the same people on it. But then you also have this freshness. You have new people – very talented younger people who are core parts of the teams.&nbsp;</p><p>So yeah, that intergenerational nature of its products and its teams and its audience, I think that’s the thing that really defines Nintendo now – and that will probably define it in the future as well. It’s gonna become like a Disney situation, although hopefully not evil. We will see.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I did forget how long Hidemaro Fujibayashi had been working on this stuff. He directed <em>Oracle of Seasons</em> and <em>Oracle of Ages</em>. That’s crazy.</p><p><strong>Keza: </strong>Yeah, he was the director on those. They poached him from Capcom. And that’s the thing: The “new” director of <em>Zelda </em>has been working on these games for decades himself.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> He’s, like, 53!</p><p><strong>Keza:</strong> Yeah, they’re seen as spring chickens because there’s Eiji Aonuma and Miyamoto, and they’re still there. When you first start to see a Nintendo developer’s name – when you first start to see them cropping up – they have been there for ten years or more by the time that happens. That kind of talent development is pretty solid. They seem to do a good job of bringing people up and not just keeping it with the established generation.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> With that in mind, do you think that tendency of previous generations to stick around well into old age stems from pride in their work and care and craft, or do you think they’re afraid to let go – that they’re afraid to completely take their hand off the wheel because they don’t entirely trust that things will keep working the way that they should if they leave and finally go enjoy retirement?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Keza:</strong> I do think there’s an element of that, probably, for quite a lot of Nintendo’s old guard. I know that Miyamoto took a long time to very slowly withdraw from game development. He’s not involved in games anymore. He does theme parks and movies and stuff. He’s become a student of film scripts because he’s trying to understand how to get the best out of Nintendo’s film partnerships and stuff. But that was a slow, slow, slow process.</p><p>Apart from anything else, can you imagine what would happen to Nintendo’s stock price if Miyamoto retired? So I do wonder the extent to which people are sticking around because they kind of have to for business reasons – especially the old guard. But then they do seem to enjoy their lives. I mean, you see these people on the product cycles; you see them every three or four years. But I’ve never interviewed a Nintendo developer who doesn’t have the light in their eyes.</p><h2 id="recommended">Recommended</h2><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/nintendo-direct-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-metroid-prime-4/"><div><p>Nintendo Does What Everybody Else Nintendon’t - Aftermath</p><p>The Switch is bucking industry trends until the not-so-bitter end</p><p><span>Nathan Grayson</span></p></div></a></figure>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>40+ days after it was first revealed as the <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-trailers-recap-highguard-titanfall-apex-2000653088">“last big thing” at The Game Awards in December,</a> <em>Highguard’s</em> social media account finally posted again, breaking a long radio silence and leading to a lot of reactions from gamers online.</p> <p>On January 23, the official <em>Highguard</em> Twitter account announced a “Launch Showcase” live stream happening on the game’s release date of January 26. This is the first time the account has posted anything since <a href="https://x.com/PlayHighguard/status/1999629482123231329">replying to someone’s reaction</a> to the initial reveal trailer back on December 12.</p>

 <p>“Tune in on Monday, January 26, at 10am PT for the <em>Highguard</em> Launch Showcase,” posted the <em>Highguard</em> account. “Here, we’ll share an in-depth look at <em>Highguard</em> direct from the studio, featuring a full gameplay deep dive, year one plans, and much more.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Tune in on Monday, January 26, at 10am PT for the Highguard Launch Showcase⚔️</p> <p>Here, we'll share an in-depth look at Highguard direct from the studio, featuring a full gameplay deep dive, year one plans, and much more.</p> <p>👉<a href="https://t.co/zm4I62mMpI">https://t.co/zm4I62mMpI</a> <a href="https://t.co/VlQ4qbCNA3">pic.twitter.com/VlQ4qbCNA3</a></p> <p>— Highguard | Launching Jan 26 2026 (@PlayHighguard) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayHighguard/status/2014760310046085443?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 23, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <h2>What’s going on with <em>Highguard</em>?</h2> <p>Since its reveal in December, <em>Highguard</em> has had a strange few weeks. Being the big reveal at the end of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/everything-we-saw-at-the-2025-game-awards-2000652719">Game Awards</a>, which reportedly the company didn’t pay for, got it a lot of eyeballs, but also a lot of scrutiny. People tend to expect some big new sequel or long-awaited project to cap off host Geoff Keighley’s annual award and trailer showcase. Instead, Geoff showcased a free-to-play online shooter that, to many online, looked too similar to many other games already out there. That initial trailer didn’t do a great job explaining what it is, and by and large, people weren’t excited.</p>

 <p>Since then, the people behind <em>Highguard</em> have been radio silent, which has led to more discourse around its radio silence and discussion over what little we’ve seen so far. So this new tweet from the main account caught a lot of people’s attention.</p>

 <p>“Bro finally remembered the password,” posted popular <em>Fortnite</em> leaker Shiina.</p> <p>“I logged in specifically just to mute you,” said another user on Twitter.</p> <p>“Oh my word, they are alive,” posted someone else.</p> <p>“Dead game,” tweeted another user, because of course, at least one person had to shout this overused insult.</p>

 <p>To be clear, there are some positive replies, too. People are excited to see what the game actually is, or people are just happy the devs aren’t giving up on it. Regardless of sentiment, <em>Highguard</em> clearly has the attention of a lot of people online, even if some of them are rooting for it to fail while others are just curious as to how this all ends. We won’t have to wait long to see more as <em>Highguard’s</em> big launch day stream kicks off on January 26. Meanwhile, the game launches that day on consoles and PC. I suspect a lot of eyeballs will once again be watching.</p>

<p>Final Fantasy 7 Remake series director has stated that Rebirth’s Switch 2 gameplay experience is “pretty much exactly the same as all the other platforms.”</p>



<p>The Xbox and Switch 2 versions of Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade are already live, and players have already started thinking about the next instalments. Moving on to the next instalment, a reliable insider has reaffirmed that Rebirth should <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-still-coming-to-xbox-in-2026-insider-reaffirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">arrive for Xbox in 2026</a>. And now, we have been informed about the game’s performance on the Switch 2. </p>







<h2 id="h-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-switch-2-gameplay-experience-could-be-the-same-as-ps5">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Switch 2 Gameplay Experience Could be the Same as PS5</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/News/2026/January/FINAL-FANTASY-VII-REMAKE-INTERGRADE-Interview-Naoki-Hamaguchi-Director-3010151.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nintendo</a>, Final Fantasy 7 Remake series director Naoki Hamaguchi spoke about Rebirth’s Switch 2 performance. The director was asked about the next instalments in the FF7 remake series, and Hamaguchi answered, stating that he can’t reveal too much information, but can confirm that Rebirth and the third instalment to the series are indeed in development for the Switch 2. </p>



<p>Development on both titles is progressing for Switch 2 and other platforms. Hamaguchi also stated that it’s his “personal policy” not to make any versions of a game different from one another, or “offer a different gameplay experience just because they’re on different hardware.” He has assured players that the Switch 2 version’s gameplay experience is “pretty much exactly the same as all the other&nbsp;platforms.”</p>







<p><span>In other news, the Final Fantasy 6 Remake series&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-6-remake-should-be-led-by-someone-else-says-ff7-director/" target="_blank">should be led by someone else</a></span>,&nbsp;according to the FF7 Remake director. Additionally, the game experience for part three is “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3s-game-experience-is-more-or-less-complete/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more or less complete</a>.” What are your thoughts on Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth featuring the same gameplay experience on Switch 2 as other platforms?

<p>Highguard developers have finally announced a gameplay showcase for the title, which will arrive on launch day. </p>



<p>Since Highguard was announced during the finale slot of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2025</a>, players have been eagerly waiting to learn more about the upcoming free-to-play shooter from the creators of Apex Legends and Titanfall. However, close to the marketing or promotion for the title has been done, apart from the reveal trailer. It seems that we are finally going to get something, but it may be too close to launch. </p>







<h2 id="h-highguard-gameplay-showcase-arrives-on-launch-day">Highguard Gameplay Showcase Arrives on Launch Day</h2>



<p>The official <a href="https://x.com/PlayHighguard/status/2014760310046085443" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter) of Highguard is finally showing signs of life, posting for the first time since December 12, 2025. The new announcement reveals that a Highguard Launch Showcase will be held on January 26, 2026, at 10 AM Pacific Time. The showcase will provide an in-depth look at the game, featuring year-one plans, a gameplay deep dive, and more. Players are speculating that the game could be dropped right after the showcase. </p>

<p>Highguard marketing has been almost non-existent, with developers providing players absolutely no concrete information about their upcoming free-to-play raid shooter. Interestingly, the game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-trophy-list-has-revealed-more-details-than-the-devs-have/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trophy list leaked</a> recently, providing players with the most information we have received to date about the upcoming title. The information included details on the game’s mechanics, items, characters, and more. </p>







<p>In other news, a recent claim alleges that Highguard developers Wildlight Entertainment <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-devs-didnt-pay-for-game-awards-spot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">didn’t pay for the spot</a> at The Game Awards finale. Additionally, here’s all you need to know about the upcoming shooter’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-platforms-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-s/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">platforms</a>.

It's quite the upgrade, and it's still a couple of months away (mark your calendars for March 26), but preorders are already live at select retailers. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Similar to other Switch 2 Editions that have released, there's a digital upgrade pack for those who already have the original Switch version, alongside a standard, complete version of the game's Switch 2 version for those who don't currently own the original. We've included where you can preorder a full physical copy of the game (<a href="https://zdcs.link/aA8MpL?object_uuid=72bd9bc9-9d5d-4d0a-a341-e18d21ab0bb9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">for $79.99</a>) and this upgrade pack (<a href="https://zdcs.link/QrJeGD?object_uuid=72bd9bc9-9d5d-4d0a-a341-e18d21ab0bb9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">for $19.99</a>) below.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Preorder Super Mario Bros.

As for the digital version, that hasn't gone up for preorder yet, for some reason. We'll be sure to update it once it's available, though.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Preorder Super Mario Bros.

Wonder on Nintendo Switch and are just hoping to get the upgrade pack to use it on your Switch 2, that's currently available to preorder right now at the Nintendo eShop. For $19.99, this will set you up with all of the extras from the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition when the game is released on March 26.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Save on Super Mario Bros.

At the moment, Woot is offering the original version of Super Mario Bros. Wonder for $46.99. If you don't already own it, you can buy from Woot at this good price and then purchase the upgrade pack, which brings your total cost to $66.98. Compared to the $79.99 price tag for the physical Switch 2 Edition, this is a great little deal to take advantage of.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Hannah Hoolihan is a freelancer who writes with the guides and commerce teams here at IGN.</em></p></div></section><div><h3 data-cy="title3"><svg data-cy="icon-logo" viewBox="0 0 76 24" title="IGN"><title>IGN Logo</title><path fill="currentColor" stroke="none" d="M5.38 7.65a7.85 7.85 0 0 1 2.26-2.26c.13-1.18.31-2.26.52-3.21a10.605 10.605 0 0 0-6 6c.95-.22 2.03-.39 3.21-.52M16.34 5.36v.02c.9.59 1.67 1.37 2.27 2.27 1.18.13 2.26.31 3.21.52a10.627 10.627 0 0 0-6.02-6.01c.22.95.4 2.02.54 3.2M7.64 18.62c-.9-.59-1.67-1.37-2.27-2.27h-.03c-1.19-.14-2.26-.32-3.19-.54 1.07 2.75 3.26 4.95 6.01 6.02-.22-.95-.39-2.03-.52-3.21M18.64 16.35h-.03c-.59.9-1.37 1.67-2.27 2.27v.03c-.14 1.17-.32 2.25-.54 3.19a10.59 10.59 0 0 0 6.03-6.03c-.94.22-2 .4-3.19.54M10.04 0h3.9c.85 1.85 1.2 4.59 1.3 5.52.04.22.06.43.06.63L12 9.11 8.7 6.15c0-.17.02-.35.05-.55.1-.95.43-3.75 1.29-5.61M8.7 17.83c0 .17.02.35.05.55.1.95.43 3.75 1.29 5.61h3.9c.85-1.84 1.2-4.59 1.3-5.52.04-.22.06-.43.06-.64L12 14.87l-3.3 2.96ZM6.16 8.68c-.17 0-.35.02-.55.05-.95.12-3.75.45-5.61 1.31v3.9c1.84.85 4.59 1.19 5.52 1.3.22.04.43.06.64.06L9.11 12 6.16 8.7ZM24 10.02c-1.86-.86-4.66-1.19-5.61-1.29-.2-.03-.38-.05-.55-.05l-2.96 3.3 2.96 3.3c.2 0 .41-.02.64-.06.93-.11 3.68-.45 5.52-1.3v-3.9Z"></path><path fill="currentColor" stroke="none" d="M42.83 13.9V10h10.45c1.06 0 1.93.86 1.93 1.92v4.63c0 2.38-1.91 4.36-4.33 4.36h-6.69c-4.96 0-8.97-4-8.97-8.94s4.04-8.95 8.98-8.95h10.36v4.11H44.2c-2.67 0-4.86 2.17-4.86 4.84s2.16 4.83 4.86 4.83h6.91v-2.91h-8.27ZM33.86 3h-4.07v16.02c0 1.05.86 1.91 1.91 1.91h2.15V3M74.37 3.01h-2.18v13.81s0 .08-.03.11a.29.29 0 0 1-.24.14c-.09 0-.16-.04-.25-.15L64.83 4.93a4.347 4.347 0 0 0-3.72-2.11h-.07c-2.39 0-4.32 1.93-4.32 4.32v11.88c0 1.05.86 1.91 1.91 1.91h2.17V7.14s.02-.09.04-.13a.29.29 0 0 1 .24-.14c.09 0 .18.03.24.14l6.88 12.07c.76 1.27 2.12 2.05 3.69 2.05h.07c2.39 0 4.32-1.93 4.32-4.32V4.92c0-1.05-.85-1.91-1.91-1.91"></path></svg>Recommends</h3></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-super-mario-bros-wonder-nintendo-switch-2-edition]]></content:encoded>

Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021.

<p>Fantastical Parade is a fantastical name for the first new Pokémon TCG Pocket set of 2026. The new B2 set brings new cards, new Shinies, and new Mega ex variations. Fantastical Parade B2 is kicking off the new year with a bang, and IG has the Pokémon TCG Pocket Fantastical Parade release date, start times, and more.</p>



<p>It hasn’t gone unnoticed that developers Creatures Inc.&nbsp;and&nbsp;DeNA have taken feedback on board. The regularity of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-to-expect-from-pokemon-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a> sets has eased up since the first anniversary, and the Deluxe ex set has been a big help. It’s now time for Set B2, and Fantastical Parade is looking to party on through the night (and every other night).</p>

<figure data-uuid="0765799819672"><a title="Hit Box Ultra 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0765799819672/hit-box-ultra-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>I’ve reviewed several leverless arcade controllers for the Switch / Switch 2, but I’ve had my eye on the <strong>Hit Box Ultra</strong> for a little while now. For those unfamiliar, Hit Box is the original leverless arcade controller; if you want to contest that, then it’s at least the one that popularised the concept. The <strong>Ultra</strong> is the company’s latest iteration of its core design, adding in three of its remarkable ‘C.O.M.B.O. Extension’ buttons while making some thoughtful improvements to the overall design.</p>
<p>Right off the bat, the Hit Box Ultra has native compatibility with the Switch, Switch 2, PS4, PS5, and PC – there’s no Xbox support for this one. Being able to connect to the PS5, however, is a <em>huge</em> win since the vast majority of arcade controllers require an additional authenticator to work properly.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067sliwzp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>All you need to do is hold the relevant button while plugging in the device to link it to your chosen console (check the manual for the exact button). Alternatively, holding in the small menu button on the far right allows the Ultra to automatically recognise which console you’re using. Similarly, you've got multiple SOCD modes available, and you can even swap the directional input to mimic the d-pad, left stick, or right stick.</p>

<p>In terms of design, the Ultra is much slimmer and lighter than its predecessor, coming in at 27mm in height and 1.7 kg / 3.75 lbs in weight. The main body is built from steel, so it's incredibly durable and feels <em>very</em> premium, which you'd expect at a price point of <strong>$299.99 / £226</strong>. You might notice that, in terms of height, it's still a lot thicker than other arcade controllers I’ve looked at, and that’s because of the buttons the Ultra houses in its main body.</p>
<p>Usually with arcade controllers, they're loaded with Kailh switches that are then covered with a simple key cap. Not so with the Hit Box. Here, the C.O.M.B.O. buttons are made up of several components: the well (which houses <a href="https://www.cherry.de/en-gb/products/switches/mx-low-profile">Cherry MX low-profile switches</a>), plunger, optimiser, cap, and finally, the locking ring. So essentially, the well slots into the controller’s main body, the optimiser rests snugly inside, the plunger (with the key cap attached) sits on top, and the ring locks everything in place.</p>

<p>As standard, the Ultra comes with three sets of optimisers. These are silicone cushions that sit within the button well and provide two key functions: they lower the travel distance of your button presses while almost completely silencing them. Twelve Super (1mm) optimisers are pre-installed, while you’re also provided with twelve Classic (1.5mm) and Ultra (0.65) optimisers each, so I encourage you to experiment and see which one fits your play style.</p>
<p>Switching them out is easy: you just hold down on the button you’re customising, turn the locking ring anti-clockwise, pull it out, lift the plunger up, then scoop the optimiser out and replace it with a different one. Alternatively, you can just leave them out completely if you want a more ‘classic’ arcade feel to your buttons, but just keep in mind that they’ll sound louder when pressed.</p>
<figure data-uuid="e6f12a8ab2c66"><a title="Hit Box Ultra 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e6f12a8ab2c66/hit-box-ultra-6.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>When you first unbox the Ultra and start testing out the buttons, they might feel a bit weird; ever-so-slightly spongy, in fact. However, when I started unleashing a bunch of combos in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>, any reservations I had completely melted away.</p>
<p>The speed at which you can actuate the button inputs is simply unrivalled, and I’ve found that the Ultra almost immediately improved my overall performance in game. Swapping out the Super optimisers for the lower-profile Ultra optimisers helped even more. Ultimately, a pattern you’ll come to notice in this review is that the Ultra consistently offers up options. I love the optimisers, but as mentioned earlier, you don’t have to use them if you don’t want to.</p>
<p>And then we come to the C.O.M.B.O. Extensions. You get three with the Ultra, and they’re essentially two buttons in one. You’ve got the standard C.O.M.B.O. button I’ve already gone through, but then an extra button that houses a <a href="https://www.kailhswitch.com/news/kailh-pg1425-x-switch-introduction-21834771.html">Kailh PG1425 X microswitch</a>. Lots of arcade controllers these days come with additional inputs embedded in the controller itself, but the good thing about the Extensions is you can rotate them to a specific position, or even customise the layout completely by swapping it with another button.</p>

<p>The three pre-installed Extensions are situated in the middle of the button layout; sort of sitting vertically in a line. This is a nice layout as it is, but I really like having a button over on the far left on which to rest my pinky finger, even if I don’t actually have any inputs mapped to it. It just feels right to me.</p>
<p>Whatever layout you choose, the Extensions are mapped to ‘L3’, ‘R3’, and ‘Capture’ by default (note: the Capture input is mapped to ‘Touchpad’ if you’re using the Ultra on PS4/5). You can swap the inputs to whatever you wish, however, and we’ll get into how in a bit. Just be mindful with something like Street Fighter 6, most tournaments won’t let you map the same input to 2 separate buttons.</p>
<p>Again, the ability to rotate your Extensions or swap them with another button is all about making the most of the copious options that the Ultra presents. You just can’t do this with other controllers, and it allows you to really make it your own. You know the saying: <em>“This is my arcade controller. There are many like it, but this one is mine”</em>.</p>
<p>Okay, maybe not…</p>

<p>Up on the top of the device, you have 6 menu buttons: from right to left, these are +, Capture, Home, –, R3, and L3. Over on the far left is the power port, which sits almost completely flush with the device. You get a braided cable with the Ultra, and it feels incredibly rugged while the proprietary design keeps it locked in place when attached. My only concern here is if the cable <em>does</em> wind up dying at some point, sourcing a replacement won’t be as easy as finding a standard USB-C cable (though Hit Box does sell replacements on its <a href="https://www.hitboxarcade.com/collections/mod-store/products/hit-box-detachable-cable">official website</a>). Over on the back, you’ve got a non-slip plate to keep the controller from sliding everywhere while in use, and it’s actually magnetic by design – this is where the real fun begins.</p>
<p>Removing the magnetic plate lets you get into all the hardware and wiring inside, and this is what you’ll need to access if you want to customise the layout of your Ultra and swap out the Extension inputs. Don’t worry if this looks daunting from the images, it’s actually not as complex as you might think.</p>

<p>So let’s say you want to remap your Extensions. You’ll see a small, green switchboard on the bottom right with three pins poking out. You just need to unplug the pin you want to remap and plug it into the desired input. Keep in mind here that the labelling is for PlayStation, but so long as you consult your manual and <a href="https://www.hitboxarcade.com/pages/support-index">Hit Box’s online guides</a>, you’ll be able to instantly translate the PlayStation inputs to Switch inputs.</p>
<p>Swapping the layout is a bit more complex, but again, it’s not too taxing. You just need to disconnect the two wires from the button you wish to remove by pulling them out with your fingers; no tools required, but you can use pliers if you wish. Once they’re out, just push the button through from the back, and it’ll pop out the front.</p>
<p>If you’re removing an Extension button, you’ll also need to disconnect the thin, white signal wire from the terminal block on the top right. All the wires are kept neatly together with three velcro strips by default, so you might need to remove one or two of these to free up some of the wiring for customisation.</p>

<figure data-uuid="2273deb7fbea8"><a title="Hit Box Ultra 18" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2273deb7fbea8/hit-box-ultra-18.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you’re looking to customise the layout of your Ultra, I firmly recommend finding the ideal setup for you and then sticking with it. Removing buttons and swapping them around isn’t hard, but you don’t want to be fiddling around with the wiring every other day – and it actually comes with six small screws to completely lock the magnetic back plate in place once you’re confident you’re done with any tinkering.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this isn’t beginner-friendly, so if you’re completely new to the world of leverless controllers, this probably isn’t the controller you want to start with. I can’t necessarily knock it for that, though, since Hit Box doesn’t – in any way, shape, or form – market the Ultra to beginners. This is a product for those looking for a long-term investment to take to tournaments and really step up your fighting game in the professional space.</p>
<p>Although I wasn’t able to do this for the review, Hit Box does confirm that you can mod the Ultra further with custom artwork. You’ll need to purchase a separate, clear acrylic top for the device and remove all buttons to accomplish this, but it’s an option for those desperate to express themselves even more. Thankfully, adding artwork to the buttons is easy, since you just remove the transparent caps and add your circular artwork underneath. Speaking of the acrylic top, I suspect this thing will be a magnet for scratches over time; it’s already attracted a bunch of fingerprints, so keep the cleaning cloth at hand at all times. Definitely a bit of a disappointment there.</p>

<p>Finally, you get a few extra goodies with your Ultra. First up are three Extension shields which protect the C.O.M.B.O. Extension buttons when travelling – you just slide them onto the end when you want to use them. To keep the Extensions locked in place if you’ve found the perfect rotation angle, you can add Grapplers underneath to stabilise them. These aren’t essential and you’ll probably find the Extensions are pretty stable anyway, but it’s good to have.</p>
<p>And last but not least, Hit Box has included a black, branded carry bag to transport your Ultra out and about; a lovely little extra that will come in handy if you attend tournaments frequently.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>While the Hit Box Ultra isn't cheap, perhaps more than any other arcade controller I've tested recently, it's very much a long-term investment geared toward players who compete professionally. The level of button customisation is unparalleled, the steel body is weighty and durable, and native compatibility with Switch, Switch 2, <em>and</em> the PS5 makes it one of the best options out there if you're looking to take your game to the next level.</p>
<p>Replacing the proprietary cable if anything goes wrong does concern me a bit, but like the controller itself, it's so strong and durable that I don't expect it to break on me anytime soon. If you like keeping your controllers in pristine condition, the acrylic top may cause issues attracting fingerprints and potential scratches. Otherwise, this is a truly world class controller for fighting games.</p>

			<p><strong>Embark Studios</strong> has revealed a new roadmap for <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/arc-raiders-everything-we-know-about-the-latest-hot-extraction-shooter/">ARC Raiders</a>,</strong> covering the first four months of the year with what it has deemed to be the game's <strong>Escalation</strong> period. The roadmap includes new map conditions, new ARC threats incoming, new Raider Decks, a map update, and, perhaps most exciting of all, a <strong>new map</strong> scheduled to arrive in April.</p>



<p>"<em>2026 is upon us, and we're embarking on our first full year of ARC Raiders. Let's do this thing,</em>" the studio writes in the opening of a <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/roadmap-january-april-2026">new blog post on the game's website</a>. "<em>As we head into 2026, we're excited to share our roadmap for the next four months. This will show you the types of new content to look forward to: new enemies, maps, conditions, or other changes</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>Stick around. After Escalation, <strong>there's even more to come</strong></em>."</p>

<p>If you're a PvP-focused player, then the first thing to take note of is the new matchmaking option to only match with players who are also <strong>level 40 and up</strong>. It should help make more of your fights more interesting, since it can get boring for the level 40+ player to keep boot-stomping low-level players with little to no good loot, while players below level 40 get frustrated and potentially stop playing because they can't engage in PvP without getting automatically boot-stomped.</p>



<p>It's good to know that we'll have new ARCs entering the fray to keep enemy variety when you jump into a session a little more lively, and new map conditions coming as soon as later this month to keep the exploration and survival aspect of the gameplay interesting. It's also exciting to know that along with the new map coming in April, we'll also get a new "<em>large ARC</em>," indicating there will be another, potentially Matriarch-level ARC to fight on the new map.</p>



<p>ARC Raiders has been the hottest new game on the market in the last few months, skyrocketing to being one of <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-sold-more-than-12-million-copies-neared-1-million-concurrent/">2025's best-selling titles towards the end of the year,</a> with no signs of slowing down, as <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1808500/charts/">it hasn't even fallen below <strong>100K</strong> concurrent players on Steam</a> since it launched. </p>

            <p>Har(c)ken to me, defenders of Speranza! Embark have just announced their plans for ARC Raiders updates over the first four months of 2026. The extraction shooter’s next season is called Escalation, and its offerings range from new maps and enemies to new Raider decks, changes to existing maps, and more Expeditions. The headline attraction is surely the “new large Arc” coming in April. I wonder how big Arcs can get. Perhaps an Arc the size of a map, like Cronos in God Of War 3? But, you know, metal?</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Let’s break it down. The roadmap, I mean, not the new large Arc, though yes, definitely that too. Coming up in what remains of this month, there’s Headwinds, an update package that introduces a new matchmaking option for players over level 40, a new minor map condition, and a new player project. February brings Shrouded Sky, which encompasses a new map condition, Arc threat, player project, and raider deck, together with a map update and another Expedition.</p>
<p>March is the time of Flashpoint, which includes a new map condition, Arc enemy and player project, together with an update for Scrappy the weird junk-attracting chicken. April, finally, is the month of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/riven">Riven</a> Tides. There’s another new map and map condition, a second Expedition, and the aforesaid “new large Arc”. Always good to end the season with a respec grind, though Embark have said they’re trying to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raider-devs-want-future-expeditions-to-be-less-about-fat-stacks-and-fomo">make Expeditions more varied in future</a>.</p>
<p>Good news, fans of frostbite: Embark aren’t done simulating winter just yet. “The Cold Snap has passed, but its danger casts a long shadow,” the devs <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/roadmap-january-april-2026">write</a> in closing. “Extreme weather will continue to test Raiders as they scavenge the surface for the resources that keep Speranza running.” As if that wasn’t harrowing enough, the developers have suggested elsewhere that one particular enemy indigenous to the new Stella Montis region <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/theyll-figure-out-how-to-get-out-of-there-eventually-arc-raiders-latest-enemy-wont-stick-to-stella-montis">might eventually find its way to the other maps</a>.</p>

And it’s an odd duck. The RG GO1, which doesn’t have a price or specific release date yet, features a 2.5-inch IPS LCD screen in the center of the controller. This can be used for various tasks, including reprogramming buttons and turning on rapid fire settings. The just-revealed controller also includes heartbeat sensors in the grips. Why? Anbernic says it will let you “monitor your well-being during intense sessions.” Sure!</p>  <p>Other features included are back buttons, six-axis gyro control, rumble motors for vibration, dual-mode triggers, Bluetooth support, and Purple Kirin’s electro-inductive capacitive joysticks, which the company claims will provide “silky-smooth movement.” Plus, the RG GO1’s face is clear plastic, letting you see some of the innards of the controller, and I’m a sucker for that.</p>

 <p>The RG GO1 is “coming soon.” We don’t have a price, but it will likely be more expensive than the company’s other controller, the $18 RG P01. But can you put a price on weird and cool? I’m being told, yes. Yes, you can.</p>

<p>Embark Studios has revealed a <strong>four-month roadmap </strong>for ARC Raiders, the studio’s new extraction adventure title that was released in October 2025. The roadmap, which spans January to April, is a long-awaited thing that fans have been begging for, and now that it’s here, it promises <strong>plenty</strong>.</p>



<p>Each month boasts a unique theme that comes with new ARC enemies, map improvements, quality-of-life changes, and events galore. If nothing else, the ARC Raiders 2026 roadmap promises to hugely expand the game’s lore.</p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-roadmap-finally-unveiled">ARC Raiders Roadmap Finally Unveiled</h2>



<p>ARC Raiders was in a rocky place coming out of the festive period. The game fell prey to some issues over the holiday break, and exploits and cheaters alike were running rampant. As soon as Embark Studios got back into the office, things sharpened up a bit, and now that the roadmap is here, fans finally have something to look forward to.</p>



<p>That includes a <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/roadmap-january-april-2026" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">four-part update spree</a> that rewards players with new content once per month.</p>



<p>Here’s the full spread:</p>



<p><strong>January – Headwinds</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>New matchmaking option (level 40+)</li>



<li>New minor map condition</li>



<li>Player project</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>February – Shrouded Sky</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>New map condition</li>



<li>New ARC threat</li>



<li>Player project</li>



<li>Raider Deck</li>



<li>Map update</li>



<li>Expedition window</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>March – Flashpoint</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>New map condition</li>



<li>New ARC threat</li>



<li>Player project</li>



<li>Scrappy update</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>April – Riven Tides</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>New map</li>



<li>New large ARC</li>



<li>New map condition</li>



<li>Expedition window</li>
</ul>



<p>The introduction of the first new map condition in February should bring about Toxic Swamp, which was discovered weeks ago by eagle-eyed gamers. We’ve also known for a while that February will yield a new Raider Deck and Expedition window.</p>



<p>What’s not so amazing is that we need to wait until <strong>April </strong>to get a large-scale ARC threat and a new map, but talk of a ‘map update’ in February is enough to potentially keep players engaged.</p>



<p>Plenty is coming in ARC Raiders, and the roadmap is indicative of all the work Embark Studios is doing – and plans to keep doing – to keep this game growing and thriving.</p>

Alternatively — and of note for those planning to play the game via Xbox Game Pass Ultimate — you can purchase that $59.99 Premium Upgrade Bundle, and play starting May 15.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The game's Premium Edition / Premium Upgrade include other benefits too, of course, though not all of them are available on day one. Effectively, this option lets you pre-order the game's two upcoming, unannounced expansions, as well as the Italian Passion Car Park, which also does not have a release date. You'll also get the Time Attack Car Pack, Car Pass (which adds 30 more cars to your game, one per week), plus VIP Membership and a Welcome Pack.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This offering is nothing new for the Forza Horizon series, though is $10 more than the $49.99 Premium Upgrade offered for Forza Horizon 5 — an increase that has not gone unnoticed among the franchise's fanbase on social media and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ForzaHorizon/comments/1qkcq7f/why_is_noone_talking_about_the_staggering_price/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The pricing is even more remarkable in other territories, too — in the UK, the Premium Upgrade is £59.99, the exact same cost as the game itself. In Australia, the Premium Edition is AU $190, up from AU $150 for the Premium Edition of Forza Horizon 5.</p><span data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><div id="xbox-games-series-tier-list" data-cy="xbox-games-series-tier-list"><p><span><span><span><h3 data-cy="title3">Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3><h3>Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3></span></span><span></span></span></p></div></span><p data-cy="paragraph">"Yeah that's absolutely cooked," wrote Aussie Forza fan Pretty_Leather4803 on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ForzaHorizon/comments/1qk9xro/190_aud_for_the_premium_edition_of_h6_is_a_joke/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a>. "$40 more for basically the same content as last time? Microsoft really thinks we're made of money down here. At this point I'm just gonna wait for it to hit Game Pass and skip all the fancy extras."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Inflation is a real thing," countered another fan, BrokenClays, in yet another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ForzaHorizon/comments/1qkggwm/inflation_is_a_real_thing/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a> thread. "In November 2021 FH5 Premium was $99.99. Adjusted for inflation, that's $116.58 in December 2025 dollars. They are charging $119.99. In the UK in 2021 FH5 cost £84.99. Adjusted for inflation, it would be £106.58. They are charging £109.99. I know a lot of people are feeling sticker shock, but the price increase is just a hair over inflation. The world we live in is more expensive."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, just to cover all bases, there's the Deluxe Edition of the game — which is less deluxe than the Premium Edition. For $99.99, you'll get the base game, Car Pass and Welcome Pack, but not the early access, expansions, or anything else included in the Premium Edition / Upgrade.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 100 Best Xbox Games of All Time</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's worth pointing out that last year, a report alleged that Microsoft had pushed Xbox studios to deliver a 30% profit margin — much higher than the industry average. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-23/microsoft-pushes-xbox-studios-to-hit-higher-profit-margins" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier said</a> that Microsoft’s 30% profit margin goal had led to the gaming division’s huge layoffs, canceled projects, controversial price rises, and multiplatform push.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-23/microsoft-pushes-xbox-studios-to-hit-higher-profit-margins" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg</a> said the average profit margin in the video game industry is 17-22%.

Image courtesy of Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to icons, which may tease an update’s contents, each month is assigned a title. Despite having just one week left, the same goes for January, which has been labeled Headwinds. The big inclusion players can expect in the coming days is a level 40+ matchmaking option, giving PvE and PvP Raiders more freedom to raid without fear they’re being matched against those of a higher skill level. A new map condition featuring a bird icon and a new player project are also set to arrive before January is out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">February (Shrouded Sky) keeps the ball rolling with a wider collection of slightly small – but still consequential – updates. A new map update, Raider Deck, Expedition Window, and player project seem to be par for the course in terms of regular updates for the future, and they’ll be present in February, too. Next month’s more intriguing additions lie in the promise of a new map condition that eerily features what appears to be a wind icon, as well as a new Arc threat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">March (Flashpoint) brings another arc threat, player project, and map condition, with everyone’s favorite resource-collection rooster, Scrappy, also set to receive an update as winter comes to an end. It’s April (Riven Tides) that promises the biggest bombshells for eager fans, with Embark delivering a new Arc Raiders map and a new large Arc threat. Only a skull is shown to tease whatever monstrosity will be joining the likes of the Matriarch and Queen, but judging by the umbrella icon and month title, it appears the new location may feature beaches or watery areas that will inevitably be polluted with lost loot and Raider flares.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Embark has big plans to kick off 2026, with its roadmap from May onward still being kept a secret for now as the studio aims to launch new content every month. A new Arc Raiders map, which will surely come with its own hidden mysteries to uncover, is no doubt the update players will be penciling into their calendars, though it’s unclear when the team will be more willing to show how the new location will fit into its PvPvE formula.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The increased ARC presence continues to trouble Shani as the Rustbelt grows more overwhelmed," the blog post says, "but no one holds all the pieces. The scale of the impending escalation remains unknown. Venture topside into an increasingly volatile Rustbelt—and make sure you’re prepared for what’s to come."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Arc Raiders launched October 30, 2025, and delivered its first new map, Stella Montis, in November. That puts a distance of about five months between its launch and the release date of the next new map. It’s unclear if Embark intends to keep with this pace in the months and years ahead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the studio works to keep the content faucet on following its winter break, the team has also spent recent weeks <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-dev-promises-significant-changes-after-players-report-widespread-issues-with-cheaters"><u>playing Whac-A-Mole with Arc Raiders cheaters</u></a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"We basically turn down those who have played zero Steam games."</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/palworld">Palworld</a> developer Pocketpair has an interesting way of screening job candidates. The Japanese game studio requires those applying for game designer positions to submit screenshots of their Steam libraries as part of the hiring process. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a recent <a href="https://x.com/urokuta_ja/status/2014593734827246006?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>tweet</u></a> on X / Twitter, CEO Takuro Mizobe shed some light on how Pocketpair hires new game designer talent (as spotted by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/palworld-developer-pocketpair-requires-game-designer-candidates-to-provide-screenshots-of-their-steam-libraries-and-playtime-according-to-ceo/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Automaton</u></a>). Mizobe explained that Pocketpair has prospective game designers submit screenshots of their Steam play history. Furthermore, Mizobe noted that applicants who <em>don’t</em> use Valve’s game platform don’t get considered for interviews: “Those who haven't played anything on Steam don’t pass the document screening stage.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is a reason why Pocketpair wants to see what their job applicants are playing though. As Mizobe explained: “in the interview, we question candidates about the top most-played titles in their Steam libraries, for example, we ask them to explain the game mechanics, to say why they think specific mechanics were adopted, and what makes the game stand out against others in the same genre. Pocketpair is recruiting game creators who are true Steam players!”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In a follow-up <a href="https://x.com/urokuta_ja/status/2014594862075805927?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>post</u></a>, Mitobe said that while applicants who are prolific console players are also encouraged to submit their Playstation, Xbox, or Nintendo Switch play data, Steam is still the priority. “We basically turn down those who have played zero Steam games,” Mitobe explained. “We want our colleagues to be playing indie games that are only available on Steam.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This makes sense considering Pocketpair’s background as an indie developer whose main distribution platform so far has been Steam. The developer’s biggest hit Palworld, as well as its previous game Craftopia, have their main playerbase on Valve’s platform.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a post on social media, Pocketpair Head of Publishing and Communications John “Bucky” Buckley <a href="https://x.com/Bucky_cm/status/2014706549982409060?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>weighed in on</u></a> the CEO’s comments: “So hilariously true. When I first joined, I was grilled if I knew games like Slay the Spire. Pocketpair is a company that truly is built by gamers, and our CEO is very adamant to keep it that way.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Palworld: Palfarm First Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Launching in open access on Steam and Xbox back in January 2024, Palworld skyrocketed in popularity, selling over 8 million copies in just six days and amassing over 25 million players in its first month. It wasn’t long before Pocketpair <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-signs-deal-with-sony-to-form-palworld-entertainment-and-expand-the-ip"><u>teamed up with Sony to launch Palworld Entertainment</u></a> with the aim of expanding the new IP.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pocketpair is continuing to build upon Palworld’s success. As well as updates to the game, it is currently developing Palworld: Palfarm, an upcoming online co-op farming sim set in the same universe. In a surprise announcement last week, it revealed that Palworld is also getting its own <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/they-really-are-going-the-pokmon-route-palworld-is-getting-an-official-trading-card-game"><u>physical Trading Card game</u></a>, which is set to drop this June.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the same time, Palworld is the subject of an ongoing lawsuit between Pocketpair and Nintendo/The Pokemon Company. Since the dispute kicked off in September 2024, there have been numerous developments, such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-rewrites-patent-mid-case-in-ongoing-lawsuit-against-palworld-dev-pocketpair-but-why"><u>Nintendo rewriting a patent mid-lawsuit</u></a>, arguing that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-says-mods-dont-count-as-prior-art-as-theyre-not-full-games-attempting-to-sway-judge-in-palworld-lawsuit?_gl=1*1e31uc1*_up*MQ..*_ga*Njk4NDIzNjQ2LjE3NjkxNzk5ODk.*_ga_4L6HY9G8XE*czE3NjkxNzk5OTIkbzEkZzAkdDE3NjkxNzk5OTIkajYwJGwwJGgw"><u>mods should not count as prior art</u></a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-and-the-pokemon-companys-monster-capture-patent-rejected-may-signal-problems-for-their-palworld-lawsuit"><u>getting their monster-capture patent rejected</u></a>. The case is expected to continue this year even as Pocketpair works towards the 1.0 release of Palworld.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West.

              <p><i><span>Dead Space </span></i><span>was revealed to be</span><a href="https://gamingbolt.com/dead-space-franchise-is-on-ice-ea-has-zero-plans-for-a-revival-rumor"> <span>permanently on ice</span></a><span> last year. We haven’t seen a non-VR version of the </span><i><span>Thief </span></i><span>franchise since 2014. </span><i><span>Deus Ex</span></i><span> has lain dormant for a decade. </span><i><span>Titanfall 2</span></i><span> also came out ten years ago. There hasn’t been a new 3D </span><i><span>Prince of Persia </span></i><span>for 16 years, and with</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-cancels-long-delayed-prince-of-persia-remake-black-flag-remake-delay-2000661866"> <span>this week’s news</span></a><span> it’s looking unlikely to return. So many massive, deeply loved gaming franchises are routinely being shelved by companies too afraid to gamble the nine-figure sums publishers believe is necessary for success. Yet there’s such an obvious solution!&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Every time I read a headline about a game franchise being shelved because it’s become too expensive, too big of a risk for a publisher to gamble $200 million on, I want to scream into the sky at the obviousness of the solution. But now, following the 2025 success of games like </span><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Arc Raiders</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Lies of P</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Helldivers 2</span></i><span>, surely the answer is clear to everyone? License these once big-name franchises to proven mid-size AA teams, and don’t interfere.</span></p>

 <p><span>In the wake of</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-earnings-layoffs-delays-canceled-ai-2000661869"> <span>Ubisoft’s latest</span></a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-share-price-crash-prince-of-persia-ai-2000662169"><span>disastrous</span></a><span> plan to rearrange itself by cancelling multiple projects, and the seemingly constant drip of major publishers shelving major franchises, all while giant company buys giant company for imaginary money, the industry has clearly got itself into a very bad place. Right now, during this grotesque phase of consolidation, with multi-billion-dollar sales seeing publishers consume one another, a financial black hole is being formed.</span></p> <p><span>With the colossally over-inflated prices involved in these deals, those buying are either borrowing heavily from predatory investors or gambling huge stakes of their own fortunes, such that the sheer notion of creating a new game in a once-loved series (let alone an original IP) becomes fantastically risky. To match the ridiculous valuations, the games these companies make are burdened with a need for justification, and every project must be predicted to bring in at least half a billion bucks to be worth even storyboarding. Ubisoft has just declared that it intends the games it makes to annually bring in a billion dollars each! Development costs therefore become self-destructively high, with expectations of figures of at least $200 million being spent to create something with enough spectacle to dazzle a hypothetical mainstream audience. Everything now needs to be the next </span><i><span>Call of Duty</span></i><span> at a time</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-sales-activision-2000652111"> <span>when even </span><i><span>Call of Duty</span></i><span> can’t manage that</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>Sure, welcome to capitalism 101: It doesn’t work. The need to always grow bigger, for share values to always increase, is a model so unsustainable that a pre-schooler could explain why. But here’s the thing, also easily grasped by toddlers: a moderately successful game that costs around $50 million to develop will make an awful lot more money than no game at all.</span></p>

 <h2><b><i>Dead Space</i></b><b> Needn’t Be Dead</b></h2> <p><span>The most recent example of a beloved game series being shelved is </span><i><span>Dead Space</span></i><span>. In late 2025,</span><a href="https://gamingbolt.com/dead-space-franchise-is-on-ice-ea-has-zero-plans-for-a-revival-rumor"><span> following rumors some months before that </span></a><a href="https://kotaku.com/dead-space-2-remake-canceled-sales-motive-battlefield-1851400721"><span>a </span><i><span>Dead Space 2 </span></i><span>remake had been cancelled</span></a> <span>after the supposedly disappointing sales for 2023’s remake of the original game, </span><a href="https://gamingbolt.com/dead-space-franchise-is-on-ice-ea-has-zero-plans-for-a-revival-rumor"><span>word went around</span></a><span> that EA had put the franchise “on ice.” In December 2024 we’d also learned that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dead-space-4-ea-remake-horror-1851727387"><span>the series’ original creators had tried to pitch a </span><i><span>Dead Space 4</span></i><span> to EA</span></a><span>, but had been immediately rejected. One of those original creators, Glen Schofield, still didn’t give up,</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dead-space-creator-sees-chance-make-dead-space-4-ea-saudi-deal-2000636125"> <span>maintaining in October last year that he was attempting to buy the IP back from EA</span></a><span> in the wake of</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-sale-saudi-arabia-madden-pif-jared-kushner-2000629829"> <span>the company’s attempted sale to Saudi Arabia</span></a><span>, but by December 2025</span><a href="https://gamingbolt.com/dead-space-franchise-is-on-ice-ea-has-zero-plans-for-a-revival-rumor"> <span>this looked incredibly unlikely</span></a><span>. Which is crazy! Because a new </span><i><span>Dead Space </span></i><span>is not something EA needs to be the least bit afraid of.</span></p> <p><span>The original </span><i><span>Dead Space</span></i><span>, released in 2008,</span><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/10/18/ex-visceral-dev-reveals-dead-space-2-cost-60-million-and-underperformed-on-4-million-sales/"> <span>cost approximately $37 million to make</span></a><span>. Adjusted for inflation, that’s $55 million in 2026 money.</span><span> And that was an in-house Electronic Arts studio, spending EA money within EA’s ludicrous corporate structure. I truly believe, with my whole lovely heart, that a well-established AA team would be easily capable of making a game of the caliber of that first, excellent horror-shooter for even less money than that, especially if innovative and novel ideas are used in place of the very fanciest modern graphics.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000662618" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000662618"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000662618">© Ubisoft</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Here’s another thing my heart believes: That </span><i><span>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</span></i><span> remake that Ubisoft</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-ubisoft-leak-2000647174"> <span>was unable to make for six agonizing years</span></a><span> before eventually</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-cancels-long-delayed-prince-of-persia-remake-black-flag-remake-delay-2000661866"> <span>killing it entirely</span></a><span>, could have been turned around by any number of excellent smaller teams. I’m not suggesting for a moment it would be </span><i><span>easy</span></i><span> to do so—it would be fantastically hard, just like making any other top-quality game—but it would be eminently achievable. Not least because, not being made internally at Ubisoft, it wouldn’t have Ubisoft constantly getting in the way. By all reports, </span><i><span>Sands of Time</span></i><span>‘s remake went through multiple iterations, scrapped and started over at least twice, and eventually was the victim of so much feature-creep that it was adding all-new powers, making Farah an entirely different character (for the better, I should add, but in the most complex way), and adding all-new content.</span></p> <p><span>However, in the hands of a super-capable and proven AA team with a proclivity for the genre and a love of the original, it could have been a far more straightforward process. That 2003 original doesn’t need new powers, nor new levels, because it was </span><i><span>fantastically good</span></i><span>. It’s one of the best third-person action games ever made, and featured a time-manipulation gimmick that should have become industry standard. At 23 years old, the original is still a great game, but a clunky and dated one that would benefit so wonderfully from a modern refresh. And that’s all anyone had ever been hoping for from Ubisoft.</span></p> <p><span>I’m sure there are many throwing up their arms and claiming that I’m over-simplifying things here. And yes, I’m being perfunctory, but I’d argue that’s because this is all relative. You might be surprised to learn just how needlessly complicated Ubisoft has made making games, even as far back as the 2000s. . I remember visiting Ubisoft Montreal for the announcement of </span><i><span>Splinter Cell: Double Agent</span></i><span> in 2005, and sitting in their offices as executives explained that development of the game was taking place 24 hours a day by being spread across at least three international studios. When Montreal finished work, they tagged in Ubisoft Milan, who would then pass the baton to Ubisoft Shanghai, and then back to Montreal. There were multiple daily video calls (2005 video calls at that) to try to manage this. Throughout the creation of the game it was </span><i><span>also</span></i><span> worked on by Ubisoft Toronto, Paris-based Gameloft, and North Carolina’s Red Storm. Imagine working like that. Try to imagine a more chaotic way to develop a game. (I remember asking developers how it could possibly work, and the rather taut smiles as they explained that it “wasn’t easy.”)</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000662616" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000662616"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000662616">© Ubisoft</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>Something &gt; Nothing</b></h2> <p><span>So no, a AA team making a $50 million (or even a $5 million) game won’t deliver the spectacle and mainstream breakthrough appeal of </span><i><span>Battlefield</span></i><span>, but nor does it need to. If you’re spending $400m on a game (before you even factor in the cost of a global promotional campaign and wildly expensive influencer events), you need it to be bringing in numbers as close to a billion dollars as possible. If that’s not at all realistic, then the project can’t get greenlit in the first place. But if you’ve spent $50m, and justifiably charge $60 for a top-quality product, you are in the black with so many fewer sales. If your game hits (and let’s remember, we’re in this mess because of all the $200m+ gambles that have missed), you could be in for vast profits.</span></p> <p><span>And it’s not fantasy figures, either! </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-trigger-nade-kettle-pvp-nerfs-2000659269"><i><span>Arc Raiders</span></i><span> announced this month that it has sold 12 million copies</span></a><span>, which at $40 a pop amounts to $480,000,000. Yup. Half a billion bucks. Sure, minus store fees that’s “only” $336 million. We don’t know its development costs, but developers have stated it was nowhere near AAA budgets. And this is a game with optional in-game cosmetic purchases, meaning that figure is going to be </span><i><span>so</span></i><span> much higher.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i><span>’s developers </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/11/arts/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sandfall.html"><span>claim</span></a><span> it cost less than $10 million to make, and it had sold over 6 million copies by the end of 2025. That means the $50 game has brought in at least $300,000,000 before store tithes. That’s a 3000 percent profit, and these are the numbers from </span><a href="https://thisweekinvideogames.com/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sees-sales-spike-following-game-awards-success/"><i><span>before</span></i></a><span> the game won all the 2025 GOTY awards and the sales that will have resulted from that.</span></p> <p><span>These are certainly stand-out examples from last year (although only some of them), but these are figures Ubisoft or EA would sell their grandchildren’s souls to see. The point is, I’m not talking out of my hat here about the potential of spending far less on a far smaller team.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000662617" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000662617"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000662617">© EA</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Many AA teams wouldn’t be interested in making a licensed game using someone else’s IP, and honestly, I wouldn’t want to trust a big-name publisher right now even if I were one who did. But many would! If you’re a small team with a $10 million project that didn’t catch fire, you’re in a very difficult place no matter how incredibly talented you might be. Many, many mid-size studios fold at that point, but what if there was the route of being trusted with the next </span><i><span>Dead Space</span></i><span>, or </span><i><span>Legacy of Kain</span></i><span>, or </span><i><span>Sleeping Dogs</span></i><span>, or </span><i><span>Thief</span></i><span>, or </span><i><span>Trespasser</span></i><span>, or </span><i><span>Command &amp; Conquer</span></i><span>, or </span><i><span>Titanfall</span></i><span>, or </span><i><span>Splinter Cell</span></i><span>, or </span><i><span>SSX</span></i><span>, or </span><i><span>Red Faction</span></i><span>, or…</span></p>

 <p><span>Maybe there’s some big, fatal flaw with this concept that would come to the surface on trying. But I’m really doubtful. The issue is the complete lack of ever trying! And honestly, in their crumbling, fire-sale-driven state, what does an Ubisoft or an EA have to lose?! There hasn’t been a </span><i><span>Splinter Cell</span></i><span> game since 2013, meaning for the last 13 years precisely $0 has been made on new </span><i><span>Splinter Cell </span></i><span>games. I realize that’s perhaps somewhat obvious, but it’s a really rather important point! A $10,000,000 </span><i><span>Splinter Cell</span></i><span> that “only” sells a million copies at $50 a pop: that’s a 500 percent profit. And even if it might seem like small change in a world where (very, very few) games bring in a billion dollars, it’s a heck of a lot more than $0.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Embark Studios has finally revealed its plans for the future of ARC Raiders, and as you could expect, it’s chock full of content. </p>



<p>This was all revealed in a recent <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-2026-roadmap-live-tracker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders 2026 Roadmap</a>, where content for the next four months was laid out. A few bits drop in the remainder of January with the release of Headwinds, such as a new Player Project and Minor Map Condition, but the real fun begins in February with Shrouded Sky. </p>







<p>Check out this guide for everything to know about the new content coming to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-arc-raiders-meta-guns-tier-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a> in February 2026. </p>



<h2 id="h-every-piece-of-new-content-coming-to-arc-raiders-in-february-2026">Every Piece Of New Content Coming To ARC Raiders In February 2026</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Get ready for new experiences topside. Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>As things stand, the Escalation Roadmap for ARC Raiders suggests that plenty of new content is on the way, including a new Map Condition, new ARC, and even a new Map Update. </strong></p>



<p>And somehow, that’s not all, as February is gearing up to be a major month in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-aggression-based-matchmaking-in-arc-raiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>. Here’s everything coming to ARC Raiders during the Shrouded Sky updates.</p>



<ul>
<li>New Map Condition</li>



<li>New ARC Threat</li>



<li>Player Project</li>



<li>Raider Deck</li>



<li>Map Update</li>



<li>Expedition Window</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s a comprehensive list, and each phrase has a small image next to it, which might hint at more details. For example, the New Map Condition is pictured alongside a gust of wind—can we expect a storm to hit certain maps? As for the new ARC threat, a flying insect is shown, implying another airborne ARC is on the way. </p>



<h2 id="h-when-will-the-february-content-release-in-arc-raiders">When Will The February Content Release In ARC Raiders?</h2>



<p><strong>There is no detailed release window for the upcoming content, but it’s fair to assume that when it does drop, it’ll be at the usual ARC Raiders timings: 1:30 a.m. PT / 4:30 a.m. ET / 9:30 a.m. GMT / 10:30 a.m. CET</strong></p>



<p>It looks like it’s going to be an exciting month, but it can be frustrating to be left guessing when it could all arrive. It’s reasonable to assume that Embark Studios will scatter the content throughout the month to keep the game as fresh as possible. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The biggest news of the week is undoubtedly <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-major-reset-cancels-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/"><strong>Ubisoft</strong> undergoing a <strong>"<em>major reset</em></strong>" as a company</a>, shaking up its portfolio by cancelling six projects, including the <strong>Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake</strong>, delaying <strong>seven other projects</strong>, and <strong>spinning up four new IPs</strong>; and that's just what we know happened to its portfolio. <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-more-layoffs-return-to-office-mandate/"><strong>The whole structure of the company</strong> was shifted around to boot</a>, but through all of this mess, one long-running project survived: <strong>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</strong>.</p>



<p>A game that was said to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/beyond-good-evil-2-reportedly-still-years-away-from-release/">"<em>years away from release</em>"</a> after it had already been in production for <strong>14 years at the time of that report</strong> (which itself is now <strong>four years old</strong>) is still worth burning money on, according to Ubisoft. In fact, the company still believes that the game has something to offer that makes it a "<em>unique proposition</em>" when compared to other modern fantasy games.</p>



<p>"<em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 remains part of our portfolio and our roadmap and fits with our strategy of focusing on open world adventures</em>," a Ubisoft spokesperson told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-long-in-the-works-beyond-good-and-evil-2-a-unique-proposition-in-the-open-world-adventure-market-studio-says">Eurogamer</a>, before continuing to say that fans of fantasy games are "<em>underserved</em>," and that Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 remains a "<em>unique proposition</em>" for players.</p>



<p>We've known about Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 being in development at Ubisoft since <strong>2008</strong>, when it was first publicly revealed. Since then, the last time <a href="https://wccftech.com/beyond-good-and-evil-2-revealed/">we saw an official trailer for it was at <strong>E3 2017</strong></a>. And while Ubisoft deemed the six to seven years spent on the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake were ultimately unsalvageable, the <strong>nearly 18 years it has spent on Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</strong> clearly aren't in the minds of Ubisoft leadership. They were <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-still-hiring-beyond-good-and-evil-2/">even hiring people for the project <strong>as recently as last November</strong></a>.</p>



<p>(<a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-lost-nearly-95-of-value-in-eight-years-34-share-price-drop-after-major-reset/">This is the same leadership that led the company to lose <strong>95% of its value in the last eight years.)</strong></a></p>



<p>Ultimately, who knows if this game will ever come out. If it does, and it's a hit, that's great for Ubisoft and for the people who will have likely been waiting a full <strong>20 years</strong> for it to release. But it's more likely that no matter the quality of the final release, no game, Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 included, can live up to the expectations of a 20-year development period. If anything, you might find more people expecting the worst after it remained gestating for that long.</p>



<p>The fact that people are still working on it, and that there are still players waiting on it, is a testament to the mark left by the first game, which you can thankfully still go and play, and will be able to play for many more years now that a <a href="https://wccftech.com/beyond-good-and-evil-20th-anniversary-edition-confirmed-to-launch-on-june-25/">remaster of <strong>Beyond Good &amp; Evil</strong> is available</a>. But with every passing year, the idea of Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 releasing as a 'masterpiece of a video game worth the two-decade wait' is a pitch that becomes less and less convincing.</p>



<p>And that's all without mentioning the real kicker in all of this: by the time it comes out (if that day ever arrives), will anyone actually care? Which is to say, it's always a gamble when trying to bring back something old and make today's consumers who didn't grow up with it care about that thing.</p>



<p>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 has been in development long enough to go to college, and it wouldn't be a surprise if today's generation of young players, who are more interested in playing 'forever games' like <a href="https://wccftech.com/top-five-played-games-in-us-2025-playstation-xbox-the-same-as-2024/"><strong>Roblox, Fortnite,</strong> <strong>Call of Duty, Grand Theft Auto V</strong> and <strong>Minecraft</strong></a>, couldn't care less about a game from over a decade ago they've only heard of in passing, if they've heard of it at all.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I've done a fair bit of camping over the years, and I often had to deal with the disquieting possibility of something going wrong, dozens or hundreds of miles away from civilization. In our <em>The Gold River Project </em>preview, you'll get to see what it's like being stranded in the wilderness, where everything is not quite what it seems.</p><p><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/gold-river-project" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="0e367eee-ab76-47df-bc21-b90a2431ae67" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>The Gold River Project</em></a> has you taking on the role of a person going on a camping trip. Fairview Games Inc. promises a survival adventure coupled with a thrilling mystery. The hints of something interesting are there, and I was curious to see if <em>The Gold River Project</em> could deliver on its promises.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>The short time spend in the outfitter's store could have been a great tutorial; it feels like a wasted opportunity.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Arriving in Gold River</h2><p>Your adventure begins in a camping office where you can view brochures and look at some nice decorations. You're promised that supplies will be made available at your campsite; upon arriving, however, you find that the campsite is destroyed and you have nothing to your name other than the clothes on your back.</p><p>By all accounts, absolutely everything has gone wrong. The pilot who dropped you off via seaplane left without checking if everything was okay. Your supplies are gone. There are no other people around other than yourself (and if you're playing multiplayer, your friends).</p><blockquote><p>The tutorial seems a little too bare bones for this game, and the situation only gets more disappointing from there.</p></blockquote><p>A short tutorial directs players to their intended campsite and gives serviceable guidance for basic crafting. Once you've looted the area, you can then go wherever you like. If you paid attention, you'll find a note directing you to a cabin at the end of a nearby trail. You're walked through setting up a basic camp, and that's it.</p><p>I'm all for minimalist tutorials, especially in a game like this; a big part of the fun of survival crafting games is figuring things out yourself. That said, the tutorial seems a little <em>too</em> bare bones for this game, and the situation only gets more disappointing from there.</p><figure role="group">

</figure>
<h2>Crude Crafting and Survival</h2><p>Crafting in <em>The Gold River Project</em> uses a recipe unlock system; you need to research specific items to unlock crafting recipes using a "Learn" function in your inventory. This also destroys the item. In my first attempt, I couldn't find enough cloth to make a bed and had to restart.</p><p>I managed to find everything I needed on my second attempt and set up a small campsite at a nearby cabin. This cabin had a fishing rod and some animal bones inside. I destroyed one animal bone to learn how to make bone fishing hooks, and then I used the second animal bone to make them.</p><p>Much to my displeasure, I found that fishing did not work at all. Maybe I'm missing something, but the guaranteed spawn of these items and a nearby small dock implies that this would be a good place to fish. I spent a good 10 minutes on the shoreline with nothing to show for it.</p><p>Another issue I had was the inability to unlock a crafting bench. I still don't know what you have to research to unlock it, if the item even exists or functions correctly. This locked me out of many of the more interesting items for most of my short playthrough.</p><p>I had enough supplies where I felt comfortable exploring, but night was falling. I decided to go to sleep for the night and get moving in the morning, and this is where I encountered another problem: I couldn't figure out how to sleep to pass the night. I ended up waiting until the sun came up.</p><figure role="group">

<h2>Hints of a Mystery</h2><p>My first in-game day was rife with problems, but I didn't want to give up on <em>The Gold River Project</em> just yet. A map in the visitor's center at the start of the game showed what looked like a fairly large playable area, so I decided to do a bit of exploring.</p><p>There are quite a few cabins, larger buildings, and other points of interest dotting the landscape. Most of these locations have some kind of useful loot, such as food or healing items. I found many items (such as batteries and electronics) that appeared useful but didn't immediately appear to have a use; they couldn't be researched, either.</p><p>Along the way, I found a few bits of lore. A cassette tape here, a handwritten note there. For the most part, though, I found a largely empty world devoid of any kind of meaningful objective other than surviving to the next day.</p><blockquote><p>I would have loved to explore the mystery in Gold River, but the barebones (and barely functional) survival and crafting mechanics killed any desire I had to continue.</p></blockquote><p>I didn't see much in the way of wildlife, either. At one point, I came across two deer next to a building that had a crafting bench inside it. As this was the only time I saw any animals, I strongly suspect that the appearance of these deer was scripted or otherwise pre-placed.</p><p>There was one element that really piqued my curiosity. Some of the buildings have cameras and spotlights on top of them. If you travel far enough, you'll encounter a futuristic force field keeping you in the playable area.</p><p>There's clearly some kind of high-tech surveillance happening here, and whoever is manning these cameras is definitely watching you. I would have loved to explore the mystery in Gold River, but the barebones (and barely functional) survival and crafting mechanics killed any desire I had to continue.</p><figure role="group">

<h2><em>The Gold River Project</em> Preview | Final Thoughts</h2><p>From what I've seen, <em>The Gold River Project</em> is a little undercooked. I can forgive a lack of story and a weak tutorial in an Early Access game, but I can't overlook the poorly functioning survival mechanics and crafting system.</p><p>To the credit of Fairview Games Inc., it's quite upfront that it intends for this to be a genuine Early Access experience where it can collect feedback from players and build out the game from there. It's good that this developer is being up front about that.</p><p>If you're keen on providing genuine feedback to a game that is very much still under development, you might want to check out <em>The Gold River Project</em>. If you're looking for a new survival crafting game to play and enjoy right now, though, it's probably best to wait until <em>The Gold River Project's</em> many rough edges have been smoothed out.</p><hr><p>The Gold River Project <em>was previewed over approximately 6 hours of gameplay on PC via </em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1253220/The_Gold_River_Project/" rel="nofollow"><em>Steam</em></a><em> with a key provided by the publisher.
