            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nihon-falcom-chairman-masayuki-kato-dies<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nihon Falcom founder and chairman Masayuki Kato has passed away at the age of 78, the studio has revealed. His cause of death has not been stated.</p>

<p>Per an announcement by Nihon Falcom (with translation from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/1hg50yo/comment/m2gmzk3/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Reddit user TheBlueDolphina</a>), Kato died on December 15th, which is also when he "resigned from his position as Director" at the company. That might sound obvious, but I'm guessing confirming this is some kind of requirement with regards to corporate structure.</p>

<p>Kato's death will be marked by a funeral and a wake that are open only to close family members "in accordance with the wishes of the bereaved family", Nihon Falcom's statement reads. The studio is also "respectfully" declining condolence gifts or physical messages of sympathy.</p>

<p>The company's early games would prove hugely influential in shaping the then-nascent JRPG and action RPG genres; with franchises like&nbsp;<em>Ys</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Heroes</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Dragon Slayer</em>, the company arguably laid the groundwork for later giants like&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest</em>.</p>

<p>Today, Nihon Falcom is perhaps best known for the still-ongoing&nbsp;<em>Ys&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Heroes&nbsp;</em>franchises, the latter of which has birthed the popular&nbsp;<em>Trails&nbsp;</em>sub-series to which luminaries like&nbsp;<em>Trails in the Sky&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Trails of Cold Steel&nbsp;</em>belong.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nihon-falcom-trails-of-cold-steel.jpg?itok=9K48phDZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nihon-falcom-trails-of-cold-steel.jpg?itok=MZqYu2jc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Trails&nbsp;</em>sub-series is just one of Nihon Falcom's exports.</figcaption></figure><p>While Kato remained the chairman of Nihon Falcom, he wasn't its president; that role is filled by Toshihiro Kondo, who said back in October that the studio was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nihon-falcom-considering-ai-translation" rel="nofollow">considering utilizing generative AI</a> for speedier translations.</p>

<p>It's not clear how the day-to-day running of Nihon Falcom will be affected by Kato's death, but for now, we can simply mourn the loss of one of the JRPG world's most influential figures. Stay tuned for more.</p>

It stands for “Second Valuable Player.” A few games here and there have used it, namely some MOBAs like <em>League of Legends: Wild Rift</em>, but it isn’t the most common gaming phrase. It is fortunately an easy concept to understand, and one worth knowing when it comes to ranked play. Let’s break down what SVP means in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>.</p><h2 id="h161135"><a id="svp"></a>What is SVP?</h2><figure id="" data-id="9486f2106988401fd4cb7b3f41e1d0a2" data-recommend-id="image://9486f2106988401fd4cb7b3f41e1d0a2" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Post-Match result screen shows a defeated team with Jeff the Land Shark as the SVP." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Post-Match result screen shows a defeated team with Jeff the Land Shark as the SVP." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9486f2106988401fd4cb7b3f41e1d0a2" data-recommend-id="image://9486f2106988401fd4cb7b3f41e1d0a2" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Post-Match result screen shows a defeated team with Jeff the Land Shark as the SVP." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The MVP is always the best-performing player on the winning team. <strong>On the flip side is the SVP, or Second Valuable Player, who is the best performer on the losing team.</strong> Even though they lost, they’re highlighted for putting in the most work among their teammates.</p><p>SVP is likely awarded on the same merits that MVP would be. The Ace players for each team are likely the ones that will be awarded MVP and SVP in the end. <strong>Here are some general guidelines to improve your chances of being considered the best on your team</strong>:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Spending time on the match’s objective is key for everyone.</li><li>Blocking damage is an important duty for Vanguards.</li><li>Getting the most kills isn’t always the most important thing in a team game, but it is what Duelists should aim for.</li><li>Healers are vital for every team, so Strategists should heal as much damage as possible.</li></ul><p>The SVP title doesn’t mean much in regular quick matches besides earning some kudos for doing your best. When it comes to Competitive Play, however, it does have a functional purpose that everyone on the losing team will want: Hanging onto more Ranked points.</p><h2 id="h161136"><a id="avoid"></a>How to avoid losing Rank with SVP<br></h2><p>The Rank system in <em>Marvel Rivals</em> is pretty simple. When it comes to progress, your Rank will increase with every win and decrease with every loss. There is one small consolation though—<strong>the SVP in a Competitive match loses fewer Ranked points</strong>. </p><p>Although there is no way to prevent the entire team from dropping their Rank, the best player on the losing team can at least receive a more lenient deduction. It’s a great way to motivate you to try your hardest during the most difficult situations. You should be aiming to win no matter what, but it’s still nice to know you might have a saving grace waiting if you do really well despite losing the match.</p><p>SVP isn’t as flashy as MVP, but earning the title is still a great accomplishment in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. You’ll need to take your role seriously and be a real team player to be the best for either team. If you want to know how else to be an asset to your allies, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-hero-shooter-overwatch-team-attacks-how-1851718182&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-hero-shooter-overwatch-team-attacks-how-1851718182">Team-Up Abilities</a></span> can make a difference. <em>Marvel Rivals</em> is available for free on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows.</p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In <a href="https://playdauntless.com/news/reflections-what-comes-next/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>website titled "Reflections on the Launch and What Comes Next", Phoenix Labs says it "hear[s]" players' frustration with Awakening and that it "sincerely apologize[s]" to players who felt their "time, effort, and trust were overlooked".</p>

<p>Phoenix Labs goes on to say that while its goals for Awakening were "ambitious", it acknowledges that the release of the update caused "frustration and confusion" and that it's "committed" to earning players' trust back.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dauntless-awakening-update-apology-snow.jpg?itok=icU89lxi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dauntless-awakening-update-apology-snow.jpg?itok=ka4wuZwz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dauntless</em>' Awakening update caused "frustration and confusion", developer Phoenix Labs has admitted.</figcaption></figure><p>In order to "respect [players'] lost progress and investment", Phoenix Labs says it'll be awarding 300,000 Rams and 5,000 Combat Merits to returning players, as well as up to 500 Peerless Aetherite "based on your weapon crafting in the pre-Awakening game".</p>

<p>Additionally, all game modes will be unlocked from the jump for returning players in an upcoming update, so you won't have to complete the new questline to unlock your favorite mode.</p>

<p>Phoenix Labs also says it's currently working on "immediate adjustments...to address progression, monetization, and technical issues", which were three of the biggest areas players identified as frustrations with Awakening.</p>

<p>Throughout the rest of the post, Phoenix Labs goes into detail regarding how it plans to reimburse players' time, detailing what initiatives are in place to fix&nbsp;<em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>and make it appealing to returning players again.</p>




<p>In case you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Dauntless</em>' Awakening update, it launched earlier this month, with the Steam version of the game also arriving on the same date.</p>

<p>Handily, that means&nbsp;<em>Dauntless</em>' <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/331370/Dauntless/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam reviews</a>, which are currently sitting at Overwhelmingly Negative,&nbsp;pretty accurately reflect players' feelings about Awakening. Complaints include new paywalls where none previously existed, as well as massive changes to weapon crafting, technical problems, and much more.</p>

<p>Suffice it to say that although&nbsp;<em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>managed to rack up <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dauntless-boasts-over-four-million-players-in-first-week" rel="nofollow">more than four million players</a> in its opening week, numbers have dwindled massively since then, and the Awakening update hasn't exactly restored trust in Phoenix Labs.</p>

<p>Hopefully, the changes outlined in the developer's blog post can bring players back, but I wouldn't be surprised if this was the beginning of the end for&nbsp;<em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>either. You can play the game right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/331370/Dauntless/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/dauntless/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/dauntless/9nq0v4dwrk49" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/dauntless-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> for free.</p>

But, as it turns out, I might have spoken too soon! 2024 provided a huge list of great third- and first-person shooters across console and PC, from devs both big and small. This year had so many awesome games that deciding which shooters to recognize here and which to leave aside was a painful process.</p><p> As before, this list is split into two sections. First, we’ll look at seven fantastic new shooters that arrived this year. Then, we’ll look at a few older shooters that received updates and continued support in 2024.

In <em>Mullet Madjack </em>you use not only guns but also your fists, feet, and melee weapons to massacre wealthy androids while you livestream it to your in-game audience.

Jumping into a group of enemy players as Venom, taking most of them out, and then hopping away feels good. On the flip side, when I see a Venom try to do that and I’m playing as Black Widow, I just smile and snipe that gooey bastard from afar. Everyone is powerful. Everyone feels dangerous in the right hands. Is this balanced? Probably not.

<p>Revenge of the Savage Planet is a game that some might not have expected to see happen after the dissolution of Google Stadia and its studios shortly after the launch of its predecessor, Journey to the Savage Planet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, after Typhoon Studios was shut down in 2021, its founders started another studio called Raccoon Logic and acquired the rights to Journey and the planned sequel. Now, over three years later, Revenge of the Savage Planet is on its way to Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and PC in May 2025.</p>



<p>I was recently invited to a preview event for the game to get a more detailed look at the gameplay, a few missions, weapons, enemies, the planets you’ll visit, and more. While I didn’t get to play the game firsthand, I was shown over 30 minutes of gameplay that left me excited with what I saw and wishing I was shown more.</p>



<h2 id="h-revenge-of-the-savage-planet-preview">Revenge of the Savage Planet Preview</h2>



<p>Revenge of the Savage Planet is built in Unreal Engine 5 – specifically, 5.3 – and features a vibrant world with unique creatures and over-the-top animations that could best be described as goofy. There are four main planets with a secret fifth planet that you unlock “if you figure out the mysteries of the world and find it yourself”.</p>



<p>As opposed to the first game in the series, this game moves to a third-person perspective. Creative Director Alex Hutchinson said the developers made the move for a few reasons, including opening up for more character customization, better platforming, and better for seeing things that can happen to players such as catching on fire or slipping. With the move to third-person, the game removed the slap mechanic in favor of keeping the kick that can send creatures launching high into the air. It was done because kicks looked “funnier” in third person than a slap did, Hutchinson said.</p>



<p>As far as what players can expect with gameplay, Hutchinson said that Revenge of the Savage Planet is a “Metroidvania at heart”. You have to get new weapons and equipment, upgrade your skills, and uncover coordinates for the new planets to progress forward. There’s also character customization and home customization that lets you express yourself in the way you see fit.</p>



<p>Each planet has its own unique creatures that vary between friendly and hostile. Some will just roam around you while others will go out of their way to attack. One example on the desert planet is a beetle that digs its horn into the ground to help it flip and try to hit you with its back.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Exploration Is The Name Of The Game</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>The game features a map that the team debated adding. Hutchinson said they didn’t want players to play the game through a map. To avoid that, Raccoon Logic made it so the map reveals itself as you go to various areas rather than being available from the get-go. That’s part of the game’s ultimate goal as well. The developers don’t want you to get through the planets in one fell swoop while you play. With the various locations, they said that the goal is to distract you with everything around you. Each planet has a number of secrets to unlock and special areas to explore that will keep you from getting what you need in order to return to Earth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Speaking of exploration, the planets have a layered environment, giving you more areas to visit and traverse. Some have you bouncing through a fungi canopy while others have you gliding through the sky to get to your destination.</p>



<p>The game can be played alone or with a friend either locally or online with cross-play support. Despite talks of potentially allowing for four-player co-op, Racoon Logic said that the decision to limit it to two-player was a creative choice. They found that players are more likely to talk and interact more with one other play than with a group.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regarding game length, Raccoon Logic says tests have shown it taking around 20 hours to 100% the game while some have completed the main story in 15 hours. This is by design as the studio wanted to keep it realistic to complete where it didn’t feel like a chore or burden to get through. To hit that time frame, the game’s difficulty scale isn’t one to push players away. Rather than a traditional scale as you progress, Revenge of the Savage Planet’s difficulty will adjust based on how efficient you are as you play. The more efficient, the more challenging it can be. Still, they didn’t want the game to be too challenging for anyone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s not about challenge, it’s more about exploring,” Hutchinson said while adding that they view the game as something for all ages. “We’re not Dark Souls, we’re ‘Light Souls’.”</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Overall, I was left excited about what Raccoon Logic has built with Revenge of the Savage Planet. The planets, for the areas shown, look great — there’s an ice planet that wasn’t shown but was talked about that I’m really interested in visiting — and the gameplay appears fun and accessible. One thing I would’ve liked to see more of during my time around the game, though, was its satire and humor. Journey to the Savage Planet was a bit hit or miss in that area. So, I’m hoping the writing is a bit better this time around. That said, humor is subjective so I know what I may find funny or not likely won’t be the same as you or someone else playing the game.</p>



<p>As mentioned earlier, the game will be coming to PC and consoles when it launches. For those on consoles, it’s currently planned to launch at a locked 30 frames per second (FPS). They are looking at getting it to 60 FPS on the systems, but it’s not something in the cards just yet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One thing that the game will feature are platform-specific costumes at launch. For example, those on Xbox will have a Red Ring of Death costume available exclusively to them. Eventually, the plan is to bring every outfit to every player, but, at the start, they want to give players a unique feel depending on what they choose to play on.</p>



<p>Revenge of the Savage Planet launches in May 2025, so stick with Insider Gaming for a full review around release.</p>

<p>Certain meta decks dominated Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket’s early weeks, but the release of Celebi ex prompted a new meta deck in Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket, and we have a walkthrough of our best deck, and how to get it.</p>



<p>Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mythical-island-set-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mythical Island</a> expansion brought about a new, complete <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/complete-pokemon-tcg-pocket-mythical-island-card-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">set of cards</a>. Alongside fiery new ex pulls and stunning Full Arts, one card arguably stands out above the rest—Celebi ex. Mew may be the cover star of Mythical Island, but Celebi ex has a certain quality, making it a necessity for the best grass decks.</p>



<p>I present to you our best Celebi ex meta deck, how to get the card, and how to get the most out of it.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-celebi-ex-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">How to Get Celebi ex in Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The heart of this deck. Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Celebi ex can either be pulled from Mythical Island booster packs in Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket, or crafted using Pack Points.</strong></p>



<p>It’s not a Premium Pass promo card like the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-promo-10-mewtwo-card-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mewtwo 10 card</a>, and there is no special challenge to get a Celebi ex. You need to get lucky with a Mythical Island booster pack and score one of the multiple ex designs, or save up 500 Pack Points—<strong>for Mythical Island, not Genetic Apex</strong>—and purchase it.</p>







<p>The best Celebi ex meta deck requires <strong>two each of Celebi ex</strong>, <strong>Snivy</strong>, <strong>Servine</strong>, <strong>Serperior</strong>, one <strong>Dhelmise</strong>, and one copy of <strong>Mystical Island’s</strong> <strong>Exeggcute</strong> and <strong>Exggecutor</strong>.</p>



<p>Grass decks are boss, but to get the top cards, they’re normally Two-Stage Evolutions—which isn’t ideal in a very RNG-orientated card game. So, for my best Celebi ex deck, I want a good mix of Basics and later evolutions.</p>



<p>Here’s my best Celebi ex Meta Deck I recommend using.</p>

<h2 id="h-best-celebi-ex-type-alternatives-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">Best Celebi ex type alternatives in Pokémon TCG Pocket</h2>



<p>The main alternative to Celebi ex has to be <strong>Venusaur ex</strong>—another hard-to-get card if luck isn’t on your side.</p>



<p>You can charge up a Venusaur ex fast using the deck’s Serperior emphasis. Players might prefer this as Venusaur trumps Celebi ex’s HP with a whopping <strong>190 HP</strong>. This makes the card extra tanky, and while its Giant Bloom attack <em>only </em>(in the context of a Stage 2 ex) does 100 damage, <strong>it recovers 30 HP with every attack</strong>—prolonging its life. </p>



<h2 id="h-why-is-celebi-ex-deck-so-powerful-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">Why is Celebi ex Deck so Powerful in Pokémon TCG Pocket?</h2>



<p>The star of the show is Celebi ex. The reason? <strong>Serperior’s Jungle Totem ability</strong> makes it so “Each Grass energy attached to your Pokémon&nbsp;provides 2 Grass Energy. This effect doesn’t stack.” This effectively makes it the <strong>grass equivalent of Garvedoir</strong>, only, you can’t have two Serperiors at once both using Jungle Totem—just the one.</p>



<p>Now, you can stack energy on Celebi ex, making its Powerful Bloom move deadly. Here’s a description of the attack, “<strong>Flip a coin for each Energy attached to this Pokémon. This attack does 50 damage for each heads.</strong>“</p>



<p>You need to focus on building up a Celebi ex, all the while trying to speed through Snivy’s evolution line until it becomes Serperior. Having two lots of each highlighted Pokémon gives us better chances of pulling them faster. To fill out the deck, Dhelmise has great HP for a Basic, and if you don’t have Celebi ex yet, its main attack can also be charged up to great effect.</p>



<p>Finally, I prefer the Mystical Island Exeggcute and Exggecutor for a couple of reasons. While I love Exeggcutor’s EX card from Genetic Apex, it was very luck-dependent, and <strong>its ex status risks a two-point loss</strong>. The Mythical Island Exeggutor has 130 HP as a non-ex (we love this) and its main attack is another that can be charged through Serperior.</p>

            <p>Naoki Hamaguchi, the director of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-guides-tips-tricks-9403">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a>, has asked PC players not to install any "offensive or inappropriate" mods once the game is released.</p>
<p>The PC release of the game was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-pc-release-date-announced">revealed at last week's The Game Awards</a>, arriving 23rd January 2025. Of course, this means it will be open to the modding community.</p>
<p>"While the team has no plans for official in-game mod support," Hamaguchi told <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/ja/news/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-is-officially-coming-to-pc-and-the-epic-games-store?lang=ja">Epic Games</a>, "we respect the creativity of the modding community and welcome their creations - though we ask modders not to create or install anything offensive or inappropriate."</p>

<p>No doubt Rebirth will befall a similar fate - I look forward to seeing the Weapons replaced by Thomas the Tank Engine.</p>
<p>Hamaguchi's comments <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-16-producer-doesnt-want-offensive-or-inappropriate-mods-on-pc-release">echo those of Final Fantasy 16 producer Naoki Yoshida</a>, who similarly asked fans not to create inappropriate mods for that game's PC release. That may have been asking for trouble, but since its release in September the weirdest mods were simply <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-16-modders-put-ben-starrs-shining-meme-face-on-clives-cape">adding Ben Starr's shining meme face to Clive's cape</a>.</p><p>Hamaguchi also told Epic that DLC was considered for the PC version "as an episodic story", much like the Yuffie INTERmission DLC for Remake. However, with limited resources, the team ultimately decided finishing the third game in the trilogy was the "highest priority".</p>
<p>"However, if we receive strong requests from players after the release regarding certain matters, we would like to consider them," added Hamaguchi.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth will come with improved lighting, though, and fans have been sharing comparisons on social media.</p>

			<p>Grand Theft Auto 6 has yet to be released, but a talented fan has already managed to quite convincingly reimagine a small portion of the game in Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>Over the past weekend, an alleged leaked video of the new entry in the series started making the rounds, fooling the vast majority of fans with its great attention to detail. The short video, however, isn't a real leaked video of Grand Theft Auto 6, but an Unreal Engine 5 creation made to look as close as possible to the real leaked videos of the game, which surfaced online a while back, made by a developer known as Long Long Time in around one month. While it may have been disappointing to learn that the video wasn't the first look at the game in a very long time, it is still an interesting watch that showcases the developer's amazing talent at creating a very believable slice of a game we have seen very little of so far.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Confirmed fake. <a href="https://t.co/Hz8MNeSDTh">pic.twitter.com/Hz8MNeSDTh</a></p>
<p>— Synth Potato🥔 (@SynthPotato) <a href="https://twitter.com/SynthPotato/status/1868021749687931287?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 14, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>No matter when it will launch, Grand Theft Auto 6 is going to have a huge impact on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-release-window-publishers/">video game industry</a> as a whole, so much so that some publishers are planning the release of their own titles so as not to coincide with its launch. Analysts also predict it will be the<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-expected-to-be-the-biggest-entertainment-launch-of-all-time-but-a-performance-below-expectations-could-impact-the-entire-industry/"> biggest entertainment launch of all time</a>, and its failure could have some important consequences for the industry. Not that a failure is likely, judging from fake leaks like the one above, as the hype for the next entry in the series by Rockstar Games is only getting bigger the more we inch closer to its late 2025 launch.</p>

Developer Creatures Inc. has still added myriad new missions and solo battles for players to interact with though, which somewhat recreates that opening day feeling of the digital trading card game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are plenty of special cards added with Mythical Island too, which despite adding 86 cards total officially caps out at 68 cards. This means there are 18 of the "secrete" alternate art cards, including one immersive and one crown card.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the mission front, Mythical Island Dex Missions have been added which, just like Genetic Apex, reward players with special shop tickets for collecting five, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 50, and 60 unique Mythical Island cards. These can be used to redeem a Mew icon.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Alternate Art 'Secret' Card in Pokémon TCG Pocket: Mythical Island</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Deck Missions are added too, rewarding players with Rental Decks for collecting some of the major new cards available in Mythical Island including Celebi ex, Gyarados ex, Mew ex, Aerodactyl ex, and Pidgeot ex.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, Themed Collections are also updated for Mythical Island. A variety of missions here reward different items for collecting, well, themed collections of cards, such as the Flower Travelers mission tasking players with collecting the three flower Pokémon in the Florges evolution line.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Solo Battles at the Step-Up and Expert tiers have also been updated with new challenges. Eight new Step-Up Battles have been added for Mythical Island decks, with players able to take on the second most challenging versions of decks such as Celebi ex and Mew ex to earn rewards such as pack hourglasses.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another eight decks are added at the Expert Battle tier, which each reward seven Pack Hourglasses upon completion. The Step-Up Battles offer five, so a total of 96 Pack Hourglasses are available in solo battles alone, letting players open eight booster packs at no cost. This comes on top of 12 Pack Hourglasses that Creatures Inc. offered as free gift to all players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Wonder Picks, these now appear to only serve Mythical Island packs and no longer Genetic Apex, though it's possible the new set is just dominating the random selection since the majority of players are presumably opening it on launch day.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Other changes to the game will emerge over the coming days, as the 86 new cards are slotted into the meta and shake up the player versus player scene. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-players-cower-as-mythical-island-expansion-threatens-to-make-misty-even-stronger">A new Vaporeon card is already threatening to make Misty even more powerful</a>, while Aerodactyl ex may lead Pokémon TCG Pocket's first control deck by stopping players evolving their Active Pokémon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon TCG Pocket arrived October 30 and is a certified hit for Creatures Inc. and The Pokémon Company, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-estimated-to-have-crossed-200-million-mark-already-outperforming-pokmon-sleep-and-unite">having earned an estimated $200 million in its first month</a> across more than 60 million downloads.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This huge amount of money comes as Pokémon TCG Pocket follows the standard mobile and free to play game model, flooding players with rewards in the first few days before soon drying up, with spending real world money the only real way to re-experience that early thrill outside of the occasional set drop like this.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Completing Genetic Apex, the first set of cards which totals 226 officially but also contains 60 rare alternate art cards, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/it-takes-almost-2-years-to-complete-just-the-first-pokmon-tcg-pocket-set-unless-you-spend-money">will take players not spending money around two years according to one estimate</a>, while <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-player-reveals-exactly-how-long-it-takes-to-complete-the-first-set-after-spending-1500">those looking to make it rain can wrap up the collection after dropping around $1,500</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

                <p>Earlier this month, CD Projekt Red finally shared the first look at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-witcher-4-release-date-trailer-news/2900-5228/" data-ref-id="2900-5228">The Witcher 4</a> with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-first-trailer-revealed-at-the-game-awards/1100-6528436/" data-ref-id="1100-6528436">a new teaser featuring Ciri</a> as a fully fledged Witcher on her own adventure. And while there wasn't much time for fun and frivolity in that preview, the developers are hinting that the card game Gwent will be featured in the upcoming sequel.</p><p>Game director Sebastian Kalemba and executive producer Gosia Mitręga were asked about Gwent's presence in The Witcher 4 during their joint interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmbhFPninuw&amp;t=635s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Easy Allies</a>. While neither Kalemba nor Mitrega came right out and said Gwent is in the game, they certainly seemed to confirm it.</p><p>"We really love [Gwent], and we also really carefully, always listen to the community⁠--which we love--and it's an amazing one. But I don't think anyone will be disappointed," said Mitrega. "It's a part of the experience, absolutely," agreed Kalema. "We also love Gwent."</p><p>Gwent was featured extensively in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-hearts-of-stone-review/1900-6416268/" data-ref-id="1900-6416268">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a>, and its popularity among players led CD Projekt Red to release a standalone title, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/gwent-review-heart-of-the-cards/1900-6417024/" data-ref-id="1900-6417024">Gwent: The Witcher Card Game</a>. Near the beginning of December, Hachette Boardgames UK and No Loading Games announced plans to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witchers-gwent-card-game-is-heading-to-the-real-world/1100-6528284/" data-ref-id="1100-6528284">release Gwent as a physical tabletop game</a> with a deck of 400 cards and a playmat. It's expected to be released in late 2025.</p><p>The Witcher 4 doesn't currently have a release date, and CD Projekt Red only recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-has-more-than-400-people-working-on-it-full-production-begins-this-year/1100-6522263/" data-ref-id="1100-6522263">ramped up its team to over 400 developers</a> and officially began production. Kalemba also shared <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-director-breaks-down-new-trailer-scene-by-scene/1100-6528474/" data-ref-id="1100-6528474">a scene-by-scene breakdown of the teaser trailer</a>, which sheds more light on Ciri's actions and dropped hints about a potentially different outcome than the one fans witnessed in the preview. </p>

Ciri had a big role role the third game, and as seen in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-first-trailer-revealed-at-the-game-awards/1100-6528436/" data-ref-id="1100-6528436">the first teaser for The Witcher 4</a>, she's going to be the main character in the next title. However, sharp-eared players may have already picked up on the fact that CD Projekt Red has recast Ciri for her upcoming starring role.</p><p>CD Projekt Red confirmed <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/the-witcher-4-ciri-voice-actor-jo-wyatt-recast-rumours/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">TheGamer</a>'s report that Irish actress Ciara Berkeley voiced Ciri in the teaser trailer, and she will portray the heroine in The Witcher 4 as well. Jo Wyatt previously voiced Ciri in The Witcher 3 and its DLC. Berkeley only has a handful of credits to her name, including the TV miniseries Swing Bout, The Deceived, and Normal People. A spokesperson for CD Projekt Red told The Gamer that "Ciara is a talented actress who impressed us with her enthusiasm and vocal acting skills, and in this trailer we believe she truly brought Ciri to life in a way that is both faithful to the character and exciting for fans of the series."</p><p>There may potentially be other parts that are recast in the game, but Doug Cockle will be back as Ciri's mentor Geralt. Earlier this summer, Cockle <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/geralt-is-in-witcher-4-but-the-game-wont-focus-on-him/1100-6525728/" data-ref-id="1100-6525728">confirmed that Geralt will be a part of the next game</a>, although he later <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-actor-says-on-second-thought-hes-not-sure-if-geralt-is-actually-in-witcher-4/1100-6528324/" data-ref-id="1100-6528324">walked back his comments</a> shortly before the teaser reveal at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-game-awards-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6077/" data-ref-id="2900-6077">The Game Awards</a>. Geralt's voice was heard at the end of the teaser that streamed during the ceremony, but not in the standalone trailer on YouTube.</p><p>The Witcher 4 game director Sebastian Kalemba recently shared <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-director-breaks-down-new-trailer-scene-by-scene/1100-6528474/" data-ref-id="1100-6528474">a breakdown of the first teaser</a>, which included details about the monster that Ciri was hunting as well as the young woman that she was trying to save. The scenes that played out in the trailer will be a part of The Witcher 4's narrative, and Kalemba hinted that players may be able to change the outcome in Ciri's favor.</p><p>CD Projekt Red hasn't announced a release date for The Witcher 4 yet.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dungeons-dragons-dark-alliance-delisted-february</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dungeons-dragons-dark-alliance-is-being-delisted-in-february.1063248/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dungeons-dragons-dark-alliance-delisted-february<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Wizards of the Coast and developer Tuque Games have announced that fantasy action-RPG&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dark Alliance&nbsp;</em>is being delisted at the end of February.</p>

<p>Rather curiously, the official announcement of said delisting comes as part of an update to the game's Steam page rather than a post on social media or a blog, as is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/littlebigplanet-3-plus-dlc-delisted-halloween" rel="nofollow">often the case</a> when games are <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/forza-horizon-4-delisting-player-surge" rel="nofollow">delisted or shut down</a>.</p>

<p>A new paragraph under&nbsp;<em>Dark Alliance</em>'s "About This Game" section on Steam states that the game will be shut down on February 24th, and that it will no longer be available for purchase starting from that date. Presumably, this applies to the DLC as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dungeons-dragons-dark-alliance-shutting-down-arrow.jpg?itok=t9f3CKSd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dungeons-dragons-dark-alliance-shutting-down-arrow.jpg?itok=TYklfScE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dark Alliance&nbsp;</em>is going offline in February.</figcaption></figure><p>If you happen to already own&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dark Alliance&nbsp;</em>and you still want to play it (for some reason) after February 24th, you'll be able to do so, as the offline single-player mode will remain available. That goes for DLC as well.</p>

<p>It's a bit of a mystery that Wizards of the Coast and Tuque Games have decided to completely remove&nbsp;<em>Dark Alliance&nbsp;</em>from sale rather than allowing players to purchase an offline version of the game.</p>

<p>However, given the game's <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/11567/dungeons-dragons-dark-alliance" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">weak critical reception</a>, that mystery might not be so puzzling after all. Our own Tyler was scarcely more positive than many others in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/dungeons-and-dragons-dark-alliance-review" rel="nofollow">his review</a>, citing awkward controls and poor AI as reasons for awarding his 6.5 score.</p>




<p>If you're wondering what&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dark Alliance&nbsp;</em>is (or was, I suppose), it's a co-op hack-and-slash action-RPG in which you and your friends play as one of four iconic&nbsp;<em>D&amp;D&nbsp;</em>heroes: Drizzt Do'Urden, Catti-brie, Wulfgar, and Bruenor Battlehammer.</p>

<p>Playing as one of these heroes (or all of them if you have a full party), you'll take on iconic&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons&nbsp;</em>monsters, explore the legendary land of Icewind Dale, and earn rewards from defeating tough bosses, allowing you to take on ever more challenging quests.</p>

<p>The game is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/623280/Dungeons__Dragons_Dark_Alliance/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP2037-PPSA02680_00-7187320704565923" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/dark-alliance/9MZ55WCBW7TK" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, so if you want to keep playing it after February, I'd recommend picking it up now if you haven't already.</p>

Great was the adulation last week when FromSoftware <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/from-software-reveal-elden-ring-nightreign-a-three-player-co-op-spin-off">announced a new Elden Ring game</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a> - and great the lamentation from certain quarters when it was revealed to be a co-op-focussed experience. If you missed the reveal, perhaps because you value sleep over <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-game-awards-2024-everything-announced">the spectacle of Geoff Keighley's fashion friends</a>, let me catch you up: in Nightreign, you pick one of eight preset characters and explore a parallel-universe version of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a>'s Limgrave map, fighting lesser foes and levelling up quickly so as to prepare for a boss battle at the end of each 15-minute in-game day. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The map is surrounded by murderous weather that closes in as night approaches, shrinking the navigable area to a boss arena - a nod to the battle royale genre. Each round lasts three days, culminating in a clash with one of eight unlockable headline antagonists. In between rounds, you can spend a currency called Murk on cosmetics at the Roundtable fort, and equip relics that provide permanent character upgrades.
</p>
<p>
It feels like it's heavily based on observation of how more dedicated fans play and tinker with Elden Ring - a speedrunner remix with the seamless co-op mod, and some confusing allusions to the wider Fromverse in the presence of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls-iii">Dark Souls 3</a>'s Nameless King. The map's buildings and terrain hazards change between visits - larger surprises include volcanoes and invading field bosses, like our old chum <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-margit-boss-fight-walkthrough">Margit</a> the Fell Omen - so it's more replayable than it might sound for a game with "only" one map and eight tacit "chapters" that (going by my back-of-napkin mathematics) you could theoretically finish in a single day.
</p>
<p>
From have made plenty of multiplayer games, of course. The Souls series, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bloodborne">Bloodborne</a> and Elden Ring have intricate co-op and PvP functions by means of in-game guilds, together with asynchronous online features like player phantoms and graffiti. But this is the first time they've made anything Soulsy where multiplayer is a menu option, rather than something slowly peeled back and investigated while travelling alone. So is there anything here for people who'd rather not squad up against the hordes?
</p>
<p>
The immediate good news is that you can play Nightreign both alone and offline. During solo play, the game also scales down enemy health pools, and there's no PvP invader element to interfere with your meanderings. 
</p>
<p>
It's also not a "live service" game - as in, one that is openly designed to expand over time by means of regular, perhaps separately sold DLC injections and a season pass model. "Once you you buy Nightreign you get the complete package, everything is unlockable out of the gate," game director Junya Ishizaki <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-fromsoftware-game-director-explains-why-the-spin-off-exists-reveals-whether-george-r-r-martin-was-involved-and-why-fans-shouldnt-call-it-a-live-service">told Ian of the Games Network, shortly before the reveal</a>. "So we want it to be clear that this is what we wanted to make. It's not intended as a live service game."
</p><p>
Beyond that, though, the picture grows muddled. According to Ishizaki, Nightreign is very much co-op-first. It's balanced primarily around three-player teams (somewhat arbitrarily, there's no two-player support), this being the "sweet spot" that avoids Nightreign becoming "too overwhelming or too busy", with players splitting up to farm the map and reuniting at sunset.
</p>
<p>
It's also missing certain key handholds for solo Ringers. For one thing, there are no Spirit Ash items to let you summon helpful NPCs, though according to Ishizaki, one of the preset heroes does have "a sort of spiritual buddy as a gameplay mechanic". 
</p>
<p>
As you might expect, given the ever-changing map, there's also no longer the ability to leave soapstone messages on the geography. This might sound trivial, but those messages add so much to FromSoft's worlds, even when they're <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/elden-ring-dogs">calling everything a dog</a>. You will, at least, be able to harvest treasure dropped by other slain players via asynchronous online.
</p>
<p>
Chuck these morsels of insight into the blender of reckless deduction, and you might come away with the speculation that Nightreign supports solo player but doesn't especially encourage it. Play alone, and by the sounds of things, you'll be cutting against the grain - which, admittedly, is the norm for certain dedicated Soulsers, with their nightmarish talk of completing whole games without levelling up once or wearing any clothes.
</p><p>
If the above has you down in the dumps, the best news of all is that Nightreign won't necessarily be the first of many multiplayer-centric games. "We don't really have a plan in terms of, oh we're going to make more spin-offs or this is going to be a one-off time one-time thing," Ishizaki told IGN. "This was purely sort of happenstance of me wanting to direct my own game and wanting to use Elden Ring and that battle design that I took part in as a base to this game, and my interest in online co-op games as well."</p>
<p>All that notwithstanding, the Nightreign concept does seemingly fit in well with Hidetaka Miyazaki's comments earlier this year about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-is-the-limit-for-from-software-project-scale-says-miyazaki-multiple-smaller-games-may-be-the-next-stage">working on smaller projects in future</a>. Perhaps they'll find a way to ship a whittled-down singleplayer offering next?

<p>Elden Ring’s Game Director Junya Ishizaki has revealed that Elden Ring Nightreign can only be played as a trio or solo.</p>



<p>The news came from a new interview with IGN, where&nbsp;Ishizaki&nbsp;revealed that the game is designed to be played as a three-person team, but you can play solo if you wish. Ishizaki flat-out said that you cannot play <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-network-test-announced-for-february/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> as a duo.</p>



<p><strong>Junya Ishizaki:&nbsp;</strong>The game is designed to be played as a three-person team, but you can play it as a solo player.</p>



<p><strong>IGN:</strong>&nbsp;Oh, great. Or in a pair?</p>



<p><strong>Junya Ishizaki:&nbsp;</strong>No, it’s either one-player or three-player.</p>



<p>Ishizaki later continued, “The reason that we went with a three-player focus was that we wanted to retain that sense of accomplishment you get from battling a boss together or from conquering a map together and that sense of enjoyment, but we wanted to recreate that in a fresh way. And we felt like focusing on a three-player co-op experience would provide a brand new sense of accomplishment with it.”</p>



<p>You can read the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-fromsoftware-game-director-explains-why-the-spin-off-exists-reveals-whether-george-r-r-martin-was-involved-and-why-fans-shouldnt-call-it-a-live-service" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">rest of the interview at IGN here</a>.</p>



<p>Elden Ring Nightreign is scheduled to release sometime in 2025, with players being able to sign up and register to test the game starting January 10. </p>



<p>“The network test is a preliminary verification test in which the selected testers play a portion of the game prior to the full game launch,” FromSoftware and Bandai Namco said. “Various technical verifications of online systems will be examined by conducting large-scale network load tests,” the test description reads. Players can <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/elden-ring-nightreign/network-test" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">sign up for the test here</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/17/the-thaumaturge-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-thaumaturge-review.1063224/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/17/the-thaumaturge-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>The Thaumaturge is an RPG where you collect monsters and use them to fight. This might sound like a certain other game, but this is set in Warsaw in 1906, the monsters are all horrific demons, and it heavily features the real-life fascinating weirdo Rasputin. So, there are a few differences, not to mention the bleak, melancholic tone and the fact that some of the people here are worse than the monsters.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Thaumaturge | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lL57ftcwSSM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>If you’re curious, a Thaumaturge is someone who can sense emotions and intentions that have been imprinted onto items using the help of salutors – those demonic monsters. As you can imagine, this makes them an investigative force to be reckoned with, as all you have to do is touch a couple of things and everything you could possibly need to know presents itself. This is convenient, as it turns out Warsaw happens to be full of unrest, so there’s an awful lot of mysteries to be solved as desperation, greed, and betrayal are everywhere.</p>


<p>Enter Wictor Szulski who, at the beginning of the game, is looking for the famous faith healer Grigori Rasputin to help him regain control over his Thaumaturgy powers. Naturally, he is successful just in time for Wictor to have a dream about his father’s death and return to Warsaw. Rasputin, ever the mysterious weirdo, tags along and you find yourself in Warsaw in the early stages of a revolution.</p>
<p>The story and setting here is the highlight of the game. Rasputin in particular is a confounding presence, exactly what he wants is a complete mystery until late in the game and it’s the thing that I kept thinking about whilst I wasn’t playing. He’s portrayed well too, featuring all the weird cult-like behaviour you’d expect from a charismatic faith healer, whilst he himself is adamant he’s just helping people. He’d fit well into the right-wing manosphere these days. Outside of Rasputin, every character here has their own motives and feelings just waiting for you to find them imprinted onto a discarded onion or something, which is great – the writing can’t really be faulted, but sometimes its delivery falls a little flat.</p>


<p>There’s a bit at the end of the prologue that was a bit unclear and I had to go back over it in my head to piece it together, though perhaps I missed something. At one point I was also kidnapped, tied up, and interrogated by someone who turned out to be a childhood friend and the fact that Wictor just casually assisted this kidnapper in a fight afterwards and continued to associate with him is just flat out crazy.</p>
<p>The bigger issue with all the investigating is that, as you’re a Thaumaturge, you press R2 and Wictor clicks his fingers, giving you a trail to follow to the selected objective. You can’t fast travel within areas either, so you spend an awful lot of time running around following a trail of particles, pressing R2 again every few seconds because the trail constantly disappears for no good reason. It soon starts to feel less like investigating and more like fetch quests, but you’re fetching people’s secrets. I forgave this issue pretty quickly though due to the strength of the setting and writing though, especially once I started collecting salutors in the city.</p>
<p>Salutors latch onto people with flaws – Wictor’s flaw is Pride, for example, it drew his main salutor, the Upyr, to him when he was young. Thaumaturges can tame and use salutors, but for everyone else a salutor influences the environment around the person with the flaw. When Wictor finds one, he must discover who has the flaw so he can bring it out into the open, which allows him to fight and then capture the salutor. Wictor normally wouldn’t be able to manage this, but with the help of Rasputin he can master multiple salutors. From the Upyr, through Djinns and all the way to Golems, the designs for the many salutors are excellent, if not entirely unique.</p>

<p>They’re not just for investigating either, there’s a combat system in this game that is quite unique. Each round, Wictor and a salutor have an action, and you can switch between any salutors you’ve unlocked at will. Actions take a certain amount of time – a short action takes one round, whilst a long one takes two rounds. The same is true of each enemy and you can see what order they’ll be attacking and what they’ll be doing at the top of the screen. Your attacks have a variety of effects in addition to dealing damage, such as lowering an enemy’s focus, causing bleeding damage each round, and so on. Some attacks can slow down or even cancel an enemy’s planned attack if you’re lucky. If you remove all of an enemy’s focus, they’ll cancel their planned attack and be open to an extra powerful yet very quick attack as well.</p>
<p>On top of this, each of the salutors have their own attacks that vary wildly. The weird chicken one, the Lelek, is excellent at removing enemy focus whilst giving you some bonuses, but doesn’t really deal much damage to health, whilst the Djinn is rather powerful but its attacks have a cost as well. It’s a system that’s deep and unique enough that it takes a while for it to click, but once it does it’s very enjoyable and very adaptable, especially with the ridiculous amount of salutors you end up with.</p>
<p>It’s a little unbalanced though. If you do side stuff you’ll either find the story quests to be too easy when you return to them or sometimes bump into a side quest that’s a bit too hard for you. It’s also weirdly underutilised, to the point where you can go a few hours without a fight and then the game will come up with an absurd reason to make one happen, one so transparently an excuse that it isn’t even mentioned after the fight. Not a big problem, but a little immersion breaking.</p>

<p>Crucially for a game with a lot of talking, the voice acting is mostly good, with only a few slightly off-kilter moments. The music is fantastic too, hosts of melancholic violins and the combat music is still stuck in my head. It’s a pretty good looking game as well, though character’s face movements and expressions look a little too muppet-y sometimes, but the environments are detailed and the game runs well throughout.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-could-be-revealed-right-when-the-new-year-starts-%E2%80%93-rumor.1063218/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-revealed/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 could be revealed right when the new year starts, judging from some reported behind-the-scenes chatter.</p>
<p>Speaking during this week's <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/reflecting-on-the-game-awards-2024-gi-microcast" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GamesIndustry Microcast</a>, Chris Dring reported that he has heard some chatter from other people suggesting that the console could be revealed right when the new year starts. As this is chatter, however, Chris Dring stressed that it shouldn't be taken as fact.</p>
<p>Shortly after Chris Dring's statement regarding the Nintendo Switch 2 reveal timing became public, Nintendtalk revealed that insiders at major third-party developers suggest that a January reveal for the console is definitely in the cards. Samus Hunter added that the system's official announcement may have been brought forward to early January, before the release of Donkey Kong Country Returns HD on January 16th, due to the recent leaks from <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-design-ports-leak-developers-excited/">accessories manufacturers</a>. As all these sources have questionable reliability, however, we have to take all they've said with a huge grain of salt.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Source: Nintendo to reveal Nintendo Switch 2 in January. This is coming from a Major Third Party developer contact I have. Here’s what they say about the console:</p>
<p>“Get ready to play modern AAA offerings on your Nintendo system in 2025”</p>
<p>— NintenTalk (@NintenTalk) <a href="https://twitter.com/NintenTalk/status/1868715333881938264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 16, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">I am not sure how much longer I can contain my hype for Nintendo Switch 2 based on literally everything I am hearing that I can't say here or in videos. Good news is, it sounds like I won't be waiting much longer...</p>
<p>— Nintendo Prime (@NintyPrime) <a href="https://twitter.com/NintyPrime/status/1868723760955900325?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 16, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Nintendo may advance the next-generation Switch reveal with an announcement that possibly could come before DK. This is to address recent leaks especially of accessories to ensure official news for the public. The remaining announcements of Switch games may come a little later.</p>
<p>— Samus Hunter | Nintendo Leak and News Inside (@SamusHunter2) <a href="https://twitter.com/SamusHunter2/status/1868898948825727415?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 17, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Where there's smoke, there's fire, as they say, so it seems very likely that a Nintendo Switch 2 reveal may not be too far off into the future. We will keep you updated on the system as soon as more come in on it, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

            <p>Quick, the world is in peril, your adopted daughter is under threat, and nearby villagers are being terrorised by monsters. What do you do? Oh, you're sitting down at a cosy table in the local tavern. You're playing a card game with a dude called "Aldert". The wind outside is howling, and so are the nightwraiths, but you're just sitting there. Playing another "cow" card. Okay.</p>
<p>Guess you'll be happy to learn that the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">Witcher 4</a> developers have more or less confirmed that Gwent will be making a return in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-first-witcher-4-trailer-is-here-and-ciri-is-the-star">recently trailered</a> Ciri-led sequel. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-witcher/cd-projekt-knows-why-were-all-really-here-gwent-is-coming-back-in-the-witcher-4-and-the-devs-dont-think-anyone-will-be-disappointed/">PC Gamer</a>, two developers at CD Projekt Red responded to a recent interview question about the in-universe card game with some confidence, saying: "I don't think anyone will be disappointed."</p>
<p>"We really love the game," said executive producer Gosia Mitręga in the <a href="https://youtu.be/ZmbhFPninuw?feature=shared&amp;t=637">interview with Easy Allies</a>. "And we also really carefully always listen to the community, which we love... But I don't think anyone will be disappointed."</p>
<p>"Yeah for sure," added game director Sebastian Kalemba. "It's a part of the experience, so absolutely. We also love Gwent."</p>
<p>It was perhaps a no-brainer that the card game be revived for the sequel, considering it was popular enough to spawn a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gwent-the-witcher-card-game">free-to-play multiplayer spin-off</a> and a standalone singleplayer adventure, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/thronebreaker-the-witcher-tales">Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales</a>. Both of which, as card games, were pretty solid. </p><p>Gwent as it originally appeared in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">Witcher 3</a> was inspired by physical card game <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/112/condottiere">Condottiere</a>, with a few differences in both visuals and rules to make it fit into the world of the cat-eyed freelancers and sneaky bog witches. The multiplayer version, meanwhile, has mutated from its original design throughout the years, to the extent that any time I've booted it up I find have no idea how best to use my cards anymore. I'm interested to see exactly what form it'll take in the Witcher 4, and if my wintry tactic of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-annoying-thing-i-like-to-do-in-gwent">covering the board in frost</a> will once again be viable.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-humor/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/borderlands-4-will-cut-back-on-%E2%80%98toilet-humor%E2%80%99-says-gearbox.1063209/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-humor/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Gearbox’s Narrative Director says it will reduce toilet humor for its next installment in the Borderlands series, Borderlands 4.</p>



<p>The revelation came from the X account (formerly Twitter) of Gearbox Narrative Director Sam Wrinkler, who previously worked on both Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands and Borderlands 3. In response to a question about the narrative direction pertaining to jokes, <a href="https://x.com/ThatSamWinkler/status/1868741632449036648" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Winkler said</a>, “Not at liberty to talk much about the content of BL4, but I remain firm in my criticism of BL3’s overabundance of toilet humor.”</p>



<p>He later elaborated, “I’m not gonna say there’s no toilets, but if the word skibidi ships in the game under my watch, I’m gonna cry real tears. Paul Tassi joked that we were gonna have a gun called Hawk 2A and a fellow dev asked me if it was real and I wanted to put my hand down the sink grinder.”</p>



<p>The Borderlands series has always tried to have a boatload of humor, and Winkler’s comments might be a positive sign for those who didn’t enjoy the humor in Borderlands 3, which was criticized for having fairly lousy humor. A simple search on Google (it’s still a thing, ya know?) of Borderlands 3 humor pulls up loads of search results of people criticizing the game and its cringe-like humor.</p>



<p>So, for now at least, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-borderlands-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we’ll have to wait until 2025</a> to know how many toilet jokes are in the game.</p>



<p>Borderlands 4 is set to launch in 2025 on the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and PC.</p>



<p>What do you think of Winker’s comments on the humor in Borderlands 4? Let us know in the comments or our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/888/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

The tone of the jokes have remained relatively consistent throughout the franchise’s run, which takes in 2012’s Borderlands 2, 2014’s The Pre-Sequel, and 2019’s Borderlands 3. Indeed, toilet humor has served Borderlands well so far, with total franchise sales now up to an impressive 81 million copies. But <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-announced-with-teaser-trailer-at-opening-night-live-gamescom-2024">the debut teaser trailer for Borderlands 4</a> suggested a darker tone this time, and the latest trailer, unveiled at The Game Awards 2024, reinforced this shift.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The TGA 2024 trailer showed snippets of first-person shooting and a few returning characters, including Claptrap.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's the official blurb from Gearbox:</p><blockquote>Revealed at The Game Awards, a new trailer introduces The Timekeeper, a ruthless dictator who dominates the masses from on high. A world-altering catastrophe threatens his perfect Order, unleashing mayhem across Kairos, the most dangerous planet discovered so far in the Borderlands universe.</blockquote><blockquote>Borderlands 4 is the most ambitious Borderlands to date, lovingly hand-crafted by the development studio that first forged the looter shooter genre. The title evolves the series’ gameplay and storytelling in new ways while delivering on the quintessential Borderlands experience fans know and love, including:</blockquote><blockquote>Intense action, badass Vault Hunters, and billions of wild and deadly weapons on an all-new planet ruled by a ruthless tyrant.</blockquote><blockquote>The deepest and most diverse Vault Hunter skill trees of any Borderlands title yet, giving players an unprecedented level of expression through their builds. Paired with the most expansive loot chase yet, players will have all the tools they need to seek out and perfect the build that best matches their style.</blockquote><blockquote>Players will be able to seamlessly travel between zones and become immersed in a more dynamic world featuring events and discoverable side missions that encourage and reward exploration.</blockquote><blockquote>New traversal mechanics add to the exploration for loot and add new dimensions to combat. A vehicle that can be summoned almost anywhere will have players racing across the beautiful vistas of Kairos in style.</blockquote><blockquote>Fight solo or in co-op with up to three other players in this immense sci-fi adventure, packed with free-form combat and exploration, pulse-pounding boss fights, infinitely varied loot drops, and an eclectic cast of unforgettable characters new and old.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">"Borderlands 4 is about freedom and being badass,” said Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford. “This is by far the biggest and most insane world we’ve ever made - it's overloaded with jerkface ratnozzle scrote monsters that need to be put down with the most over-the-top hardcore nuts op guns and loot in any game ever. Oh, and the story also seriously kicks ass!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Borderlands 4 is set to launch at some point in 2025, and comes after the disastrous launch of the Borderlands movie.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel-rivals%E2%80%99-most-op-characters.1063203/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-most-op-characters<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve spent any time with NetEase’s new hero shooter <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-review">Marvel Rivals</a>, then you already know that the game features many powerful heroes and villains. Yet with a base roster of 33 characters, some were inevitably going to rise to the top of the heap once players got their hands on them. Memes and humorous videos about the game have already taken social media by storm, with many focusing on which characters are causing tons of frustration and annoyance for the game’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-is-a-smash-hit-with-10-million-players-in-just-3-days">ten million plus playerbase</a>. After playing a few hundred matches of my own, I’ve found certain ones are far more dreaded than others. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So today, we’re going to rank the top Marvel Rivals characters by how much they’re driving fans crazy. Obviously this list could change in the future depending on new additions or balance patches, but for now, here are the most overpowered characters in Marvel Rivals.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">6. Moon Knight</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/16/marvel-rivals-op-moon-knight-1734382313453.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Marc Spector, aka Moon Knight, may be a relatively low level character powerwise in the pantheon of Marvel comics, but he’s a serious threat in Rivals. Both his Crescent Darts and Moon Blades can bounce not just between enemies who are close together, but also between his Ankhs, which crafty players can place at all sorts of weird angles to get bonus damage without their foes even knowing where they’re being hit from. This is even easier for Moon Knight players because of how agile he is, easily scaling buildings or vantage points with his double jump and hookshot skills. And while his ultimate, Hand of Khonshu, is easily dodgeable if spotted, the fact that it comes from directly above means many Moon Knights have discovered it’s best to place it slightly behind the enemy team. This takes advantage of the natural inclination for players to back up when they can’t instantly see where an ultimate attack is coming from, leading them straight into the damage zone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He does require forethought and positioning, but once you grasp the fundamentals, Moon Knight can devastate an enemy team before he’s even spotted.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">5. Star-Lord</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/16/marvel-rivals-op-star-lord-1734382335778.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The title of “Legendary Star-Lord” may be something Peter Quill calls himself more than anyone else does, but in Rivals he more than lives up to the hype. Playing like a variant of Overwatch’s Tracer with the ability to fly instead of zip back in time, Star-Lord is a lightning-fast triggerman. His Element Guns deal high damage at a rapid rate, he can fly out of a hot zone at a moment’s notice, and his Stellar Shift dodge ability, for which he has two charges before cooldown, not only reload his guns but also grant him invincibility frames. When it comes to hit and run tactics, few Rivals characters can match Star-Lord, which makes his ultimate even more outrageous. Galactic Legend couples his hard hitting and quick reloading weapons with free flight and auto-aim, meaning that unless someone snipes him the second he activates it, there’s little the enemy team can do but scramble for cover and wait the ability out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He still needs to be careful health-wise due to being a squishy DPS character, so he can be something of a glass cannon. But if you’re quick and good at managing cooldowns, Star-Lord can feel unbeatable in the right hands.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">4. Scarlet Witch</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/16/marvel-rivals-op-scarlet-witch-1734382357921.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">There was no way the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/most-powerful-marvel-characters">strongest Avenger</a> was going to sit out a Marvel hero shooter, and Wanda Maximoff makes another return to the spotlight as one of Rivals’ most deadly duelists. Perfect for Moira players from Overwatch who couldn’t help but get the most eliminations in a match while ostensibly being a healer (guilty as charged), Scarlet Witch can drain enemy health bars without needing to aim much. Joining her lock-on magic are powerful Chthonian Burst missiles which she can toss frequently, and two charges of Mystic Projection, which gives her free flight and a ‘Phased’ state that allows her to avoid all damage for a short time. Once you get into a rhythm, Wanda can annihilate foes at both close and long range while easily ducking out of retaliation or enemy ultimates without even needing to be well-positioned. And then there’s her ultimate, Reality Erasure, and while it does have a long charge time, it instantly vaporizes any enemy within range. It’s more than worth the wait.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a Scarlet Witch main myself, plenty of players probably hate me. But if loving Wanda in this game is wrong, I don’t want to be right.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">3. Hela</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/16/marvel-rivals-op-hela-1734382389004.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">This one might not be as obvious to casual players, but real Rivals heads are sure to know why Hela makes this list. The Goddess of Death lives up to her namesake, with her Nightsword Thorn primary fire able to wipe out heroes at a far distance with only a couple of critical strikes, and her Piercing Night attack often killing them outright with a single cast. Although she’s not technically a sniper, she can basically function as one in the hands of a skilled enough player. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And let’s not forget her ultimate, Goddess of Death, which allows Hela to soar above the field and rain hellfire from above. Although it is technically possible to drain her health bar in this state, it’s not really worth it because she gets a HP boost, meaning it takes pretty much the entire duration of the ability’s cast time to shoot her down. This means she can clear a point single-handedly by forcing the enemy team to flee for cover, making her an early favorite for character bans once you reach Diamond rank in Competitive Mode.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thor and Loki may be more popular characters, but Hela is the true Asgardian threat you need to watch out for.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">2. Jeff</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/16/marvel-rivals-op-jeff-1734382415946.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">No one would have thought that an adorable baby shark could cause so much hysteria, but Jeff the Land Shark has quickly become one of the most hated heroes in Marvel Rivals. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Why? He’s a healer, and he’s not exactly built for the front lines (even if his primary attack is deceptively powerful and he has a damage reduction against critical hits.) But the real reason Jeff is so feared is his ultimate ability, It’s Jeff!, where the little land shark reveals his monstrous appetite. Jeff is invincible while casting and, after selecting a circular area, he instantly swallows everyone within it, friend and foe alike. Enemies do take damage when they’re in Jeff’s stomach, but the real value of this ability is that he can move with other players inside him, meaning Jeffs will often spit their foes into bottomless pits. Some will even guarantee the kills by committing suicide, leaping over the edge with enemies inside. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is counterplay to this ability (Scarlet Witch can usually escape being swallowed with a well-timed Mystic Projection, for example), but the indignity of being eaten and thrown off a cliff by a baby shark has enraged many a player.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He may be intended for keeping his allies healthy, but smart use of his ultimate makes Jeff an absolute menace on the battlefield.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">1. Iron Fist</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/16/marvel-rivals-op-iron-fist-1734382439419.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">No character inspires more primal terror in the hearts of Marvel Rivals players than Lin Lie, the Immortal Iron Fist. This master martial artist has far and away the most insane powers in the game. Not only do his rapid fire punches allow him to assassinate healers and duelists with impunity while giving him bonus health in the process, but he also has four air jumps before cooldown, as well as a spin kick that dashes him forward. This means that he can effectively fly with well-timed use of his attacks and jumps, chasing characters like Iron Man <a href="https://x.com/RivalsAlerts/status/1866010702080627027" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">literally through the sky</a>. But that’s not even the worst of it. He can also use Dragon’s Defense as a parry maneuver against virtually any attack in the game. <a href="https://x.com/RivalsAlerts/status/1866010702080627027" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">No, really</a>. He can somehow prevent himself from being nuked, eaten by Jeff or erased from reality by Wanda with nothing more than a well-timed flex of his shoulders. If there’s an Iron Fist on the enemy team with even a moderate understanding of his toolkit, you’re in for a world of pain.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Seriously, NetEase, do something about this man. My healers are dying.</p><div id="marvel-rivals-tier-list-best-heroes" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3><h3>Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Carlos Morales writes novels, articles and Mass Effect essays.

<p>The new costumes include an icy Venom, Groot decorated like a Christmas tree, and Rocket in a Santa hat, among others.</p>
<p>As for the Gallery Card, completing various tasks will reward players with limited-time items, including the Jeff the Land Shark: Cuddly Fuzzlefin costume and other rewards.</p>
<p>In further news, the game's creative director Guangyun "Guangguang" Chen confirmed to <a href="https://dotesports.com/marvel/news/marvel-rivals-devs-confirm-cross-progression-is-in-the-works-but-platform-rules-remain-a-barrier">Dot Esports</a> that cross-progression is in the works to allow players to progress freely across multiple platforms. Cross-play between PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S is already included, but progression is currently limited to each platform.</p><p>"Cross-progression involves a lot of platform-specific rules, we're still looking at it and how to solve it," said Chen. "Once the team is ready, once we've figured it out, we'll be sharing to everyone and players will be the first to know."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-opening-weekend-sees-10m-players-join-in">Marvel Rivals has proven incredibly popular</a> since its launch at the start of the month. Its opening weekend saw 10 million players join online.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Borderlands 4 will dial down the toilet humour compared to the previous game, so don't expect any "skibidi" quotes.</p>
<p>Narrative director Sam Winkler described Borderlands 4 as Gearbox's "most ambitious game yet" and said he's happy to "work with some of the funniest people I know".</p>
<p>A response to Winkler's post asked if, judging by trailers, the game will have darker humour, to which he replied: "Not at liberty to talk much about the content of BL4, but I remain firm in my criticism of BL3's overabundance of toilet humor."</p>
<p>He added, in a further response: "I'm not gonna say there's no toilets but if the word skibidi ships in the game under my watch I'm gonna cry real tears. Paul Tassi joked that we were gonna have a gun called Hawk 2A and a fellow dev asked me if it was real and I wanted to put my hand down the sink grinder."</p>

<p>The Borderlands series isn't exactly serious in its tone, but the third game was criticised for its humour. For some, though, this didn't detract from its shooting mechanics.</p>
<p>Reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-3-review-bigger-better-and-even-more-polarising-than-ever-before">Eurogamer Borderlands 3 review</a>: "No, it's not a particularly cerebral experience, but nor is it trying to be; while stuffed with gore and violence and frankly infantile humour, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/borderlands-3">Borderlands 3</a> is a solid shooter with a meaty 30-ish hour campaign, plentiful - if repetitive - busywork, and a colourful cast of hard-to-forget characters."</p>
<p>At last week's The Game Awards, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-first-look-at-borderlands-4-featuring-a-brand-new-planet-and-four-new-vault-hunters">new trailer for Borderlands 4 was shown</a>, which revealed its new planet and four playable vault hunters.</p>
<p>It's looking plenty outlandish, but the lack of poop and fart jokes will make for a more satisfying release once the game launches in 2024.</p>
<p>If you're unfamiliar with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skibidi-toilet-made-using-half-life-2-assets-reportedly-in-talks-for-michael-bay-movie">Skibidi Toilet</a> (lucky you), it's a very silly internet animation made using Valve's Source Filmmaker software and featuring assets from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/half-life-2">Half-Life 2</a> and Counter-Strike.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> spin-off game Nightreign will feature enemies from Dark Souls, its director has confirmed.</p>
<p>Souls fans certainly spotted some familiar enemies in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftware-is-making-more-elden-ring-after-all-with-the-co-op-elden-ring-night-reign">Nightreign's reveal trailer</a> at last week's The Game Awards, most notably The Nameless King from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dark-souls-iii">Dark Souls 3</a> who rides atop a dragon firing lightning bolts.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202412/27477">Famitsu</a>, director Junya Ishizaki has confirmed that a "small number" of enemies from across the Dark Souls series will appear in Nightreign thanks to the "influence of the Night King".</p>

<p>He added this is to add to the sense of "chaos" that the night brings. It's all part of the parallel universe of Nightreign, which is clearly allowing FromSoftware to nod to its past.</p>
<p>As the Dark Souls social media account teased: "In the Night, ancestral foes await - remnants of a fire that once burned bright."</p> <div>

</p></div>
<p>And while Ishizaki specifically mentioned only the Dark Souls series, perhaps Bloodborne and Sekiro enemies could make an appearance too.</p>
<p>Indeed, as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/is-elden-ring-nightreign-starting-a-fromsoft-multiverse">IGN</a> spotted, the trailer includes player characters battling a three-headed creature with an exposed ribcage that appears to be the Centipede Demon from Dark Souls. Further, an official screenshot released by the developer includes a giant spider who could well be The Duke's Dear Freja from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dark-souls-ii">Dark Souls 2</a>.</p>
<figure>

 </a>
<figcaption>Is this Freja? | <span>Image credit: <cite>FromSoftware</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Further, fans have likened the playable character the Duchess to Bloodborne's Lady Maria thanks to her quickstep ability, while Wylder's claw shot resembles the grappling hook of Sekiro. This is certainly more speculative, but judging by the increased mobility of the playable characters in Nightreign, there does seem to be some influence from across FromSoftware's previous games.</p>
<p>Ishizaki also described Nightreign to Famitsu as a dense but short game that condenses RPG fundamentals into a single mission.</p>
<p>Communication with others, meanwhile, will be with pins and gestures to continue the "loose connection" with fellow players established in previous Souls games. There won't be PvP this time, though, and there's no invasion method.</p>
<p>Lastly, within the roguelite structure, if players successfully pass all three days of the game's day and night cycle, they will obtain relics for various boosting effects.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-co-op-spin-off-nightreign-network-test-announced-and-you-can-register-for-it-soon">network test for Elden Ring: Nightreign</a> will take place in February, with registration beginning on 10th January.</p>
<p>Bandai Namco also revealed a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-has-now-sold-286m-copies-outselling-the-dark-souls-series-combined-prior-to-release">new sales total for Elden Ring</a>, which has now sold more copies than the entire Dark Souls series had prior to its release.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Mistwalker's FANTASIAN Neo Dimension JRPG can now be checked out prior to purchase, thanks to a new free demo released by publisher Square Enix on all platforms.</p>
<p>The demo lets gamers experience the game's first few hours and test the multi-dimensional battle mechanics. Moreover, as is customary with post-launch free demos, players will be able to continue their journey as Leo by carrying over their progress to the full game if they purchase it afterward.</p>
<p>FANTASIAN Neo Dimension initially launched as an Apple Arcade exclusive. However, it has recently debuted on PC and all main consoles (PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and Nintendo Switch), with great overall reception. The game designed by Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi scored a nine out of ten in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fantasian-neo-dimension-final-fantasy-in-all-but-name/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wccftech's review</a> penned by Francesco De Meo:</p>
<p><em>Instead of attempting to do away with the tropes that have dominated the genre for a very long time, FANTASIAN Neo Dimension fully embraces them to deliver a compelling experience that feels markedly "Final Fantasy" without being an actual part of the series. The story, as a whole, may not be anything special, but the little interactions between the characters, some emotional moments, and the solid combat system, which only improves as the adventure proceeds and the challenge level increases, make for one of the best JRPGs released in the past few years.</em></p>
