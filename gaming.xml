They were being fed too much voltage, and some have irreversibly degraded. Intel has not yet said if laptop chips are failing the same way.</p><p>As of August 2024, there is currently no fix for an Intel CPU that’s crashing like this — you need to exchange it, and that’s what the extended two-year warranty is for. But you can apply <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/8/24216054/intel-msi-asus-bios-updates-crashing-13th-14th-raptor-lake-gen-cpus">motherboard BIOS updates</a> that may prevent damage to begin with, and Intel is explicitly addressing the excessive voltage issue in August updates for its partners’ motherboards.</p><p>There are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/26/24206529/intel-13th-14th-gen-crashing-instability-cpu-voltage-q-a">many open questions</a>, like how many customers are affected, why Intel isn’t recalling these chips, why it didn’t claw back existing inventory ahead of its August patch, how it will proactively warn customers, how lenient it might be when dealing with customers who want an exchange, and which other issues might be contributing to these chips’ instability. (Intel has suggested the voltage is a primary cause, but not the only one.) </p><p><em>The Verge</em> is keeping track of the answers, and other news, in updates to the StoryStream you’ll find below. We’re also keeping track of which PC makers will honor Intel’s extended warranty <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/7/24215440/intel-13th-14th-gen-crash-raptor-lake-integrator-warranty-lenovo-dell-hp-acer-asus">in this story</a>.</p></div><div><h2>Highlights</h2></div><section id="updates-section"><ul><li role="article" id="stream-entry-31f66307-dde1-4556-916a-6b2ed7039fca"><div><p>CyberPowerPC has decided to hop onto the Intel-warranty-respecting bandwagon.</p><p>It <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/7/24215440/intel-13th-14th-gen-crash-raptor-lake-integrator-warranty-lenovo-dell-hp-acer-asus">now offers a five-year warranty</a> on Intel’s problematic 13th and 14th Gen CPUs, just like its closest competitors. </p><p>We also got a vague new statement from Dell/Alienware that suggests it <em>might </em>extend its own parts warranty, but doesn’t promise to do so.</p><br></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-be10603b-d6b8-428b-8eb3-1c674b0cba53"><div><p>Should we do a big screaming headline about Intel BIOS updates?</p><p><a href="https://www.falcon-nw.com/">Falcon Northwest</a> CEO Kelt Reeves tells <em>The Verge</em>:</p><blockquote><p><em>Please</em>&nbsp;help us get the word out to all Raptor Lake desktop users, especially i9 users, in big screaming headlines that they need to update their PC to the latest BIOS&nbsp;<strong>now&nbsp;</strong>to stop/prevent the CPU wear and hopefully avoid the need for an RMA.&nbsp;Don’t wait for the August microcode – that’s the last 5% (we hope) of the solution, but 95% of the fix is available now.&nbsp;Think of the new BIOS’ as the vaccine against this issue, but it will do no good unless people get shots in arms.</p></blockquote><p>Intel spox Thomas Hannaford wouldn’t go as far as “95% of the fix,” but he says “Kelt’s PSA is a good one”.

That’s a question TinyCircuits is answering with the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kenburns/thumby-color">Thumby Color</a>, a GBA clone measuring just two inches in size that still manages to fit a directional pad, shoulder buttons, a rumble motor, a 16-bit color screen, and the ability to link two of them together with a USB-C cable for multiplayer gaming.</p><p>Unlike the myriad Game Boy and GBA clones released by companies like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/8/24152105/can-you-resist-anbernics-game-boy-advance-sp-that-plays-ps1-and-n64-games">Anbernic</a>, the Thumby Color is not an emulator. It doesn’t have enough processing power to play retro games nor enough storage to hold hundreds of ROM files.</p><p>It’s powered by a 150MHz <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/rp2350/">Raspberry Pi RP2350 processor</a> that’s paired with just 16MB of storage — yes, that’s megabytes, not gigabytes. Not being able to play actual GBA games on the Thumby Color is probably a good thing because its 0.85-inch square LCD screen has a resolution of just 128 x 128&nbsp;pixels, which is less than half the resolution of the GBA.</p><p>Games are instead programmed in MicroPython. The Thumby Color will come with six open-source titles preinstalled, including a first-person shooter called <em>Monstra</em> and a dungeon crawler called <em>Thumbgeon 2</em>. It will also come with all the monochromatic games that shipped with the original Thumby back in 2021, which was the company’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/TinyCircuits-Console-Playable-Programmable-Keychain/dp/B0B4Z915Q9/ref=asc_df_B0B4Z915Q9/?tag=theverge02-20">ultra-tiny clone of the original Game Boy</a>.</p><p>The Thumby Color isn’t a handheld you’re going to want to play for hours on end, but it is one you can potentially sneak into any setting where you want a distraction — without trying to hide more conspicuous handhelds like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23951655/steam-deck-oled-review">Steam Deck</a>. It’s also a good excuse to learn a programming language, as TinyCircuits has created <a href="https://youtu.be/wmfun32n8TQ?feature=shared">tutorials</a> and guides <a href="https://thumby.us/">available for free through its website</a>.</p><div><figcaption><em>The Thumby Color is available in several different colorways, including transparent case options.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: TinyCircuits</cite></p></div><p>TinyCircuits has opted for a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign to bring the Thumby Color to consumers. The <a href="https://tinycircuits.com/products/thumby">original Thumby</a> still sells for $42, but this new color screen version is available with a pledge of $49 for a purple version, with shipping expected as early as November. If you want a Thumby Color with a clear or transparent purple housing, the price jumps to $55, and if you want a Kickstarter-exclusive black version, it’s $75.</p><p>Keep in mind that there’s always the chance a crowdfunded product will not deliver all the features promised at the time of the campaign. It could also be significantly delayed, or never delivered at all, without refunds. TinyCircuits has successfully <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/kenburns/created">shipped several Kickstarter products</a> before, so there’s slightly less risk here, but there’s no guarantee the product will materialize, even with its funding goal already being met.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/turkiye-bans-roblox-due-to-potential-child-exploitation/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Türkiye has officially decided to ban Roblox, a free-to-play game released in 2006. This decision comes as the government grew increasingly concerned that Roblox may be a way for child predators to access their victims, leading to child exploitation.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time that Roblox has been in hot water for such things. Multiple reports have now suggested that Roblox isn't safe for children to play on and that there isn't enough safeguarding for those who do.</p>
<p>In July, <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/company-news/2024/07/23/the-gaming-platform-with-a-predator-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg wrote</a> that Roblox had sent over 13,000 reports to the National Center of Missing and Exploited Children in 2023 alone. A number like that suggests that there are no real safeguards for children in Roblox. It's also a game where children can <a href="https://wccftech.com/ten-year-old-kid-buys-3100-worth-of-roblox-purchases/">easily purchase Robux</a> and other cosmetics using a parent or guardian's credit card without them even realizing it. This has happened far too often and just adds to the hot water that Roblox currently sits in.</p>
<p>On August 7, Türkiye's Minister of Justice made the decision to ban Roblox outright in the country, announcing this decision on X. They did this "due to content that could lead to the exploitation of children."</p>
<p>While users can create content in-game and even earn money from it, there are no real rules and regulations regarding what pops up. As a result, there has been a significant increase in sexual content on Roblox, with reports in recent months only continuing to increase.</p>
<p>Contradictory to the reports, Roblox <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-responds-to-platform-ban-in-turkiye" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released a statement</a> to Eurogamer claiming that it had spent the last two decades making the game "one of the safest online platforms" for its youngest players." In addition to this, they responded to their plans moving forward with Türkiye and their lawmakers. "We respect the laws and regulations in countries where we operate and share local lawmakers' commitment to children. We look forward to working together to ensure Roblox is back online in Türkiye as soon as possible."</p>
<p>However, the reports released in the past year aren't new information. In 2021, a report was released about the exploitation of young children making games to make a profit. This report was released by People Makes Games, and the Studio Head of Roblox responded by saying that they are giving <a href="https://kotaku.com/roblox-boss-kids-child-labor-exploit-indonesia-slum-1851387795" target="_blank" rel="noopener">children in the slums a job</a> where they can sustain themselves by creating content in Roblox.</p>
<p>As this statement received a lot of backlash, Roblox had to make an official statement claiming most of the content creators were over 18 and that the company didn't hire minors.</p>

Personally, I liked the world-hopping and FPS action of <em>Borderlands 3</em>, though yeah, the main villains aren’t very memorable and the game’s final few hours feel even more like a trainwreck than those of other entries in the franchise famous for never sticking the landing. Still, I’d rather play <em>Borderlands 3</em> than watch the newly released <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tales-from-the-borderlands-live-action-movie-gearbox-1851614468&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tales-from-the-borderlands-live-action-movie-gearbox-1851614468"><em>Borderlands</em> movie</a></span>, especially after today’s surprise quality of life update.<br></p><p>On August 8, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-3/update-notes/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-3/update-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gearbox announced a new update</a></span> for <em>Borderlands 3</em>. The update doesn’t add a large quest or a fresh area to explore, but it does add a very useful feature. You can now toggle loot to be auto-sold based on rarity. So, for example, you can say all whites and greens should be sold automatically and when you pick up a random crappy white pistol, the game will sell it instead of letting it clutter up your inventory. </p><p>I’m currently replaying <em>Wonderlands </em>with my wife and I’d kill a thousand Skaggs for an auto-sell feature. I hope Gearbox backports this feature into other older <em>Borderlands </em>games. At the very least, this needs to be a feature in <em>Borderlands 4 </em>or whatever the next main game ends up being. </p><h2 id="h21251"><a id=""></a>What else is in this <em>Borderlands 3 </em>update?</h2><p>Also included in this update is the ability for players to create a new max-level character right from the main menu. You’ll need to have beat the main game and hit max level with at least one character before this option will be available, but for folks looking to go back and do endgame content, this will be handy and let them check out other characters without having to replay the entire adventure.</p><p>Lastly, Gearbox has added an option for Steam Deck users to increase the in-game text size in <em>Borderlands 3</em> which isn’t world-changing, but nice to see. </p><p>As for why this update was released today, well, I’d say it’s likely because Gearbox is hoping (and expecting)<em> Borderlands 3</em> and possibly the other games in the series to see an uptick in players and sales following the release of the new movie. We saw something similar with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://twistedvoxel.com/the-last-of-us-tv-show-huge-boost-sales-game-series/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://twistedvoxel.com/the-last-of-us-tv-show-huge-boost-sales-game-series/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Last of Us</em></a></span><em> </em>and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fallout-tv-show-amazon-prime-steam-pc-new-vegas-1851410034&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-tv-show-amazon-prime-steam-pc-new-vegas-1851410034"><em>Fallout</em></a></span><em>. </em></p><p>However, with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/borderlands-movie-reviews-impressions-bad-good-negative-1851615664&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-movie-reviews-impressions-bad-good-negative-1851615664">horrible reviews and bad word of mouth</a></span>, I’m not sure the <em>Borderlands </em>movie is going to help grow the brand.  Likewise, I’m not expecting many people will be hopping back into Pandora over the weekend after seeing the movie. But hey, I’ll take a quality-of-life update for a game I enjoy any day of the week and for any reason. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It was derided in 2015 for its short length, with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howlongtobeat.com/game/20067&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/20067" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How Long To Beat</a></span> clocking the average playthrough at about seven hours. Admittedly, that is a tough pill to swallow when you paid $60 for it, but $10 for a pretty solid, highly polished action game is a steal. <em>The Order </em>stars Sir Galahad, a member of an alternate history Knights of the Round Table in which the titles of Galahad, Perceval, and the like are passed down to different members of the order. In this world, the Knights of the Round Table persist into the 1880s and face a growing infestation of monstrous half-breeds that resemble werewolves, vampires, and other monsters.</p><p>Galahad starts out as a loyal member of the order, but it’s clear from the outset he won’t stay that way. <em>The Order: 1886 </em>opens with Galahad being violently interrogated by his own comrades. As the game recounts how we got here, <em>The Order: 1886 </em>unravels a centuries-long conspiracy in a steampunk Victorian-era London, full of twists, turns, and betrayal.</p><p> Gameplay-wise, <em>The Order: 1886 </em>is a mostly fine cover shooter with flashes of potential brilliance. Taking advantage of the steampunk setting, <em>The Order: 1886</em>’s arsenal of guns range from period-appropriate firearms to some really cool toys like the electricity-firing Arc Induction Lance courtesy of this universe’s version of scientist Nikola Tesla. <em>The Order: 1886 </em>packs a lot of worldbuilding into its brief runtime, which extends to Galahad’s collection of pseudo-futuristic armaments. The time between fights is often filled with QTEs that range from clever moments like having Galahad counting down with individual button presses to initiate a combat encounter, to some of the more standard “mash a button until you push someone off of you,” but it’s got a level of polish only attainable when a game scales down to this size.</p><p>Skimming through the lore as I write this, I’m immediately taken back to 2015 when I saw the potential for something spectacular to come from <em>The Order</em>. A sequel that learned lessons from the criticisms of the first could have been truly special and established itself as a long-running franchise from the PS4 era alongside games like <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> and <em>Spider-Man</em>. I think many fans held out hope that one would happen. <em>Knack</em> got a sequel despite a middling reception, so why not <em>The Order</em>? Unfortunately, one never came, and then Ready At Dawn was acquired by Meta.</p><figure id="" data-id="da9c6a9ceef44ab70e22b19578aa37ae" data-recommend-id="image://da9c6a9ceef44ab70e22b19578aa37ae" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Members of the Order protect a man on the ground." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Members of the Order protect a man on the ground." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ready at Dawn</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="da9c6a9ceef44ab70e22b19578aa37ae" data-recommend-id="image://da9c6a9ceef44ab70e22b19578aa37ae" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Members of the Order protect a man on the ground." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s bittersweet to look back on because I feel like we as an industry are better equipped to appreciate <em>The Order: 1886 </em>for what it did so well. It didn’t feel like it was looking to waste your time, it presented a world that could have easily have built a long-running franchise, and it had glimpses of what could have been a really exciting shooter with some tweaks and a harder focus on the ways of play that set it apart from other games of the time. <em>The Order: 1886 </em>deserved better, but so did Ready at Dawn. So if you only ever heard bad things and never picked it up, or you maybe were jaded towards it the first time and haven’t touched it in years, give <em>The Order: 1886 </em>a second chance.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Since Bungie <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-announces-major-layoffs-and-restructuring/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced sweeping changes</a> to the studio and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-confirms-new-details-on-bungie-restructuring-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony’s comments</a> on the state of the studio, many have wondered what the future holds for Destiny 2 as a game.</p>



<p>There have been reports of Bungie <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-will-no-longer-release-paid-expansions-for-destiny-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no longer planning paid annual</a> expansions in order to focus on smaller, regular updates. There was also talk of Destiny 3 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-possibly-developing-destiny-3-under-codename-payback/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">being in development</a> which was later <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/project-payback-cancelled-destiny-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">found to not</a> be the case.</p>







<p>In a series of <a href="https://x.com/Destiny2Team/status/1821619810645766275" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posts on Twitter</a> on Thursday, the Destiny 2 developer team addressed the game’s future.</p>



<p>“We know that recent changes at Bungie have created uncertainty surrounding the future of Destiny,” they said. “Rest assured we remain committed to Destiny, to supporting our community with transparency, and to delivering regular updates about the game.</p>



<p>“We’ll be talking with you all about the future of Destiny and plans for our next multi-year journey soon. Once we plant a flag for the date, we’ll let you all know. Thank you for your patience, and we’ll see you again soon.”</p>



<p>While it likely won’t do much to calm the nerves of worried players, it still seems as though the team is remaining loyal to the game, for now. </p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shapez-2">Shapez 2</a> will launch in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shapez-2-gets-an-early-access-release-date-and-a-new-trailer-to-explain-how-itll-consume-all-your-free-time">Early Access on August 15th</a>, bringing the relaxing, shape-cutting factory builder into 3D.
</p>
<p>In a new post, its lead developer has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2162800/view/4357881096234065558">laid out what to expect from Early Access</a>. In the main: a polished, 40 hours-or-so experience with no known major issues, and a post-release roadmap waiting to be defined by player feedback.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We’ve spent a lot of time polishing the game already and are really happy how it turned out. We believe it’s in a great state and is meant to be played," says the post. "With 4 game modes, there’s plenty of content to be explored. There should be at least 40 hours of content but it’s easy to get over a hundred hours or more, as our playtesters have proven already."
</p>
<p>Tobspr Games - which has grown to eight people, rather than the mostly solo project of the original - has been working with patrons and the series' Discord community since development began. In that time they've run regular playtests, but also canvassed their players as to what features are most important to them, which proposed art style they prefer, and more. That relationship will continue into Early Access.
</p>
<p>"I don’t like launching with a roadmap immediately, especially not for early access. If the roadmap is already predetermined, what impact do players actually have?"
</p>
<p>There's also no pre-decided amount of time that Shapez 2 will spend in Early Access, because "it could be years in theory" and depends on how well it sells.</p>
<p>"Our dream goal would be to keep updating the game for many years while it finances the development. However, as the game industry is unpredictable, we don’t want to promise something we can’t keep."
</p>
<p>One of the central ambitions of Shapez 2 was to improve performance over the original, according to the post.
</p>
<p>"Performance was a frequent complaint [in Shapez 1], but there was nothing left to optimize. Shapez 1 is written in JavaScript, so it’s literally just a website. There is no support for efficient rendering, memory management or proper multithreading and the language itself is at least a magnitude slower than C++ or C#."
</p>
<p>Shapez 1 would begin to lag for players "starting at around 5,000 - 10,000 buildings". By comparison, in Shapez 2 "everything should currently run very smooth until 100,000 buildings, pretty smooth until 250,000 buildings and depending on your setup somewhat smooth with 500,000 buildings (30 fps on a higher end setup)."
</p>
<p>There's no hard limit on how many buildings players can create, and in testing some players have constructed factories with "1.25 million buildings and above", but experienced "significant lag."
</p>
<p>I played Shapez 1 for the first time last week, for a fun few hours. It's a factory builder in which resources are unlimited, buildings are free, and there's no threat or time pressure. That makes it pretty perfect for pairing with some dumb-as-rocks episodes of Criminal Minds on a second screen. My few hours with it were enough to make me certain that I wanted to try Shapez 2 when it launches next week. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>EA Sports released the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/college-football-25-gets-first-major-title-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first major title update</a> for College Football 25 on Thursday. Unfortunately, however, a couple significant bugs were uncovered after the update for College Football 25 released.</p>



<p>Within the game’s Dynasty mode, three main issues have been uncovered with one being the most problematic.</p>







<p>The two smaller, yet frustrating, problems involve incoming freshman not appearing in the position change screen during the offseason and annual non-conference games not rotating as they should. The big bug, however, involves the game’s schemes and playbooks.</p>



<p>“When using schemes and playbooks to change your coach playbook/scheme, your player archetypes and OVRs change based on the scheme,” the game’s developer account <a href="https://x.com/CFBDirect/status/1821621788906025060" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted on Twitter</a>.</p>



<p>The developers are actively investigating and working on a resolution to the problem, they said.</p>



<p>As far as what to do in the mean time, EA Sports says don’t use the schemes and playbooks screen to change them. Instead, you should make the changes you want within the Edit Coach screen until a fix is deployed.</p>



<p>Updates on the pending fix will come via social media.</p>

Numerous card combos help spice up your strategy each time you play. </p><h2 id="dark">Batman: The Dark Knight Returns - The Game</h2></div><div catalogid="04999a5a-a2d5-44ba-99af-941b48b317d3" id="205713"><div id="205713" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Batman: The Dark Knight Returns - The Game</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li>Players: 1-2</li><li>Age Range: 14+</li><li>Play Time: 90 minutes</li></ul><p>A huge game that can be enjoyed as a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games">solo board game</a>, Frank Miller’s legendary story is adapted into a tabletop experience spanning four Books, each with unique mechanics, characters, and rules, and each subsequent Book’s outcomes are affected by the previous.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Texas Chain Saw Massacre - Official Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Wes Keltner--CEO, designer, and director at Gun Media--provided a statement to GameSpot regarding TCM's time in Game Pass, as well as its forthcoming departure, in an effort to address the concerned fans. He also suggested the game may one day return to the subscription library, as some games have in the past.</p><div data-embed-type="breakoutBox"><p dir="ltr">"It’s hard to believe that it’s been one year since The Texas Chain Saw Massacre was released! We’ve had a blast creating new content and watching how the players engage and share the unique experiences our game creates. In a lot of ways we owe Game Pass and the team at Xbox for the awareness and success of the title so far. Now that our time with Game Pass is coming to an end, it’s time to focus on the future of Texas, and it looks very bright!</p><p dir="ltr">"Game Pass is a great program, especially for small teams like ours that are trying to push relatively new genres forward. It removes so many barriers to entry for players, and enables them to sample a variety of games and genres they may otherwise never touch. Some may not find horror multiplayer for them, but we found so many new players there. And while a great many subscribers use the program to "graze," we've got an active and loyal player base that's been there since launch on all platforms. And we'll see a lot of Game Pass players convert to paid--especially since they get a discount from Xbox to do so. That's a pretty cool deal if you ask me.</p><p dir="ltr">"We’ve enjoyed our time within the Game Pass ecosystem and who knows, maybe we’ll enter back into it again in the future. Being one of the most popular games in Game Pass this last year and winning the Xbox Excellence Award is usually a good sign that a game will not only return to that program, but also has a strong future full of new content and experiences. Bloody, gory, fun experiences. See you in Texas."</p></div><p dir="ltr">As for specifics on the "future of Texas," the TCM team has recently revealed the <a href="https://www.txchainsawgame.com/hub/content-pass" rel="nofollow">Content Pass</a>, which offers a bundle of upcoming DLC at a reduced price when compared to buying the content individually ($20 versus $45). The pass includes two new characters (one for each team), four upcoming cosmetic packs, a new execution pack, which is exactly what it sounds like--gruesome new kill animations--and early access to a free new game mode, Rush Week, coming in the future.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, more paid cosmetic packs are on the way, as well as several free updates, including a new map and weather variants for three of the game's existing maps.</p><p>Echoing Keltner's thoughts on the game's post-Game Pass roadmap, Gun's Matt Shotcha told a concerned player, "[G]ames come and go on Game Pass all the time. That's how the service works. It's been a year, and a great one at that [...] Don't worry, we still have all the content planned we always did. Support and content are not inherently tied to Game Pass."</p><p dir="ltr">In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-texas-chain-saw-massacre-review-thrill-of-the-hunt/1900-6418102/">Texas Chain Saw Massacre review</a>, I called it one of the scariest games I've ever played, giving it a score of 9 out of 10 and added, "When you hear that chainsaw revving, it's like nothing else in horror, no matter the medium."</p>

<p dir="ltr">As described in the official Call of Duty <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/08/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-deep-dive-terminus-map-intel#Horrors" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog</a>, the Vermin are "large, spider-like ravenous scuttlers with a central thorax that seems to take the form of a screaming human head." They are weak on their own, but are dangerous in groups, ripping themselves free from fallen zombie hosts. To attack, the Vermin sprint and leap at foes, and can even spew a corrosive substance to kill their prey. They can also evolve and transform into another insect-like creature, the flying Parasite.</p><p dir="ltr">These are some nasty-looking monsters, but Treyarch has confirmed (via <a href="https://x.com/ModernWarzone/status/1821574160176590923" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Modern Warzone on X</a>) that there will be an Arachnophobia setting in the game's options that will disable the Vermin's appearance.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a nice accessible setting to include, and one that has become more popular in recent years. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grounded/" data-ref-id="5000-504764">Grounded</a>, the Honey I Shrunk the Kids-like survival game from Obsidian that features various bugs as its primary enemy type, included an arachnophobia mode.

The shutdown is effective immediately. Meta acquired the studio <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/facebook-buys-ready-at-dawn-lone-echo/">in 2020</a>.</p><p>As for why Meta is shutting down the studio, here’s what <em>Android Central</em> said:</p><div><blockquote><p>One report&nbsp;<a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-4-leaked-release-date">in mid-July</a>&nbsp;said that Meta was cutting its Reality Labs division’s budget by 20% by 2026, and an internal memo sent to Meta employees by Gio Hunt, VP Oculus Studios — seen by Android Central — supports this reasoning. A Meta spokesperson told Android Central that the cuts weren’t being made to “save money,” per se. Rather, these cuts are being made to ensure that Reality Labs stays within the new budgetary constraints and that Oculus Studios can make a “better long-term impact” in VR development.</p></blockquote></div><p>We tried to ask for more details, but Meta spokesperson Alaina Laszewski&nbsp;declined to comment. In its most recent earnings, Meta said that its Reality Labs division, which its VR efforts fall under, <a href="https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2024/Meta-Reports-Second-Quarter-2024-Results/default.aspx">lost nearly $4.5 billion</a>. </p><p>When Meta announced that it had acquired Ready at Dawn, it said that <a href="https://www.meta.com/blog/quest/welcoming-ready-at-dawn-to-facebook/?utm_source=www.readyatdawn.com&amp;utm_medium=oculusredirect#new_tab">the studio would</a> “continue creating memorable, immersive, and innovative VR content for gamers around the world as an independently-operated studio.” And while it did go on to release <a href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/pcvr/1711938725528735/?utm_source=www.oculus.com&amp;utm_medium=oculusredirect"><em>Lone Echo II</em> for the Rift and Rift S</a> — the game isn’t natively available for Meta’s standalone Quest headsets — Meta shut down the well-loved <em>Echo VR</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/31/23580356/meta-shut-down-echo-vr-oculus-quest-arena-ready-at-down">in August 2023</a>.</p><p>At the time, CTO Andrew “Boz” Bosworth <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/6/23588083/meta-shutting-down-echo-vr-john-carmack">said that</a> the resources to make <em>Echo VR</em> “could be put to other uses that I think will be useful to the now tens of millions of people who are in VR.” The Ready at Dawn team also said that it was <a href="https://medium.com/@EchoGames/an-update-on-the-future-of-echo-vr-7f074dca1ed1">working on its next project</a>, but now it seems that project won’t be released.</p></div><div><p>Most Popular</p><p>Most Popular</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/7/24211339/humane-ai-pin-more-daily-returns-than-sales"><h2>Humane’s daily returns are outpacing sales</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/6/24214471/google-chromecast-line-discontinued"><h2>Google is discontinuing the Chromecast line</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/7/24215275/google-tv-streamer-chromecast-gemini-interview"><h2>Why Google decided now’s the time to move on from Chromecast</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/7/24215440/intel-13th-14th-gen-crash-raptor-lake-integrator-warranty-lenovo-dell-hp-acer-asus"><h2>Will PC makers replace your crashing Intel chip?

It took place during the height of COVID-19 pandemic when more people spent time indoors, and amidst a technological shift that's made it possible to play triple-A games on portable devices like the Nintendo Switch and portable PC devices like the Steam Deck.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That's made direct comparisons with prior launches harder to make—but in the last week we got plenty of data to confirm an important fact: current-generation console sales are slowing down, and the last generation of consoles is partly to blame.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The three major data points are these: Xbox </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/xbox-hardware-revenue-is-in-decline-but-microsoft-says-subscriptions-and-content-define-success">reported a massive dip</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in game hardware sales that may mean Xbox Series X|S sales have peaked.

But this port undeniably shows how developers need the last generation of consoles to sell games.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Even a Jedi can’t run from the past">Even a Jedi can’t run from the past</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Despite the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ea-earns-1-2-billion-from-live-service-titles-during-record-first-quarter">success</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> EA decided a last-generation port of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Jedi Survivor</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> could juice the game’s revenue. It would take an impressive cost/benefit analysis to make that decision, because it’s not like there was a button somewhere in EA that just said “push button to port game.” It’s challenging work to take a game optimized for newer consoles and optimize it for older hardware.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">EA was probably looking at data similar to what our colleagues at Omdia have been seeing. As you can see in the chart below, the active install base of Sony and Microsoft’s next-generation consoles only surpassed the previous generation in 2023—three years (really two and change, given how late the consoles launched in 2020) after their debut.</span></p><p>Image via Omdia.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That change has accelerated in 2024 but Omdia projects that in 2025, 25 percent of players will still be hanging out on older-generation consoles. Analyst James McWhirter pointed out to me that Sony reported in early 2023 that 30 percent of active PS5 users had never used a PS4, which is “good and bad” for the company.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“What we saw in the first half of the PS5's cycle was the adoption of PS5 outpaced the decline of active PS4 systems,” he said. “This tells us many PS5 purchasers never had a PS4. While positive in its own light it does shine a light on the prolonged cross-generation period we've seen continue into the second half of the cycle this year.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In other words, some PlayStation 4 players were happy to stay on their last-generation console.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Why? It’s not clear. An obvious answer might be that Sony and Xbox were both slow to roll out games that made the most of their new hardware—but third-party games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Jedi Survivor</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> could have convinced plenty of players to make the jump, and the excitement around new consoles seemed as strong as it was in prior years.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Other analysis indicates this slow adoption is due to games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Grand Theft Auto </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Online, Fortnite and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Minecraft</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Though both games have received graphical updates on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, their prior-gen versions look and play just fine. Younger audiences accustomed to playing these games with their friends may not see the need to upgrade if their online social spaces aren't dramatically impacted.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That’s probably partly true, but surely the number of players on mobile devices eclipsed console users for the latter two titles, and younger users wouldn’t have the purchasing power to drive that shift anyway.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It’s likely a combination of these and other factors that all were exacerbated by events no one could control: the economy and inflation got </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>weird</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> right in the window these consoles were rolling out.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I say “weird” and not “bad” because, on paper, the post-COVID-19 recovery (at least in the United States) has been strong. There’s a reason people have been calling this a “</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/23/opinion/biden-trump-vibecession.html">vibecession</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.” Inflation, “</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/greedflation-caused-more-half-last-100000899.html">greedflation</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">,” and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have all hit the market, but people still haven’t stopped spending money on entertainment.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Spending on travel, concerts, and Barbenheiemer exploded in the last two years, each driving knock-on economic stimulation for tourist attractions and areas around concert venues.

Just this morning Future Friends announced that it’s porting </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Vampire Survivors</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> onto PS4 and PS5. It’s a great title to span both generations. The already massively popular PC game doesn’t need fancy high-end graphics, so making a play for PlayStation is just all about making the game available for people anchored on that platform.</span></p><p>Image via Respawn Entertainment/Electronic Arts.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Some business brains in the industry are crossing their fingers for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Grand Theft Auto VI</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to drag players forward, as the series is liable to drive millions of dollars in sales within 24 hours of launch.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And it’s not like the spending shifts in 2022 and 2023 permanently dragged consumers away from games.

<strong>UPDATE 8.39pm:</strong> Following sightings of a new "definitive" <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/now%20surfaced%20on%20Steam">Doom 1 &amp; 2 bundle on Steam</a>, the same bundle how now surfaced on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/doom_doom_ii">GOG</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/doom-and-doom-ii-f5e089">Epic</a>, Switch's <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/doom-plus-doom-ii-switch/">eShop</a> (so far only in the US), the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/UP1003-PPSA21444_00-OSIRIS2000000000">PlayStation Store</a> for PS4 and PS5, and the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-gb/games/store/doom-doom-ii/9P46M5JQ2PTF/0010">Microsoft Store</a> for Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S.
</p>
<p>
All versions of the game cost $9.99 USD (around £8, with some variance depending on your platform of choice), and early reports - in lieu of an official announcement from id Software or Bethesda - are suggesting existing owners of either Doom 1 or Doom 2 will be upgraded to the new two-game bundle and its various expansion content for free.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>ORIGINAL STORY 8.23pm:</strong> As id Software's annual QuakeCon gets underway today, a new - and currently unannounced - Doom 1 &amp; 2 bundle has been sighted on Steam, promising "enhanced" versions of the classic shooters with a brand-new episode from Wolfenstein and Indiana Jones studio MachineGames.
</p>
<p>
As <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1821578978462699748">flagged by Wario64</a> on social media, a new listing combining 1993 FPS classic Doom and its illustrious 1994 sequel has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2280/DOOM__DOOM_II/">now surfaced on Steam</a>, seemingly replacing the individual listings previously available on Valve's platform. This new dual listing contains what are being described as the "definitive" versions of Doom 1 &amp; 2, complete with a lengthy feature list.
</p>
<p>
First and most expectedly, the new bundle contains the DOS versions of Doom 1 &amp; 2. That's alongside a number of additional campaigns, including TNT: Evilution and The Plutonia Experiment (two community created Doom 2 expansions later officially packaged together as Final Doom), plus Master Levels for Doom 2, Doom 2 expansion No Rest for the Living, and Sigil - John Romero's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/john-romeros-unofficial-fifth-doom-episode-sigil-is-finally-out">unofficial fifth episode</a> in the Doom saga.
</p>

<p>
There's also a brand-new campaign, Legacy of Rust, created by MachineGames and Nightdive Studios, as well as a new Deathmatch map pack featuring 25 maps. In total, that makes for 187 mission maps and 43 deathmatch maps across Doom 1 &amp; 2.
</p>
<p>
That, however isn't the end of things. Alongside the enhancements added in id's previous updates of Doom 1 &amp; 2 - which included upgraded visuals and modern controller support - this new version features the likes of online, cross-platform deathmatch and co-op for up to 16 players, and community-published mod support with an in-game mod browser.
</p>
<p>
It's also possible to select between the games' original midi soundtracks and Andrew Hulshult's IDKFA versions, with other enhancements including improved performance with multithreaded rendering supporting up to 4K resolution, BOOM source compatibility, new accessibility options, and expanded language support.
</p>
<p>
Notably, while Doom 1 &amp; 2's Steam page is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2280/DOOM__DOOM_II/">now live</a>, id Software hasn't yet formally announced this enhanced version of its classic shooters. It seems likely the full reveal treatment will come during QuakeCon, which runs from today, 8th August, until this Sunday, 11th August.
</p>
<p>
To coincide with the event, a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/quakecon2024">QuakeCon sale</a> is currently live on Steam, offering discounts on Bethesda and id Software titles until 21st August.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-esports-player-ever/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>When diving into the vast and wonderful world of esports, many end up wondering exactly who the best esports player of all time is. With so many immense players already in the industry, and many retired pros who have already cemented their names in the industry’s illustrious history, who among them can be truly classed as the top esports player ever?</p>



<p>Let’s hope this doesn’t disappoint too many people.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-greatest-esports-player-of-all-time">The Greatest Esports Player Of All Time</h2>



<p>To be the best esports player of all time, you need to tick more than just a few boxes. It’s not just about being solid at your game – you’ll also need to win tournaments, titles, and net a hefty stack of cash for your efforts. The best esports player needs to have an immense following made up of thousands – or even <strong>millions </strong>– of dedicated fans, and they should be synonymous with their chosen game.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>There are quite a few factors to think about when trying to decide who the greatest esports player of all time is. If we add up the criteria, who is the GOAT of esports?</p>



<p>There can only be one answer…</p>



<h2 id="h-johan-n0tail-sundstein">Johan ‘n0tail’ Sundstein</h2>



<p>Johan ‘n0tail’ Sundstein is without a doubt the greatest esports player of all time. While many other names were just short of number one, n0tail has to be the most successful esports player <strong>ever</strong>, putting him above everyone else. But why?</p>



<p>Not only is n0tail one of the best Dota 2 players in the world, but he is also a two-time back-to-back champion when it comes to The International (the biggest Dota 2 annual tournament). He won the two titles back in 2018 and 2019.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>N0Tail has also won four Major championships, making him one of the most well-decorated competitors in the Dota scene. If that wasn’t enough, he has won a staggering <strong>fifty </strong>lower-tier events, including DreamLeague and DreamHack. </p>



<p>And if <strong>that</strong> <strong>still wasn’t enough</strong>, he is one of the leading co-founders of OG, a brilliant and highly regarded esports organisation. Despite not competing since The International in 2021, the Danish-Faroese gamer claims he is ‘just taking a break’.</p>



<h3 id="h-n0tail-earnings">N0tail Earnings</h3>



<p>N0tail also has the highest earnings of any esports player in history, with an estimated $7.1 million earnings in prize money. He sits at more than half a million dollars ahead of the second-highest-earning esports player of all time.</p>



<p>Sundstein started his career competing in the game Heroes of Newarth but eventually switched to Dota 2, which was a decision that ultimately led to his massive success and monumental profile.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Not only is n0tail the highest-earning esports player of all time, but even some of his teammates in OG are in the top five. It just goes to show how valuable Dota 2 is.</p>



<h2 id="h-honorable-mentions">Honorable Mentions</h2>



<h3 id="h-lee-faker-sang-hyeok">Lee ‘Faker’ Sang-hyeok</h3>



<p>For many, Faker is the best esports player of all time, having won the League of Legends World Championship a record four times and having established himself as one of the most dominant esports players in history. He’s a rockstar competitor with a stunning profile, but he’s yet to break away from being ‘just’ a competitor and hasn’t won anywhere near as much as n0tail.</p>



<h3 id="h-ian-crimsix-porter">Ian ‘Crimsix’ Porter</h3>



<p>Crimsix is one of the biggest and most successful FPS-based esports players in the world. Over a career lasting more than a decade, Porter secured a whopping 38 chips and three Call of Duty world championship titles. For a while, he was the highest-earning esports pro in the COD space and was widely regarded as the pinnacle player of days gone by.</p>



<h3 id="h-oleksandr-s1mple-kostyliev">Oleksandr ‘s1mple’ Kostyliev</h3>



<p>When you think Counter-Strike esports, you think ‘s1mple’. Despite not being the winningest player in the scene, s1mple is widely known as one of the best esports players of all time, and his accolades speak for themselves. For years, he has been playing at the top of his game, and millions of CS fans have leant on his guidance and in-game tips to succeed in their own aspirations.</p>

<p>It is a crazy day when a Vice-presidential Candidate acknowledges esports. The popular (and newly announced VP for Kamala Harris) political figure, Tim Walz, recently acknowledged a Minnesota high school on their Valorant varsity team’s State Championship victory back in 2022.</p>



<p>Walz, who has been governor of Minnesota since 2019, has already been seen doing various sporting activities with his kids, such as football coaching and more. And now, it would seem the political figure has esports under his belt, too.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-tim-walz-congratulates-high-school-valorant-team-for-state-championship-victory-in-2022">Tim Walz Congratulates High School Valorant Team For State Championship Victory In 2022</h2>



<p>Back in 2022, the Apple Valley High School varsity Valorant team took home first place in the State Championship. Walz made sure to acknowledge this massive feat for the school, as he was well-known for acknowledging other sports too.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Congratulations on an undefeated season and winning the Minnesota Varsity League State Championship in Valorant. Competitive success requires more than mere physical strength and agility; it also demands mental fortitude and tactical planning.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Walz’s acknowledgement of esports is a huge feat for the industry, as in the past, many political figures have sought to restrict video games at various levels.</p>



<p><em>“With esports on the rise, I am extremely proud of you and the role you have taken on to grow esports participation at Apple Valley High School in Minnesota. You are at the helm of transforming a hobby into a potentially life-changing career in a new and innovative realm of sports.”</em></p>



<p>With <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/verizon-announces-free-high-school-esports-league/">Verizon’s new esports program</a> being introduced into US schools, we are looking at a very bright future for scholastic esports events and more.</p>

<p>When the Nintendo Switch launched in 2017, one thing it didn’t really have in its library were AAA games. It had major first-party games like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, but nothing from the bigger third-party developers. With the upcoming launch of the Nintendo Switch 2, there appears to be a shift happening with the games that’ll be available for players.</p>



<p>According to Paul Gale, the Nintendo Switch 2 will have “big launch window releases” from third-party studios. These include “significant” AAA games.</p>







<p>“A few major third party developers whom at E3 2017 weren’t anticipating Nintendo Switch taking off the way it did and didn’t have a Triple A title at launch/the show itself, are working on big launch window releases for Nintendo’s next system,” Gale posted <a href="https://x.com/paulgalenetwork/status/1820819933267403125?s=46" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on Twitter</a>. </p>



<p>“[Nintendo Switch 2] will have some early, significant ports, parallel releases, and exclusives.”</p>



<p>As far as what those AAA games on the Nintendo Switch 2 could be, that’s anyone’s guess.</p>



<p>Nintendo is expected to reveal its next console in early 2025 with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-reportedly-headed-for-2025-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release rumored to be</a> for March 2025. The latest rumors on the system claim that it will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-will-be-backwards-compatible-and-support-4k-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">be backwards compatible and support 4K</a> resolution.</p>
