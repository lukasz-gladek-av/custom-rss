            <p>If you can't resist taking cheeky potshots at your fellow players in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>, the shooter's matchmaking can now neatly shuffle you into a session where you're more likely to get a taste of your own medicine. Developers Embark have confirmed that some "aggression-based matchmaking" has been sprinkled into the game's systems as of late, making PvP-prone players a bit more likely to be funnelled towards each other.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Said confirmation comes directly from the mouth of Embark CEO Patrick Söderlund during a recent interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY3u7wOmm4w">Games Beat</a>. "Obviously first it's skill based, of course," the exec said of how <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-best-guns-tier-list">Arc Raiders</a> handles shifting folks where they need to go to start a game. "Then you have solos, duos, and trios. Also since a week ago or so, we introduced a system where we also matchmake based on...how prone you are to PvP or PvE.</p>
<p>"So, if your preference is to do PvE and have less conflict with players, you'll get matched up [in line] with that [more often]. Obviously, it's not a full science," Söderlund added, before agreeing that it'd be accurate to dub this aggression-based matchmaking.</p>
<p>While the exec was clear this new element is just part of the equation the game turns to when deciding where to shuffle which players, it'll be intriguing to see how folks' willingness to turn their guns on each other being taken into account shapes things going forwards. Söderlund didn't shed any light on how exactly the game measures your PvPness and the exact weight it's given in where you get funnelled - possibly because he was busy playing Arc Raiders as he gave this interview.</p><p>From what he did say, though, it sounds like something simply designed to gently nudge different players towards an experience which mirrors how they play. Whether that's as desirable as filtering by skill level or to shift away folks who show annoying habits like griefing or regularly dropping out of matches at awkward times - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gta-online">GTA Online</a> springs to mind in terms of the latter - is the question.</p>
<p>In the short-term, running into less folks gunning for your head might be ideal if you're <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-is-a-good-shooter-but-its-also-where-i-go-for-a-walk-and-relax">keen to keep things a bit more chill</a>. However, in the long run, maybe it'll dull down some of the unpredictability which helps keep any online game - but especially <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooters</a> - feeling fresh. We'll see how things play out.</p>

            <guid>1397224</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Would Microsoft secretly be happier if people stopped buying the Xbox entirely? Would you risk breaking a $2,000 Samsung Galaxy Z Fold to chase a high score? And why was <em>League of Legends</em> unplayable for so many people over the weekend? You’ve stumbled onto another edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture.</p> <p>Welcome to the first full week of 2026 where I am obsessed with the idea that the first act in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> might have been even longer. Creative director Igor Sarzyński <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/srznsk.bsky.social/post/3mbokwdsals27">explains why that would have been a terrible idea</a>. “No it wouldn’t. It’s like saying we should spend more time on Tatooine with farmer Luke before he got involved with all this Jedi stuff.” RIP Jackie.</p>

 <h2>Not selling Xboxes must be intentional at this point</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sales of Xbox consoles were down 39% in the UK during 2025, making it comfortably the worst year on record for Xbox consoles. With the return of favourite Xbox franchises in 2026, might things improve this year?</p> <p>— Christopher Dring (@Chris_Dring) <a href="https://twitter.com/Chris_Dring/status/2007156688923836635?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 2, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The Game Business’ Chris Dring reports that 2025 was “comfortably the worst year on record for Xbox console” sales in the UK. They were down nearly 40 percent from the year prior, which was already far from stellar. I’m not sure how to square Microsoft’s seemingly complete abdication of hardware sales less than five years into the current generation with its promise to continue making consoles in the future.</p>

 <h2><em>League of Legends</em> was completely unplayable yesterday and the reason is very stupid</h2> <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1q4ao9r/per_vandiril_apparently_the_login_issues_were/">According to YouTuber Vandiril</a>, Riot Games forgot to renew the client security certificate for the hit Moba game. There was a workaround, however. All players had to do to get back into the game was reset their system clock. Maybe it was just the Nexus’ way of telling fans it was time to take a break.</p>

 <h2>Finally, a Flappy Bird made just for folding phones</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Phone companies: We've tested our hinge mechanism for 200,000 folds, so that should cover 5 years of use</p> <p>Users: <a href="https://t.co/jRzjFWB2Hk">https://t.co/jRzjFWB2Hk</a></p> <p>— Marques Brownlee (@MKBHD) <a href="https://twitter.com/MKBHD/status/2007546884794249262?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 3, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><em>Foldy Bird</em> requires you to physically fold your super expensive phone over and over again to keep the bird flying through the familiar <em>Super Mario Bros.</em>-style environment. How neat! I still don’t want one.</p>

 <h2>Sega co-founder David Rosen has passed away</h2>   <p>Rosen was integral to the company’s amusement game operation, including the push into coin-operated arcade games like <em>Periscope</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Monaco GP</em>, <a href="https://www.replaymag.com/segas-dave-rosen-passes-on-christmas-day-in-l-a/"><em>RePlay Magazine</em> reports</a>.</p>

 <h2><em>Resident Evil 4 Remake</em> originally began with a cut chapter starring Ashley</h2> <p>That’s according to modder Michael “Thekempy” Kemp who combed the game’s files and restored the lost content. “It would have started with Ashley in the woods at night,” Thekempy explained <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nXI-MrzgZXU?autoplay=1">in a recent video</a> (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-4-remake-cut-an-entire-opening-chapter-that-starred-ashley"><em>Eurogamer</em></a>). “She stumbles upon Los Illuminados in the middle of performing a ritual sacrifice.”</p>

 <h2>Brandon Sanderson’s <em>Mistborn</em> books could become a video game</h2> <p>The prolific fantasy author said multiple AAA game companies have expressed interest in his latest “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOe7VV5T-hw">State of Sanderson</a>” video (via <em><a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/mistborn/brandon-sanderson-mistborn-game">PCGamesN</a></em>). “I’m trying to do things differently this time, in order to retain control of my videogame rights,” he told fans. “I already have interest from some major players in the videogame industry, who I like a lot. So, if you are a decision-maker at a triple-A studio or a major independent, and you’ve always wanted to make a <em>Mistborn</em> or <em>Stormlight</em> game, you would want to contact my reps now.” If someone bites, maybe we’ll see the actual game by 2032.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/minecraft-donut-smp-server-farm-notch-2000656412">The 10-year journey to falling back in love with <em>Minecraft</em></a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-ai-slop-satya-nadella-2000656473">Microsoft wants you to move beyond calling it AI slop</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-racer-revenge-ps4-ps5-port-hacker-limited-run-2000656482">An obscure<em> Star Wars</em> game is more expensive than ever thanks to a rumored PS5 hack</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

              <p>Buying a new smartphone can be pricey, especially if you’re going with one that’s still relatively new. But with the deal we’ve sourced, you can get one that’s still well worth using without taking out a second mortgage. You’re likely familiar with it if you’re an Android user: the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6661/">If you’re interested in changing up what you use for your daily driver phone, you can buy the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra on Amazon right now for $1,049</a>. That’s $250 (or 19%) lower than the retail price of $1,299.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6661/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A newer smartphone that’s still well worth using</h2>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra comes in a Titanium Silverblue housing that has a massive 6.9″ display, a 5000mAh battery and a built-in S Pen. It also comes with a US 1-year warranty and runs with unlocked Android 15 and One UI 7 out of the box.</p>
<p>Inside, the phone has the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite processor and 12GB of RAM to make sure you have enough power to run your apps/games/multitask between them. The 256 GB of internal storage means you have enough room for all of your pictures/videos/downloads without having to constantly clear everything out.</p>
<p>For connectivity, you have Bluetooth, NFC, Wi-Fi and USB, so you can pair your accessories, pay for purchases using contactless payment methods and tether with other devices. Samsung’s One UI 7 sits atop Android 15 and utilizes the hardware specs along with AI tools and Samsung’s services.</p>
<p>The built-in S Pen lets you draw, write, and annotate screenshots and navigate their screen with accuracy, while the Always On Display provides access to important information at a glance at any time. Additionally, the high-resolution 2960 x 1440 resolution provides for clear text and images displayed on-screen and provides a lot of space for working in a multi-tasking mode or viewing high-definition video. The dimensions of the phone are 6.41 x 3.06 x 0.32 inches, providing a fairly small frame around the large display.</p>



<p>In terms of the camera capabilities of the Galaxy S25 Ultra, Samsung pushes hard on AI features, specifically on low-light and video recording. Samsung developed an AI Night Mode Camera to brighten dark areas and hold onto detail, so when taking a picture at night or indoors, the image does not immediately become blurry/noisy. Audio Eraser is a tool that can reduce background noise in your recorded videos, and there are a suite of other options you can use as well.</p>
<p>The Now Brief feature is intended to provide you with useful information prior to the time you would normally receive notifications for these same items (e.g. reminders/tasks), to help you keep up with everything going on in your life. Additionally, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is capable of rapid charging (and wireless charging), and the device is water-resistant, adding to its durability for everyday use.</p>
<p>If it’s been long past time to pick up a new smartphone,<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6661/"> the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is a fantastic choice that you won’t want to miss out on, especially since you can save some serious cash here</a>. Grab it and migrate over.</p>

<p>A new claim states that Fortnite has already begun work on its next anime collaboration, and it’s none other than Chainsaw Man. </p>



<p>Fortnite is known for collaborating with franchises and properties across all media of entertainment. Some of their most popular collaborations have been anime-related, with the game bringing in characters from Dragon Ball Z, Naruto, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnites-next-big-anime-collaboration-for-chapter-7-season-1-has-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bleach</a>, Jujutsu Kaisen, and more to the island across the years. It seems they will build on this foundation with another highly popular anime, Chainsaw Man. </p>







<h2 id="h-fortnite-x-chainsaw-man-in-the-works">Fortnite x Chainsaw Man in the Works</h2>



<p>The Fortnite x Chainsaw Man collaboration’s claim comes from SamLeaks on <a href="https://x.com/SamLeakss/status/2008156723803254943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter); the leaker had previously accurately revealed the Bleach collaboration. However, no other details were revealed, such as the release window, the included characters, or the mythics. But the players have already started making their character wishlists, with Denji, Makima, Reze, and Power as the top contenders. Some are also praying for Pochita to arrive as a Sidekick in the game. </p>



<p>Epic Games has already gone the OG anime route by bringing in names like Dragon Ball Z, Naruto, and Bleach, with One Piece being the only one remaining from the big 3. However, they have been targetting more recent anime as well, with Jujutsu Kaisen, Kaiju No. 8 and My Hero Academia along with Chainsaw Man expected to join the lineup soon. </p>







<p>In other news, Chainsaw Man’s director was working on a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/chainsaw-man-director-is-working-on-a-new-horror-game-for-roblox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new horror game for Roblox</a> earlier in 2025. Additionally, Shroud has predicted that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/shroud-arc-raiders-fortnite-hot-take/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders will be ‘bigger</a> than Fortnite’.

Here, players discovered that the various spiderwebs lead to one central web that contained a cryptic direction in its web design: "N" and a symbol for another telegraph pole. Heading north (as directed by "N") leads to another wooden pole which, once found, can be shot at to reveal yet another direction under its bark.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Red Dead Redemption 2 Screenshots Show Off Rockstar's Epic Open-World</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">All of that brings us pretty much up to date, and up to a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T4J8LYqUi0" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> published just yesterday which details where the mystery is at now.

                <p dir="ltr">The souls-like genre has exploded in popularity since the dawn of From Software's Souls franchise, with multiple companies taking a stab at the format--and some companies taking multiple stabs. Bandai Namco, who publishes FromSoft's Souls games as well as Elden Ring, dropped an anime-style version of the genre in 2019's Code Vein, and now it's back for more in Code Vein II.</p><p dir="ltr">We spent a few hours with the next Code Vein adventure during The Game Awards week, and we came away impressed with its improved combat system and a new and interesting take on the genre's "summon" mechanic, but what surprised us most was an original story that carries some emotional weight. The original Code Vein was a solid first effort, but Code Vein II shows that the franchise may have, pardon the pun, cracked the code.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4629230-pylon_exploration1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4629230" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4629230-pylon_exploration1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4629230"></a><figcaption>Code Vein II</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4629230-pylon_exploration1.png"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">A new code</h2><p dir="ltr">Code Vein II takes place in a world on the edge of ruin, and where humans and Revenants, a human-like species of beings with vampiric abilities, live amongst one another. Our demo picks up in the present, as the effects of the Resurgence--a cataclysmic event that slowly morphs Revenants into mindless beasts--are wreaking havoc on the world.</p><p dir="ltr">A century prior, a group of Revenant warriors tried to seal the Resurgence and save the planet, only to fail and bring on another phenomenon that insteads speeds up the process. Those fallen would-be heroes are trapped around the world, and our hero, with the help of a friend with time-traveling powers, must go back into the past, work with those warriors to figure out how to unlock that which traps them in the present, then come back and defeat them once and for all.</p><p dir="ltr">That's a lot to take in, and if you haven't played the original Code Vein before, you might rightfully assume you've missed something. Mercifully, Code Vein II is taking the Final Fantasy storytelling approach, as this is a standalone tale. Those new to Code Vein can jump in without needing background knowledge, which makes taking in all of the information presented easier.</p><p dir="ltr">Jumping into the game starts with creating a character, and the creator in Code Vein II offers a robust slate of choices for us to dig through. Dozens of skin colors, eye colors, hair styles, hair colors, accessories, and more are available right from the start, creating an experience that those with a creative imagination can sink hours into before even starting the game. Characters also have six attributes--strength, dexterity, mind, willpower, vitality, and fortitude--which can be enhanced by finding special perks called Blood Codes throughout the game.</p><p dir="ltr">After character creation, a small tutorial section offers a few brief moments of exploration, including our character meeting up with the time-traveling friend, and a cutscene establishing the story. We then travel via a sweet motorcycle to the time-travel access point, where we travel back in time to the Sunken Pylon dungeon, link with the fallen hero Josee Anjou, and the meat of the demo begins in earnest.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4629229-formae_fallingsun.png" data-ref-id="1300-4629229" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4629229-formae_fallingsun.png" data-ref-id="1300-4629229"></a><figcaption>Falling Sun Formae</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4629229-formae_fallingsun.png"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">Form(ae)s of combat</h2><p dir="ltr">Once we're dropped into the dungeon, we are immediately presented with a wealth of combat options. Seven main weapons are provided for us to tinker with while in the dungeon, each with their own abilities and attributes. One-handed Swords served as a sort of baseline, as they acted like a standard sword would in any souls-like. Twin Blades allowed for faster strikes, while Greatswords and Hammers dealt massive damage--sometimes even one-shotting foes--with slower, more deliberate attacks.</p><p dir="ltr">The Bayonet was particularly interesting as the long-range weapon of the group, thanks to its allowing me to craft ammo on the fly whenever an opening presented itself, so long as I had the right materials. The floating Rune Blades looked really cool slashing through the air while I punched foes at the same time, though it quickly became clear that they would take more time to learn than the demo allowed--enemies kept getting between the blades and the character, leaving us open to big attacks.</p><p dir="ltr">Each weapon couples with two key components, Formae and Jails, in order to round out your abilities. Formae are weapon-specific abilities, like enhanced attacks, status effects, and more, that can be activated during battle. The Rune Blades, for example, included a Whirling Shredder Formae where the two blades spun like a buzzsaw in front of the character, hitting enemies caught in the circle multiple times.</p><p dir="ltr">Jails, meanwhile, function similarly to Blood Veils in the original Code Vein. Jail attacks are equipped separately from the standard weapons, and are used to drain Ichor from enemies. Ichor is the resource needed to use Formae, so routinely using Jail attacks will keep Formae attacks available for us when needed. Hound was our favorite Jail in the demo, as using it would produce two massive hound heads from either shoulder that would sink their teeth into a nearby enemy, but the massive hand called Ogre and the scythe called Reaper were also fun options.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4629232-jos%C3%A9eanjou2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4629232" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4629232-jos%C3%A9eanjou2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4629232"></a><figcaption>Josee Anjou in the past.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4629232-jos%C3%A9eanjou2.png"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">Partner up</h2><p dir="ltr">As our character has joined with Rosee Anjou in the past, she becomes the poster child for Code Vein II's new Partner mechanic. As the hero meets with more fallen champions of the past, he can build relationships with them by bringing them into battle. The more frequently a hero is selected, the stronger that bond becomes.</p><p dir="ltr">The strength of the bond is most apparent in Link Points (LP), which are visible just below the playable character's health bar. Link Points serve as additional health, and it depletes before the main health bar is affected, which means that the stronger our bond is with Rosee, the more health we will have as we fight. This is a cool way to reward building relationships with characters, and one that's especially welcome in a genre known for its difficulty like the souls-like.</p><p dir="ltr">You can build your relationship with Rosee in one of two ways: Summon and Assimilation. Summoning Rosee adds her to the battlefield, where she can fight enemies on her own and serve as a distraction when we need to heal up or regain stamina. Assimilation adds Rosee's power to your own, leaving us alone on the battlefield, but greatly enhancing our abilities.</p><p dir="ltr">Offering these options is an ingenious way to cater to two different types of souls-like players, those who like summoning help and those who prefer to go it alone, while allowing both the benefits of relationship building. We stuck to Summoning, as we appreciated the distraction Rosee provided during boss fights, but Assimilation is just as valid, as the power boost is certainly worth considering. The Partner system stands out as one of the best new additions to Code Vein II, if only because the development team found a way to include both sides of that "to summon or not to summon" argument.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4629233-vsjos%C3%A9e1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4629233" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4629233-vsjos%C3%A9e1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4629233"></a><figcaption>Josee Anjou in the present.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4629233-vsjos%C3%A9e1.png"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">Fixing the future</h2><p dir="ltr">The demo culminated in two massive boss fights, one in the past and one in the present. The boss in the past was called the Metagen Remnant, a spider-like creature with a human face. This was a tough fight, but one made more bearable thanks to having Rosee on the field as a summoned partner. Rosee drawing the Remnant away so we could get a few extra strikes in was a major part of our victory, even with the disgusting toxic green goop the Remnant would shoot onto the floor when we got in close. Just when we think we're avoiding the Remnant's swipes, green goop hits us with a poison effect; that's a souls-like for you.</p><p dir="ltr">After putting the Remnant down, our character says goodbye to Rosee and returns to the present, where the bindings of the now-monstrous Rosee are unlocked and must be vanquished. This fight is <em>much</em> tougher than the Remnant, and not just because of attack patterns or damage; halfway through the battle, Rosee remembers who we are, and begs us to mercifully end her life as her second phase begins.</p><p dir="ltr">Here is where Code Vein II's emotional weight comes into focus. Each time we go back in time to aid a warrior in their battle with the Resurgence, we will have to return to the present and battle against that very same hero--albeit in a more monstrous form. How will they react? What will they say? In Rosee's case, she shows immense grief for what she has become, and thanks our character for sending her into the afterlife as she fades away. The scene leaves us wondering if every hero will be so understanding, as the demo comes to a close.</p><p dir="ltr">With a separate story, a versatile partner system, and a variety of battle options, Code Vein II is shaping up to be a worthy entry in the crowded souls-like arena. The Formae and Jail system allow players to keep their most powerful attacks handy, while multiple weapon options will let them fight through the Resurgence-ruined world how they see fit.</p><p dir="ltr">Code Vein II is set to launch January 30 for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The end of the world is nigh in Code Vein II, as the calamitous Luna Rapacis progresses and corrupts the Revenants who had, until this point, been able to live in harmony with mankind. But there’s still time to fix this. With a story that’s somewhere between Quantum Leap and X-Men: Days of Future Past, you need to jump back in time to visit and team up with Revenant heroes of a century ago, looking for a way to reawaken them in the present and stop what’s coming.</p>
<p><iframe title="Code Vein 2 Preview –&nbsp;Anime Soulike of Future Past" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FxZSqlaieMM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Back in 2019, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/09/26/code-vein-review/">the original Code Vein</a> brought a whole host of interesting ideas to the Soulslike form, from the ability to jump between character build Blood Codes, to the Partner NPC characters that would fight alongside you throughout. And yes, it came with anime-style graphics too. The Soulslike subgenre already felt pretty full and saturated back in 2019, but now in 2026, it’s bursting at the seams with competition. Bandai Namco’s answer is to take the core of what worked well before, and then bring so, so much more player customisation to the table.</p>


<p>Code Vein II Producer Keita Iizuka explained, “Code Vein belongs to the soulslike genre, but even within the action RPG there are many more genres, for example, exploratory open world games. But there aren’t as clear-cut boundaries as before, I would say. So yes, probably you are right, it’s becoming even more competitive, however because of that, it’s very important for us to really be mindful of our strength. It’s because of their competition that we are more stimulated to create something even better. So that’s something that we have hopefully realised and achieved in this version.”</p>


<p>Take the Partner system in general. It’s still great to have another AI partner there to draw aggro from enemies, dish out some damage of their own, and be ready to revive you with a chunk of their own health should you fall –&nbsp;this Restorative Offering now puts them into a cooldown for a time – but now all of that is optional. This is now branded as Summoning, but you also have the choice to use Assimilation, to absorb you Partner and add their strengths to enhance your powers, stats and abilities. If you found the Partners a touch frustrating to in their behaviours before, then you can sideline them through the whole game now.</p>
<p>Iizuka-san explained, “The reason why we allowed Assimilation is because by just having two characters all the time for every fight, the fighting style became fairly set, so the Partner just takes on a certain role and the player would take a certain role. We wanted to remove that kind of boundary, so that’s why we have created the assimilation mode, to be able to really see the fights from a different angle.</p>
<p>“The emotional arc is an important one. So the characters, you will be able to really spend one-on-one time with them to learn more about their backstories, their emotions, really have very heartfelt conversations. So that’s something that we have really valued.”</p>

<p>You’ll spend time with these characters regardless of how you play. This new world and story sees your protagonist journeying back in time to team up with the Revenant heroes of legend, the Fallen Heroes of the Resurgence, and our hands-on saw us partnering with Josée Anjou back in the day. Battling alongside her through the Sunken City to find a source for the pollution within the Sunken Pylon dungeon that we played. Along the way, there’s various narrative interludes that explore Josée’s character, the relationship she had with her sister and what befell them.</p>
<p>“The preview that you have played focused on Josée’s as her main narrative of her arc,” Iizuka-san said, “but there are other arcs involving other characters, and the scenes that you would be able to experience. With the time travel axis as well, you would be able to go back in time and then meet the characters at different points in their lives, to change the outcome, but also to experience the weight of history as well. So I hope that the players get to enjoy that.”</p>
<p>Putting the narrative focus on a range of characters that aren’t your own is an interesting way to frame the story, especially with the potential to bounce back and forth between time periods, and it also makes sense with just how goofy you can make your custom character. There’s a huge range of visual customisation that lets you fully indulge your more absurdist impulses. Want to wear a top hat with a snowman sticking out the top of it? Well, I certainly did when fiddling with the character creator, and that’s just scratching the surface of what’s possible here.</p>
<div id="attachment_467552"><p id="caption-attachment-467552">Is that a snowman in your hat?</p></div>
<p>“It’s not something that we actively specifically ordered to the developing team […] but the customisation team really took on an active role in coming up with this even further evolved version of the customisation build system,” Iizuka-san told us.&nbsp;“ But something that, as a team, we were very conscious of, is that we wanted to deliver a system that is easy to build, customisable, and that the outcome is always great-looking anime-like characters. So there are many numbers of parts, but always the end result to something that is great. That is something that we want to aspire to create.”</p>
<p>The visual customisation is echoed within the combat builds, again taking the core of the ideas from the original Code Vein and expanding them greatly. The Blood Codes that you apply determine the attributes of your character through six categories, with the equipment and weapons that you then equip putting a burden on these figures, which can lead you to being overburdened and suffer penalties to your play, in turn pushing you to align your choice of weaponry and play style.</p>
<p>Talking about the new possibilities here, Iizuka-san said, “So we have added two new categories into the weapons, as well as two different drain attacks as well, and when it comes to Formae, there are many different varieties that we have added. So by combining them all, there are a lot more that the players could enjoy, so I hope they do.”</p>
<p>You’ll really want to make the most of your Formae abilities (formerly Gifts), the skills that you can use for offence or defence, building up to the Bequeathed Formae as your most powerful ability, summoning a special weapon to your hands to unleash hefty damage. That will require you to have enough Ichor, drawn from enemies by performing Jails (the rebranded Blood Veil) to drain their blood. There’s additional Boosters sprinkled on top for what is a particularly broad and complex system of stats, abilities and synergies for players to find.</p>

<p>It’s this depth of customisation that could end up being Code Vein II’s biggest strength. The Sunken Pylon dungeon felt a little by-the-numbers with its Soulslike structure and fairly samey abandoned, ruined industrial look. There is a more open overworld that can be navigated on a motorcycle, which I didn’t get to play, and I’d be curious to see just how the story handles bouncing between time periods and the character growth. There’s not too long to wait, though, with Code Vein II out later this month.</p>
<p>The opening of 2026 is a busy one for Soulslike fans, and Code Vein II is first in line with a refreshed take on the original’s anime visuals, more extensive character customisation, and a characterful time-travelling tale.</p>

<p>As for why the record has been smashed, Valve almost certainly owes that to the ongoing Steam Winter Sale, which ends today at 10am Pacific and which features huge discounts on a number of popular games (as well as smaller discounts on newer or more evergreen titles).</p><p>Since many of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/steam-best-of-2025" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="506dd7fd-a10c-4745-bcb4-ef7cfe0636c8" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">2025's best-selling games</a> on Steam are live-service titles as well, it's not unreasonable to assume that players are flocking to those games over the holiday period, which is probably why the concurrent in-game player count record has been broken too.</p><p>This news comes after what has been a rather checkered year for Steam, with Valve facing challenges from the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/horses-steam-ban-indie-horror" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a4a11cd5-8771-4a5c-86ba-ff196e272f59" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Horses </em>developer Santa Ragione</a>, No More Robots' <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-more-robots-review-flag-rejection-valve" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5b8f68ae-5137-4e39-9011-498f4b4b7c21" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Mike Rose</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vile-exhumed-steam-removed-sexual-content" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3d619c44-1572-4d4c-9fdf-64af4c3b37db" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Vile: Exhumed</em>'s Cara Cadaver</a> over what appear to be contradictory censorship policies that seem to ignore important context.</p><p>With that said, legendary <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rance-series-coming-to-steam" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7bdd01fa-043a-41f0-af9b-a0305684ffa0" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">eroge series <em>Rance</em></a><em> </em>is about to make its Steam debut, albeit in what will probably end up being a heavily censored form subsidized with a patch downloadable from its publisher's website.

            <guid>1397176</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Now that its officially 2026, Apple waited no time at all to discount its 2025 model of the MacBook Air. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5068/">Amazon is currently Apple MacBook Air with the M4 chip, priced at just $799—down from the regular $999.</a> This 20% price cut saves you $200, making it one of the deepest reductions since its release last year. It’s a great opportunity to kick off the new year with a powerful, versatile laptop.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5068/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Everyday Performance</h2>
<p>The 13-inch 2025 MacBook Air remains a top pick for those who want portability without compromising on performance. Weighing just 2.7 pounds and boasting a sleek design, it continues the Air’s legacy of being incredibly lightweight while delivering the power of larger machines. Despite its slim build, it comes with a 10-core CPU, up to a 10-core GPU, and supports up to 24GB of memory. With the new M4 chip, this laptop performs up to twice as fast as the M1 MacBook Air and is up to 23 times quicker than Intel-based versions of the Air.</p>
<p>Apple designed the M4 chip with Apple Intelligence in mind, optimizing the system for faster task execution, efficient information processing, and handling demanding workflows effortlessly. The MacBook Air stays smooth and responsive whether you’re working on reports, editing videos, or managing multiple tabs.</p>



<p>If you’re often on the go and need long-lasting battery life, the MacBook Air delivers. Apple claims it can last up to 18 hours on a single charge, easily getting you through an entire workday. The 12MP front camera, with 1080p video capability, is perfect for virtual meetings, classes, or chatting with friends and family. The three-microphone array ensures crystal-clear sound, eliminating the need for external microphones.</p>
<p>The backlit keyboard makes typing easy in low-light environments, and Touch ID gives you a quick and secure way to unlock your laptop. On the sides, you’ll find two Thunderbolt ports for fast data transfer and connecting peripherals. The MagSafe charging port keeps your power cable securely in place but detaches safely if pulled. Plus, after all these years, Apple has kept the headphone jack in tact—a nice bonus for those who prefer wired audio.</p>
<p>If you’re already part of the Apple ecosystem, the MacBook Air makes it easy to sync with your iPhone, iPad, or other Apple devices via features like AirDrop, iMessage, and Handoff.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5068/">The MacBook Air is discounted in several configurations. The 256GB model is the most affordable, priced at $799</a>. The 512GB version is now $999. For those who need more memory, the model with 24GB of RAM and 512GB of storage is $1,200. Each of these represent a $200 discount from their original list prices. Choose from four stylish colors: sky blue, silver, starlight, and midnight.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-3-rumored-to-get-brand-new-dlc-in-2026-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reports</a> about a new Witcher 3 DLC have been circulating online since June 2025, when it was claimed that the third major expansion for the game would be announced in 2025; however, it never was. New details have now surfaced online thanks to a Polish Noble Securities Analyst, which provide an expected release window for the DLC as well as The Witcher 4. </p>

The new expansion is expected to “kick off the proper marketing campaign for The Witcher 4.” The analyst also predicted that The Witcher 4 will release in Q4 2027. </p>



<p>Eurogamer also followed up on the original source, Borys Nieśpielak, who stated that the information about The Witcher 3’s 2026 DLC has been verified by “several” independent sources. Nieśpielak also pointed to a statement from CD Projekt RED’s recent earnings call, which states that “Given our current progress, there is a chance that new content hinted upon in recent calls and reports may see release in the coming year.” However, CD Projekt RED’s official response states that the company “does not comment on rumour or speculation”. </p>

            <p>On its release back in 2023, Nintendo kept the Imprisoning War Sages from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> shrouded in a certain amount of mystery. In fact, despite them playing a fairly key role in terms of the overall backstory, we only saw them in the game very briefly.</p>
<p>That changed in last year's release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>, which was set before the events of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. Here, the Hyrule Warriors team was able to shine more of a light on the war's Sages, who we now know to be Ardi of the Gerudo, Qia of the Zora, Raphica of the Rito and Agraston of the Goron.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>In Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment, players are able to take on the role of each Sage as well as the likes of Princess Zelda and Rauru, as they fight through waves upon waves of bokoblins, Lynels and more.</p>
<p>But, why did Nintendo keep Tears of the Kingdom's Imprisoning War Sages under wraps like it did until the spin-off prequel? Well, director Hidemaro Fujibayashi has now said if the developer had shown the Sages' faces and shared their names before then, the story of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom "would have naturally grown too much" for the game.</p><p>"In Tears of the Kingdom there was a central theme running through the main story, and the Sages are depicted with their faces hidden by masks and without names," Fujibayashi said in a recent interview with <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/898/G089833/20251205029/">4Gamer</a> (translated by <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/nintendo-explains-why-it-kept-the-imprisoning-war-sages-a-mystery-in-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/">NintendoEverything</a>). The director then went on to state there were "many things" Nintendo "intentionally held back" for its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">Breath of the Wild</a> sequel.</p>
<p>"If we had shown [the Sages'] personalities and faces, the story would have naturally grown too much," Fujibayashi further explained. "That's why I'm truly happy that the Sages have been more carefully picked up upon here in the Imprisoning War."</p>

<p>Our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-impressions-review-story-gameplay">Alex took Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment out for a spin</a> ahead of its release, calling it the series' "richest offering yet".</p>
<p>Since its release in November, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-free-update-adds-more-weapons-and-enemies-to-the-chaos">updates for Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment have added additional weapons</a>, as well as new Vicious enemies.</p>

            <p>There are a few series staples you can expect from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-franchises/final-fantasy">Final Fantasy</a>: a guy called Cid, moogles, chocobos, that lovely arpeggio motif in the music, and… surveys? If you've been reading this site for a while - or, indeed, following the Final Fantasy series - you'll know that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> likes to lobby the fanbase to hear our thoughts about the series' identity and future.</p>
<p>The publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-15-survey-hints-at-possible-future-updates">did it for Final Fantasy 15 back in 2017</a>, it did to find out <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-polling-final-fantasy-fans-on-moogles-in-ff15">what we all thought about moogles in 2015</a>, Naoki 'Yoshi-P' Yoshida <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naoki-yoshida-on-dawntrail-criticism-community-feedback-and-the-future-of-final-fantasy-14">regularly uses surveys</a> to poll <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">FF14</a> players, and Square Enix <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-16-successfully-expanded-the-series-audience-says-dlc-director">found out that more young people played Final Fantasy 16</a> via a survey in 2024. Keeping with tradition, then, we're seeing the Japanese company once again ask players about the storied series in a poll. And it closes on 9th January.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, we don't really know anything about where the mainline series is going. Yoshi-P said in an interview last year that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/not-a-clear-cut-answer-whether-final-fantasy-17-will-be-turn-based-says-naoki-yoshida-following-clair-obscurs-success">the team isn't even sure whether the game will be turn-based or not</a> (though we do know, at least, Square Enix wants to keep whatever game comes out of its current work a 'cinematic experience').</p>
<p>If you've got big thoughts about what you want to see - something more turn-based, maybe? Something more in line with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> or Metaphor Refantazio, perhaps? - then you can <a href="https://questant.jp/q/6K9FPT4N">head on over to the link</a> and have your say about what you'd like to see more (or less) of in the series going forward.</p><p>Personally, I was electrified by the comments Kazutoyo Maehiro, director of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-tactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a> remake, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-tactics-remake-could-open-the-door-to-a-sequel-if-it-sells-well-says-director">made in an interview last year</a>. Basically, he mentioned that if the re-release sold well, then it would "open the door" to a sequel and "prove the business viability of the strategy RPG genre."</p>
<p>There's an open field at the end of the survey where you can leave whatever comments you like. This is where I've opted to pop my interest in more Final Fantasy Tactics-related titles. Feel free to add what you want, but please, keep it civil.</p>

<h2 id="h-phantom-blade-zero-september-9-2026-pc-playstation-5">Phantom Blade Zero (September 9, 2026 - PC, PlayStation 5) </h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Phantom-Blade-Zero.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>With its intense action combat and incredible animations, Phantom Blade 0 is looking like the best "pure" action game launching this year</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><em>Phantom Blade Zero</em> made more than a few heads turn when it was <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-0-is-a-new-unreal-engine-5-powered-dark-action-rpg-coming-to-playstation-5/">revealed in May 2023</a>,</strong> with its distinctive style <strong>blending traditional kung fu with steampunk and cyberpunk</strong>. However, many dismissed it as yet another <strong>soulslike</strong>. Fortunately, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-not-soulslike/">this won't be the case</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Edging closer to a more <strong>traditional action game</strong> than a soulslike, the game in development by S-Game is setting out to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-gamescom-hands-on-preview-setting-up-for-greatness/"><strong>one of the best games of the current console generation</strong></a>, featuring intense action, linear yet articulate level design, exceptional enemy encounter design that forces players to employ every game mechanic effectively, epic boss battles and some of the smoothest animation in video games.</p>



<p>Though in the works by what is essentially an unproven team, <em>Phantom Blade Zero</em> truly has everything to <strong>succeed</strong> when <a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-slashes-its-way-on-pc-and-playstation-5-this-september/"><strong>it launches this September.</strong></a></p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-s-wolverine-q3-q4-2026-playstation-5">Marvel's Wolverine (Q3/Q4 2026 - PlayStation 5)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Marvels-Wolverine.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>Starring one of the most iconic Marvel Comics characters ever, Marvel's Wolverine is set to become one of the most successful action games of 2026</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Following the success of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/marvels-spider-man-2-ultimate-incarnation/"><strong><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Marvel's Spider-Man</em> series</strong></a>, Insomniac Games is preparing to branch out with a new game starring <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">one of the most beloved Marvel Comics characters</strong> that shares very little with Peter Parker's and Miles Morales' adventures.</p>



<p>Seemingly <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-wolverine-hard-r-not-fully-open-world-2024-2025/"><strong>ditching the open-world</strong></a> of <em>Marvel's Spider-Man</em>, <em>Marvel's Wolverine</em> will take <strong>a third-person action adventure route</strong> where players control the legendary Logan, explore a variety of locations, meet an ensemble cast of Marvel Comics characters, and gruesomely take down enemies using his <strong>superior strength and Adamantium Claws</strong>. With the vehicle traversal and varied locations teased in <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-wolverine-new-trailer-provides-first-look-at-gameplay-confirms-fall-2026-release-window/">last year's gameplay trailer</a></strong>, there are plenty of reasons to be excited about the game.</p>



<p>With <strong>Sony's first-party premier action-adventure game series not receiving new entries this year</strong>, <em>Marvel's Wolverine</em> is undoubtedly <strong>the game to look out for for fans of the genre</strong>, even those who aren't too keen on the Marvel Comics universe.</p>



<h2 id="h-crimson-desert-march-19-2026-pc-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-s">Crimson Desert (March 19, 2026 - PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S)</h2>

<p><em>Crimson Desert</em> by Pearl Abyss, the developers of the popular MMO Black Desert Online, has been in the works for a very long time, but <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-has-release-date-recommended-requirements-reduced/"><strong>this year we will finally be able to experience</strong></a> Kliff's journey through the continent of Pywel ourselves.</p>



<p>With the political turmoil following the death of the Unifier of Lands in the background, players will get to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">explore a really varied world</strong> with regions ranging from the pleasing plains of Akapen to the cold lands of Kweiden, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">raid castles</strong>, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">explore dungeons </strong>featuring puzzles, treasure and powerful enemies, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">create alliances</strong> with other central characters and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">master weapons and martial arts techniques</strong> to take down some <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-gameplay-shows-off-boss-fight-against-mechanical-dragon/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">rather impressive massive enemies</strong></a>.</p>



<p>For too long, <em>Crimson Desert</em> has been a huge unknown, but from what we have seen so far, the game has <strong>a high chance of being one of the best open-world action games </strong>in this packed 2026.</p>



<h2 id="h-007-first-light-may-27-2026-pc-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-s-nintendo-switch-2">007: First Light (May 27, 2026 - PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch 2)</h2>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a> voice actor Ned Luke - aka Michael de Santa - got swatted for the eighth time over Xmas. I don’t mean that somebody belted him on the nose with a rolled-up newspaper. I mean that somebody put in a hoax call to emergency services in a bid to have armed police sent to his house. The latest incident happened this December while Luke was streaming GTA Online with Rob Wiethoff, the voice of John Marston in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/red-dead-redemption">Red Dead Redemption</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>.

<p>“Swatting” is, obviously, <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/first-ever-uk-swatting-sentence-passed-after-man-shot-in-face-by-armed-unit-due-to-hoax-call-13118559">very dangerous</a> in a country like the USA, where there are more guns than humans and the police are especially well-armed. It has gotten <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ks/pr/ohio-gamer-pleads-guilty-swatting-caused-death">a couple</a> <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/tennessee-man-targeted-his-twitter-handle-dies-after-swatting-call-n1274747">of people</a> killed, that I know about.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the cops seem pretty relaxed in the footage, possibly because they’re aware that Luke is a frequent target of such malevolent pranking - indeed, one of them can be heard saying "you've been swatted again". If it were me, I’d be lying on the floor nonetheless with all limbs extended at 45 degree angles, but Luke just gets up with a sigh and says hello to the fuzz, then goes back to playing GTA Online for an hour and a half. I guess it’s just as well he didn’t answer the door in character for Michael.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-5-voice-actor-ned-luke-swatted-police-live-streaming-twitch-2000655992">Kotaku</a>, Luke says he was repeatedly swatted in late 2023, after his address was leaked online, and that at one point, the police ordered him to step outside his house. He's also initiated legal proceedings against some of the swatters, with one person due <a href="https://x.com/GTAVI_Countdown/status/2004926105275498972">to appear in court for sentencing</a> this month - we'll keep an eye out for that, I guess. It’s not clear there’s any real motivation for Luke's repeated swatting, beyond random people being spiteful.</p>
<p>This feels like the kind of morbid present-day cultural phenomena the forthcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a> should parody, alongside <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6s-wholesome-boris-bike-docking-revealed-in-alleged-wip-rockstar-portfolio-video">Boris Bikes</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-appears-to-have-its-own-florida-man-parody">Florida Man</a>, but then again, that would only be encouraging the arseholes.

            <guid>1397125</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Buying a new desktop computer can be a bit of a bear, especially if you want something that can both save you some space and money. But because we’re here to help, we’ve found something that satisfies both conditions and then some: the KAMRUI AM21 Mini Desktop wth an AMD Ryzen 7 processor.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6659/">You can purchase the KAMRUI AM21 Mini Desktop for $499 from Amazon (originally priced at $699), which nets you a discount of $200 or 29% off.</a> That’s nothing to sneeze at, so if you’re ready to plunk your cold, hard cash down on, it’s go time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6659/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A mini PC that has all the bells and whistles of its larger cousin</h2>
<p>The KAMRUI AM21 Mini Desktop features an AMD Ryzen 7 8745HS processor, 32GB of DDR5 5600 MHz memory, and a 1TB M.2 2280 NVME PCIe 4.0 SSD in a space-saving desktop chassis. This is an 8-core, 16-thread chip that runs up to 4.9 GHz and has integrated Radeon 780M graphics that provide smooth 1080P gaming resources. In other words, it’s deceptively powerful, despite its small size. And that means you can put it just about anywhere and still expect some serious performance.</p>
<p>Storage begins with a 1 TB M.2 2280 NVMe PCIe 4.0 x4 SSD, but there are two M.2 2280 slots available for expansion. These can accommodate up to 4 TB of NVMe storage. Although the listing mentions that SATA SSD expansion is not supported, users will need to utilize NVMe SSDs when expanding their storage.</p>



<p>This mini-desktop ships with Windows 11 Pro, KAMRUI Care support, and Amazon’s standard product support options. That means there are tons of ways to get help, so if you find yourself needing it, it’s there for you. You never know what kinds of issues can crop up when you’re setting up a new computer.</p>
<p>Pound for pound, this is a small but mighty computer that can replace a typical desktop or laptop, depending on which one you use regularly. And you can’t forget how much you’re saving on it, as well as how small it is in comparison to the commonly-accepted desktops on the market. You can get a ton done with it, and then some. Then you’ll even have some money left over to buy accessories or other items should you need to finish outfitting your work area. Or your casual home office, whichever ends up becoming true.</p>
<p>If your New Year’s resolution is to get a better PC that can improve your productivity and make things easier, this is an excellent pick. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6659/">Just act quickly, because this deal likely won’t be around for long, and it isn’t the type of discount you’ll not want to sink your teeth into.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new claim reveals that NVIDIA plans to re-release their GeForce RTX 3060 GPUs to counter the ongoing memory shortage. </p>



<p>The GPU market has been suffering from a memory shortage recently, ever since AI has blown up worldwide. We have already heard reports on how it’s going to impact NVIDIA, with some claiming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-rtx-5090-prices-to-5000-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prices will get ridiculous</a> in 2026. Now, a new claim reveals how NVIDIA plans to counter this issue.</p>







<h2 id="h-nvidia-is-reportedly-re-releasing-geforce-rtx-3060-to-counter-ongoing-memory-shortages">NVIDIA is Reportedly Re-Releasing GeForce RTX 3060 to Counter Ongoing Memory Shortages</h2>



<p>The new claim about NVIDIA bringing back GeForce RTX 3060 GPUs comes from <a href="https://x.com/hongxing2020/status/2008043115308065078" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">hongxing2020</a> on X (formerly Twitter), via <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-to-bring-back-geforce-rtx-3060-q1-2026-tackle-memory-shortages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wccftech</a>. The tweet from today only states that NVIDIA is re-releasing GeForce RTX 3060 GPUs along with an expected release window of Q1 2026. However, no additional details were provided, so we don’t know whether they will release one of the variants or both 12GB and 8GB versions when it is expected to arrive. Additionally, no pricing was revealed either. </p>



<p>The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 was released back in 2021 and was built on the Ampere Architecture. The GPU was also packed with other gaming features such as Ray Tracing, NVIDIA DLSS, NVIDIA Reflex, and much more. There were 192-bit 12GB GPUs and 128-bit 8GB GPUs, both featuring GDDR6 memory configurations. The GPU launched at USD $329 when it was released, and players are hoping it returns at a similar price. </p>







<p>In other news, the memory shortage could lead NVIDIA to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-cutting-rtx-50-series-production-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cut RTX 50 series</a> production this year. Additionally, an ARC Raiders backpack had single-handedly crashed the NVIDIA website last month. What are your thoughts on NVIDIA re-releasing RTX 3060 GPUs in 2026?

            <title><![CDATA[Can You Preload Hytale Early Access Before Launch?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/can-you-preload-hytale-early-access-before-launch/</link>
            <guid>1397119</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The long wait for the release of Hytale is coming to a close, with the eagerly anticipated early access release now right around the corner, and if you have questions about the preload status, Insider Gaming has all the crucial information.</p>



<p>Hytale’s early access release is<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-early-access-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> set for January 13 on PC</a>, and thousands of players are expected to dive into the Minecraft-inspired title as soon as they possibly can, which may lead to strain on the servers.</p>



<p>That may lead to slow downloads for players, with preload a potential way to avoid such issues, and this guide explains whether the option is available for Hytale.</p>







<h2 id="h-does-hytale-have-a-preload-option">Does Hytale Have a Preload Option?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Roaring onto the scene. Image via Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, there is no preload option available for Hytale. You will need to wait for the early access release on January 13 to download the game in full.</strong></p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HytaleInfo/comments/1psbpco/preload/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reddit </a>post covering the topic, a fan responded with details of the lack of preload available in Hytale, with a developer stating that it “would require more system to be built to decrypt downloads” and they “don’t have the capacity for it.”</p>



<p>The good news, however, is that it shouldn’t take too long to download Hytale when early access becomes available, as the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-system-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">system requirements</a> for the game state an installation size of around 8GB. However, it’s recommended to have at least 10 GB of available storage, with 20 GB stated to be a safe bet.</p>



<p>As Hyutale procedurally generates a world that can continue to expand, the more you explore, customize, and build, the more memory will be required.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-hytale-have-a-preload-option-in-the-future">Will Hytale Have a Preload Option in The Future?</h2>



<p><strong>Hytale may have a preload option in the future when major updates are rolled out, allowing you to download the newest content for the game before the servers are live with new content, but this is speculative at this point.</strong></p>



<p>Many live-services games allow players to pre-download major updates before they are able to play them, with major examples including Fortnite, and this approach means players are able to dive into enjoying content as soon as the servers are back online.</p>



<p>At this stage, however, it’s not known what approach Hytale will take, particularly in early access, given that new patches are expected to deploy bug fixes and new content regularly.</p>

                <p>Through most of last year, IO Interactive assured players that its upcoming James Bond title, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-james-bond-game-first-light-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531773/" data-ref-id="1100-6531773">007 First Light</a>, was set for an early 2026 debut. The game had been scheduled to debut on March 27, but the release date has now been pushed back to May 27.</p><p>In <a href="https://x.com/007GameIOI/status/2003511022141817016" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a statement posted online</a> late last month, IO Interactive's Hakan Abrak called 007 First Light the company's "most ambitious project to date" while mentioning the Bond staples included in the game like car chases, gadgets, and wild globe-trotting adventure. However, he went on to say that the decision to delay it "allows us to ensure the experience meets the level of quality you players deserve on day one."</p><p>"The game is progressing well and is fully playable from beginning to end," added Abrak. "So these two additional months will allow us to further polish and refine the experience, ensuring we deliver the strongest possible version at launch. We're confident this sets 007 First Light up for long-term success, and we sincerely appreciate the patience and continued support we've received ever since we first announced the game."</p><p>In November 2025, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/james-bond-dev-reacts-to-gta-6-delay-and-explains-why-the-game-is-good-for-the-industry/1100-6536420/" data-ref-id="1100-6536420">Abrak spoke about GTA 6's delay</a> and why he thinks it was a good thing for 007 First Light and the industry in general. The new game features Patrick Gibson as a much younger James Bond than the character is usually portrayed, and the story will introduce a new origin for 007.</p><p>007 First Light narrative director Martin Emborg recently told GameSpot that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/007-first-light-knows-the-key-ingredient-to-a-great-james-bond-adventure/1100-6537117/" data-ref-id="1100-6537117">Lenny Kravitz's pirate king Bawma</a> won't be the only villain featured in the game. He also highlighted Kravitz's role in the creation of the character.</p><p>"We knew the character of Bawma was a larger-than-life, colorful character," said Emborg. "So, when Lenny came on board, he helped shape the character in a big way. He's had a major impact on Bawma; The cool outfit, the character traits, the backstory, all of these things we went back and forth and crafted this character together. We designed the character in cooperation with him."</p><p>007 First Light will be available on Switch 2, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/djis-flagship-drone-joins-the-clearance-lineup-tri-camera-mavic-4-pro-with-rc-2-drops-to-an-all-time-low-2000656507</link>
            <guid>1397098</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="552">Drones come in a crazy wide range of styles and performance levels for a variety of use cases. Some of the more affordable options are essentially just toys, ideal for casual fun at parties or for quick park outings with friends. This is not one of those drones. The DJI Mavic 4 Pro is a premium-grade model specifically built for professional aerial photography and videography. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6658/">Normally priced at $2,699 on Amazon, it’s currently available for a reduced price of $2,199—a $500 discount. Kick off the new year with an awesome new piece of tech.</a></p>
<p data-start="554" data-end="1321">For professionals seeking a versatile drone, the DJI Mavic 4 Pro is exceptional. This model features three distinct cameras. First, there’s a 28mm Hasselblad camera that boasts a massive 100MP resolution, perfect for wide-angle shots. Additionally, a 70mm medium telephoto camera offers 48MP, and a 168mm telephoto camera provides 50MP for capturing detailed close-ups from a distance. With the combination of the main lens and two telephoto lenses, you can achieve sharp, high-quality zoom shots, as well as breathtaking wide shots. The dynamic 360-degree gimbal system ensures smooth, stable camera movement, whether you’re shooting cinematic sequences for a film or broadcasting live sports events.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6658/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p data-start="1323" data-end="1624">Tracking your subject with precision is key for drone photography, and the DJI Mavic 4 Pro makes this easier than ever. The ActiveTrack system enables 360-degree vehicle tracking, allowing the drone to follow moving subjects from as far as 200 meters away, all while maintaining awareness of its surroundings.</p>
<p data-start="1626" data-end="1915">The included DJI RC 2 controller enhances the flying experience with its 7-inch, bright, and rotatable screen, making it easy to monitor your footage while keeping your focus on the drone’s performance. The controller is also collapsible, making storage and transportation more convenient.</p>


<h2>Fly Safely, Even at Night</h2>
<p data-start="1917" data-end="2309">The DJI Mavic 4 Pro is capable of capturing stunning visuals even in low-light environments. Thanks to its 0.1-Lux nightscape omnidirectional obstacle sensor, the drone can detect nearby objects in the dark, preventing potential collisions even when visibility is limited. This makes it an excellent option for shooting after the sun sets or in dimly lit conditions.</p>
<p data-start="2311" data-end="2721">The Mavic 4 Pro offers an impressive flight time of up to 51 minutes on a single charge, giving you ample time to capture long, cinematic shots. It also comes with 64GB of onboard storage, which can be expanded up to 512GB if needed. You can easily transfer photos and videos to your smartphone via the DJI Fly app, with transfer speeds of up to 80MB/s, all without having to remove the SD card from the drone.</p>
<p data-start="2723" data-end="2905" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6658/">Now is the perfect time to get the DJI Mavic 4 Pro as it sits with a significant $500 discount.</a> Take advantage of this limited-time offer and elevate your aerial photography and videography game.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Cubey sandbox crafter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hytale">Hytale</a> launches into early access next Tuesday, January 13th, after a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-a-rare-bit-of-good-news-hytale-lives-on-with-its-original-devs-buying-the-rights-off-of-riot">dicey few months</a> in which it was cancelled, bought out by the original developers, and revived like a majestic square-beaked phoenix. It’ll also have a native Linux version, allowing anyone fed up with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-most-important-pc-gaming-news-stories-in-2026">Microsoft’s continued bullshit</a> to play it on a system running something that <em>isn’t</em> an increasingly bloated or prematurely abandoned Windows.</p>
<p>There are caveats, mind. In a <a href="https://x.com/slikey/status/2006774600491827296">Xitter post</a> announcing the Linux version, Hypixel co-founder and tech director Kevin Carstens – well spotted by <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2026/01/native-linux-support-for-hytale-will-be-launched-as-experimental/">Gaming on Linux</a> – stresses that it’ll be an "experimental" endeavour, potentially susceptible to bugs specific to different distributions (sub-versions) of the open-source OS. And the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a>, which runs the Linux-based SteamOS, is in a trickier position still. Carstens explains that limited testing on a docked Deck, with the handheld aided by a mouse and keyboard, suggests it can run local singleplayer fine, though it’s "not officially recommended" as a Hytale-playing device as the game currently lacks controller support.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>It's easy to see this as the latest move in a campaign of expectation management on Hypixel’s part, the newly minted developer-owners having <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytales-early-access-release-date-set-in-stone-for-january-2026-but-its-devs-admit-the-first-impression-will-be-rough">previously warned</a> that Hytale is "still very much unfinished and broken", as well as electing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-wont-be-on-steam-right-away-as-its-devs-want-to-avoid-overindexing-on-negative-reviews-from-players-who-arent-as-well-informed-yet">not to release on Steam</a> until it’s been hammered into better shape. Broadly, though, this is still good news for Linux PC owners. It remains a rarity for games to get full-blooded native ports, and even a buggy Linux version can sidestep the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/respawn-have-killed-apex-legends-steam-deck-support-in-the-name-of-anti-cheat">pitfalls</a> of running a Windows game on a compatibility layer, as the Steam Deck does for most of its playable catalogue.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t count the Deck out entirely, though. It’s apparently already cleared the performance hurdle – Hytale is "well playable" on it, according to Carstens – and considering that the Java version of fellow block-manipulator Minecraft can be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-install-minecraft-on-steam-deck">tweaked and tuned</a> to run on Valve’s portable PC, despite its own lack of controller/gamepad support, it’s not outside the realm of possibility that Hytale could find a similarly custom-built solution. At the very least, Linux compatibility bodes well for the upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hands-on-with-the-new-steam-machine-valves-square-shot-at-steamos-pc-redemption">Steam Machine</a>, which also runs SteamOS and adopts a PC-like box design that lends itself better to mouse and keyboard piloting. It even <em>looks</em> a little like a Hytale block.</p>

<p>Steam hardware surveys indicate <a href="https://www.club386.com/steam-hardware-survey-shows-how-linux-is-slowly-eating-into-windows-market-share/">Linux usage grew slightly in 2025</a>, amid widespread (and vocal) consumer dissatisfaction with Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nearly-a-third-of-all-gaming-pcs-are-still-running-windows-10-even-as-microsoft-prepare-to-kill-it">shuttering of Windows 10</a>, stuffing of Windows 11 with unwanted and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-detail-agentic-ai-plan-for-windows-11-immediately-admit-it-might-install-malware-on-your-pc">potentially dangerous AI 'features'</a>, and questionable military contracts. While I’m not aboard the boycott train just yet, the possibility of freeing myself from the Redmond monopoly is becoming more and more attractive, especially when more and more developers are taking Linux seriously as an alternative. And when it’s just not nearly as rubbish for games <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-problems-we-had-with-gaming-on-linux">as it used to be</a>.</p>
<p>But what say you, reader? Should we be paying more attention to Linux, potentially outside the relatively 'big' SteamOS developments? Here’s a poll – let us know. Feed us with data, that we may all be nourished.</p>

            <p>Gerry from the River rides up to a noticeboard. Between contracts, he scans the pinned scraps for a fresh job to take on, only for his eyes to rest on one particularly peculiar bit of prose. 'There's a mysterious extra DLC for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3</a> in the works', this bit of paper claims. 'Oh, you mean <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-witcher-3s-final-patch-delivering-cross-platform-mod-support-has-been-delayed-until-2026">that anniversary patch</a> which was delayed last year?' Gerry's mutant brain asks in response. 'No, seemingly not that one,' the sentient scrap replies.</p>
<p>Gerry grumbles to himself in mild confusion. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>'s a decade old at this point, and while CD's love of relentlessly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077s-latest-patch-disengages-autodrives-sticky-handbrake-and-gives-it-a-pass-to-run-every-red-light">adding more stuff</a> to their games is well-documented, they're <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cd-projekt-plan-to-release-the-witcher-4-5-6-within-six-years-of-one-another-and-oh-are-those-pigs-flying">surely busy</a> focusing on the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2</a>?</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Yet, the bit of paper, symbolising reporting from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-there-really-going-to-be-a-2026-witcher-3-expansion">Europeanvideogamer</a> which cites claims by Polish industry whisper hearer Borys Nieśpielak, remains adamant such a thing is coming. Having initially claimed that an extra Witcher 3 DLC was in the works at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-remake">Witcher 1 Remake</a> developers Fool's Theory last summer, Nieśpielak's latest comments on the subject see him stick to his guns and point to a comment from CD Projekt's <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2025/11/transcript-q3-2025-earnings-3.pdf">latest financial report</a> published late last year.</p>
<p>Said comment is from CD Projekt chief financial officer Piotr Nielubowicz, and came at the end of a discussion about the company's potential to achieve the upcoming moneymaking targets they've set. "Given our current progress, there is a chance that new content hinted upon in recent calls and reports may see release in the coming year, having an impact on our results," the finance fellow said, not shedding any more light on said content.</p><p>Outside of Nieśpielak's claims and the vague financial report chat, a <a href="https://strefainwestorow.pl/analizy/noblesecurities-cdprojekt-wiedzmin-dlc-orion-cyberpunk">Polish investing site</a> has reportedly cited Mateusz Chrzanowski - an analyst at investing firm <a href="https://noblesecurities.pl/">Noble Securities</a> - as having predicted "the next paid add-on (DLC) for The Witcher 3" to be released in May 2026.</p>
<p>Gerry from the River thinks, scratching his white whiskers. It's all very strange. What would such a DLC even feature, assuming it's more than just a few extra bits of gear or similar stuff? A quest similar in scope to the brief mission added to the game with 2022's next-gen update, this time tying in with The Witcher 4 rather than Netflixy witchering?</p>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077's last few patches were pretty vehicle/transport heaving in terms of their additions, so maybe the option to take a scenic cart ride along the roads of the Northern Kingdoms if that's anything to go by? Perhaps the integration of some more popular mod - no, wait, that's it. The new mode of transport is <a href="https://www.vg247.com/witcher-3-mod-geralt-centaur-horse-man">this weird mod</a> which allows Geralt to run around as a half-man, half-horse centaur after blowing a magic horn finally being added to official Witcher canon. Then, boom, The Witcher 4 rocks up and Ciri's developed the ability to grow hooves on command, going on to have neigh problem founding the first Witcher school of the horse, much to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/turns-out-a-relatively-important-plot-point-in-the-witcher-games-shouldnt-exist-at-all-so-says-the-books-author">the chagrin of Andrzej Sapkowski</a>.</p>
<p>Its secrets are stolen and animal melding magic becomes the latest problem to threaten The Continent, as mages begin taping bear claws and wolf mouths to themselves. To save the world, Ciri has to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Witcher3/comments/18s8fzg/do_ya_think_that_this_was_allusion_to_cyberpunk/">travel into Cyberpunk 2077 again</a> and have a set of mantis blades installed to teach these misbehaving magicians who's boss. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cd-projekts-mysterious-project-hadar-is-now-their-research-focus-as-cyberpunk-2-and-witcher-4-gather-steam">Project Hadar</a> turns out to be the first game in a third CD Projekt series in which we follow a modern day half-dog Keanu Reeves as he tries to drag society away from a future of dystopian metropolises and instead towards a park-centric system of governance inspired by the game of fetch.</p>
<p>Or maybe it'll just be a couple of new swords, Gerry thinks as he gallops off to hunt another monster.</p>

            <guid>1397083</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="518">If the holidays came and went without the new gaming console you were hoping to unwrap, Amazon is offering a solid second chance to treat yourself. Right now, you can pick up the Xbox Series X and finally experience Microsoft’s most powerful console in stunning 4K. The standard retail price for the Xbox Series X has recently settled at $650, but for a limited time, Amazon is discounting it by 8%. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6384/">That price drop knocks $50 off the total, bringing the console down to $600—a meaningful savings given today’s market.</a></p>
<p data-start="520" data-end="1351">Okay, let’s pause for a moment to get a lesson on Xbox Series X’s unusual pricing history. When Microsoft launched the Xbox Series X alongside the Series S back in 2020, the flagship console carried a $500 price tag. That price held steady for years, which is typical for console generations. However, in May 2025, Microsoft announced a price increase, bumping the Series X up by $100 to $600. Just a few months later, the company raised the price again, pushing it to $650. This makes the current generation one of the rare cases where console prices have increased rather than dropped over time. With that context in mind, Amazon’s current deal effectively brings the Series X back to its 2025 spring and summer pricing.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6384/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="1353" data-end="1819">Xbox Series X vs. Xbox Series S</h2>
<p data-start="1353" data-end="1819">When comparing the Xbox Series X to its more budget-friendly sibling, the Xbox Series S, the reasons for the price difference become clear. One of the biggest advantages of the Series X is its ability to run games in native 4K resolution. While both consoles support high refresh rates of up to 120 frames per second and HDR visuals, the Series X is built for players who want the sharpest image quality possible on modern displays.</p>
<p data-start="1821" data-end="2145">Another major distinction is the inclusion of a disc drive on the Series X. This is a big deal for players who prefer owning physical copies of their games or who already have a collection of discs. Beyond gaming, the console can also double as a Blu-ray player, making it a useful addition to your home entertainment setup.</p>


<p data-start="2147" data-end="2690">Both the Xbox Series X and Series S rely on Microsoft’s Xbox Velocity Architecture, which is responsible for the fast load times that define this console generation. This technology also powers Quick Resume, a feature that lets you suspend and switch between multiple games. Instead of closing out a game and rebooting it to the start screen later, Quick Resume saves your exact progress and returns you to the same spot when you jump back in. It’s especially convenient if you like to bounce between different games without worrying about finding a save point every time.</p>
<p data-start="2692" data-end="2971">The Xbox Series X also functions as a complete media hub. You can download popular streaming apps like YouTube, Netflix, HBO Max, and Dropout, and enjoy supported content in full 4K with HDR.</p>
<p data-start="2973" data-end="3476" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">To get the most out of the Xbox ecosystem, Game Pass Ultimate is well worth considering. The subscription includes online multiplayer through Xbox Live and access to a massive library of games you can download and play at any time. It’s often compared to Netflix, but for video games. One standout title in the Game Pass catalog is the critically acclaimed <em data-start="3330" data-end="3359">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>. With numerous awards and glowing reviews, it’s a great example of the value Game Pass offers right out of the gate. You can hit the ground running with one of the best titles to come out last year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil 4's helpless companion character Ashley was once planned to star in a newly-designed intro made for Capcom's acclaimed remake.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Everyone knows by now how Resident Evil 4 opens: with fan-favorite character Leon S. Kennedy thrown into the action as he investigates the abduction of Ashley Graham, the U.S. president's daughter. And in the final version of the brilliant <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-4">Resident Evil 4 Remake</a>, this is again how the game begins.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Capcom planned — and at least partially built — a new introduction sequence dubbed Chapter 0 which would have seen players sneak around as Ashley, before she's finally dragged off by brainwashed ganados. And now, a fresh video showing some of the mission has been put together.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Ashley's Chapter 0 would have taken place in an expanded version of the forested area outside the game's main village, close to where Leon is ultimately seen creeping along at the beginning of the remake. A snippet of this survived in a trailer for the remake, where Ashley witnesses a grisly ritual sacrifice prior to getting captured. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The non-combat mission sees Ashley sneak along, hiding from a patrolling ganado, and spotting another who is carrying Luis — presumably to the basement where Leon finds him later. But, ultimately, we all know Ashley is going to get captured — something that, after a brief chase sequence, we then see play out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're keen to see the remains of this mission in action, modder Michael "Thekempy" Kemp has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXI-MrzgZXU" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> of its surviving elements — though it seems like much of the mission was unfinished, or removed from the game's final version.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 10 Best Resident Evil Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While Resident Evil 4 remake features plenty of extra sequences not found in the original Resi 4, it's easy to see why this one fell by the wayside. It's hard to imagine anyone being surprised by Ashley's capture, since that sets up the whole game, and the character already has her own short sections of gameplay later on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And then there's the fact that Ashley is, well, not loved by some Resident Evil fans. The Resi 4 remake goes some way to making her less of a damsel in distress, but it's perhaps unsurprising that Capcom ultimately chose not to open the game with her, rather than simply letting players jump straight in to Leon's mission.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The Resident Evil 4 remake is the series' most relentlessly exciting adventure rebuilt, refined, and realised to the full extent of its enormous potential," IGN wrote in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-4-remake-review">Resident Evil 4 Remake review</a>, scoring it 10/10.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
