            <p>Sony's PlayStation State of Play May Showcase 2024 may have been announced at short notice, but packed within its 35-minute presentation we got a look at a whole host of brand-new PS5 games coming in 2024 and beyond. There were also two new PSV2 games announced here, as well as the surprise return of one of PlayStation's most beloved mascots, Astro Bot. </p>
<p>Whether you missed the showcase or just want a handy round-up of all the trailers again, here's everything that was announced in Sony's State of Play May Showcase.</p>
<h2>Concord</h2>
<p>First up, we got a long-awaited look at Concord, Firewalk's upcoming PvP shooter, both in the form of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnStS9d2xg">cinematic vignette</a> and a proper gameplay trailer (embedded below). <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-concord-is-a-5v5-sci-fi-shooter-with-guardians-of-the-galaxy-vibes">Big Guardians of the Galaxy energy</a>, this one. Lots of big guns, lots of colourful moons and planets, and a very chatty cast. Could this be the perfect second course after Helldivers earlier this year? We'll find out when it launches on PS5 and PC on <strong>August 23rd 2024</strong>. </p>

<h2>God of War: Ragnarok</h2>
<p>Ragnarok and its Valhalla DLC is finally <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-ragnarok-next-sony-game-coming-to-pc">coming to PC</a> in one bundled package, adding unlocked frame rates, DLSS, XeSS and FSR support, as well as support for super ultrawide monitors. It's coming on <strong>September 19th 2024</strong>. </p>

<h2>Dynasty Warriors Origins</h2>
<p>Giant army battles? Check. Dashing heroes on horseback cutting down waves of soldiers in a single swosh of their sword? Double check. Yep, this is Dynasty Warriors all right, and honestly, it's great to see Omega Force return to their flagship series after spending several years applying their ridiculously over the top (but oh so satisfying) Warriors formula to Zelda, Fire Emblem and Persona. Dynasty Warriors Origins certainly looks ambitious, what with its hundreds of onscreen footsoldiers all waiting to get mowed down like human hay bales, but dare I say that it also looks like one of Omega Force's most technically proficient games yet? We'll find out for sure when it launches in <strong>2025</strong>.  </p>

<h2>Infinity Nikki</h2>
<p>Described as an open world dress-up adventure, Infinity Nikki is all about styling it out as you venture across the vast world of Miraland with your cute cat bud in tow. On top of some light platforming, it also looks like you'll be using the powers of your various outfits to fight big monsters, chase after sheep, take pictures, ride giant flower stems through the air, and give fluffy doggos a tiny sponge bath. Adorable stuff. No set release date just yet, but there will be a beta test sometime between <strong>July and September</strong> later this year. </p>

<h2>Ballad Of Antara </h2>
<p>Just in case Shadow of the Erdtree doesn't fulfil your towering, enigmatic beast quota for the year, Ballad of Antara is an upcoming fantasy action RPG from TipsWorks and Infold Games. You won't be travelling through this strange and mystery world alone, either, as you've got a small child clamped to your back at all times, it seems. It's currently unclear what role your tiny friend plays at the moment, or indeed how the other protagonists hinted at in the reveal trailer below come into play, but hopefully it won't be too long before we find out. Ballad of Antara is coming in <strong>2025</strong>. </p>

<h2>Skydance's Behemoth</h2>
<p>From the developers of The Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners, Skydance's Behemoth is a new PSVR2 game set in an icy, mountainous realm known as the Forsaken Lands. After its initial cinematic tease all the way back in 2022, tonight we got a look at some proper gameplay. On top of turning its regular-sized foes into jam via its hand-to-hand combat, you'll also be trying to avoid getting jammed yourself by the altogether larger hoofs and stampy feet of its titular giants. Shadow of the Colossus, eat your heart out. It's coming later this <strong>autumn</strong>.</p>

<h2>Alien Rogue Incursion</h2>
<p>Another one for PSVR2 fans here, we got a very brief, 53-second glimpse of Alien Rogue Incursion in action as well. Set on the planet Purdan, it looks like you'll be exploring the very, very dark and not at all creepy ruins of a crashed spaceship, and yep, trying not to get munched by the resident Xenomorph. Truly, the perfect Christmas present for all PSV2 owners, as it's coming sometime during <strong>Holiday 2024</strong>. </p>

<h2>Marvel Rivals</h2>
<p>Announced earlier this year, Marvel Rivals is another PvP shooter that asks the question, what if Overwatch was made up of Marvel supes? Its big selling point is that certain groups of heroes (and villains) can team up to perform big signature combo attacks to nuke both your opponents and the local environment. Will it be enough to overcome my extreme Marvel fatigue, though? There's still no set release date for this one, but there will be a closed beta coming to PS5 in <strong>July</strong>.  </p>

<h2>Where Winds Meet</h2>
<p>Now this is more like it. We've seen several glimpses of Where Winds Meet at this point, but cor, this latest trailer really does get the pulse racing with its big, juicy sword fights. It's essentially a montage of lots of neat-looking fights, and yep, that does include a battle against a very big fish, and a flaming wooden bird robot. Some of the weapons look quite tasty, too. A paper umbrella laced with throwing blades, you say? Well, don't mind if I do. Alas, there's still no release date for Where Winds Meet, but the trailer wants to assure you it's very much 'in development' still.  </p>

<h2>Until Dawn</h2>
<p>A fresh trailer for the PS5 version of Until Dawn, which (whisper it) looks more or less identical to how I remember the original looking, to be honest. Still, it's nice to be able to play this on modern consoles, and it's getting a bonus PC release too. Both versions are coming this <strong>autumn</strong>.</p>

<h2>Path of Exile 2</h2>
<p>Another look at Grinding Gear Games' take on Diablo, Path of Exile 2 is a moody, top-down action RPG. Over the course of two minutes, we get a whistlestop tour of some of its major classes, as well as a look at the truck ton of magical spells you'll be employing to rid its dungeons of various nasties. The big news from this latest trailer, though, is that the console version will be adding couch co-op, as well as crossplay and cross-progression. It will also get an early access launch across all platforms (PS5 included) in <strong>late 2024</strong>. </p>

<p>Ahead of Konami's own Silent Hill Transmission showcase, we got another trailer for the Silent Hill 2 remake, and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-releases-on-ps5-and-pc-this-october">release date</a>. It's coming on <strong>October 8th 2024</strong>.</p>

<h2>Monster Hunter Wilds</h2>
<p>After its initial teaser reveal last December, we got another big chunky look at Capcom's Monster Hunter Wilds next. Lots of big, mean, new beasties here, including a shaggy dog lion lad who also happens to reside inside a giant, electrified sandstorm. What a delight. Some fan favourite monsters also make an appearance here, too, and we get a proper look at Wilds' mounted combat as well. Lots to enjoy here for long-time Monster Hunter fans. All I need now is to set eyes on my trusty dual blades and we'll be golden. It's coming in <strong>2025</strong>. </p>

<h2>Astro Bot</h2>
<p>Now that's how you end a showcase. It's been a hot minute since we last saw a game from Team Asobi, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-announces-new-astrobot-game">Astro Bot is finally back</a> and reporting for delightful, harebrained duty. Part 3D platformer, part on-rails space shooter, and part celebration of all things PlayStation, this 'super-sized' Astro Bot adventure will see you traverse over 80 dazzling worlds that all look to have their own unique hooks and special powers to enjoy. My personal favourite? That big, giant sponge bob. I mean, boy. Err, bot. In any case, Astro Bot looks absolutely delightful, and I can't wait to play it when it launches on PS5 on <strong>September 6th 2024</strong>.</p>

Konami’s <em>Silent Hill </em>presentation expanded on his patheticness featuring extended scenes of James fighting more monsters and interacting with the other people lost in the town. However, developer Team Bloober seemingly realized the value of the tease, exercising restraint in not including any glimpses of the big daddy himself: Pyramid Head. You can watch the full <em>Silent Hill </em>Transmission presentation, which also features a short vignette on the <em>Silent Hill 2</em> movie, below.</p><p>The remake was first announced in 2022 as part of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/19/23412671/silent-hill-2-remake-f-townfall-konami-bloober-team">a big drop of <em>Silent Hill </em>news</a> that included multiple spinoffs and a new live-action movie (which is also based on <em>Silent Hill 2</em>). The updated version of the game, which originally launched on the PSone in 2001, is being developed by Polish studio Bloober Team, which is best known for horror games <em>Layers of Fear</em> and <em>The Medium</em>. </p><p>At the beginning of the year, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/31/24057338/silent-hill-2-trailer-short-message-state-of-play">Konami put out a trailer detailing the combat of <em>Silent Hill 2</em></a>, while also surprise launching a short, free spinoff called <em>The Short Message</em>. Interestingly, though today’s two events confirmed the game’s October 8th release date, only Konami’s featured the confirmation that <em>Silent Hill 2</em> will come day and date to PC. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It feels like the project has been close to release for some time now, and yet info has been hard to come by, to the point even <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-bloober-trash-konami-edited-trailer-does-not-reflect-spirit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remake developer Bloober Team has seemed frustrated by the situation</a>. Well, thankfully, today during Sony’s latest <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">State of Play</a> showcase, we got a fresh peek at the new Silent Hill 2, and more importantly, a spooky October release date. You can check out the trailer for yourself, below.</p>
<p><iframe title="SILENT HILL 2 | Release Date Trailer  (4K:EN/ESRB) | KONAMI" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GiLbQVne110?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Following the State of Play, Konami held its own Silent Hill Transmission showcase, during which they shared a meaty 13-minute-plus chunk of the new SH2 in action. I have a feeling the footage may be divisive, as it’s not up to the visual standards of, say, recent Resident Evil games, and there do seem to be some performance issues. That said, the tension is definitely laid on thick, the tone is right, and I’ll admit, the footage made me jump a few times. The Transmission can be found below and has been queued up to the beginning of the Silent Hill 2 footage. Stick around after the SH2 gameplay for a sneak peak at the Return to Silent Hill movie, which looks to be sticking pretty closely to the source material and coming together fairly well.</p>

<p><a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10005529" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pre-orders for the Silent Hill 2 remake are now open</a>, with those who put their money down getting a Mira the Dog mask (PS5 owners also get a second Robbie the Rabbit mask). There will also be an $80 Deluxe Edition, which includes a digital artbook, soundtrack, Pyramid Head mask, and 48 hours early access if you pre-order.</p>
<p>The Silent Hill 2 remake emerges from the fog on PC and PS5 on October 8. What do you think? It’s been a long time coming, but does it seem like the new Silent Hill 2 has shaped up well?</p>

There are big monsters, too, such as the fanged Doshaguma and the Chatacabra...a creature with a huge tongue and ridiculous saliva. Previously, Capcom has revealed Rathalos, which is one of the franchise's main recurring monsters. </p><p>Monter Hunter Wilds has players join a Research Commission team investigating a place called the Forbidden Lands, where they encounter new companions and a mysterious child integral to the plot somehow.

As <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/01/31/an-enhanced-version-of-until-dawn-comes-to-ps5-and-pc-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">previously confirmed</a> when the project was announced, the UK studio Ballistic Moon is tasked with porting Until Dawn to PC and PS5. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Powered by Unreal Engine 5, Until Dawn's remaster will include improved animations and detail in environments to enhance what was already a cinematic horror experience when it was initially released on PS4. </p><p>An enhanced version of Until Dawn has been coming for a long time. Though its initial release was met with critical acclaim, replaying Until Dawn can be hard for most due to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2015-vs-until-dawn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">its framerate issues</a>. The framerate would reach as low as 20 frames per second (FPS) or as high as 40FPS, depending on what was displayed onscreen, due Supermassive not capping the framerate to 30FPS. </p><p>Although Supermassive Games is best known these days as a horror studio that specializes in narrative-focused, choose-your-own-adventure horror games, most notably The Dark Pictures Anthology series, Until Dawn became a massive hit for the studio and helped make the developer becoming a household name for horror game fanatics. </p><p>Since Until Dawn's release, Supermassive has released two spin-off games: <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/until-dawn-rush-of-blood#:~:text=Summary,paced%2C%20arcade%2Dstyle%20shooter.">Until Dawn: Rush of Blood</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-inpatient">The Inpatient</a>, both released exclusively on the PlayStation VR in 2016 and 2017, respectively. Additionally, it was announced last January that Until Dawn would be <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/until-dawn-movie-in-development">getting a film adaptation</a> directed by David F. Sandberg, whose previous directing credits include Lights Out, Annabelle: Creation, and the DCU Shazam! films.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/24/until-dawn-review">our review of Until Dawn</a>, IGN wrote: "Until Dawn is a flawed but fun experience. Though an unfocused story means it falls short of greatness, it's an otherwise entertaining homage to the curious traditions of horror movies, which pays off your in-game decisions with occasionally shocking consequences."</p><p><em>Taylor is a Reporter at IGN.

            <title><![CDATA[Wuthering Waves Review In Progress]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/wuthering-waves-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wuthering-waves-review-in-progress.885888/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/wuthering-waves-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Right from the start, Wuthering Waves’ odd mix of swords, guns, and spirits caught my eye, somehow combining disparate ideas into a combat spectacle. This story-driven gacha RPG will have you spinning like a ballerina to dodge attacks before passing the baton to a teammate that slams the enemy with a fish-like dragon. I still have a lot left to play, including digging into its endgame, but so far these flashy abilities have only deepened my appreciation for its Devil May Cry-style combat and parkour-like movement that enables exploration – unfortunately, it's also failed to impress in a few other key areas, including a lackluster story that tempts me to use the skip button.</p><p>Wuthering Waves is all about action, whether that’s through combat or exploration. Every character you unlock has an element and weapon associated with them, as well as individual skills that you can level up. However, how you use those characters isn’t quite a copy-paste of similar mobile action-RPGs like <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/genshin-impact-review">Genshin Impact</a>. That’s thanks in part to the intro and outro skills that can be used when you swap between them, which activate cool special attacks like triggering a fire-infused shootout.  You’ll need to charge up a gauge by dishing out damage or successfully dodging and parrying enemy attacks in order to use them, but these skills add an extra layer of strategy to how you build your three-person party and when exactly to change teammates. </p><p>Characters also have unique combos you can activate during combat, all of which you can practice in dedicated tutorials for each one. To use them, you might need to press the same button four times, press and hold a button after performing a different attack, or jump in the air for an aerial attack before activating an alternate combo. It can take a bit to memorize those inputs, but doing so for your favorite fighters makes using them even more satisfying. It’s nice that Wuthering Waves encourages you to try them all out at least once, too, even offering some small rewards for your trouble. </p><p>Rather than using traditional equipment like helmets and gloves, you strengthen your characters with Echoes: animal-like companions you can equip to increase their attack, elemental damage, and so on. The buffs depend on how many of the same type you equip at once, a limit that increases as you level up. The best part about Echoes is how they tie in with the environment. As you fight enemies and bosses, they will sometimes leave behind ghost-like shells of themselves for you to absorb and convert into Echoes. I felt more compelled to explore because finding different types of monsters could mean getting access to Echoes with new effects. Not only does this system reward me with interesting gear for my characters, it encourages me to fill out my map as I go. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Echoes reward you with interesting gear and also encourage exploration.</p></div><p>However, I do worry that this structure could eventually get repetitive once I hit the late-game, when I’ve already explored everything there is to see. So far everything has stayed satisfying while it’s all still shiny and new, but I’ve only played around 15 hours of Wuthering Waves as of this review and have lots more to go. On the bright side, capturing Echoes also gets you points in a collection tracking guidebook as well as a battle pass full of rewards, so there are reasons to hunt them beyond just upping your stats. Gotta catch ‘em all!</p><p>One part that has already fallen flat, however, is the story. Developer Kuro Games has openly spoken about how it had to revamp the entire story ahead of launch, and it pains me to say it that the version we ultimately got still falls short, with uneven pacing and too much exposition. The beginning is full of unnatural, lengthy conversations that use cryptic terminology you need to look up in encyclopedias and loading screens to actually understand</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Your protagonist seemingly appears out of nowhere, and from there the story revolves around the secret of their past – but that setup feels confusing and undeserved because of all the history and jargon being thrown at you without any explanation as to how all of it connects. The few side quests I’ve completed haven’t done much to endear me to the other characters or the setting, either. Small things, like the very few moments when your hero suddenly speaks despite otherwise being largely silent, also seem jarring. At some points, I even preferred to mash buttons to quickly skip through a tedious conversation or leave a scene on autoplay so I could just listen without reading all that text.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The story missions don't have me perched on the edge of my seat.&nbsp;</p></div><p>I just started Huanglong Chapter 1: Act 5, the fifth of six total acts, so I’m almost done with the main story that’s currently available. However, I’m also only rank 22 when the cap is 80, so I’m not quite at the endgame yet. At this point, I’m more compelled to play through the story missions out of curiosity to see if they will somehow improve overall, not because I’m perched on the edge of my seat waiting for some big reveal. </p><p>The rewards for climbing the ranks have also encouraged me to dig deeper on their own. Gacha games have fail-safes called “pity systems” to make sure players eventually get a high-quality reward for their randomized banner pulls, the system where you can trade in-game currency for characters and weapons. For what it’s worth, Wuthering Waves has been more generous with its pity system than many other games in this genre, only taking 80 gacha pulls to get to a guaranteed 5-star character or item versus the 90+ pulls I’m used to seeing. It also offers tons of resources during the initial honeymoon phase, handing out dozens of pulls for whenever you climb 10 or so ranks, along with other systems that make them particularly easy to earn at the beginning. </p><div data-cy="carousel"><p><h3>Jess's Best RPGs</h3></p></div><p>You’re guaranteed to get at least one random 5-star character early on, plus another of your choice. And on top of that, Wuthering Waves handed out a free pass around launch that was good for <em>another </em>5-star character, which means you can get at least two top-tier characters within the first few hours of playing and a third if you stick around for a couple more. You’re still at the luck of the draw beyond that, but it feels generous out of the gate, especially for any gacha game fans burnt out on bad pulls elsewhere.</p><p>So far, the dynamic combat means I’m enjoying Wuthering Waves a lot, even if it’s not the story that’s pulling me forward. I still have to beat the campaign and dig into the endgame before I can put a final score on it, and we’ll have to see if its hunt for Echoes holds up once I’ve explored the whole map – but right now I can’t wait to play more.  </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gematsu.com/2024/05/concord-launches-august-23<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Concord</em> is a five-versus-five character-driven, first-person multiplayer <a title="Genres > Shooter [3,778 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/shooter">shooter</a> set in the Concord galaxy.</p><p>We built <em>Concord</em> as a love-letter to aspirational sci-fi <a title="Genres > Adventure [1,501 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a>, inspired by our favorite art, anime, films, and TV series. Combined with our deep love of multiplayer, we’re dedicated to creating those had-to-be-there, down to the wire moments with your friends and creating a sense of adventure as you discover more about the galaxy, the characters you play as, and the worlds you visit every time you log on.</p><p><strong>Freegunners: They’re Not Heroes, They’re Professionals</strong></p><p>In <em>Concord</em>, you play as the crew of the Northstar—a group of guns-for-hire known in our galaxy as Freegunners. The Freegunners roam the stars taking high-stakes jobs on worlds across Wild space, where they face other fiercely competitive Freegunner crews. From match-to-match, you’ll form your team of Freegunners with other players and battle it out with rival crews to take home the reward across a variety of maps and modes.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Freegunner Code: Crew First, Job Second</strong></p><p>From the very beginning, we wanted to make a tight, well-balanced first-person shooter that feels great to play from the moment you pick up the controller. </p><p>While our core gunplay will feel familiar to shooter fans, the versatility and variety of each Freegunner and their abilities makes it so aim and thumbskill alone aren’t always enough to come out on top. Each Freegunner’s abilities are designed to make it so that players of a wide range of skill levels and play styles can be effective—even those that are new to the genre—while providing additional challenge and depth for those looking for high-stakes, high-sweat competitive play.</p><p>From powerful mystics and towering robots to skilled gunslingers and snipers, we want each Freegunner’s personality and gameplay abilities to come alive in every element of how they play and the strategic considerations they create. Some Freegunners’ abilities are made for in-the-moment tactics, including casting walls of fire, throwing exploding knives, or lobbing trash bombs. Others can have an enduring impact on a match, like deployable walls that can block entire lanes, explosive traps, bullet-blocking domes, speed-granting spores, and more that persist across rounds and respawns. </p><p>Inspired by some our favorite fighting and <a title="Genres > Strategy [173 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/strategy">strategy games</a>, all of these abilities and mechanics come together to create a unique asymmetry to the characters and opportunities for improvisation that make every fight and every match-up a chance for something different and unexpected to happen.</p><p>Alongside getting to know the crew of the Northstar through gameplay, you’ll also have an opportunity to see their stories unfold through cinematic vignettes that will premiere in-game, starting weekly from launch. These brief cinematic vignettes will feature ongoing narrative arcs that grow the characters’ stories, relationships, and unpack the broader Concord galaxy and life as a Freegunner. </p><p><strong>An Evolving Universe</strong></p><p>The Concord galaxy is full of danger and adventure, and we’ll be unwrapping more in the coming weeks and months.  At launch, <em>Concord</em> will have a roster of 16 distinct Freegunners to learn and master, and the Northstar crew will grow over time through regular, free post-launch updates that introduce new playable Freegunners, maps, modes, cinematic vignettes, and more.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The remake features updated graphics and sound. Environments from the town of Silent Hill have been expanded in the remake to give players more room to explore. Another notable change is the new over-the-shoulder camera, which replaces the fixed-view from the original.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/state-of-play/2024/05/30/open-world-dress-up-game-infinity-nikki-gets-a-delightful-gameplay-trailer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>If you haven’t followed Infinity Nikki, it’s equal parts charming, beautiful, and ambitious. The open-world game is the latest entry in the Nikki series of fashion games, which is very popular in Asia, and Westerners are getting their biggest exposure to it yet with this charming adventure.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d0oiJJRZF4I" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>The game unfolds on the magical continent of Miraland, and Nikki must save it. Her main power is "styling," which involves changing clothes from different nations, allowing her to adopt unique abilities. For example, one outfit allows her to float while another cleanses corrupted creatures of demonic energy. The trailer shows one outfit that lets players summon a giant flower to glide through the air. Another ability shrinks her to the size of her small companion, Momo, to access tight areas and other locations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The more outfits you collect, the more abilities Nikki has to solve puzzles and overcome platforming obstacles. But despite the "save the world" premise, Infinity Nikki is billed as a relaxing adventure. You can also catch bugs, go fishing, and gather resources to craft new outfits, among other activities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Infinity Nikki looks wild, and fans can get their first taste of it in a beta test happening during Q3 of this year. The game is coming to PC and PlayStation 5.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-releases-on-ps5-and-pc-this-october<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
At this evening's State of Play, we got another look at Bloober's upcoming Silent Hill 2 remake. 
</p>
<p>
Perhaps learning from its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bloobers-silent-hill-2-remake-gets-fresh-airing-in-combat-focused-trailer">previous combat-focused tease</a>, the Silent Hill 2 Remake team went down the more atmospheric route for this trailer. Gone were the parkouring nurses from yore, and in its place we got crumbling gravestones, creaking floorboards and plenty of fog. After all, this is Silent Hill! 
</p>
<p>
The trailer gave us all a closer look at James, the game's protagonist. He is trying to get to Silent Hill, having received a letter from his deceased wife. "James heads to where they shared so many memories, in the hope of seeing her one more time," the trailer description reads. You can check it out below.

<p>
In addition to setting the tone, we also got a release date for the upcoming remake. Silent Hill 2 is set to launch on 8th October, across <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP0101-PPSA08709_00-MAINGAME00000000">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2124490/SILENT_HILL_2/">PC via Steam</a>. It is available to pre-order now. 
</p>
<p>Following on from Sony's State of Play, we got a further look at Silent Hill 2's remake during the Silent Hill Transmission broadcast. Here, we got a much better idea of the gameplay, with James investigating the titular setting. </p>
<p>It is all suitably ominous, as you can see in the video below.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/concord-shows-guardians-of-the-galaxy-style-cast-first-slick-gameplay-ahead-of-august-launch.885834/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/concord-first-trailer-gameplay-release-date/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>While we’ve known about the existence of <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/concord/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Concord</a> for over a year now, Sony’s new PvP multiplayer shooter has remained quite mysterious. The game is the work of <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-acquires-firewalk-studios-destiny-vets-live-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Firewalk Studios</a>, a new startup headed up by a team of Destiny vets, and teasers have hinted at a colorful, character-driven approach to the genre. Beyond that, details have been scant.</p>
<p>Well, today during Sony’s latest <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">State of Play</a> showcase, we finally got a real look at Concord and learned the game will be coming our way in August. The game is a Overwatch-style 5v5 arena hero shooter, featuring a cast of “Freegunners,” very clearly inspired by Guardians of the Galaxy. Overall, gameplay looks polished, with visuals well beyond most multiplayer shooters (certainly far beyond what Overwatch is doing these days). Interestingly, Sony also hints that story elements and missions will be woven directly into the game, rather than just on the side. You can check out the first cinematic trailer for Concord for yourself, below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Concord - Reveal Cinematic Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mBnStS9d2xg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>And here’s a meaty look at actual Concord gameplay…</p>
<p><iframe title="Concord - Gameplay Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7jqQJhjf_3o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The new Concord cinematic trailer and gameplay mostly focus on a single Freegunner squad of five, including the sniper Vale, gunslinger Lennox, fire mage Haymar, tank Star Child, and wacky robot 1-Off. Of course, this being a 5v5 game, there's got to be more than five characters, with Sony confirming there will be a full cast of 16 playable characters at launch...</p>
<p><em>"In Concord, you play as the crew of the Northstar—a group of guns-for-hire known in our galaxy as Freegunners.&nbsp; The Freegunners roam the stars taking high-stakes jobs on worlds across Wild space, where they face other fiercely competitive Freegunner crews. From match-to-match, you’ll form your team of Freegunners with other players and battle it out with rival crews to take home the reward across a variety of maps and modes.</em></p>
<p><em>The Concord galaxy is full of danger and adventure, and we’ll be unwrapping more in the future.&nbsp; At launch, Concord will have a roster of 16 distinct Freegunners to learn and master, and the Northstar crew will grow over time through regular, free post-launch updates that introduce new playable Freegunners, maps, modes, cinematic vignettes, and more."</em></p>
<p>Concord is slated to launch on PC and PS5 on August 23. What do you think? Does Sony’s latest venture into the realm of live service games look promising?</p>

It’s definitely giving some witty banter, sci-fi, Marvel-esque vibes to my ears and eyes. <em>Concord </em>comes out on August 23, 2024.<br></p><hr><h2 id="h15701"><a id=""></a><em>God of War Ragnarok </em>comes to PC on September 19, 2024<br></h2><p><em>God of War Ragnarok</em> is coming to PC! I’m sure you already suspected that, but we got a look at daddy Kratos smashing up baddies with some previews of its PC features, such as ultrawide support and all the major super sampling tech, and it comes with the game’s great <em>Valhalla </em>DLC too! Kratos’ latest adventure arrives on PC on September 19, 2024.<br></p><hr><h2 id="h15702"><a id=""></a><em>Dynasty Warriors Origins</em><br></h2><p>With epic melee weapon skirmishes against massive amounts of foes, <em>Dynasty Warriors Origins</em> looks like it’s going all in on totally unrealistic yet fully badass combat.<br></p><hr><h2 id="h15703"><a id=""></a><em>Infinity Nikki</em><br></h2><p>Are you ready to walk the path of a stylist? That’s what <em>Infinity Nikki </em>promises, with cute outfits, fantasy vistas, platforming, and the ability to shoot little cats out of cannons! <br></p><hr><h2 id="h15704"><a id=""></a><em>Ballad of Antara</em><br></h2><p>With moody color themes, epic dark fantasy vibes, and some very satisfying melee weapon sound effects, <em>Ballad of Antara</em> is definitely worth keeping an eye on if you’re into brawls against mythic creatures in a magical realm. <em>Ballad of Antara</em> is expected to arrive in 2025.<br></p><hr><h2 id="h15705"><a id=""></a><em>Skydance’s Behemoth</em><br></h2><p>Hey, remember the PS VR2? Sorry, but hey, it’s nice to see some new games coming out for Sony’s somewhat struggling headset. With both first-person sword battles and some neat mechanics with a rope weapon you can use to pull enemies and weapons around, this could prove to be a very satisfying VR experience.<br></p><hr><h2 id="h15706"><a id=""></a><em>Alien Rogue Incursion</em><br></h2><p><em>Alien Rogue Incursion</em> aims to bring its HR Giger-inspired horror vibes to a PlayStation VR headset near you...you know, if you feel you won’t die of absolute fraking terror.<br></p><hr><h2 id="h15707"><a id=""></a><em>Marvel Rivals</em><br></h2><p>It’s like third-person <em>Overwatch</em> but you know, with a Marvel license or something! Joking aside, <em>Rivals </em>may set itself apart with its third-person action and good use of its source material.<br></p><hr><h2 id="h15708"><a id=""></a><em>Where Winds Meet</em><br></h2><p>With a trailer focusing on some tense and speedy-lookin’ one-on-one showdowns, <em>Where Winds Meet </em>is currently in development for PS5.<br></p><hr><h2 id="h15709"><a id=""></a><em>Until Dawn</em><br></h2><p>Supermassive’s 2015 interactive teen horror movie is being rebuilt and upgraded for current hardware.&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn</em>’s PS5 and PC trailer at this month’s State of Play wasn’t short on gruesome contraptions and hellish ways to see its characters murdered.<br></p><hr><h2 id="h15710"><a id=""></a><em>Path of Exile 2</em><br></h2><p>Grinding Gear Games’ <em>Path of Exile 2</em> is set to arrive on PS5 in 2024. Cast into a dark fantasy world tortured by monsters and disease, players will have to take on the role of fearless warriors seeking victory and, of course, better and better loot. Keep this one on your radar if <em>Diablo 4</em> hasn’t been doing it for you. <em>Path of Exile</em> <em>2</em> arrives on PS5 via Early Access in late 2024.<br></p><hr><h2 id="h15711"><a id=""></a><em>Silent Hill 2</em><br></h2><p>Today we got a closer look at the upcoming remake of horror classic <em>Silent Hill 2</em>. Complete with a very <em>Resident Evil 4</em>-inspired camera set up and gruesome beasts, time will tell if this remake lives up to the hype when it launches on October 8, 2024.<br></p><hr><h2 id="h15712"><a id=""></a><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em><br></h2><p>We finally got a real look at the next entry in the beloved <em>Monster Hunter</em> franchise. Yes, there are cute Palicos as well as menacing beasts. Tonight’s trailer showed off some of the game’s world too, which sports sandstorms and plenty of open space to engage in battle with creatures while riding aboard your bird mount. The game is expected to arrive in 2025.<br></p><hr><h2 id="h15713"><a id=""></a><em>Astro Bot</em><br></h2><p>Hope you weren’t tired of our pal Astro! Looking far more ambitious and elaborate than the delightful PS5 pack-in game <em>Astro’s</em>&nbsp;<em>Playroom</em> and absolutely packed with cameos from throughout PlayStation history to trigger your brand nostalgia, this definitely looks like it’ll rise above the status of novelty to be something rather interesting. <em>Astro Bot </em>arrives on September 6.<br></p><hr><p>And that wraps everything we saw at tonight’s State of Play. It was a short but sweet showing of some neat-looking games coming to the PS5.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The trailer aired during today's PlayStation State of Play as the game is coming to PS VR2, but it's also coming to Meta Quest 3 and Steam (for other PC VR devices) this holiday season. In the trailer, we get a few glimpses of some Xenomorphs, the tracking device we'll be using to avoid said Xenomorphs, and a look at some pods that indicate we might be fighting more than one.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Check it out for yourself in the Alien: Rogue Incursion gameplay trailer below</strong>:&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fnzh9Ll4i7A" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>In a new <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/05/30/first-look-at-alien-rogue-incursion-ps-vr2-gameplay-out-holiday-2024/">PlayStation Blog post</a>, Survios chief product officer TQ Jefferson explains that Alien: Rogue Incursion was developed from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5. Jefferson also shares that the "high tension shooter" tasks players with exploring an "overrun facility on the inhospitable planet Purdan."&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Dynamically spawning and pathing with countless unique possibilities, even we couldn't tell you exactly where and when each Xenomorph will strike, let alone what strategies it might use or if it'll bring some friends," the blog post reads. "While heart-pounding combat is the core of Alien: Rogue Incursion, grabbing your pulse rifle and blasting your way out of every situation is not always the best strategy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Constantly hunted by unpredictable and resourceful Xenomorphs, players will often find creativity and a level head to be their greatest weapons, especially when it comes to leveraging the environment to their advantage."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Alien: Rogue Incursion hits VR this holiday season.&nbsp;</p>

We received a new trailer for the beloved game alongside the announcement during today's State of Play presentation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Until Dawn puts you in control of eight teenagers/young adults who venture up a mountain for a fun night in a secluded cabin. In typical slasher-movie fashion, there is much more than meets the eye regarding this cabin and its surrounding area. Relying heavily on player choice, Until Dawn's narrative uses a system called the Butterfly Effect, where pivotal choices you make have consequences that go far beyond that which you can immediately recognize. The game stars actors like Rami Malek, Hayden Panettiere, Meaghan Martin, and more.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ownf9ZasITA" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Originally announced as a full remake of the game, the trailer footage does not appear to be a significant step up in terms of visuals, appearing to be more in line with the industry's definition of a remaster. PlayStation's official description says it's been "rebuilt and enhanced for PS5 consoles and PC." Developed by Ballistic Moon, this improved version also boasts new environments, collectibles, and re-cut narrative sequences.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We loved Until Dawn when it arrived on PlayStation 4 in 2015, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/games/until_dawn/b/playstation4/archive/2015/08/24/until-dawn-review-game-informer-playstation-4.aspx">awarding it a score of 9 out of 10</a>. In the time since Until Dawn's original release, Supermassive has released other games in the genre, including The Dark Pictures Anthology and The Quarry. The studio is currently working on The Casting of Frank Stone, a game set in the Dead by Daylight universe. Until Dawn arrives on PlayStation 5 and PC this fall.</p>

<p>The games have an unusual identity&nbsp;and are, in some ways, a genre unto themselves. They almost always feature large-scale battles in which the lead character can sweep through dozens of enemy combatants with a single swing.</p>

<p>That playstyle appears to remain intact if this new trailer is to be believed.</p>

<p>A lot has changed in action gameplay in the years since Dynasty Warriors was at its most popular, but there’s no doubt that the series once had an enthusiastic fanbase.</p>

<p>We’ll see if the series is able to update its gameplay and draw in new fans when it hits PlayStation 5 next year.</p>

		<p>The full game sequel to Astro’s Playroom, Astro Bot is coming out on 6th September 2024 for PS5, with a huge number of world to explore and nods to popular PlayStation games and franchises.</p>
<p><iframe title="ASTRO BOT - Announcement Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wHMNQzLG_Jg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>More than 50 worlds will feature in Astro Bot, and just as with Astro’s Playroom – the game bundled with every PS5 – there will be plenty of gameplay variety. We saw flying sequences, sponge abilities, space battles, punching and grappling and more, in addition to returning abilities from Playroom.</p>
<p>There’s also plenty of new PlayStation game references, such as Journey, Parappa the Rapper, Kratos and others.</p>
<p>It looks like a lot of fun, and we can’t wait.</p>

<p>Astro’s Playroom was a simple bundle of joy for pretty much every PS5 owner. “Astro cements himself as the PlayStation 5’s mascot,” <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/08/astros-playroom-review-the-first-game-you-should-play-on-playstation-5/">I said in 2020</a>, “with a celebration of all things PlayStation that also showcases the full potential of the immersive new DualSense controller. Astro’s Playroom is the first thing you should play on PlayStation 5.”</p>

		<p>Alien: Rogue Incursion was&nbsp; announced for PSVR 2, Meta Quest 3 and Steam VR earlier this year and we now have the first gameplay reveal and a release window of holiday 2024.</p>
<p><iframe title="Alien Rogue Incursion - First Gameplay | PS VR 2 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fnzh9Ll4i7A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Alien game project has been in development for the last two years at VR specialists Survios. The company burst on the scene with the dawn of VR with Raw Data in 2016, before bringing the rapid releases of Sprint Vector, Electonauts and Creed: Rise to Glory through 2018.</p>
<p>“As reverent fans of the franchise, we know that any Alien video game begins and ends with its deadly Xenomorphs, and those encountered within Alien: Rogue Incursion are definitely ferocious, unpredictable, and terrifying,” explains &nbsp;TQ Jefferson from Survios.</p>
<p>“Dynamically spawning and pathing with countless unique possibilities, even we couldn’t tell you exactly where and when each Xenomorph will strike, let alone what strategies it might use or if it’ll bring some friends.&nbsp;&nbsp;While heart-pounding combat is the core of Alien: Rogue Incursion, grabbing your pulse rifle and blasting your way out of every situation is not always the best strategy. Constantly hunted by unpredictable and resourceful Xenomorphs, players will often find creativity and a level head to be their greatest weapons, especially when it comes to leveraging the environment to their advantage. “</p>

<p>There’s a rich pedigree for Survios and VR, in other words, but really the main reason why people will be excited for Alien: Rogue Incursion is because of 2014 game Alien: Isolation. The celebrated horror game was once shown as being playable in VR prior to release, and fans have long wanted to see a VR version of the game released – hopes that will sadly never be realised at this point. Hopefully Rogue Incursion can be the VR horror surrogate that we need.</p>
<p>“Our team at Survios are huge fans of Alien and have been building Alien: Rogue Incursion for a long time, honing our ability to pair the most technically advanced, immersive, and engaging VR experiences with best-in-class franchises,” says TQ Jefferson, Chief Product Officer at Survios. “This fully original story embraces all our favorite elements from 45 years of Alien, from kinetic action and heart-pounding exploration to our terrifyingly resourceful Xenomorphs that will truly make your skin crawl. We can’t wait for fans to get their hands on it this holiday season.”</p>

		<p>Sony’s State of Play broadcast has previewed the heavily anticipated <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/silent-hill-2/">Silent Hill 2</a> remake. The new trailer shows more of the town of Silent Hill, more of the enemies and a smattering of combat, all of which looks rather like the recent Resident Evil remakes. Silent Hill 2 set to release on October 8th.</p>

<p><em>“Having received a letter from his deceased wife, James heads to where they shared so many memories, in the hope of seeing her one more time: Silent Hill. There, by the lake, he finds a woman eerily similar to her… “My name… is Maria,” the woman smiles. Her face, her voice… She’s just like her.”</em></p>
<p>A second extended gameplay trailer was released by Konami an hour later as part of their Silent Hill broadcast., at the time of writing it has not been published by itself but you can watch it at the start of the broadcast below.</p>

<p>In development by Bloober Team, Silent Hill 2 is a big step up for the studio, but one that absolutely makes sense. They’re best known for their work on psychological horror games like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/06/15/layers-of-fear-review-2/">Layers of Fear</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/19/observer-system-redux-review-ps5-series-x/">Observer</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/01/27/the-medium-review-xbox-series-x-pc/">The Medium</a>. That experience will be vital when updating a game made and designed for the limitations of the PlayStation 2 hardware in 2001.</p>

<p>In terms of the core gameplay, Silent Hill 2 will most noticeably be transformed by a shift away from fixed cameras and tank controls to over-the-shoulder and a more modern control scheme, similar to the treatment that Capcom gave to their Resident Evil remakes.</p>
<p>Of course, there’s also a massive leap forward graphically, with Bloober Team tapping into Unreal Engine 5 and all the cutting edge technology that this features like Lumen for realistic lighting effects and Nanite for exceptionally detailed 3D modelling and texturing.</p>
<p>It had been a while since Silent Hill 2 was first <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/10/20/silent-hill-2-remake-is-using-unreal-engine-5-with-lumen-and-nanite-graphics/">announced back in 2022</a> – of course, it had been heavily rumoured for a good long time before then – but true to their word, it seems that development had been progressing smoothly in the time since then. Sadly there’s no sign of a release date just yet, but this latest look at the game will certainly have horror fans champing at the bit!</p>

		<p>Sony shared a first look at the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/until-dawn">Until Dawn</a> remake coming to for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a> and PC, confirming that the game is still set to release in late 2024.</p>
<p><iframe title="Until Dawn - Gameplay Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ownf9ZasITA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Until Dawn is getting the full remake treatment by Ballistic Moon, taking the PS3 cult classic horror game and completely remaking it in Unreal Engine 5, as opposed to the Decima engine of the original.</p>
<p>There will be some updates to both gameplay and narrative, most notably shifting to a third person camera, instead of fixed camera angles, and trying to be more nuanced and emotional with the story. Hopefully it’s still got some of the original’s schlocky teen horror vibes, and this trailer does seem to show it echoing many of the old locations and scenes.</p>
<p>Originally released in 2015, Until Dawn really put Supermassive Games on the map as a horror game developer, and saw them then delve deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole of more and more narrative horror through The Dark Pictures Anthology series, The Quarry and more.</p>

<p>In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/08/24/until-dawn-review/">original review of Until Dawn</a> in 2015, Jim said, “With its immersive world, branching narrative, and lifelike character work, Until Dawn will have players on the edge of their seats while pounding them with jump scares and a bone-chilling soundtrack. Having previously worked on ports and smaller titles for Sony, Supermassive Games have shown that they can play with the big boys and we can’t wait to see what they come up with next.”</p>
