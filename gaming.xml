It'll arrive sometime in 2025.</p><p>It was the big announcement to close out the State of Play, and one of the biggest surprises. Developer Sucker Punch showed off a significant look at footage too, including some gorgeous cinematics. And if you couldn't glean from the title, it'll focus on a different setting and a brand-new protagonist, Atsu, moving away from Ghost of Tsushima's Jin Sakai. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Sucker Puncher didn't reveal too much during the presentation, but we got a little more insight thanks to a PlayStation <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/24/ghost-of-yotei-is-coming-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a> shortly after. It'll take place in 1603, 300 years after the events of Ghost of Tsushima, in the lands surrounding Mount Yōtei, known as Hokkaido today. Sucker Punch calls it "a far cry from the organized samurai clans who lived in Tsushima, and it’s the setting for an original story we can’t wait to tell."</p><p>According to the post, the developer "wanted to maintain the core pillars established in Ghost of Tsushima: playing as a wandering warrior in Feudal Japan, offering freedom to explore at your own pace, and highlighting the beauty of the world."</p><p>"We also wanted to continue to innovate. To create something fresh but familiar, we looked beyond Jin Sakai’s story and the island of Tsushima, and shifted our focus to the idea of the Ghost instead," the post continues. "At Sucker Punch we love origin stories, and we wanted to explore what it could mean to have a new hero wearing a Ghost mask, and uncovering a new legend. This led us to Ghost of Yōtei: a new protagonist, a new story to unfold, and a new region of Japan to explore."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/24/ghost-of-yotei-3-blogroll-1727219402294.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>A Ghost of Tsushima sequel, Ghost of Yotei, will arrive in 2025. </figcaption></figure></output><p>As "Sucker Punch’s first game built from the ground up for PlayStation 5," it'll also include new mechanics, gameplay improvements, and new weapons. </p><p>Unabashedly inspired by the works of Akira Kurosawa (to the point where the game even included a "Kurosawa Mode") and other samurai films, Ghost of Tsushima followed a samurai on a quest to protect Tsushima Island during the first Mongol invasion of Japan. It released for the PlayStation 4 in July 2020 followed by a multiplayer mode, Ghost of Tsushima: Legends, that October. A Director's Cut was released for PS4 and PS5 in 2021, and a PC port finally arrived last year.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-tsushima-movie-from-john-wick-director-in-development">Ghost of Tsushima movie is also in the works</a> with Sony Pictures and PlayStation Productions, with John Wick director Chad Stahelski set to direct.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-tsushima-review">IGN gave Ghost of Tsushima a 9/10</a> back in 2020, calling it "an absolutely gorgeous adventure through one of history’s most strikingly beautiful landscapes, and that beauty is compounded by one of the best blade-to-blade combat systems the open-world action genre has seen."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Ghost of Yotei Screenshots - State of Play September 2024</h3></div></output><p><em>Alex Stedman is a Senior News Editor with IGN, overseeing entertainment reporting.

But the big news was the reveal of the game's launch date: the Monster Hunter Wilds release date is February 28, 2025, and it'll be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p><p>We recently played a preview build of the game, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-hands-on-preview-exactly-what-i-hoped-for">came away impressed with Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, but you can watch the new trailer below. And further <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/24/monster-hunter-wilds-launches-february-28-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">details on Monster Hunter Wilds</a> were given on PlayStation blog. Arkveld is the flagship monster for this entry and comes from a long-extinct species, and the mystery of its existence is at the heart of the story. In the Forbidden Lands, where Wilds takes place, a research team investigates attacks by a monster they call the "White Wraith" and follow clues from a boy they saved named Nata. Arkveld is a beastly figure with massive chain-like wings it uses to attack.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>From here, you form units within the Hunter's Guild. You as the protagonist belong to the Avis Unit and the characters featured in the trailer - Olivia the hunter, Erik the biologist, and Werner the engineer - belong to the Astrum Unit. And it seems that this is the lens for which you experience Monster Hunters Wilds' story.</p><p>The Scarlet Forest was shown in previous trailers but this latest one gave a closer look at its lucious environments where you'll be fishing, scaling cliffs, and hunting monsters, of course. Using a hookshot-like Slinger can lead to contextual environmental destruction which can be a key part of battles. The Slinger can also whip you around the world as a means of traversal, along with a pet Seikret mount.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Monster Hunter Wilds Screenshots - State of Play September 2024</h3></div></output><p>In case you missed it, be sure to read up on the newly announced remaster of the PS1 classics, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-1-2-remastered-leaked-via-playstation-store-ahead-of-state-of-play-broadcast">Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1 and 2</a>, and the reveal of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-tsushima-2-confirmed-as-ghost-of-yotei-at-state-of-play-releasing-2025">Ghost of Tsushima sequel, titled Ghost of Yotei</a>.

While fans had speculated for months that the company would take Pocketpair to court, speculation largely revolved around the similarities of some of Palworld's monster designs to Pokemon's. The actual lawsuit, however, revolves around patented game mechanics, leaving many puzzled as to how it may actually play out in Japanese courts.</p><p>Palworld launched in early access in January this year on PC and Xbox as a day-one Game Pass title. We <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-review">gave its early access launch an 8/10</a>, saying that it "may crib quite a bit from Pokémon’s homework, but deep survival mechanics and a hilarious attitude make it hard to put down – even in Early Access."</p><p>You can catch up with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-state-of-play-september-2024-announcements">everything announced in today's State of Play right here</a>.</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

<p>If you've been sleeping on the Akira Kurosawa-inspired, <em>Assassin's Creed</em>-esque samurai game <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>, you've been missing out. Given that it recently got a PC release, this is a great time to catch up on it—but now there's even more reason to do so, as Sony just announced a sequel titled <em>Ghost of Yōtei</em>.</p>
<p>Slated for a 2025 release, the game bears similarities to its predecessor. It follows a wandering samurai who rides horses across picturesque, wind-swept fields, befriends animals, and defeats enemies in katana duels.</p>
<p>Whereas <em>Ghost of Tsushima </em>was set on Tsushima Island during the time of the Mongol invasion, <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> is (fittingly) set around the foot of Mount Yōtei, one of Japan's most picturesque locales—the area is called Hokkaido today.</p>
<p>Most fans of the first game expected a new location in <em>Tsushima</em>'s sequel, but they may not have expected the other big change: there appears to be a new protagonist. The woman who appears in the trailers is not Jin Sakai, the main character of <em>Tsushima</em>. This suggests the franchise will move forward with something like an anthology format instead of direct sequels. A <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/24/ghost-of-yotei-is-coming-in-2025/">blog post from Sony</a> says the new character is named Atsu.</p>
<p>The blog post also says that <em>Yōtei</em> takes place in 1603, 300 years after the events of <em>Tsushima</em>.</p>
<p>Developer Sucker Punch hasn't revealed anything about the gameplay, though, beyond what we see in the trailer. So far, what we see looks almost identical to what we've played before. There are surely going to be more announcements to come, though.</p>

                <p>Near the end of December, Keanu Reeves will lend his voice to Shadow the Hedgehog on the big screen in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-trailer-delivers-rapid-fire-antics-with-his-toughest-fight-yet/1100-6526119/" data-ref-id="1100-6526119">Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a>. But as revealed during Sony's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/playstation-state-of-play-september-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-5793/" data-ref-id="2900-5793">State of Play</a>, Reeves will also be voicing Shadow earlier in December as part of a DLC release for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonic-x-shadow-generations-is-coming-october-25-new-trailer-revealed-at-summer-game-fest/1100-6524053/" data-ref-id="1100-6524053">Sonic x Shadow Generations</a>.</p><p>Only a brief clip of the Sonic the Hedgehog 3 Movie Pack DLC was shown during State of Play, but it dropped Reeves' Shadow directly into Tokyo, which is one of the settings in the film.</p><p>While speaking to <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/24/movie-shadow-coming-to-sonic-x-shadow-generations/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PlayStation Blog</a>, Shun Nakamura noted that the Sonic the Hedgehog 3 Movie pack is unconnected to the narrative of Shadow Generations. Instead, he described it as "bonus content," but stressed that Shadow's controls will remain consistent with the main game.</p><p>"The development team also lives in Tokyo, so we tried to develop this setting an enjoyable place as a Sonic game but also clearly showing the Tokyo-likeness," added Nakamura. "We even went out for research to the actual area being used in the game for inspiration. We feel it is very exciting to play as Shadow in a real existing city, so please look forward to it."</p><p>Sonic x Shadow Generations is coming to all consoles and PC on October 25, while the Sonic the Hedgehog 3 Movie Pack will be released on December 12. The DLC will also be available as part of the Sonic x Shadow Generations Digital Deluxe Edition.</p>

			<p>It's no surprise whatsoever that Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered was going to be announced, and as expected, it was announced today during the State of Play. The remaster will be available on PlayStation 5 and PC, with the game launching on 31 October 2024. Those who already own the original PlayStation 4 title will be able to get an upgrade for $9.99.</p>
<p>At the moment, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered isn't listed on the Steam store, despite the release date of the game being so close.</p>
<p><iframe title="Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered - Announce Trailer | PS5 &amp; PC Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kMN-x9goE7M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Compared to The Last of Us remasters, there seems to be more substance to this update. While the main focus is that the graphics have been updated to match Forbidden West, over ten hours of dialogue has been re-recorded. In addition, facial animations have been improved to provide an extra element of realism.</p>
<p>It's not surprising at all that this game was getting a remaster, as just last week, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered was <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-rated-by-esrb-for-ps5-and-pc/">rated by the ESRB</a>, giving away the fact that the game's remaster was going to be released on PC and PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>Horizon's franchise continues to grow, as Horizon is also getting a LEGO game in the near future, where players will get to explore the expansive world, which has been faithfully recreated using LEGO. Much like the remaster, this game will also be available on PC, as well as on Nintendo Switch. Although it hasn't got a release date yet, the game is officially open for pre-order. It's reported that LEGO Horizon Adventures will be released on November 14, but Guerilla Games hasn't yet confirmed the date.</p>
<p>Compared to previous remasters developed for PlayStation, Horizon comes as a general shock to the audience, as it was only released in 2017 and looked pretty good, all things considered. Whether this now means that Horizon Forbidden West will equally get a remaster coming up soon remains to be seen, but it wouldn't be that surprising. The Last of Us received two remasters, with The Last of Us Part 2 also getting its own remaster, despite only being released in 2020. Although technology advances constantly, technology for creating a game like The Last of Us 2 hasn't evolved that much, and it seemed very unnecessary to make a remaster of a game that was still looking brand-new and up to date compared to other IPs that PlayStation fans have been asking for for years now. These IPs include Bloodborne for PC, Demon's Souls for PC, and remakes of games such as Parasite Eve and Dino Crisis (which was added to the <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/ps-plus/games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation Plus catalog </a>for October.)</p>

And boy howdy, it sure does look pretty. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ghost-tsushima-2-yotei-atsu-woman-trailer-release-date-1851656719&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-tsushima-2-yotei-atsu-woman-trailer-release-date-1851656719"><em>Ghost of Yōtei</em></a></span> is the name of the newly revealed sequel and it’s set in a different part of Japan, a few hundred years after the events of the first game, and stars a new character, Atsu. We don’t know much more about the story, but Sucker Punch did make it clear in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/24/ghost-of-yotei-is-coming-in-2025/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/24/ghost-of-yotei-is-coming-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a blog post published after the reveal</a></span> that it “wanted to explore what it could mean to have a new hero wearing a Ghost mask, and uncovering a new legend.” The setting, according to the blog post, is the year 1603, in “the lands surrounding Mount Yōtei” in the region of Japan that today is known as Hokkaido.&nbsp;That’s all we really know about the story and world of this sequel. </p><p>Looking at the new 4K trailer posted by Sony, it really feels like <em>Ghost of Yōtei</em> was designed not only to showcase the power of the PS5, but also to show off the newly announced <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-price-specs-release-date-sony-preorder-1851644442&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-price-specs-release-date-sony-preorder-1851644442">$700 PS5 Pro.</a></span> It’s shocking to me that Sony didn’t include this game in the PS5 Pro announcement, even as a tiny teaser, to show off something totally new and amazing looking, running on the pricey console. </p><p>According to Sucker Punch, this is the first game they’ve built from “the ground up” for PS5. And I expect<em>  Ghost of Yōtei</em> will take full advantage of the PS5 Pro. Here’s what Sucker Punch had to say about working on the PS5. </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>This is also Sucker Punch’s first game built from the ground up for PlayStation 5, and we’re excited to build on the visual foundation we established in Ghost of Tsushima by making the world feel even more real. We have massive sightlines that let you look far across the environment, whole new skies featuring twinkling stars and auroras, even more believable movement from wind on grass and vegetation, and more improvements we’ll share in the future. Our new setting also gives us the opportunity to introduce new mechanics, gameplay improvements, and even new weapons.</p></blockquote><p>And now, let’s look at some pretty screenshots of this gorgeous-looking game, which is set to launch sometime in 2025. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f6313e38fc8232b10c917f39cf4e9d50"

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Lunar Remastered Collection</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The remastered Lunar games are set to hit PlayStation 4 and PS5 in Spring 2025, although Sony didn't share any additional details. You can check out the announcement trailer above.</p><p dir="ltr">The Lunar games were originally released on Sega CD in the 1990s and were notable for quality stories and strong English localization, great classic turn-based RPG action, and anime cutscenes. Since the first game's release in 1993, there have been a bunch of remakes and re-releases; the most notable was Lunar: The Silver Star Story Complete, coming to the US on the original PlayStation in 1999.</p><p dir="ltr">Since then, the Lunar games saw releases on the Nintendo DS and PlayStation Portable, and on mobile devices, but there hasn't been a new US version of Silver Star Story Complete since it hit iOS in 2012, and no new Eternal Blue US version since it released on PlayStation in 2000. That's a long time to wait for a couple of classics of the '90s RPG form to become available again.</p>

The news was shared at tonight's PlayStation State of Play with a glimpse of gameplay from the DLC. Shadow sports a furrier design akin to that of the film and is seen racing through Tokyo as seen in the film's latest trailer.
</p>
<p>
"This title has been developed to satisfy not just the Sonic game fans, but also those who see the Sonic movie and become fans of Sonic and Shadow for the first time," said series producer Shun Nakamura on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/24/movie-shadow-coming-to-sonic-x-shadow-generations/">PlayStation Blog</a>.
</p>
<p>
"But of course, we didn’t expect to have Shadow from the movie included in this game, as the world for the movie and game are different – we thought that it would be challenging to do so.
</p>
<p>
"However, we saw an almost festival-like opportunity where we have the movie and game being launched almost at the same time. We decided to pursue it and have work on movie-related content with development starting last Autumn."
</p>
<p>
The aim is for fans to watch the film and then re-experience it as part of Sonic x Shadow Generations. The DLC won't have a strict story relating directly to the film, but is inspired by the Tokyo setting.
</p>
<p>
As for including Reeves, Nakamura stated: "It was an incredibly secretive process, so when we started to implement the voice in the game, we actually weren't told who this voice is. The voice recording was handled by Iizuka-san in the US, so when we received the recorded voice files, we listened to it and felt, is this that actor…?, so we were also surprised after the official announcement from Paramount!" 
</p>
<p>
The Sonic the Hedgehog 3 Movie Pack is included in the game's digital deluxe edition. The film will be released on 21st December.
