Though Blizzard has released several variations of its annual spooky event, the original Junkenstein’s Revenge was one of the earliest examples of the potential lurking beneath the competitive surface. It has such a good concept: Reinhardt gathering folks around for a spooky story starring alternate versions of <em>Overwatch</em> heroes in a fight to survive the night. The vibes are immaculate, the actual event is a blast to play with friends, and Blizzard has rolled out some reasonably challenging spins on it over the years. Just don’t think about it too hard or you’ll remember this game was supposed to have a PvE story mode. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="619d50318bd259fad9ffeb52e288df5c" data-recommend-id="image://619d50318bd259fad9ffeb52e288df5c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="619d50318bd259fad9ffeb52e288df5c" data-recommend-id="image://619d50318bd259fad9ffeb52e288df5c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Dates: </strong>October 8 through November 5<br></p><p>Halo Infinite is still around and going strong.

<p>Competitive Call of Duty is being kicked off early in Black Ops 6, but it’s not being backed by Activision.</p>



<p>ZooMaa’s ‘The Flank’ has announced a triple-threat of tournaments that’ll take place between October 29 and November 6, and as a collective, they boast a $100,000 prize pool. It’s a CDL AR &amp; SMG spree that boasts 12 teams made up of four players each, and it comes before the 2025 CDL season has even been formally announced.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-into-our-own-hands">Into Our Own Hands</h2>



<p>From the moment Black Ops 6 was released, the more competitive players among us were looking for an angle from which they could earn. Wagers sprung up, $8s started running rampant on social media, and amateur kick-off tournaments were set up far and wide.</p>



<p>This is by far the biggest Black Ops 6 tournament to surface, and it comes mere days after the game was released.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Flank has revealed the following schedule:</p>



<ul>
<li>October 29 – $25,000 tournament</li>



<li>November 1 – $25,000 tournament</li>



<li>November 5/6 – $50,000 tournament</li>
</ul>



<p>On tonight’s episode of The Flank, the teams are being picked live, and the expectation is that it’ll be mostly CDL and Challengers players that make the cut, with a few Warzone competitors sprinkled in as cannon fodder.</p>



<p>It’s an exciting time to be a Call of Duty fan – the off-season and pre-season events hosted by brands like OpTic and The Flank are typically more entertaining than the official CDL events. Don’t tell Activision I said that, though.</p>

                <p>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, one of the most popular and best action games of the year, has just received a nice discount on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Warhammer-40-000-Space-Marine-PlayStation/dp/B0CVSDJNKS?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Warhammer-40-000-Space-Marine-PlayStation/dp/B0CVSDK499?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Series X</a>. Space. Marine 2 released in September with a $70 price point for consoles, $10 more than the PC edition. But now console players can dive into the action for $60, too.

The best defense in the game is a good offense, and as a Primaris Space Marine, there's a gratifying amount of ultra-violence here as you carve a bloody path through the Tyranid hordes. The game looks good, feels consistently fun to play, and it has robust PvP and PvE modes to sample after the end credits have rolled on its meaty campaign.</p><p>"Space Marine 2 is a fantastic sequel that builds on its predecessor in every way, bombarding you with an overwhelming enemy and chaotic action that makes you feel like a small part of a much larger war," Richard Wakeling wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review/1900-6418276/" data-ref-id="1900-6418276">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 review</a>.</p><p>PC gamers aren't being left out in the cold either, as Space Marine 2 continues to be available for a discounted price at GameSpot sister site Fanatical.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-windows-home-experience-is-available-for-xbox-insiders/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Those who are signed up as an Xbox Insider will now have the opportunity to experience the new Windows Home experience in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-cloud-gaming-to-let-you-stream-your-own-games-next-month/">Xbox app</a>. It features a lot of changes and brings forward a new design that shows off the top games on Game Pass and Store tabs, as well as providing you with new games, news, and curated recommendations. For those who may not be able to splurge on new games, it also shows off free-to-play content for those looking for a new experience and game to play but don't want to sink any money into it.</p>
<p>This new experience comes after months of listening to feedback and trying out different designs internally. They have made this new Windows Home experience for Xbox Insiders to test out, hoping to make a faster and easier Xbox app on Windows, allowing those who utilize it to jump between Game Pass and Microsoft Store with ease and without having to flip between tabs constantly.</p>
<p>Walking through the highlights of the new Home experience, the main part is the featured content. This provides an at-a-glance view of upcoming game releases, events, and content that is available via Game Pass and sales. Alongside this, you'll be able to get the latest deals and discounts available to peruse, showing you the best deals and discounts on offer so that you don't have to pay full price for games and new experiences.</p>
<p>Additionally, there will now be curated collections and recommendations for you based on what games you've played previously. The games shown to you will include games from both Game Pass and the Store, depending on which way you prefer to access your games.</p>
<p>Microsoft has also added a 'Jump Back In' feature as part of the Game Pass tab experience. This features allows players in Compact Mode to click on a game card and will send them directly to the game hub, where you can press play and jump back into the game seamlessly. This feature has been in testing since May, and is now available as part of the new Home experience for all Xbox Insiders.</p>
<p>While it isn't widely available for those who aren't Xbox Insiders at the moment, you can join the Xbox Insider Program by downloading the <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/account-profile/manage-account/xbox-insider-program" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Insider Hub</a>, which will give you access to new features and previews that Microsoft are working on to improve the Xbox experience.</p>

<p>Popular lifestyle and gaming organization, 100 Thieves, revealed a brand-new Adidas Merch line, which is set to drop this November. The drop, which includes shoes, sweatshirts and more, is another perfect example of how very few gaming organizations are doing it like 100 Thieves.</p>



<h2 id="h-100-thieves-x-adidas-merch-release-date">100 Thieves x Adidas Merch Release Date</h2>



<p>The new merch by Adidas and 100 Thieves is currently set to release on the following date:</p>



<ul>
<li>November 6, 2024.</li>
</ul>



<p>Those looking to purchase the drop can do so at the official <a href="https://t.co/lud7N2Kfep">Adidas website</a> and select retailers. However, 100 Thieves fans will be able to get early access to the new merch at <a href="https://100thieves.com/">100 Thieves’s website</a> on November 2, 2024.</p>



<p>100 Thieves has been dedicated to providing gamers with sleek-designed merch for years now in hopes of combining both lifestyle clothing and gaming.</p>



<h6 id="h-related-report-100-thieves-to-build-cdl-superteam-based-on-scrap-and-hydra">Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/100-thieves-cdl-superteam/">REPORT: 100 Thieves To Build CDL ‘Superteam’ Based on Scrap and HyDra</a></h6>



<h2 id="h-everything-included-in-the-merch-drop">Everything Included in the Merch Drop</h2>



<p>The 100 Thieves x Adidas merch drop marks the second time the two brands have worked together. The drop is being called the Adidas Originals x 100 Thieves Drop 02 and will feature the following clothing items:</p>



<ul>
<li>Long Sleeve Shirt</li>



<li>Jacket</li>



<li>Shoes</li>



<li>Socks</li>
</ul>



<p>The entire drop fits well together, featuring a black, white and red design pattern. </p>

<p>It has become quite common for large brands, such as Adidas, to work with gaming companies and organizations. 100 Thieves, however, continues to put out merch like no other.</p>



<p>Will you be purchasing any of the upcoming 100 Thieves merch? While prices have not been revealed, it will more than likely be a bit more on the expensive end.</p>

They plan to be gaming the rest of their lives so decided it would "save a good bit of money."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A PS Plus Essential subscription cost $79.99 per year, so 24 years worth costs $1,919.76. Then, Sony was kind enough to offer the player an 89% discount to upgrade to a Premium subscription in a bizarre loophole, charging just $199.99 instead of $1,889.75, meaning it came to $2,119.75 altogether,</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Best PS Plus Games (Extra &amp; Premium Tiers)</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While the reaction to On_Reddit_In_Class's post was a mixture of shock and awe, there is at least some logic behind the move, assuming PlayStation Plus remains a thing into the mid 21st century. Subscription service prices are on the rise, with everything from PS Plus to Xbox Game Pass and Netflix going up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-raises-price-of-playstation-plus-12-month-subscriptions-across-all-tiers">Sony last raised the price of PS Plus in September 2023</a>, from $59.99 to $79.99 for the most basic tier. "This price adjustment will enable us to continue bringing high-quality games and value-added benefits to your PlayStation Plus subscription service," it said at the time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-defends-ps-plus-price-rises">Analysts said this was inevitable</a>, so another increase in the future isn't out of the question. Xbox Game Pass has seen a similar price rise, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-appears-to-be-getting-another-price-hike">doubling from $9.99 at its launch in 2017 to $19.99 now</a>. Buying a subscription ahead of time guarantees the price remains the same, however, so On_Reddit_In_Class may be on to something.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

The Playstation Vita had a similar situation, and even people reported PSP <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PSP/comments/psdk76/dug_my_psp_1000_out_of_storage_is_this_a_swollen/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">issues a few years ago</a>.</p><p>"If you own any lipo battery I recommend buying yourself a lipo safe bag that is fire and explosion proof. I own a few of these and you never know when your batteries will burst due to swelling," one poster <a href="https://x.com/CyberJoules/status/1849459869146910910" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">suggested</a>. "You may just save your home from a fire or worse by spending an extra $15-$20."</p><p>So while some gamers might be experiencing this for the first time, it's hardly some new or sudden threat. This is a wise practice to periodically follow as your devices continue to age. When you notice it, it's not always an immediate threat, but something to make sure gets replaced.</p><p>"Swelling certainly isn't good, and it's an indicator of decreased performance," said David Mitlin, a battery researcher and professor at the University of Texas at Austin, in an interview with the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/04/18/lithium-ion-battery-swelling-why/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Washington Post</a> about the subject. "But it doesn't instantly mean the battery is going to catch on fire."</p><p>The condition is caused by the gases created lithium ions flow from one end to the other, moving in the opposite direction when the battery is being used to power something. Those ions move through something called the electrolyte. As you keep charging and discharging the battery over time, the electrolyte begins to decompose and produce gases as a byproduct.</p><p>Mitlin continued with the fact that that not all rechargeable batteries are equal. Some big name companies invest even bigger money into researching and developing batteries that stall this decay. In the meantime, there are a few things to keep an eye on such as if the battery gets too hot and what the charge percentage is.</p>

    <div>
        

        <p>Changes begin this weekend.</p>

    </div>

            <p>
Epic has <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/coming-soon-progress-your-fortnite-passes-by-playing-any-experience?lang=en-US">announced</a> an overhaul of its different mode-specific <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> passes that'll soon make it possible to progress through each one simultaneously, regardless of the mode players are currently playing in - and that's on top of word the company readying to introduce an "easy way to snag all premium passes at once".
</p>
<p>
As things stand at present, players can progress through Fortnite's Battle Royale Battle Pass by earning XP from any in-game experience, but the Festival Pass and LEGO Pass can only be levelled by playing in their respective modes (that is, Fortnite Festival and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-fortnite">Lego Fortnite</a>). However, that's all set to change starting on 2nd November.
</p>
<p>
From that date, all earned XP, regardless of the mode it was generated in, will progress the Battle Pass and Music Pass (the new name for the Festival Pass) simultaneously. Then, from 1st December, the changes will apply to the LEGO Pass too. As part of this overhaul, the Music and LEGO Pass will change to a format resembling the Battle Pass, meaning one track containing both free and premium rewards for each - although this won't come into effect until the current Lego Pass and Music Pass have run their course.

<p>
To accommodate these changes, Epic is ditching Festival Points (from 2nd November) alongside Battle Stars and Studs (from 1st December), so that the only earnable currency required to unlock tiers across each pass is XP. It'll be possible to claim rewards in non-sequential order on all unlocked pages of each pass, as is currently the case with the Battle Pass, and players can configure their passes to auto-unlock rewards as XP is earned. Furthermore, players will be able to directly purchase pass rewards (up to an unspecified limit) if they want something they haven't managed to unlock yet.
</p><p>
Epic notes players will still need to purchase the Battle Pass, Music Pass, and LEGO Pass separately if they want to unlock each pass' premium rewards, but teases that an "easy way to snag all premium passes at once" will be introduced soon. There's no word on how this will work - or if, say, Epic will offer a bundle discount for players who want passes across all three modes - but it shouldn't be long until we hear more.
</p>
<p>
"We hope this change encourages you to play where you want, how you want!," Epic concludes. "Soon it’ll be even easier to unlock awesome rewards in Fortnite."
</p>
<p>
Word that Fortnite's pass changes come into effect this Saturday, 2nd November, lends credence to unconfirmed reports Fortnite Chapter 2 Remix will launch on the same date. This mini-season is expected to follow the same format as last year's hugely popular Chapter 1 Remix, which - as its name suggests - brought back elements of Fortnite's inaugural chapter for some nostalgia-baiting fun. Although details are thin, Chapter 2 Remix will likely include numerous map options alongside the return of Midas, Meowscles, TNTina, Slurp Commando Ripley, and 8-Ball (possibly now 1-Ball), as you can <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-chapter-2-remix-estimated-release-date-and-time">read about elsewhere on Eurogamer</a>.

It details what fans can expect from the bold reboot, including “harsh” survival mechanics that might not be for everybody, but is surprisingly light on information about a game expected to arrive in just a year.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196653" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: A Star Wars Classic Returns &amp; More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="105" data-playlist="196653,195371,195386" data-current="196653"><div><p>The Week In Games: A Star Wars Classic Returns &amp; More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22209.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8WgMQuPwRE&amp;t=4s&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8WgMQuPwRE&amp;t=4s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A new YouTube video</a></span> outlines the core mechanics and game loop that players will hopefully be diving into sometime in the not-too-distant future. The core gameplay revolves around customizing characters called runners that players take into matches, collecting loot and fending off rivals in order to escape alive lest they lose everything they earned during the outing. If you’ve played <em>Escape From Tarkov </em>or <em>Hunt: Showdown</em>, you probably already know the drill. </p><p>“It’s a game that’s not for everybody, but if you are interested in having sort of that tense survival experience and having a game where the stakes really matter and you’re challenged to survive in a really, really harsh and interesting world, then <em>Marathon</em>’s right up your alley,” Ziegler said. He added that the world of <em>Marathon</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marathon-bungie-steam-release-free-1851470109&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-bungie-steam-release-free-1851470109">which is based on Bungie’s classic 1990s sci-fi trilogy that recently re-released on Steam</a></span>, will evolve as fans play so that there are new things for them to learn and discover. </p><figure id="" data-id="305ab849d41703f11265e109d7a31164" data-recommend-id="image://305ab849d41703f11265e109d7a31164" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A runner prepares for extraction " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A runner prepares for extraction " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bungie</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="305ab849d41703f11265e109d7a31164" data-recommend-id="image://305ab849d41703f11265e109d7a31164" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A runner prepares for extraction " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>So far, that’s all old news. What we did get from Ziegler for the first time was a glimpse of a couple of Runner archetypes codenamed “Thief” and “Stealth.” What exactly they’ll do remains a mystery, but the concept art, as with everything else in the game, looks really neat. He also gave a very light update on the state of development, including that environments are “coming together” really well while character models are not “completely there yet” and  enemy models are still in an early state. “It’s a little early to show you all of it as one piece,” Ziegler said, which isn’t exactly reassuring for a game players expected to see at the recent PlayStation State of Play in September.</p><p><em>Marathon</em>’s big delay came a year ago amid the first round of seismic cuts at Bungie following its acquisition by Sony.  Ziegler, who previously worked on <em>Valorant</em> at Riot Games, was announced as the new game director earlier this year, with it only being <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-28/-marathon-video-game-director-barrett-was-ousted-over-inappropriate-behavior&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-28/-marathon-video-game-director-barrett-was-ousted-over-inappropriate-behavior" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported later by <em>Bloomberg</em></a></span> that previous director and longtime Bungie veteran Chris Barrett had been fired for misconduct. Rumors of a $40 price point and new playtests have taken hold in the meantime, with questions about whether <em>Marathon</em> is actually really on track yet or not still up in the air. </p><p> “For the past couple of years we’ve been doing a lot of aggressive change to the game and we’ve been iterating pretty heavily,” Ziegler said today. That certainly paints a picture of a game very much still in the middle of development. Perhaps instead of a cold launch in 2025, there will be a series of closed and open betas to get player feedback and grow a fan community around the game instead. <em>Concord</em>’s recent failure may have put new pressure on the live-service prospects of <em>Marathon</em>, as well as <em>Destiny 2</em>'s evolving future. Ziegler signed off his video by asking players to Wishlist the game on the PlayStation store so they know how interested everyone is.</p><p>You can watch the full video below:</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You'll need to hop from the nearby rooftop to the top of the truck that's parked outside of the shop. This lets you vacuum the part out of the top-right window of the barbershop.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Build the LTG device</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391660-maineeltg.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391660" data-ratio="0.56261682242991" data-width="2140" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391660-maineeltg.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391660"></a><figcaption>Build the LTG on bank rooftop</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391660-maineeltg.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">With all three LTG parts collected, you can now head to the bank's rooftop. Just unlock and use either the zipline or ascender connected to the roof. There is a special crafting bench on the roof just for this device.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Use the LTG device</h2><h3 dir="ltr">Grab an Aether canister</h3><p dir="ltr">Head back into the church after building the LTG. Interact with the machine again to <strong>pick up an Aether canister</strong>. Whoever holds this item is going to be weighed down and moving slowly.</p><p dir="ltr">Take the canister to either of the two Dark Aether storms on the map. There's one at the Cemetery and another just right of the Pump and Pay gas station. The order doesn't matter here, but we'll start the guide at the gas station.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Collect an HVT essence</h3><p dir="ltr">Place your canister near the trap at the gas station. Then, interact with the trap piece located directly under the purple storm. Doing so will place the LTG device down.</p><p dir="ltr">This will spawn zombies for a 60-second window. You need to protect the device from taking damage from zombies during this time. Then, the device will turn red, and a portal will spawn the HVT. This enemy will be either a Mangler or an Abomination.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391661-maineemanglerhvt.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391661" data-ratio="0.56214953271028" data-width="2140" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391661-maineemanglerhvt.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391661"></a><figcaption>Mangler HVT at the gas station trap</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391661-maineemanglerhvt.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">You <strong>need to weaken but not kill</strong> the HVT right away. Get the health low and lead the HVT back to the canister you placed down near the trap. The HVT emits purple sparks when the health gets low enough. When this happens, you need to quickly activate the trap. You need to <strong>kill the HVT by the canister while the trap is still active</strong>.</p><p dir="ltr">With the HVT's essence now captured in the trap, you must collect that canister and carry it back to the church. <strong>This step is timed</strong> at 90 seconds, plus you still move slowly carrying it, so make haste toward the church.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Deposit the filled Aether canister</h3><p dir="ltr">Deposit this canister back into the machine inside the church. Once the canister is deposited, a tray on the machine will dispense a new item to pick up. This is called a Strauss Counter. Grab it.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Use the Strauss Counter</h2><p dir="ltr">The Strauss Counter is used to sync up three items on the map that look like old-school film projectors. Using the Strauss Counter is the same button prompt as activating your tactical equipment, and you'll want to activate it while standing beside each of these small devices.</p><p dir="ltr">The Strauss Counter will give you a color, which can be green, yellow, or red. Interact with the projector device on the ground until it matches the color shown on your Strauss Counter. Repeat this step for all three devices. These are found as follows:</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391662-maineehillsideprojector.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391662" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391662-maineehillsideprojector.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391662"></a><figcaption>Device on hillside leading down to the bowling alley</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391662-maineehillsideprojector.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr">Church hillside</h3><p dir="ltr">The closest one is on the hill leading down from the church to the bowling alley.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391663-maineewhitehouseprojector.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391663" data-ratio="0.56261682242991" data-width="2140" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391663-maineewhitehouseprojector.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391663"></a><figcaption>Found behind the white house on the church street</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391663-maineewhitehouseprojector.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr">Near tool shed</h3><p dir="ltr">Behind the white house on the church street, which is near the Groundskeeper's Tool Shed.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391666-maineerooftopprojector.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391666" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391666-maineerooftopprojector.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391666"></a><figcaption>Rooftop device overlooking the gas station</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391666-maineerooftopprojector.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr">Bank rooftop</h3><p dir="ltr">On the lower portion of the bank's roof.

This is the same process as before with the HVT. This will be either a Mangler or an Abomination, whichever you didn't get as an HVT the first time.</p><p dir="ltr">Place the canister near one of the cemetery traps, which is in the street outside the church, and then place the LTG on the trap piece under the storm. Fight off the zombies for 60 seconds at the LTG until the HVT spawns.</p><p dir="ltr">Weaken the HVT, but <strong>do not kill it right away</strong>.

                <p>After more than a year of silence, Bungie has given an update on the development progress of its extraction shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marathon/" data-ref-id="5000-589442">Marathon</a>. The lengthy video is surprisingly light on details, however, with only a hint of future playtests coming in 2025.</p><p>The update, delivered by game director Joe Ziegler, acts more like a reintroduction to Bungie's latest shooter as opposed to a meaningful update. Ziegler spends time explaining what an extraction shooter is, breaking down the high risk, high reward nature of the genre, while also giving brief hints as to how the games different classes might work. It aligns with a lot of<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-everything-we-know-about-bungies-extraction-shooter/1100-6514617/" data-ref-id="1100-6514617"> what we already know about Bungie's shooter</a>, making it a gameplay update light on new details</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8WgMQuPwRE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/r8WgMQuPwRE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In the video, Ziegler briefly speaks about two of the game's Runners--the name given to Marathon's playable characters--with each of their descriptions suggesting that Marathon is taking hints from existing hero shooters. The first is simply codenamed "Thief", with Ziegler assuming you'll have an idea of their gameplay style from the name alone. The other, codenamed "Stealth", is described as using deception to their advantage on the battlefield, with Ziegler remarking that he's enjoyed playing as the character in tests recently.</p><p>Ziegler stressed that Marathon is still not in a state where the team can show it off just yet, pointing at the various states at which distinct elements are at currently.</p><p>"Where the game is at right now, there's a variety of different things at different states inside of the game. Some things are a little more complete, like our environments are starting to come together in a really beautiful way. Some of the character models we've been iterating through; they're coming together but they're not fully there yet. Our enemy models are still kind of in an early state so we're still iterating through things to make those land in a strong way," said Ziegler.</p><p>"It's a little early to show you all of it in one piece," he continued. "But as you've noticed, as many of you are familiar with if you're familiar with game development, all of these things are on track. They're not all together, but when they all do come together we really, really are looking forward to showing you what that looks like and play.</p><p>Zielger ended off by inviting players interested in being invited to further tests to wishlist the game on Xbox Series X, PS5, and Steam, with store pages up for Marathon right now. This is the first time Bungie has spoken about<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-announces-revival-of-pre-halo-sci-fi-series-marathon/1100-6514533/" data-ref-id="1100-6514533"> Marathon since it's announcement in May 2023</a>, where it said that the next time, writing at the time, "now we’re going dark to focus on the game... and when we come back – we’ll have gameplay to show!". Marathon is still slated for release in 2025, although the Steam listing omits this and simply reads "Coming soon".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/jackbox-games-announces-fakin-it-card-game-bringing-their-party-games-to-gaming<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A Fakin' It card game is on its way. This is a tabletop adaptation of one of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/jackbox-games-10-years-of-laughing-quipping-and-fibbing" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Jackbox Games'</a> large catalog of digital party games. It is also the studio's first foray into making a physical card game.</p>

<h2>The <em>Fakin' It</em> Card Game Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official press release, the <em>Fakin' It</em> card game is, understandably, a social deduction card game based on the <em>Fakin' It</em> videogame designed for 3-6 players.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fakin-it-card-game-set-up.jpg?itok=tUzca2eB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fakin-it-card-game-set-up.jpg?itok=FDUH8ql6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In each game, a single card is drawn from the deck. Each card has a task written on it, that the players must read through their secret wallets. The twist is that one of these wallets won't reveal what the card says, meaning the player has to fake the task to score points.</p>

<p>The <em>Fakin' It</em> card game is broken up into five categories. Hands of Truth involves players raising their hands or keeping them down. Number Pressure has players raising a certain number of fingers between 1-10. You Gotta Point has you pointing fingers at another player or yourself. Face Value is about making facial expressions. Finally, Text You Up is about answering the question on the card truthfully.</p>

<p>If you enjoy a rowdier, raunchier party environment, the <em>Fakin' It</em> card game will be releasing alongside <em>Fakin' It All Night Long</em>, a version of the game aimed at the 17+ crowd.</p>

<p>This marks the first tabletop game released by Jackbox Games. The studio has made a reputation for itself with entertaining digital party games that can be played on PCs, consoles, or smart phones. Their past work includes <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/jackbox-survey-scramble-review-wed-like-to-play-steve" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Survey Scramble</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/review/quiplash-review-perfect-you-your-friends-or-strangers-internet" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Quiplash</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/jackbox-naughty-pack-review-spicier-but-not-too-crass" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Naughty Pack</em></a>.</p>

<p>Given their body of work has consistently been about simple but fun party game shenanigans, the move from digital to physical is an understandable one.</p>

<p>The Fakin' It card game will be available on Amazon storefronts November 1. Fakin' It will contain 300 cards and will be sold at an MSRP of $19.99. Fakin' It All Night Long will include 150 cards and will be available at an MSRP of $9.99.</p>

Early in the game, you’ll post up in a safehouse and discover that you can purchase three upgrade stations within, each offering you a variety of perks to buy with the money you gather during missions.</p><p>While it may seem like these perks are just supplementary at first, it soon becomes clear that the campaign is balanced around them—you’ll absolutely want to be finding all the cash you can while you’re out shooting bad guys (pro tip: keep an eye out for safes). Each time you return to the safehouse, you can head to one of the upgrade stations and spend your hard-earned money on some new perks.</p><p>There are a lot of perks to choose from, and they’re all useful in their own ways. However, there are some that are extremely important to snag as early as you can, to improve your ability so survive.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/purearts%E2%80%99-1-300-assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-syndicate-statue-can-be-pre-ordered-now.1021317/</guid>

<p>PureArts is now accepting pre-orders for one of the most remarkable Assassin’s Creed collectables ever marketed. The ‘Assassin’s Creed Animus: Jacob &amp; Evie’ statue, which stands at a whopping 24 inches tall and weighs a hefty 39lbs, is available to order now and will be shipped Q4 2025.</p>



<p>If you want to secure an exclusive edition that comes with a wearable replica of Jacob Frye’s necklace, you’ll need to move fast – only 250 will be made.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-greatest-collector">The Greatest Collector</h2>



<p>This is an item that only the most hardcore fans will consider copping.</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Syndicate was released in 2015 to a relatively stellar reception, emerging as the last of the ‘original formula’ games that were sunsetted when Origins was released in 2017. It saw players assume control of two protagonists – Jacob and Evie Frye – as they explored Victorian London.</p>



<p>The setting was superb, the map was meticulously created, and the story was great – if a little predictable. It had brilliant expansions, and for me, it was on home turf, so that was a bonus.</p>



<p>PureArts’ Jacob and Evie statue is 1/4 scale, which means it’s <strong>massive</strong>. For $1,299, you’re getting a hefty polyresin figure with incredible details. It has onboard LED lighting, a ‘hyperdetailed’ sculpt, and the most accurate thing you’ll see from the game short of downloading it and pressing ‘play’.</p>



<p>The Jacob and Evie statue joins a long line-up of similar figures from PureArts, who historically has poured effort into creating some of the finest collectables from the world of Assassin’s Creed.</p>



<p>Could you see yourself parting ways with $1,299 in celebration of Assassin’s Creed Syndicate? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

Each scenario is set across a series of rounds, with the end of each round supplying you with cash you can use to build or upgrade your current forces. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although that seems simple enough, the game will frequently challenge you with harder levels and enemies that exploit your defence, forcing you to think tactically and carefully deliberate on how to spend your accumulated cash and dominate the battlefield.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Callum Williams is an IGN freelancer covering features and guides.
