If a DLC drop gets delayed, Steam will let developers reschedule it up to 3 months later. And if developers have to cancel a DLC, buyers must get a refund for the item value.</p><p>Steam is also redefining what a season pass is:</p><div><blockquote><p>Because a Season Pass is effectively a DLC pre-purchase, creating a Season Pass on Steam has many of the considerations and restrictions as outlined in the documentation on&nbsp;<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/prepurchase">pre-purchases</a>. For these reasons, we will not offer a Season Pass except in a few rare cases with partners with which we have a well-established relationship and that have a proven track record on Steam.</p></blockquote></div><p>Steam also provided a strong disclaimer for developers:</p><div><blockquote><p>If you aren’t ready to clearly communicate about the content included in each DLC AND when each DLC will be ready for launch, you shouldn’t offer a Season Pass on Steam.</p></blockquote></div><p><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/platforms/pc-gaming/steam-is-forcing-games-to-be-more-clear-about-whats-in-their-season-passes-and-only-allowing-devs-with-a-proven-track-record-to-sell-them/">As noted by <em>Games Radar</em></a>, the new rules might be more challenging for indie developers who don’t have a lot of games under their belts to pass Steam’s requirements. They also may not have enough resources to build up a guaranteed DLC list — but in that case perhaps they aren’t big enough to offer a season pass anyway.</p></div><div><p>Most Popular</p><p>Most Popular</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24301975/elon-musk-vivek-ramaswamy-doge-plan"><h2>Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy have spelled out their plans for DOGE</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/19/24300569/jaguar-rebrand-new-logo-ev"><h2>Jaguar is now JaGUar</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24301740/hyundai-ioniq-9-three-row-electric-suv-laas"><h2>The Hyundai Ioniq 9 is a three-row electric SUV with room to grow</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24301489/amazon-echo-show-21-smart-display-price-specs-release-date"><h2>Amazon’s new&nbsp;Echo&nbsp;Show 21 has a huge screen and built-in&nbsp;smart home&nbsp;hub</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24300617/doj-google-search-antitrust-chrome-breakup"><h2>DOJ says Google must sell Chrome to crack open its search monopoly</h2></a><hr></li></ol></div></div></article></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/it-can-cost-up-to-500000-for-a-spot-on-opening-night-live-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The cost to show your game at Opening Night Live is set to get even more expensive for studios. According to a new report from German outlet <a href="https://www.gameswirtschaft.de/gamescom/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-werbespots-preise-211124/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesWirtschaft</a>, Geoff Keighley’s annual event at Gamescom is charging up to nearly $500,000 for an spot on Opening Night Live 2025.</p>



<p>The report claims that prices start at $146,800 (€140,000) for a 30-second ad and rises to roughly $487,506 (€465,000) for a 180-second (three-minute) ad, based on currency conversion rates as of writing. The three-minute ad is one of two new tiers offered for 2025 along with a 150-second ad for roughly $419,360 (€400,000). In total, there are six different tiers to choose from, all more expensive than the reported <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/it-costs-up-to-288000-to-show-your-game-at-gamescom-onl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cost for the same amount of time</a> in 2024. Across the board, the increases range from 17.4% up to 21.9%.</p>



<p>Opening Night Live 2025 is scheduled to air August 19, 2025, the day before Gamescom 2025 officially begins.</p>







<ul>
<li><strong>30 seconds</strong>: $146,776 or €140,000 ($125,000 or €115,000 in 2024)</li>



<li><strong>60 seconds:&nbsp;</strong>$214,922 or €205,000 ($179,600 or €165,000 in 2024)</li>



<li><strong>90 seconds:</strong>&nbsp;$283,068 or €270,000 ($234,000 or €215,000 in 2024)</li>



<li><strong>120 seconds:&nbsp;</strong>$351,214 or €335,000 ($288,000 or €265,000 in 2024)</li>



<li><strong>150 seconds:</strong>&nbsp;$419,360 or €400,000 </li>



<li><strong>180 seconds:</strong>&nbsp;$487,506 or €465,000 </li>
</ul>



<p>It’s worth noting that neither Keighley himself nor the Gamescom promoters have confirmed these prices. Insider Gaming has attempted to reach out for comment, though no response has been received as of publishing.</p>

                <p>When Conan O'Brien was still hosting a talk show on TBS, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/conan-obrien-is-bringing-back-clueless-gamer/1100-6509127/" data-ref-id="1100-6509127">Clueless Gamer</a> was a regular feature. While O'Brien hasn't made many episodes since the end of Conan, Clueless Gamer returned this week with a new installment that tackles the director's cut of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/death-stranding-directors-cut-review-the-limits-of-the-dead/1900-6417746/" data-ref-id="1900-6417746">Death Stranding</a>, a game that actually features O'Brien in a cameo role.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xcw16EQObXM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Xcw16EQObXM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Aaron Bleyaert reunited with O'Brien for the segment, and he proceeded to explain the lore of Hideo Kojima's game at length. When O'Brien wasn't looking at the camera and silently pleading for mercy, he was pretending to be falling asleep.</p><p>O'Brien eventually got his hands on the controller and stepped into the role of Sam Porter Bridges (Norman Reedus), before promptly made a mockery of Sam's attempt to dispose of his mother's body. The scene in the game wasn't meant to be comical, but O'Brien kept finding ways to bring out the slapstick by slipping and falling before he handed over the controller to Bleyaert.</p><p>As related by O'Brien, he traveled to Japan and allowed himself to be scanned for his cameo role in the game. Kojima even briefly reappears in this video to tell O'Brien where he can find his character, who can provide players with a Sea Otter Suit for swimming. But after finding himself, O'Brien said, "Oh my God, I hate him and he's me."</p><p>To close out the segment, O'Brien jokingly pitched Kojima with the idea of making him a more heroic character in a new game, and the director invited him to return to Japan to be scanned by even more advanced technology than he was before.</p><p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-is-now-on-xbox-series-x-s-five-years-after-it-first-launched-on-ps4/1100-6527622/" data-ref-id="1100-6527622">Death Stranding Directors' Cut made its debut on Xbox Series X|S</a> after previously being a console exclusive for PS5 and PS4.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> COD Warzone &amp; Black Ops 6 - Season 01 Battle Pass Overview Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The update refreshes Black Ops 6's multiplayer to bring back the popular 10v10 moshpit playlists for both core and Hardcore. Hideout, Extraction, and Protocol are now added to the map pool for 10v10 as well.</p><p dir="ltr">On the Zombies side of the update, the patch notes reveal the developer has fixed an issue that previously caused players to be slowed when reloading while sprinting. It also addresses an issue that could cause the "Box Addict" Dark Ops challenge to not track properly.</p><p dir="ltr">Rebirth Island returns to Warzone, again. The map previously arrived the week after Season 1's launch, but was removed just hours after launch due to "map-specific issues." The patch notes confirm that the map is now available with lighting and audio adjustments that have been made to improve gameplay.</p><p dir="ltr">The developer thanked players for their patience, and discussed the map's disappearance by saying, "We wanted to take the necessary time to address key issues and make improvements to ensure the best possible experience."</p><p dir="ltr">The update also includes XP balancing across various Warzone modes. This includes increased player XP in standard battle royale and Plunder mode, while increased weapon XP is adjusted for Plunder and Resurgence modes.</p><p dir="ltr">Another major change is a buff to the popular Stim Shot tactical equipment. The patch notes reveal the Stim Shot's speed boost duration has been increased from one to three seconds.</p><p dir="ltr">The full patch notes for both <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-01-patch-notes" rel="nofollow ">Black Ops 6</a> and <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/11/call-of-duty-bo6-warzone-season-01-patch-notes" rel="nofollow ">Warzone</a> can be found below, as shared by Activision.</p><p dir="ltr">Most recently, an update went live to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-patch-notes-reveal-return-of-legacy-xp-tokens/1100-6527868/">add the Legacy XP tokens back into Black Ops 6</a>. It was also revealed by Activision that players who buy Black Ops 6 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/buying-black-ops-6-or-playing-with-game-pass-comes-with-a-nice-bonus-for-warzone/1100-6527891/">receive a 30% XP boost in Warzone</a>.</p><h3>GLOBAL</h3><h4>New Event: The Hit List</h4><p>Who’s next? Keep up your luxurious – but slightly corrupt – lifestyle during the Hit List Event. You’re offered up a take-no-prisoners mission: kill or be killed. The Hit List Limited Event gives players a board of contracts with one goal – take them all out. Cross off the entire list and earn some exclusive loot for hire.</p><h3>MULTIPLAYER</h3><h4>Playlist Updates</h4><ul><li>Added 10v10 Moshpit to Quickplay</li><li>Added Hardcore 10v10 Moshpit to Hardcore Quickplay  <ul><li>Added Hideout, Extraction, and Protocol to 10v10 map pool</li></ul></li></ul><h4>Challenges</h4><ul><li>Addressed an issue on the Krig C and Saug where Camo progression for Dark Spine was not tracking properly.</li></ul><h3>RANKED PLAY</h3><h4>Restrictions Update</h4><ul><li>The RC-XD has been restricted in all modes.</li></ul><h4>Gameplay</h4><ul><li>Addressed an issue where some matches would unintentionally end in a draw.</li></ul><h4>UI</h4><ul><li>Addressed an issue where SR would sometimes display incorrectly after a match.</li><li>Addressed an issue where players would sometimes be stuck with no UI after a match ended when they are max level.</li></ul><h3>ZOMBIES</h3><h4>Movement</h4><ul><li>Addressed an issue where players would be slowed when reloading while sprinting.</li></ul><h4>Challenges</h4><ul><li>Addressed an issue that could prevent the “Box Addict” Dark Ops Challenge to not track properly.</li></ul><h4>Stability</h4><ul><li>Added various stability fixes.</li></ul><h2>WARZONE PLAYLIST</h2><ul><li>Rebirth Island will be re-enabled in the Warzone playlist later this morning.</li></ul><p>Thank you for your patience these last few days as we've worked to bring Rebirth Island back to the Warzone playlist! We wanted to take the necessary time to address key issues and make improvements to ensure the best possible experience.</p><h2>MAPS</h2><ul><li><b>Rebirth Island </b><ul><li>A number of lighting and audio adjustments have been made to improve gameplay.</li></ul></li></ul><h2>GENERAL</h2><ul><li><b>Armory </b><ul><li>The Warzone Armory will be re-enabled later today.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><b>XP Balancing </b><ul><li>Increased player XP in Battle Royale and Plunder</li><li>Increased Weapon XP in Plunder and Resurgence</li></ul></li></ul><p>We’ve made several adjustments to Player and Weapon XP in order to bring earn rates across different modes closer together.</p><ul><li><b>Stim Shot </b><ul><li>The speed boost duration has been increased from 1 second to 3.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Upon the launch of Warzone, we identified a critical issue and, in response, temporarily reduced both the speed increase and the duration of Stim Shots while we worked on a solution. Our goal is to offer a meaningful speed boost with a clear upper limit, to ensure balanced and consistent combat encounters. As it stands, both Resolute and Stim Shot provide a 15% speed boost each, with their combined effect capping at 20%. This allows players to experiment with various combinations to reach the maximum impact.</p><ul><li><b>Deployable Box Interaction Speed </b><ul><li>We’ve removed an unintentional delay that previously prevented players from interacting with the Armor/Munitions/Utility Box when initially deployed.</li></ul></li></ul><h2>BUG FIXES</h2><ul><li>Fixed an issue on Area 99 that would cause players to hear Killstreaks from across the map.</li></ul><ul><li>Fixed an issue that would cause players to drop a weapon involuntarily while attempting to pick up a different weapon from the ground.</li></ul><ul><li>Fixed an issue that would prompt players to remove an Aftermarket Part from their weapon despite one not being currently equipped.</li></ul><ul><li>Fixed an issue that caused the STB 556 Assault Rifle body to disappear when equipping an underbarrel attachment.</li></ul>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dragon-age-the-veilguard/">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> continues to receive support from developer BioWare with several bug fixes and quality-of-life changes. The third patch, released on November 21 for PC and consoles, improves photo mode, input mappings, and some visual elements.</p><p>For the photographers out there, there are now filters available in photo mode. Plus, screenshot file names have been simplified and show the date the photo was taken, and the file path where screenshots are saved is now shown in game, which is especially useful for PC users.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WoDI-4E7efU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WoDI-4E7efU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As for other quality-of-life changes, arrow keys can now be bound to input mappings. Elsewhere, the patch makes it so you can compare new rings against both equipped ring slots, and there's a clearer view to identify where an enchantment has been applied to a companion's equipment. Moreover, the Glint option description in settings has been adjusted, there are new icons for some weapons, and you'll now get a notification when the Crossroads' Spirit Merchant is available.</p><p>The list of bug fixes is quite extensive, and tackles a variety of issues. A few of note are instances where music would incorrectly stop playing, the HDR calibration setting now being saved correctly between game sessions, camera stutters, and a number of crashes. You can find the full list in <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard/news/patch-3-release-notes" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">BioWare's blog</a>, and below.</p><p>In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review/1900-6418294/" data-ref-id="1900-6418294">Dragon Age: The Veilguard review</a>, editor Jodan Ramée praises its "tantalizing visuals, ranging from artifact-filled forests of verdant greens and golden glows to canal-dominated cities of deep blues and evocative purples," as well as standout party companions, the in-depth character creator, and satisfying combat mechanics, though the latter is dependent on which class you choose.</p><ul><li>Eliminated the causes of a small number of crashes.</li><li>Rook's body shape no longer changes unexpectedly after a cutscene with Emmrich.</li><li>Adjusted an odd facial expression when Rook first meets Emmrich.</li><li>Fixed a rare issue where some of an existing Rook's settings got unintentionally reset after making and saving a new Rook.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-releases-assassins-creed-shadows-stealth-gameplay-overview/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As the release date for Assassin's Creed Shadows looms ever closer, Ubisoft has begun to drop details about the upcoming title, with <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/es-mx/game/assassins-creed/news/1lmnk4XTnnqRh1foViGYPR" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a new post</a> detailing the Stealth gameplay that players can expect from diving into this title. Assassin's Creed Shadows is set to release on February 14, 2025, after Ubisoft announced that they will be delaying the game from its <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025-ubisoft-announces-return-to-steam-on-day-1-and-departs-season-pass-model/">original release date of November 15, 2024</a>. However, in September, Ubisoft announced that although the game's features are padded out how they wanted, they are going to delay the release to polish the game further <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-has-only-sold-1-million-copies-since-launch-learning-curve-assassins-creed-shadows/">after Star Wars Outlaws suffered from a poor release</a> in August.</p>
<p>The stealth gameplay overview focuses primarily on Naoe, one of the two protagonists available in the game. One of the main features in the stealth gameplay is the Observe mechanic, which both Naoe and Yasuke have access to. This allows you to identify targets as well as tagging and monitoring enemies. This feature was available in previous games but wasn't as detailed. "The new Observer mechanic is at the core of the Assassin's Creed Shadows experience. When in doubt, take a pause, observe the world around you, and only then should you decide what your next move should be," says Simon Lemay-Comtois, Associate Game Director.</p>
<p>The blog post showcases many different features of how stealth works in Assassin's Creed Shadows, with small clips that showcase each element.</p>
<p>Naoe doesn't just have to rely on movement and being stealthy to get out of situations, as she has four tools that she can use to help her get away from a sticky situation or to secure a kill on a target. This includes Smoke Bombs, Shinobi Bells, Kunai, and Shuriken. All of them relate to the stealth mechanic in some way. For example, Shinobi Bells create noise, and you can throw them somewhere to alert enemies to the bell rather than to your presence. Kunai can be used for one-shot kills if you are good with your aim. Shuriken can stun enemies and cause distractions if thrown into an environment. The Smoke bombs are self explanatory, and the blog post provides a glimpse into the action of how Naoe can use these tools to better the situation.</p>
<p>"Naoe is our smallest Assassin to date. And she uses that to her advantage: she can squeeze through tiny wall cracks, and she can hide inside small storage spaces and boxes in order to get the drop on her enemies," says Lemay-Comtois.</p>
<p>When it comes to stealth, this is primarily an option that is given to Naoe, although Yasuke does have a couple of options if you want to avoid direct combat. Overall, it seems that the stealth system in Assassin's Creed Shadows has been well thought out, with tools to use at your disposal as well as a progression system that can allow you to tunnel vision skills for your stealth or abilities.</p>

First up is the game’s <a href="https://ubisoft.pxf.io/c/482924/864200/12050?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ubisoft.com%2Fen-ca%2Fgame%2Fstar-wars%2Foutlaws%2Fnews-updates%2F1Q4y5lMJwdUUt6qXzbWKPI%2Fstar-wars-outlaws-game-update-showcase-wrapup">first batch of downloadable content</a>, which adds a new storyline involving Lando Calrissian and what appears to be a very dangerous game of Sabacc. The new expansion is called <em>Wild Card </em>and will be followed by a second DLC update next spring called <em>A Pirate’s Fortune</em>.</p><p>Perhaps more significant, today, <em>Outlaws</em> is also getting a major update to address some of the game’s technical and design issues. Ubisoft describes it as the game’s “biggest patch yet.” Most notable, it seems, is that the stealth sections — a major point of frustration for many players — have been toned down.</p><p>Ubisoft says that the update includes “updates to stealth and combat that allow players greater choice, including using stealth or reaching for their blaster, even in syndicate territories in cities.” Similarly, there are “enemy AI and detection improvements, with players being notified when they’re being detected and can choose to escalate or change tactics to remain in stealth.”</p><div><p>Here’s how creative director Drew Rechner <a href="https://ubisoft.pxf.io/c/482924/864200/12050?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ubisoft.com%2Fen-gb%2Fgame%2Fstar-wars%2Foutlaws%2Fnews-updates%2F4U9vshW5I0KpPRJFhQspn2%2Fstar-wars-outlaws-dev-update-3-the-scoundrels-journey">explains the changes</a>:</p></div><div><blockquote><p>Our first step in expanding player choice is removing forced stealth from almost all quest objectives. This doesn’t mean that sneaking is no longer a viable or even preferable option in some cases. Rather, if you’re caught while sneaking, the objective won’t fail and reset you to the last checkpoint. Instead, you’ll seamlessly transition into combat.&nbsp;</p></blockquote></div><p>You can check out the full patch notes <a href="https://ubisoft.pxf.io/c/482924/864200/12050?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ubisoft.com%2Fen-ca%2Fgame%2Fstar-wars%2Foutlaws%2Fnews-updates%2F1sXCR6GmB3Kn7OrKiy8DPO%2Fstar-wars-outlaws-title-update-140">right here</a>, and get an overview in the video below.</p><p>Also notable: while <em>Outlaws</em> has been on PC since launch, it was only available through the Epic Games Store and Ubisoft Connect.

<p>In the years since <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/10/heroes-die-our-first-hours-with-the-addictive-and-maddening-dark-souls/"><em>Dark Souls</em> first hit the scene</a>, the action RPG genre has been overrun with "Souls-like" games that emulate FromSoft's general vibe. That often applies not just to dark settings and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/03/is-elden-ring-really-that-hard-well-it-depends-what-you-mean-by-hard/">punishing difficulty</a> but also to the slow, deliberate management of every movement and attack to survive even simple encounters with your life and stamina intact.</p>
<p>While that approach definitely has its place, sometimes you want an action-RPG with a little more color, a little faster pacing, and a little more, well, <em>action</em>. After spending a few hours with Obsidian's <em>Avowed</em>, it already feels like just the thing for action-RPG fans who want something a little less Souls-like.</p>
<h2>All politics is local</h2>
<p>From the start, <em>Avowed</em> is layered with all of the vaguely medieval high fantasy tropes you'd expect from a game spun off from the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/06/pillars-of-eternity-2-deadfire-review-oh-the-places-youll-plunder/"><em>Pillars of Eternity</em></a> universe. Your protagonist is a "god-like," touched in the womb by mysterious immortal beings that gave you mysterious powers but also a disfigured face that led you to be bullied as a child. Eventually, you grow up to be an envoy to the King of Aedrys and are sent over the sea to the lightly civilized Living Lands to investigate a mysterious fungal plague that is turning animals and soldiers alike into unruly, rage-filled beasts.</p>
<p>While the exposition dump introduction is a bit tedious, the storytelling picks up quite a bit in well-voiced conversations with a wide variety of humans and multicolored humanoid species around the island kingdom of Paradis. Through the well-written dialogue, you get a pretty quick feel for the strained politics between Aedrys and Paradis. What the Aedryn people see as an important civilizing occupation, the Paradisans are more likely to see as a heavy-handed colonization. As such, you're treated more often with suspicion and reluctance by the local populace than as a fated hero saving the realm from destruction.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          


<p>The early dialogue trees offer plenty of opportunities to explore the political lore and historical backstory of the world. You can also stumble on some interesting side stories, including one where you end up playing impromptu relationship counselor to a troubled human who has fallen into a forbidden relationship with one of the beasts bedeviling the town.</p>
<p>After taming a few of the more fearsome infected beasts troubling Paradis, you discover a mystical stone that lets you actually talk to the sentient fungus that's causing all of this trouble; it describes itself as "mycelia twining through the loam, taking and giving in equal measure." That first conversation with the reluctant infection itself is full of the kind of heavy-handed mysticism and flowery language that quickly had me tuning out of the story. I'm hopeful that the full game will stay more focused on the more interesting human interactions instead.</p>

<h2>Daggers, bows, and spells</h2>
<p>If you're used to games like <em>Dark Souls</em> or <em>Elden Ring</em>, you'll find the first-person melee-based combat in <em>Avowed</em> to be downright zippy. You start with a simple dagger that's great for multiple quick thrusts or for a slower, charged attack that lets you lunge in from a few paces out. Getting in close with the dagger can open you up to dangerous counterattacks, though, which are best avoided with a quick sideways or backward dodge. The window for those dodges can be pretty tight, though, and a few stray attacks is enough to leave you struggling to survive with a limited "second wind" recovery.</p>
<p>Pretty quickly, you'll stumble on a bow and a seemingly unlimited supply of arrows, which can be fired quickly or charged for a more powerful volley. This is the safest way to attack most early grunt enemies, as you can keep your distance from foes that can't do much from afar but throw rocks. But the safer option is also the duller one, as lobbing arrow after arrow from a relatively safe distance quickly starts to feel a bit tedious.</p>

      The bow is a bit too effective at taking out early enemies from afar

<p>The tedium of the bow doesn't really break until you stumble on your first spellbook, which you can hold in your off-hand while gripping the dagger in the other. Spouts of flame, freezing icicles, and blasts of lightning all come standard with the basic spellbook, alongside learnable spells like an enemy-tracking elemental blast and a powerful bull charge that can stun even lunging enemies.</p>
<p>Even early on, the wide variety of available spells—all on relatively quick cooldown timers—can make for some pretty dynamic fights. In one early boss battle with a large, infected bear, I was able to continually pepper the beast with each available spell while also lunging in for a few quick dagger hits when it was stunned or immobilized. By the time I was done with the last spell in my repertoire, my first spell was ready to use again, leading to a satisfying cycle of magical attacks that held out as long as my mana did. Though you do have to manage a prominent stamina meter during these battles, the game seems to be generous enough to make it not much of a pressing issue (at least for my combat-heavy character build).</p>

<p>Through it all, there's usually one or two computer-controlled partners fighting alongside you as well. In many games like this, these kinds of partners feel like more of a chore to manage than an ally to aid you. In <em>Avowed</em>, though, your partners do a good job of distracting large groups of enemies from ganging up on you while also doing significant damage themselves—one actually landed the killing blow on a boss while I was off healing from a stray attack. While you can issue commands and get specific upgrades to fine-tune how your allies work, I've been perfectly satisfied with letting their default assistance round out my battles.</p>
<p>The small preview slice of <em>Avowed</em> we were given access to only touches on a deep, multi-branched ability tree suited for both melee combat and more ranged magic users. We're eager to explore more when the game hits Windows and Xbox consoles on February 18.</p>

In <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/disney-dreamlight-valley/" data-ref-id="5000-563578">Disney Dreamlight Valley</a>, you will need to grow crops and forage for food as part of your ongoing adventure in the Valley. Once you have gathered plenty of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-dreamlight-valley-ingredient-locations/1100-6507170/" data-ref-id="1100-6507170">different ingredients</a>, you will likely want to try your hand at cooking up some delicious meals. Cooking can make your crops worth more to sell or can even be gifted to the various characters around the Valley to improve your friendship with them.</p><p dir="ltr">Early in the game, you will be introduced to the concept of recipe books, which will teach you how to make a single dish. While this happens infrequently throughout the game, you can also learn how to cook new recipes by just trying things. If you put the correct ingredients in the pot, you will create a new dish and unlock that recipe in the collection. That means as long as you know what ingredients are needed and have them, you can make any dish in the game.</p><p dir="ltr">Recipes in Disney Dreamlight Valley will require one of two things. The recipe will either require you to have the exact ingredients listed. For example, Creamy Garlic Scallops require Scallops, Garlic, Lemon, and Butter. Other recipes will require any ingredient from a certain category. For example, Fish Steak requires Tomato, Basil, and any fish. It could be Cod, Salmon, or Tuna, it doesn't matter, as long as it's in that category.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Disney_Dreamlight_Valley_recipes">Disney Dreamlight Valley recipes</a><ul><li><a href="#1_Star_Meals">1-Star Meals</a></li><li><a href="#2_Star_Meals">2-Star Meals</a></li><li><a href="#3_Star_Meals">3-Star Meals</a></li><li><a href="#4_Star_Meals">4-Star Meals</a></li><li><a href="#5_Star_Meals">5-Star Meals</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#A_Rift_in_Time_recipes">A Rift in Time recipes</a><ul><li><a href="#1_Star_Meals">1-Star Meals</a></li><li><a href="#2_Star_Meals">2-Star Meals</a></li><li><a href="#3_Star_Meals">3-Star Meals</a></li><li><a href="#4_Star_Meals">4-Star Meals</a></li><li><a href="#5_Star_Meals">5-Star Meals</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#The_Storybook_Vale_recipes">The Storybook Vale recipes</a><ul><li><a href="#1_Star_Meals">1-Star Meals</a></li><li><a href="#2_Star_Meals">2-Star Meals</a></li><li><a href="#3_Star_Meals">3-Star Meals</a></li><li><a href="#4_Star_Meals">4-Star Meals</a></li><li><a href="#5_Star_Meals">5-Star Meals</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Best_meals_for_energy_in_Dreamlight_Valley">Best meals for energy in Dreamlight Valley</a></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="Disney_Dreamlight_Valley_recipes">Disney Dreamlight Valley recipes</h2><p>These recipes are available in the base game and do not require any additional purchases to access.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="1_Star_Meals">1-Star Meals</h3><p>These meals require one ingredient to cook.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Appetizers</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr">Cheese Platter -

You may even be surprised to hear that higher-star meals don't always equate to the highest gains in energy. Here are the meals that provide the most energy, but check below the list for our pick for the meal that offers the most efficient use of time and ingredients.</p><ul><li>Thousand Needles - 5000 energy</li><li>Barbecued Brilliant Starfish - 3118 energy</li><li>Sand Worm Carpaccio Plate - 3004 energy</li><li>Barbecued Pretty Pink Starfish - 2812 energy</li><li>Conch Ceviche - 2646 energy</li></ul><p>With the absolute highest energy meals out of the way, our pick for the most efficient use of your time and ingredients is <strong>Berry Salad</strong>. This simple 3-star meal can fill <strong>nearly 80% of your gold energy</strong> (and even more if you add extra berries when making it). Combine the relatively high energy replenishment with the fact that these three required berries are such a cinch to forage, and you've got yourself a quick meal choice to keep on hand for filling your energy.</p><p>We have dozens of Dreamlight Valley guides to help you every step of the way.

                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/black-friday/">Black Friday</a> has kicked off  early this month, and if you're looking for a deal on headsets and earbuds, you can pick up a set of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D1XD1ZV3?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Apple Airpods Pro 2 for <strong>$160</strong></a>. This is the lowest price ever for these--previously, it was $170 during Prime Day in July--as they normally retail for $250.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4403443-airpods-pro-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4403443" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4403443-airpods-pro-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4403443"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4403443-airpods-pro-2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">This set comes with a MagSafe Charging Case (USB-C) and several sets of silicone ear tips to help you fine-tune the fit. What's really nice about these earbuds is that they sit comfortably in your ears, as the silicone tips don't push into your ear canals. If you're the kind of person who hates earplugs, for example, then these are a great option as they're lightweight and you'll barely feel them when they're placed in your ears.</p><p dir="ltr">For the hardware inside of each earbud, there's a powerful Apple H2 chip that can deliver really good audio quality and excellent noise cancellation. These are particularly good at drowning out background noise and you can even use them at gym, although admittedly, you're still going to hear some sounds if your local exercise joint plays music at an unbearably loud level. These will still do a good job of masking most of the noise with its ANC technology, and both the AirPods Pro and the MagSafe Charging Case are IP54-rated, meaning they're dust, sweat, and water-resistant.</p><p dir="ltr">They also feature various touch controls to manage playback functions and Siri interactions, and if you have an iPhone or iPad with iOS 18 installed, these have been authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration to function as over-the-counter hearing aids.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Black Friday Headset Deals</h2><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Solo-Wireless-Headphones-Matte/dp/B0CZPLV566?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Beats Solo 4 headset</a> -- $100 ($<del>200</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth/dp/B0CCZ26B5V?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bose QuietComfort headset</a> -- $200 ($<del>350</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM4-Canceling-Headphones-phone-call/dp/B0863TXGM3?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sony WH-1000XM4 headset</a> -- $198 ($<del>348</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM5-Canceling-Headphones-Hands-Free/dp/B09XS7JWHH?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sony WH-1000XM5 headset</a> -- $298 ($<del>400</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/JBL-TUNE-720BT-Lightweight-comfortable/dp/B0CTBCDD6D?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">JBL Tune 720BT headset</a> -- $40 ($<del>80</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Cancelling-Optimization-Interpreter-Redesigned/dp/B0D9YZJ3V7?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro earbuds</a> -- $189 ($<del>250</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sonos-Ace-Wireless-Headphones-Cancellation/dp/B0CYHGTMNH?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sonos Ace headset</a> -- $350 ($<del>450</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/JBL-Live-Pro-TWS-Beamforming/dp/B09V9P5Q6W?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">JBL Live Pro 2 earbuds</a> -- $75 ($<del>150</del>)</li></ul><p>Several other headsets are on sale for Black Friday as well, like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Solo-Wireless-Headphones-Matte/dp/B0CZPLV566?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Beats Solo 4 headset</a> for $100 (was $200), the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM5-Canceling-Headphones-Hands-Free/dp/B09XS7JWHH?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sony WH-1000XM5</a> with excellent ANC for $298 (was $400), and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sonos-Ace-Wireless-Headphones-Cancellation/dp/B0CYHGTMNH?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sonos Ace headset</a> for $350 (was $450).</p>

"I understand it completely, but I think, from my perspective, what the fans really want to see the most is not necessarily DLC. They want to see the third part of the series as quickly as possible."</p><p>Seeing how the first part of the trilogy launched in 2020 for the PS4, with the DLC a year later that focused on Yuffie as a playable character--subtitled Intermission--fans might have taken that as setting a precedent since these games are so colossal. That DLC was later rolled into the PS5 version of Final Fantasy 7 Remake and renamed Intergrade.</p><p>"So that's why we've decided not to focus the development resources on creating additional extra episodes for DLC at the moment," he added. "We really are putting all our efforts into getting the third game out as quickly as we can. So for the moment, that's where we're focusing our time. I want [Remake Chapter 3] to come out as quickly as possible, and then move on maybe to look at some other stories, dig a bit deeper."</p>

Primarily, its purpose is to create a framework that "maps how the design of children’s digital experiences affects their well-being and provides guidance on how informed design choices can promote positive well-being outcomes."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In essence, LEGO and UNICEF want game designers to implement features that make online games safe for children to be themselves, connect with others their own age (and of different backgrounds and living situations), and grow their skills and as people. The </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.unicef.org/childrightsandbusiness/media/1036/file/RDT-Framework-Poster-A4-nmarkup.pdf">suggested framework</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was developed in consultation with nearly 800 children across the globe, and covers key areas such as autonomy, safety, creativity, and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI).</span></p><p>The key aspects of Lego/UNICEF's RDT framework.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For example, if a designer wanted to use the framework to develop experiences based around </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.unicef.org/childrightsandbusiness/media/1121/file/RDT-CardsDesktop.pdf">autonomy</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">? They need to make sure the experience lets kids "feel in control and make decisions about their gameplay [and] develop their own strategies to survive and progress."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Likewise, DEI-focused experiences should allow children to see themselves through their custom-made in-game avatars, including options for different skin tones and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/art/bioware-pulls-back-the-veil-on-dragon-age-the-veilguard-s-magical-hair-tech">hairstyles</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> or "assertive technologies" like wheelchairs and other mobility aids. It may also mean designing experiences for kids who do not have consistent internet access, or who have limited hardware and funds.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Quotes from children surveyed further show they have thoughts on each aspect: in the Autonomy section, a group of Bulgarian children (aged 12-15 years old) say they enjoy titles that give "opportunities for a child to make different choices." A 9-year-old in Australia added that games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Goat Simulator</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> have helped her process her emotions: "If I’m feeling angry, sometimes I just go headbutt a tree or something."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Concerns about video games' effect on kids have always been a talking point, and become more prominent within the past decade.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-will-overhaul-stealth-mechanics-but-still-include-insta-kill-assassination-option<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> is set to overhaul stealth mechanics for both its dual protagonists, but will also include an option to allow insta-kill assassinations on all enemies.</p>
<p>That's because stronger enemies can completely deny assassination attempts, as detailed in a <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/news">new blog post</a> from Ubisoft. Coloured prompts over enemies will indicate either an instant kill, some damage dealt, or a complete assassination denial, though this can all be negated with a specific menu option for insta-kills.</p>
<p>"When it comes to assassinations, progress and context work in hand," said associate game director Simon Lemay-Comtois. "Invest in perks that increase your assassination damage and test things around: A strong enemy may survive a frontal assassination but may die from a sneaky air assassination."</p>

<p>Elsewhere, Lemay-Comtois noted stealth gameplay has been "ambitiously overhauled in a few key areas". Most notably, the game lacks a bird companion, unlike the most recent games.</p>
<p>Instead, both samurai Yasuke and shinobi Naoe will have a new Observe mechanic to identify targets, tag enemies, and highlight lootable stashes, which Lemay-Comtois promised is core to the game. "When in doubt, take a pause, observe the world around you, and only then should you decide what your next move should be," he said.</p>
<p>Naoe, however, will have Eagle Vision in addition to highlight enemies hidden behind walls based on sounds they make.</p>
<p>The game also includes a couple of series firsts: hiding in shadows will provide complete invisibility (living up to the game's name), and both characters are able to go prone to reduce visibility.</p>
<p>With the former especially, players will be able to destroy lanterns to create pools of darkness for protection. "Naoe is a perfectly capable Shinobi in broad day light," said Lemay-Comtois, "but the cover of darkness gives her a remarkable edge over her enemies - especially on higher difficulty settings."</p>
<p>And while prone, Naoe is also able to dodge by rolling in multiple directions. She's also the smallest Assassin to date, allowing her to hide in small spaces.</p>
<p>Much of these stealth mechanics appear to give Naoe a significant advantage (she's a shinobi after all), suggesting samurai Yasuke's gameplay will be less stealth-focused overall. However, the blog post notes he can still be stealthy with his bow and is able to blend "stealth with a more direct combat approach". Further details will be provided in a future blog post.</p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows was delayed until February 2025, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delay-necessary-to-change-narrative-of-ubisofts-inconsistency-in-quality">series boss Marc-Alexis Coté said</a> was necessary to change the "narrative" of Ubisoft's "inconsistency in quality".</p>
<p>Last week images leaked <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-leak-looks-to-show-free-battle-pass-rewards">appearing to show free battle pass rewards</a>, something not seen before in an Assassin's Creed game.</p>
<p>"All the rewards available in the Animus Hub will be entirely free, there are no paid subscriptions or paid battle pass featured in the Animus Hub, and players will have access to regular content [and] missions at no extra cost," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-responds-to-assassins-creed-shadows-leak-showing-free-battle-pass-rewards">Ubisoft later confirmed</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Marvel Games and NetEase Games have made the announcement that Hawkeye will be joining the launch roster for Marvel Rivals. So far, the roster is pretty nicely stacked and has a lot of variation for those who plan on getting stuck into the game. The release date for Marvel Rivals isn't far away, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-demanding-540p-xbox-series-s/">the game will be launching on December 6</a> with all heroes unlocked and free to play. In addition to Hawkeye's reveal, the dev team has also revealed a new map being added for Wakanda. The map is called Birnin T'Challa and is a built-up, futuristic city in the Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hawkeye: The Unmatched Sharpshooter | Character Reveal | Marvel Rivals" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XMmZ8wuXNG0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>To celebrate all of the announcements they've made, they've released a trailer for Hawkeye and<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=Ci9jZY11JluGVcqL&amp;v=dz_778SYulo&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Birnin T'Challa</a>, respectively, as well as a new dev diary that was released five days ago to talk about some of the decisions they've made for the upcoming hero shooter. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYSZFAZC3Kg&amp;t=22s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The dev diary</a> talks about the roadmap of the upcoming game, with the title beginning with Season 0, named "Doom's Rise." This season will be month-long, where players will get to experiment with 33 heroes and eight maps for Quick Match and Competitive modes. There will also be a Conquest map and a new Practice Range, allowing players to experiment with the superheroes before taking them into a game against other people. The Doom's Rise season is all about the chaos that is caused by Doctor Doom and his time experiments, which is also explained in the dev diary released recently.</p>
<p>Since Season 0 is so short, there will be a battle pass available, but it will have half the content of a full Seasonal Battle Pass, with the battle pass being priced accordingly for the month long season. Additionally, there is an in-game store that will have regular rotations with costumes and cosmetics inspired by the comics, MCU, and costumes that are specifically created to reflect the storyline of Marvel Rivals.</p>
<p>These costumes include the Imperial Protocol series, which has Afrofuturism roots and is representative of the empire of Wakanda. As Hawkeye is the latest character to be added to the ever-expanding roster of Marvel Rivals, he is the fourth in the story set to receive an Imperial Protocol costume, with details of the cosmetic set to be revealed sometime soon.</p>
<p>Will you be playing Marvel Rivals?</p>
