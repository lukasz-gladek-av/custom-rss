			<p>Following Randy Pitchford's social tease that the Borderlands 4 reveal would be coming soon, the official franchise page on X has now <a href="https://twitter.com/Borderlands/status/1866166006353449188?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1866166006353449188%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that the game will be shown at Geoff Keighley's The Game Awards 2024 show. The tweet also boasts how it will be the franchise's most ambitious installment to date.</p>
<p>The game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-officially-announced-for-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> at Gamescom this year for a generic 2025 release window. Other than the confirmation that it will take place on a brand new planet, not much has been shared so far. The studio did provide fans with a few concept art <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-concept-art-revealed-at-pax-west-202/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">during a panel at PAX West 2024</a>, but those were mere tidbits.</p>
<p>The series certainly needs a bit of pick-me-up following the disastrous launch of the long-awaited <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-borderlands-movie-trailer-is-finally-here-at-last/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">live action adaptation.</a> Despite the presence of actors like Cate Blanchett, Jamie Lee Curtis, Édgar Ramírez, Jack Black, and Kevin Hart, the film was a massive box office bomb (making only about a quarter of its $120 million budget back), receiving equally devastating reviews from critics and fans.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the previous game in the series sold extremely well, surpassing 18 million units last year. Undoubtedly, Gearbox owner Take Two (following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-two-buys-gearbox-for-460-million-confirms-new-borderlands-game-among-other-things/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$460 million acquisition from Embracer Group</a>) will try to match or even exceed those financial results with Borderlands 4.</p>
<p>It seems like they're going all-in with The Game Awards 2024, anyway, as another heavy hitter of their 2025 lineup <a href="https://x.com/mafiagame/status/1866165956134707406" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> it will also show a new trailer at the show. We're referring to Mafia: The Old Country, which was also <a href="https://wccftech.com/mafia-the-old-country-revealed-for-release-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> at Gamescom 2024. Developed by Hangar 13, it will function as a prequel, delving into the origins of the Mafia in the fictional Sicilian city of San Celeste.</p>
<p>Those rumors about a <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2024-will-have-big-news-says-vgcs-founder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">big The Game Awards 2024 show</a> are taking shape. As a reminder, the show will go live on Thursday, December 12, at 4:30 PM Pacific Time.</p>

And while I'll get into this more on the podcast, I must speak it into existence now: uh,<em> Indiana Jones and the Great Circle </em>is<em> good good</em>. It's an immersive sim?

Now, about 12 months later, Epic is adding a whole new Lego-themed game to <em>Fortnite </em>that looks to be directly inspired by <em>The Sims </em>and <em>GTA </em>roleplay servers. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.fortnite.com/news/lego-fortnite-brick-life-build-your-life-in-the-big-city?sessionInvalidated=true&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/lego-fortnite-brick-life-build-your-life-in-the-big-city?sessionInvalidated=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On December 9, Epic announced that<em> Lego Brick Life</em></a></span><em> </em>will be released on December 12 as a free game in <em>Fortnite</em>. It will be available on Xbox, PlayStation, PC, and Switch in all countries where <em>Fortnite </em>is available, with the exception of South Korea. </p><p>Here’s the first gameplay trailer for <em>Brick Life</em>: </p><p>In <em>Brick Life</em>, you’ll be able to work various jobs to earn money that you can spend on buying a house, decorations, clothes, and more. Players will be able to hang out with friends and use text chat to communicate while living in a bricky new city filled with things to do and a day-night cycle. The game will support drivable vehicles and hoverboards, too.</p><p>And if you think I’m just doing the video game blogger thing of sticking <em>GTA </em>in a headline to get more clicks, look at this tweet from Epic’s official <em>Lego Fortnite</em> Twitter account. It’s clearly referencing a certain famous <em>GTA: San Andreas </em>meme and <em>GTA</em> <em>6</em>'s now-famous artwork. </p><p>Yeah, Epic is definitely targeting teens and kids who love <em>GTA </em>roleplay servers and the <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> series with this new game mode. And that makes sense. Roleplay servers in <em>Roblox</em>, <em>Fortnite</em>, and<em> GTA V </em>are incredibly popular. The kids love to live out the fantasy of having a stable job and owning a home in a world where you don’t have to worry about healthcare costs. </p><p><em>Brick Life</em> launches on December 12 in <em>Fortnite</em>.

Marcin Momot, Global Community Director at CD Projekt, <a href="https://x.com/Marcin360/status/1866151943736897724" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> to say “the team still has some gas in the tank.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s all we know for now, although CD Projekt teased big things, saying: “Get ready, chooms! It's gonna be 🔥”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>📢 REDstreams alert 📢</p><p>Join us for a new episode of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/REDstreams?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#REDstreams</a>, where we'll dive deep into the new features Coming Soon TM for Cyberpunk 2077 in Update 2.2!</p><p>See you tomorrow at 5 PM CET on our Twitch and, for the first time ever, simultaneously on our YouTube channel.… <a href="https://t.co/gxABDNpQN2" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/gxABDNpQN2</a></p></div>— Cyberpunk 2077 (@CyberpunkGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1866150925678657589?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 9, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">We do know, however, that there are <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cd-projekt-rules-out-cyberpunk-2077-ps5-pro-patch">no plans for a PlayStation 5 Pro update for Cyberpunk 2077</a>. Nor is New Game Plus coming to the game. Momot confirmed in a subsequent <a href="https://x.com/Marcin360/status/1866161075281863141" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweet</a>: "A lot of questions about whether PS5 Pro support and NG+ are coming with Cyberpunk 2077 Patch 2.2. The answer is no. We do have some other cool stuff in the oven and we’ll talk about it tomorrow during the stream — we hope you’ll like it too! Appreciate the patience🙏"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, CD Projekt said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-4-enters-full-scale-production-cyberpunk-2077-hits-30-million-copies-sold"><u>The Witcher 4</u> had entered full-scale production</a>, with Project Polaris - the first instalment in the new Witcher trilogy - progressing from preproduction to full-scale production.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I’m proud to confirm that several weeks ago the Polaris team wrapped up preproduction and moved on to full-scale production – the most intensive phase of development,” commented joint CEO Michał Nowakowski. “We are very pleased with our progress on this project, and I wish to thank the team for its dedication.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I'm thrilled to announce that Project Polaris has entered the full-scale production phase," game director Sebastian Kalemba <a href="https://x.com/Skalemba/status/1861446070858846571" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>tweeted</u></a>. "With new challenges just around the corner, it’s the talented and hard-working people who make me believe we can together make the upcoming Witcher Saga a remarkable experience. No stopping now! Stay tuned for what’s on the other side of the coin!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">CD Projekt currently has 400 developers working on Polaris, the majority of its 650-person total development staff. That's down from the 410 reported at the end of July. 64 are working on Orion, the sequel to Cyberpunk 2077, 42 on Sirius, The Witcher game developed by The Molasses Flood, and 18 on Hadar, CD Projekt's brand new IP. It seems that the developer also had a few members of staff tucked away making this new Cyberpunk 2077 update.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The news comes as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/cyberpunk-2077"><u>Cyberpunk 2077</u></a> hit an astonishing 30 million copies sold, with the Phantom Liberty expansion selling over eight million. CD Projekt pointed to “strong sales” of both as well as The Witcher 3 during its recent third quarter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“In less than four years since release we’ve already sold 30 million copies of Cyberpunk 2077, and as for Phantom Liberty – in just over a year it has sold over eight million copies,” Nowakowski added. “These are impressive figures. I’m very happy to see a large, dedicated community coalesce around our Cyberpunk games. In the coming year the base game, along with its expansion, will be released to a new group of users: owners of Mac devices powered by Apple Silicon chips."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Peanut butter and chocolate. Movie theaters and popcorn. The Cleveland Browns and failure. By all rights, Power Rangers and a mid-90s arcade beat ‘em up should also be on that list. It just seems like something written in the book that determines cosmic history, willed into existence by a higher power. But it never happened. Yes, there were a couple of middling <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mighty-morphin-power-rangers-snes">SNES/Genesis sidescrollers</a>, but like most console beat ‘em ups at the time, they were limited by their at-home hardware. We never got a proper, glorious four-to-six player arcade cabinet, or even a game designed like it was made for one. At least, not until now. With Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita’s Rewind, developer Digital Eclipse has taken it upon itself to give us the Turtles in Time/X-Men/The Simpsons-style Power Rangers beat ‘em up we never got. A couple underwhelming gimmick sections mean Rita’s Rewind doesn’t quite manage to carve out a place for itself amongst the genre’s all-timers, but it is a pretty great beat ‘em up that’ll make you want to suit up and take a trip back through time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As someone who absolutely loves arcade-style brawlers like this but doesn’t have much nostalgia for Power Rangers specifically, trust me when I say you don’t need to know “The Lore™” to follow Rita’s Rewind. In the distant future, the year 2023, Robo Rita decides to go back in time with her past self, Rita Repulsa, and take out the Power Rangers. The 2023 lineup can’t stop her, so it’s up to the original 1993 crew to step up and take care of business. (Time travel, baby! We’re making diagrams out of straws.) The story is pretty simple here, but it allows Digital Eclipse to write in some funny moments and interactions (the Ritas, despite working together, don’t get along) and put certain enemies in areas they shouldn’t be. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That setup also adds to the whole “this is a 90s arcade game” feel, just like the CRT filters, excellent, guitar-heavy soundtrack that can stand beside the genre’s best, and the absolutely stunning pixel art. Arcade games like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time and X-Men – as well as modern follow-ups like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-shredders-revenge-review"><u>Shredder’s Revenge</u></a> – worked in part because they nailed a vibe, not because their stories made logical sense, and Rita’s Rewind gets that. You’re not here for the lore; you’re here to kick some butt as a Power Ranger.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a lot of ways, RIta’s Rewind adheres to the standards of the modern, retro-style beat ‘em up. The gameplay isn’t overly complex: you’ve got a basic attack combo, a throw if some mook gets too close for comfort, a double jump, rising and falling attacks, a running kick, a dodge, and a screen-clearing super attack you can unleash once your meter is full. If you want to pull off a sick combo beyond that, you’d better be playing with a friend who is willing to throw dudes at you so you can juggle ‘em. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/streets-of-rage-4-review"><u>Streets of Rage 4</u></a> this ain’t.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It's a beat ‘em up built on the fundamentals that make the genre great.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">What it is, then, is a three-hour beat ‘em up built on the fundamentals that make the genre great: characters that are just interesting enough (the Rangers — Red, Blue, Yellow, Black, and Pink — are more or less the same functionally), enemies that are fun to fight, cool environments that range from a theme park to a toxic waste dump, enticing Easter eggs and unlockables to hunt down, and unique boss fights, like the excellent one against Bones or the goofy brawl with Chunky Chicken. Rita’s Rewind has all of that. It feels great to play, the levels are memorable, the enemies force you to adapt on the fly, and the bosses are a ton of fun. And, of course, it’s all even better in co-op – as of launch, you can play with up to six people locally (except for on PlayStation, which is currently capped at four, but Digital Eclipse plans to bring that number up to six in a future update), though unfortunately online co-op is still to come in a free post-release update and will be limited to two players when it does arrive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All that is to say: beat ‘em ups are kind of a magic trick, the secret sauce can be hard to identify, but you’ll know when it’s not there. In Rita’s Rewind? It’s definitely there. But Digital Eclipse wasn’t content to just trot out a good Power Rangers-themed brawler and call it a day. One of Rita’s Rewind’s highlights is its Super Scaler segments, which plop you into either the cockpit of the Megazord, the driver’s seat of a motorcycle, or behind the controls of your own individual Zord. These sections are, for the most part, pretty great, though certain ones can be frustrating.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In general, they operate like arcade classic <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2009/06/24/space-harrier-arcade-review"><u>Space Harrier</u></a>. You zoom toward the screen through a pseudo-3D level, chasing down a boss that Rita has jumbo-sized after you’ve beaten them in a fistfight, or just rolling through Putties if you’re on your bike. These sections are both visually impressive and a ton of fun as you dodge incoming fire, shoot down enemies, and acquire power-ups like missiles or the Double Shot. I loved all of the motorcycle segments, but the Dinozord ones were more mixed, partially because of some pretty crazy difficulty spikes. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Taking the wrong hit or missing a jump in your Zord can cost you one of your limited lives, and it’s hard to dodge all of the stuff coming at you because there’s often so much on-screen at once. Certain Zord segments took my co-op partner and I several tries just because we kept losing lives to single hits or missed jumps. When they work, these segments are great, and provide some interesting differentiation between characters (the Pink Ranger’s pterodactyl is unique in that it can fly, for instance, making it easier to avoid attacks). When they don’t, however, they can be pretty miserable. Every continue I spent during Rita’s Rewind was in a Zord level. There’s certainly more good than bad here, but the bad… well, it’s notable.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Super Scaler levels can be a bit of a mixed bag.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Megazord sections, which serve as the cap to any given boss fight, are also more mixed. You can’t lose during these encounters, which is awesome, but they can be frustrating in a different way. You pilot the Megazord in first person, dodging the boss’s ranged attacks and charged strikes until you can get close enough to land some punches, which charges your Power Sword, in stages, for the final blow. Getting hit knocks you back and you lose any charge in a stage you haven’t fully built up (and in co-op, taking enough hits switches pilots, as well). That’s all fine and good, but the issue is that the boss can just jump away from you when you get close, so your goal is not only to get in without making too many mistakes, you also have to get lucky and hope the boss actually lets you punch them. And if you’re bad at dodging their projectiles, it can get very old, very quickly, especially in co-op. (In another bizarre twist, these levels add a lot more to your score than the beat ‘em up levels do, which feels odd given that Rita’s Rewind is a beat ‘em up first and foremost.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So the Super Scaler levels are a mixed bag, but the additional one-off ideas certainly aren’t. Whether it’s a Super Scaler section aboard a rollercoaster, the obligatory elevator level, or wild time travel mechanics, Rita’s Rewind is at its best when it's experimenting. Take the time travel, for instance. Sometimes, Rita’s goons will have large tanks carrying the crystals that make time travel possible – damaging these tanks will cause time to rewind, putting you and your enemies in exactly the same place you were before the attack. It also resets your super bar, so you can spend it, trigger the rewind, and do it all over again until you take out the crystal. It encourages smart play while livening up otherwise standard encounters.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Will's Favorite Licensed Games</h3><p>A list of the best licensed games unfit to print.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of cool one-offs, between missions you’ll hang out at the Juice Bar, where you can talk to professional losers Bulk and Skull, check in with Ernie, and see how any of the characters you’ve rescued over the course of the adventure, like Mr. Caplan and Ms. Appleby, are doing. The coolest thing about the Juice Bar, though, is the arcade games you can play. These are brand new, original games designed to answer one simple question: what arcade games <em>were</em> the Power Rangers playing during their downtime? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each one is missing a part, but if you find it out in one of Rita’s Rewind’s levels, you unlock that game for good. They’re pretty grand, whether you’re playing Karate Chopshop (think Mortal Kombat’s Test Your Might), Drive Bomber (a racing game where you try to blow up other cars and avoid the damage your bombs cause), or Nanopilot (Asteroids, but you’re trying to protects cells from invading viruses). They’re really fun, and my co-op partner and I often found ourselves stopping by for a run or two between missions. If I have one complaint about the Juice Bar, it’s that I wish you could change Rangers here between missions instead of having to back all the way out and re-select your save file. That’s kind of a bummer, especially since there’s no option to switch Rangers if you need to use a continue.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, Rita’s Rewind isn’t short on replay value. Beating the campaign unlocks the Green Ranger to enable that sixth (currently non-PlayStation) co-op slot, and there’s high scores to chase, S-ranks and deathless runs to achieve, new difficulties to conquer, collectibles to find, and a speed run mode. There’s plenty to do here after you’ve rolled credits for the first time, and I can see Rita’s Rewind becoming a staple in my beat ‘em up library.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita’s Rewind nails the look and feel of both Power Rangers and the classic arcade games it’s drawing inspiration from. While the Super Scaler levels can be a bit of a mixed bag, they sing when they work, and they’re still only manageably frustrating when they don’t. Everything else, though, rules — the gorgeous sprite work, bumping soundtrack, rock-solid beat ‘em up gameplay, in-jokes for fans, and other little touches like playable in-universe arcade games. And while nostalgia will certainly enhance the experience for some, you don’t have to know your Green Ranger from your Black Ranger to enjoy it. It might even give you an itch to revisit the classic games, or give the original television series a watch. You may not be able to go down to your local arcade anymore, but if Rita’s Rewind is any indication, you can always go back in time. Just pack some spandex.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The itch.io domain was back up and running by 7 am Eastern, according to media reports, "after the registrant finally responded to our notice and took appropriate action to resolve the issue." Users could access the site throughout if they typed the itch.io IP address into their web browser directly.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.brandshield.com/">BrandShield's website</a> describes it as a service that "detects and hunts online trademark infringement, counterfeit sales, and brand abuse across multiple platforms.” The company claims to have multiple Fortune 500 and FTSE100 companies on its client list.</p>
<p>In its own series of social media posts, BrandShield <a href="https://x.com/BrandShieldltd/status/1866143933320892707">said</a> its "AI-driven platform" had identified "an abuse of Funko... from an itch.io subdomain." The takedown request it filed was focused on that subdomain, not the entirety of itch.io, BrandShield said.</p>
<p>"The temporary takedown of the website was a decision made by the service providers, not BrandShield or Funko."</p>
<p>The whole affair highlights how the delicate web of domain registrars and DNS servers can remain a key failure point for web-based businesses. Back in May, we saw how the desyncing of a single DNS root server <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/05/dns-glitch-that-threatened-internet-stability-fixed-cause-remains-unclear/">could cause problems across the entire Internet</a>.

<p>Fortnite’s Discover section now has a unique LEGO Fortnite Category, where players can find Odyssey and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-fortnites-brick-life-game-mode-arrives-this-december/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brick Life</a> as the new game modes. In Odyssey, players will find that the Storm King has invaded the world, and it’s up to them and their friends to take care of him and his storm-wild legion, which Raven leads.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-lego-fortnite-storm-chasers-update-nbsp">LEGO Fortnite Storm Chasers Update&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Your new LEGO Fortnite Odyssey journey will begin at Storm Chaser village, where you meet characters like Carl Ruckus and Dr. Borrasca. Then, you will head out into the storms, where Storm Dungeons are located. Within these dungeons, you will find fragments of Storm King’s power that must be destroyed to loosen his control over the world. The enemies you are up against include the Acolytes, Raven and The Storm King himself.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-new-gameplay-mechanics">New Gameplay Mechanics</h2>



<p>LEGO Fortnite Odyssey’s Storm Chasers Update also introduces a set of new gameplay mechanics. Enemy health has been balanced, along with their health and damage points. Component-based crafting has been introduced, bringing more flexibility when choosing which materials to use. The Legendary Forge is an upgrade station that you can use to take your tools to the next level.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, other players and NPCs can now revive players to get them back into the action. There are new vehicle-guided builds, such as the ‘Lil’ Barge’ and ‘Storm Chaser’. Lastly, LEGO Fortnite Odyssey is fully compatible with split-screen on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/6-steps-to-a-successful-playtesting-process-for-an-indie-developer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Player feedback is a powerful resource. It plays a key role in creating products that truly connect with the audience. While this might seem like an obvious point, such oversights happen far more often than you'd expect.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Many indie developers fall into the trap of trying to create a one-in-a-million game, forgetting that complexity doesn’t always equal success. To this, our team is no exception.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We have seen how quickly players can give up on a game if it feels unnecessarily difficult. Just days before one of our release, after reading a particularly critical pre-release review, we made the decision to halve the game's difficulty. We increased the resources and experience available to players while significantly reducing the strength of the enemies.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But even after that, Highfleet (the aforementioned release) proved to be too difficult for some players. This challenge isn’t unique to us – studios behind games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Rain World</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> have grappled with similar feedback. This always happens due to the common cognitive bias: what feels obvious to the creator can be completely baffling to the player, leading to frustration and a skewed perception of the game. Here, the only solution is extensive testing and diligent gathering of user feedback.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Before you jump to conclusions — playtesting isn’t always costly. Indie developers on a tight budget start by testing games </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>for free</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: involving friends, acquaintances or fans. Later, when there's a bit more room for some spending, developers use </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>low-cost methods</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> like questionnaires and surveys. What’s in it for the people? Participants can be rewarded with game bonuses or free access to the full version after release.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Professional</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> playtesting, which is the most expensive option, is typically reserved for targeting specific audiences (with the help of professional testing services), testing complex or large-scale games, or preparing for a multi-platform release.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Regardless of the budget, these six steps will guide indie developers toward receiving effective and valuable feedback.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="1. Prepare for the test."><span>1. Prepare for the test.</span><br></h3><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Define the key elements</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> of the game to be tested (control, level balance). Some early development stages test basic mechanics or player reactions to the general idea.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Conduct playtesting consistently</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, without trying to test everything at once. This can reduce the quality of received feedback. Try to choose one or two aspects to test per session. For example, test the usability of the controls in the first stage and the difficulty of the levels in the next stage.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Formulate specific questions: </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Is it easy to understand the controls? Is the user interface clear? Which parts of the game felt boring or frustrating?</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Without proper preparation, feedback can end up vague (e.g., "the graphics could be better," "the controls feel awkward," or "the interface is confusing").</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Such feedback doesn’t address the core issues. For example, what specifically needs improvement in the graphics — is it the style, texture quality, or overall atmosphere?&nbsp; Similarly, what makes the controls feel awkward — is it the character’s sluggishness, the button layout, or delayed responsiveness?</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Establish clear success criteria.</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> This makes playtesting as objective as possible and allows you to measure how effectively players interact with aspects of the game. Criteria will help focus on key data, eliminating subjective and scattered feedback, and saving time on analysis. For example: </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>90%</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> of players should be able to understand the controls within the first 3 minutes without any explanation (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>ease of mastery), </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">players should be able to use all basic mechanics such as movement, jumping, and interaction within the first 5 minutes (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>usage).</span></span></p></div></li></ul></div><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="2. Build a playable demo or early access version."><span>2. Build a playable demo or early access version.</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The goal of a demo is to offer a focused, polished experience that represents the core elements of the game, enticing players while also providing enough context for actionable feedback.&nbsp; When creating a demo, several important factors need the team’s careful consideration:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Stability:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> The demo version must run without critical bugs. This means that key mechanics (such as movement, object interaction, or combat) should function without errors that prevent players from completing the game or understanding its core concept.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Focus:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Concentrate on the aspects you want to test. For example, if you're testing the controls, include a simple level where players can learn and test the character's movements. Avoid overloading the demo with unnecessary content that distracts from the goal.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Clarity:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Ensure that players understand how to play. This can be achieved through an introductory tutorial (e.g., hints showing the controls) and a clear objective (e.g., "Collect all items and complete the level"). This eliminates confusion and allows testers to focus on the game.</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The game demo should be short enough to maintain interest but long enough to showcase the key aspects of the game. The optimal duration is 15–30 minutes, depending on the genre and testing objectives. This time allows players to explore the core mechanics, and understand the overall style and atmosphere, but not get tired or lose interest.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If the demo is too short (e.g., 5–10 minutes), players might not have enough time to immerse themselves in the game or appreciate its potential. On the other hand, if it’s too long (e.g., 1–2 hours), players can become fatigued, especially if the tested content is repetitive or lacks a clear conclusion.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The perfect balance would be a limited amount of content, showcasing the most important elements of the game, such as controls, core mechanics, and unique features. Plus, an ending with an engaging moment that leaves the player intrigued and eager for the full version.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="3. Create channels for player feedback to conduct surveys and encourage playtesting at different stages of development."><span>3. Create channels for player feedback to conduct surveys and encourage playtesting at different stages of development.</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Choosing the right platform to test your game is crucial because it determines what kind of audience you will attract, what data you will collect, and how useful it will be for improving your project. Different platforms provide access to different types of players, from a creative community for early prototypes to a mass audience for testing final versions.

			<p>When it comes to early 3D gaming classics, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver">Soul Reaver</a> is definitely up there. It may not have become as prolific a series as, say, T<a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/tomb-raider">omb Raider</a> or <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a> yet it definitely had something special, so much so that fans have been pining for a new Legacy of Kain game for more than two decades.</p>
<p><iframe title="Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1 &amp; 2 Remastered - Launch Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LpKy31RzDBA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>To celebrate the original game’s 25th anniversary, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/crystal-dynamics">Crystal Dynamics</a> has teamed up with <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/aspyr">Aspyr</a> to remaster Soul Reaver and its 2001 sequel. But is Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1&amp;2 Remastered the definitive way to experience these games? The short answer is yes, though the makeover isn’t as thorough as we’ve come to expect from modern remasters, and the experience is hampered by bugs and the absence of a major quality of life feature.</p>


<p>For those completely new to the series, Soul Reaver isn’t the first Legacy of Kain title. It all started a few years earlier with the release of Blood Omen, a top-down action adventure game that cast players as a noble-turned-vampire whose quest for revenge leads to a seismic upheaval within the gothic lands of Nosgoth. On the cusp of restoring balance, Kain is offered a choice: sacrifice himself to save the world, or condemn it to oblivion.</p>
<p>In Soul Reaver, the developers chose to make Blood Omen’s bad ending canon, thrusting the narrative forward several centuries. Suspecting that his chief vampire lieutenant will one day surpass him, Kain murders our hero Raziel, who is then risen by an Elder God to embark on a revenge odyssey of his own.</p>


<p>The Legacy of Kain boasts a rich narrative and setting that, at the time, seemed a strange fit for a 3D action game. The superb performances of Soul Reaver’s voice cast serves to elevate this, especially Michael Bell’s monologuing as Raziel throughout which is even more prevalent in the sequel. There’s a gothic grittiness to the presentation of these games too, spliced with themes of dark magic and decadence.</p>
<p>Aspyr’s remasters feature improved character models, textures, and effects, though the end result is surprisingly subtle. In some instances, especially when playing Soul Reaver 2, toggling between the new and original graphics (which can be done at any time with a single button press) offers a granular improvement rather than a noticeable facelift. With that said, the work done to character models is impressive and avoids masking over the charm of the original games.</p>

<p>Other enhancements include the option for modern control and camera movement. A new map and compass have also been added to the game’s UI though have a limited impact on actually helping you navigate Soul Reaver’s maze-like world. This has always been a weak point; without any real signposting, it’s easy to get lost in Nosgoth and work out where you need to head next. This isn’t helped by the fact that Raziel is returned to a hub area whenever loading a save, forcing players to trace a path back to wherever they left off. In some cases, this can mean replaying pretty large chunks of the game.</p>
<p>This is compounded by game-breaking bugs found within the remasters. On a couple of occasions I lost more than a hour’s progress to random crashes, which begs the question: why didn’t Aspyr work to improve Soul Reaver’s save and checkpoint systems? It’s an oversight made only more apparent by the fact that Blood Omen and its sequel were both released only days ago on PlayStation 5, both enhanced with quick save, quick load, and rewind features.</p>

<p>As for the gameplay it’s serviceable, though the original Soul Reaver is really showing its age. The sequel certainly holds up better with a greater emphasis on dynamic combat that transcends the original game’s basic button bashing. There are still some interesting ideas at play, however, such Raziel’s ability to switch between planes. This mechanic seamlessly morphs the world around him, exposing hidden secrets and creating new pathways.</p>
<p>For die-hard Nosgoth nerds, there’s plenty of bonus material too such as galleries for original concept art and renders, as well as full scripts for both games. There are even a clutch of “Lost Levels” but don’t get too excited – these amount to a handful of unfinished 3D environments cut from the original game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/my-first-video-game-concert-was-pretty-cool<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Over the weekend, my friends took me to see a <a href="https://www.bam.org/installation/2024/journey" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">live performance</a> of the soundtrack for <em>Journey</em>, where a group of players went through the game while composer Austin Wintory directed an orchestra alongside them. I’ve never been to a video game concert before, and now I want to know everything about how video game soundtracks are made.</p><p><em>Journey</em>, you may remember, is an indie game that came out for PS3 in 2012 and made waves for its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/13/22972989/journey-10-year-anniversary-multiplayer-jenova-chen-austin-wintory" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiplayer element</a>, where a stranger could show up in your game to accompany you across the sandy landscape. You were limited in how you could interact, and the whole experience was pretty revelatory for the time. The game ultimately came to PC in 2019, but when it first released I didn’t own a console, so my familiarity with it is mostly playing a bit of it at the house of the friends who took me to the concert. I hadn’t played any multiplayer games with strangers back then, so I remember the fascination and nerves that filled me when another player appeared in my game, and my curiosity and relief when we could only communicate through movement and musical chirps.&nbsp;</p><p>Wintory conducted the <a href="https://www.americancomposers.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Composers Orchestra</a>, which prominently featured a very excellent cello soloist who made me miss playing the cello. The game showed on a giant screen behind them, while players seated to the side took turns trading off the controller. I split my time between watching the gameplay and staring at the orchestra, wondering what it was like to follow a score that had to line up to someone playing the game in real time. At one point, a player missed a jump, and the orchestra seamlessly looped the music to keep it in time. Sometimes the experience felt like watching a Let’s Play at home; at other times, it felt like watching a concert.</p><p>As the end credits rolled, the user names of several players appeared on the screen. My friends and I assumed they were real players who just happened to be online and matched up with the concert, which was kind of wild to contemplate. Who was playing <em>Journey</em> on a Saturday afternoon in 2024? Would they ever imagine that hundreds of people had watched them live, including the game’s composer?&nbsp;</p><p>I’m ashamed to admit I’ve never thought super hard about how video game scores work on a compositional level. In many games, a player could spend unlimited time in an area, so how do you structure a score that doesn’t have a defined length like a song would? When you play <em>Journey</em>, the music <a href="https://www.polygon.com/videos/2019/11/18/20970945/journey-ending-soundtrack-austin-wintory-interview-video" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">responds </a>to where you are, what you’re doing, and whether there’s another player. I’ve always just kind of thought “yeah, that’s a thing video game music does” and considered the technical aspect of how it’s implemented in a game, without ever thinking much about how someone <em>writes</em> a score that can do that. As Wintory told <a href="https://egmnow.com/playing-your-song-the-evolution-of-dynamic-music-in-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EGM</a> in 2019:</p><blockquote><p>The issue [with dynamic scores] is reconciling the player agency with some sort of musicality… Music is by definition a linear art form, playing out over time. Great music (and great performers) leverage that to take you on emotional adventures. When that passage of time is subject to tinkering, it can destroy the storytelling instantly. My goal is always to find a way to preserve the best of what traditionally linear music can offer (particularly with regards to storytelling) while giving the player maximum agency in the process.&nbsp;</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Combining a performance of the soundtrack, which could easily just be static, with the elements of gameplay, which require responsiveness and change, was way cooler to witness than I expected it to be when my friends invited me. A video game music concert is definitely not something I would have gone to on my own, and I’m really glad I went. </p><p>I know at least some of you are video game music composers, so please fill the comments with notes about your creative process, which I will read and then respond to with phrases like “gosh!” and “wow!” because, outside of <a href="https://aftermath.site/let-humans-not-ai-be-bad-at-music" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">writing a few little songs</a> on guitar, my only experience with arranging is from high school music theory, wherein I attempted to create a band version of the Counting Crows song “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Bxohwsx14Q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Raining in Baltimore</a>” for an assignment, but failed utterly.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Grand Theft Auto 6 is going to be among the biggest video game launches of all time, if not the biggest, and its release window, which is still up in the air with a potential 2026 delay, is already influencing the video game industry as a whole.</p>
<p>In a new report posted on <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-09/-gta-6-release-date-will-decide-much-of-the-2025-game-calendar?embedded-checkout=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg</a> today, it has been revealed that anticipation surrounding the game is so high that competing video game publishers are waiting as long as they can before committing to Fall 2025 release dates for their games, as they want to see if Grand Theft Auto 6 will indeed release next year or if it will slip into 2025, and want to launch their games as far from it as possible. This is far from surprising, considering how analysts expect it to be the<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-expected-to-be-the-biggest-entertainment-launch-of-all-time-but-a-performance-below-expectations-could-impact-the-entire-industry/"> biggest entertainment launch of all time</a>, which could have a massive impact on the entire industry, and not just in terms of release timings.</p>
<p>It has been some time since Rockstar Games discussed Grand Theft Auto 6. Back in May, publisher Take-Two confirmed that the game was still on track for a Fall 2025 release on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S but has said nothing since. The game's <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-not-delayed/">ambitious nature could make it slip into 2026</a>, but for the time being, the game's release window hasn't been changed.</p>
<p>Those who want to experience Grand Theft Auto 6 at its very best, however, will have to wait longer than everyone else, as a PC release, which is undoubtedly coming at some point, has yet to be officially confirmed. Compromises will likely be made on consoles, and even the PlayStation 5 Pro may not be able to run the game at <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-60-fps-playstation-5-pro/">60 FPS</a> if the game is targeting 30 FPS on the base model, mostly due to CPU limitations.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[God of War Ragnarok Art Director Raf Grassetti Joins Naughty Dog]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/god-of-war-ragnarok-art-director-raf-grassetti-joins-naughty-dog.1055874/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/raf-grassetti-naughty-dog<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>God of War Ragnarok&nbsp;</em>art director Raf Grassetti has joined up with&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Uncharted&nbsp;</em>developer Naughty Dog.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/rafagrassetti/status/1866135153497768034" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post on social media platform X</a>&nbsp;earlier today, Grassetti shared a picture of the Naughty Dog logo, together with the simple caption "new chapter" to announce that he'd signed up with the studio.</p>

<p>It's likely that Grassetti will be working on Naughty Dog's next project, which is almost certainly the same game Neil Druckmann <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1gr42v6/neil_druckmann_says_his_current_project_has_been/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">said has been in development since 2020</a> last month, although we don't know any more about the game than that yet, unfortunately.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/raf-grassetti-naughty-dog-sculpture.jpg?itok=zu-Y20et 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/raf-grassetti-naughty-dog-sculpture.jpg?itok=g657UAyy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Raf Grassetti is perhaps best known for his work on the two most recent&nbsp;<em>God of War&nbsp;</em>games.</figcaption></figure><p>As for Grassetti, he's probably best known as the art director on 2022's&nbsp;<em>God of War Ragnarok</em>, having served as an artist on the 2018 predecessor as well. If you loved the art direction of Kratos' latest adventure, you've got Grassetti to thank, at least in part.</p>

<p>Of course, that's not all the work Grassetti has done in the gaming industry. After <a href="https://x.com/rafagrassetti/status/1659618787036110848" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">leaving Sony in May 2023</a>, Grassetti joined up with Netflix to create "a brand-new studio and AAA multiplatform game", although it seems like he may have been one of the casualties when Netflix <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-team-blue-shut-down-report" rel="nofollow">shut down "Team Blue" in October</a>.</p>

<p>Prior to his time with Sony, Grassetti worked as a character artist on projects like BioWare's&nbsp;<em>Mass Effect 3</em>, Ubisoft's&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Origins</em>, and CD Projekt Red's&nbsp;<em>The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings</em>, among many others. Suffice it to say he's an old industry hand.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/god-of-war-ragnarok-raf-grassetti.jpg?itok=MCCxfEcq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/god-of-war-ragnarok-raf-grassetti.jpg?itok=g-X3sfu1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you loved&nbsp;<em>God of War Ragnarok</em>'s art direction, you have Raf Grassetti to thank.</figcaption></figure><p>Since Naughty Dog is a Sony subsidiary, Grassetti is effectively coming home to Sony, although he'll technically be working under different management in this new position.</p>

<p>As for Naughty Dog itself, it's currently working on at least one as-yet unannounced project.</p>

<p>Given that the studio moved towards <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/last-of-us-online-canceled-as-naughty-dog-works-on-more-than-one-ambitious-single" rel="nofollow">focusing exclusively on single-player games</a> back in December last year, it's likely the new game won't be a multiplayer live-service affair, which, given one of Sony's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-shuts-down-two-studios-including-concord-creator" rel="nofollow">more recent high-profile failures</a>, is probably for the best.</p>

            <p>Fancy taking the piss out of video games? Here you go, a fun little tool you can run in your browser easily lets you rewrite famous game quotes. <a href="https://deathgenerator.com/#gallery">The Death Generator</a> offers a gallery full of (mostly) retro games and a simple text box that will replicate the exact font used by those games, all so you can make the little shopkeeper in Zelda say rude words, or entirely rewrite the pre-mission dossiers of Goldeneye 007. There's a lot more than that though. I've done a bunch, come see what I mean and have a go yourself.</p>

<p>You can mess about with the FBI warning that famously told every arcade visitor in the United States (and beyond) that "Winners don't do drugs". You can play with Dracula's existentialist screed in Castlevania: Symphony Of The Night. Or reimagine the letter Princess Peach sends to her plumber pal in Super Mario 64. </p>

<p>But my favourite is probably <a href="https://deathgenerator.com/#mgs">the Metal Gear Solid one</a>, because it not only lets you re-type the text of your codec conversations, it also lets you customise who is in the call. You can make up conversations with Otacon, Mei Ling, the Colonel, Meryl, and Naomi - it even lets you choose how many bars of reception is showing. The attention to detail is admirable.</p>

<p>You can also just type in a small phrase and hit a dice button to cycle through the screens at random, just to see how your words might fit if, say, Sub-Zero were speaking them.

<p>The tool is made by programmer "Foone" who shared it <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/foone.bsky.social/post/3lcro77ertc2t">on Bluesky</a>. "I've got 270 games in it so far and I'm adding more all the time," they said on the social media site. "The most recent one is the GBA <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-hearts">Kingdom Hearts</a> game,  Chain of Memories.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/all-marvel-rivals-leaked-characters/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The topic of Marvel Rivals and leaked characters is unlikely to ever go away. While the community rightly lauds the current crop of heroes, everyone is keeping an eye on the next superhero to grace our screens. So, we’ve taken a trip to the rumor mill, and unearthed every bit of gossip pertaining to new Marvel Rivals heroes.</p>



<p>Heroes were the big selling point of the Marvel Rivals launch. While Marvel is blessed with a cornucopia of iconic characters, the initial <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-character-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hero list</a> could have impacted Marvel Rivals in different ways. Thankfully, players seem to be enjoying the content, and this is evident with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-10-million-players-count/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10 million players in Rivals’ first three days</a>.</p>



<p>You can’t sit around and bask in your success in the live-service market though. Times move quickly, attention spans shrink, and you need new content in the pipeline. This is where Marvel Rivals leaked characters are a big selling point of the shooters’ future, and any info is helpful.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-marvel-rivals-leaked-character">Every Marvel Rivals Leaked Character</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Don’t get used to the status quo. Credit to NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p>So far, <strong>12 new Marvel Rivals characters have leaked</strong>, and the speculated names span various Marvel franchises: <strong>Fantastic Four, The Avengers, Captain Marvel, and X-Men</strong>.</p>



<p>We’ve already discovered <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-leaks-reveals-details-about-ultron-and-the-thing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ultron and The Thing</a> are destined for Marvel Rivals, but this is a small mackerel of what’s allegedly to come. The leaks come courtesy of various X social media sources including <a href="https://x.com/RivalsLeaks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Marvel Rivals — Leaks</a>, <a href="https://x.com/Facio_Leaks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Matfacio | Leaker of games</a>, <a href="https://x.com/mmmmmmmmiller" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Miller Ross</a>, and <a href="https://x.com/FumoLeaks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fumo Leaks</a>.</p>



<p>Here is every leaked Marvel Rivals character so far, and their attached Marvel franchise.</p>



<ul>
<li>Angela</li>



<li>Blade</li>



<li>Captain Marvel</li>



<li>Emma Frost</li>



<li>Hit-Monkey</li>



<li>Jean Grey AKA Phoenix</li>



<li>Johnny Storm  AKA Human Torch</li>



<li>Knull</li>



<li>Mister Fantastic</li>



<li>Susan Storm AKA Invisible Woman</li>



<li>The Thing</li>



<li>Ultron</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Knull</strong> was seen in the Season 0: Dooms’ Rise Official Trailer, so his debut is very likely. The rest of the rumored characters are all datamines and speculation.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MarvelRivals"></a>In addition to these potential heroes, I’ve also seen Daredevil discussed, but only in memes showing his gameplay to be nothing but a blank screen—if you know, you know. Otherwise, these 12 names are the common heroes outed by leakers, and datamines have revealed info about each including movesets and Team-Up abilities.</p>



<p>Interestingly, there’s still no mention of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/do-we-know-when-doctor-doom-is-coming-to-marvel-rivals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Doctor Doom</a>—a hero we’ve discussed before in great detail. The villainous Victor was the heartbeat of the No One Rivals Doom trailer on Jul. 26, and also the Dooms’ Rise video. There’s still no confirmation of his arrival yet though, so we’ll keep our eyes peeled.</p>

Path of Exile 2’s next hotfix reduces its damage. “Note that this isn't the only skill on our radar right now but we're really just trying to address egregious cases at the moment,” GGG said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We're currently playing alongside you all and are also collating a lot of your feedback that we'll be addressing as much as possible in the upcoming week once the team is back in the office before the holidays.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And then, on December 9, GGG <a href="https://x.com/pathofexile/status/1865939374304886931" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> it's “a bit too easy” to detonate Gas Cloud explosions when combined with persistent Ignite skills like Flame Wall. Yet another upcoming hotfix will nerf explosion damage of both Gas Grenade and Gas Arrow.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“In the future, we want to update it such that the potency of the Ignite or Detonator contributes to determining the damage of the Gas Cloud explosions, that way we would be able to avoid balancing around the simplest and most efficient way to apply Ignites,” GGG explained.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Path of Exile 2 is GGG’s action role-playing sequel set years after the original game. Players return to the world of Wraeclast and seek to end a spreading corruption, with six character classes, each with two Ascendancy Classes, available to play at the launch of Early Access. There’s co-op for up to six players, but you can play solo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It launched across PC via Steam, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S on December 6 and immediately ran into server issues that prevented players from logging in. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-never-expected-things-to-go-this-big-during-early-access-path-of-exile-2-dev-braces-itself-for-over-1-million-concurrent-players"><u>GGG had warned players that Path of Exile 2 might struggle with the influx of players at launch</u></a>, and so it proved. But over the course of Friday and into the weekend, the New Zealand developer began to get on top of the problems, and its concurrent player count on Steam shot up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/path-of-exile-2/Classes_Guide:_Which_Class_to_Pick_in_PoE_2_Early_Access"><u>which class to pick in PoE 2 Early Access</u></a>, plus an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/path-of-exile-2/Early_Mercenary_Build"><u>early Mercenary build</u></a> guide and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/path-of-exile-2/Sorceress_Frozen_Explosion_League_Starter_Build_Guide"><u>Sorceress build guide</u></a> to help you get started.

            <p>Indie retro RPG Chained Echoes is set to receive DLC next year, as its solo developer Matthias Linda has opened his own studio.</p>
<p>Ashes of Elrant will expand Chained Echoes with a new land and story, as well as a new playable character: the White Wolf.</p>
<p>It's set for release in the second quarter of 2025 across all platforms: PC, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch.</p>

<p>Chained Echoes was first released by Linda at the end of 2022. It's a retro, pixel art adventure following Japanese RPGs like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/chrono-trigger">Chrono Trigger</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vi">Final Fantasy 6</a>, and more.</p>
<p>Both <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-weve-been-playing-89">myself</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-new-golden-age-for-jrpgs">ex-Eurogamer editor Martin Robinson</a> were big fans when it came out, thanks in part to its Overdrive battle system where players must balance offence and defence or risk overheating.</p>
<p>In fact, the game proved such a success for Linda, he's now opened his own studio: Umami Tiger. Ashes of Elrant will be its first release.</p>
<p>The DLC promises new areas, 40 new monsters and bosses to fight, and 15 new tracks from composer Eddie Marianukroh.</p>
<p>"And also grab yourself a fishing rod - you will need it," reads the press release. Expect a fishing minigame, then.</p>
<p>The release of Chained Echoes DLC puts it in direct competition with another retro RPG, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sea-of-stars">Sea of Stars</a>, which has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-stars-free-carnival-themed-dlc-throes-of-the-watchmaker-revealed">Throes of the Watchmaker out next Spring</a>.</p>
<p>For something brand new, though, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/newly-revealed-rpg-threads-of-time-will-compete-with-sea-of-stars-as-chrono-trigger-spiritual-successor">check out Threads of Time</a> - a spiritual successor to Chrono Trigger announced at this year's Tokyo Game Show. There's no release date yet, but it looks gorgeous.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/epic-reveals-lego-fortnite-social-experience-brick-life-and-major-new-storm-chasers-update.1055844/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lego-fortnite-brick-festival-storm-chasers<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Epic has revealed big changes for&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite&nbsp;</em>in the coming days, including a major new social roleplaying experience and an update to the core mode that adds lots of new content.</p>

<p>First up,&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite</em>'s new Brick Life mode is coming on December 12th. Described by Epic as an "all-new social roleplay experience in the&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite&nbsp;</em>universe", the mode will allow you to "make new friends, explore the sights, land your dream job, and move into your new home", according to Epic's description.</p>

<p>Brick Life looks to be an experience that wants to compete with&nbsp;<em>The Sims&nbsp;</em>(and also <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>, perhaps), so of course, you'll also be able to build your dream home and furnish it with all kinds of fun accessories, by the looks of things.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lego-fortnite-brick-life-odyssey-update-phones.jpg?itok=bS3qgpjP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lego-fortnite-brick-life-odyssey-update-phones.jpg?itok=HaYo1H59 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Lego Fortnite</em>'s new Brick Life mode is a "social roleplaying experience" that has shades of&nbsp;<em>The Sims&nbsp;</em>about it.</figcaption></figure><p>In the trailer, we also see&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite&nbsp;</em>characters riding on vehicles, working out at the gym, stealing diamonds from some kind of bank vault, and engaging in plenty of other activities, so it looks like there'll be lots to do in Brick Life.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for this new&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite&nbsp;</em>mode right here.</p>




<p>The second major piece of&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite&nbsp;</em>news released by Epic today is a name change and major update for&nbsp;the main&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite</em>&nbsp;mode. It's now called&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite Odyssey</em>, and it'll be part of a new bespoke&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite&nbsp;</em>section within the main&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>game.</p>

<p>Tomorrow,&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite Odyssey&nbsp;</em>will get a brand new update by the name of Storm Chasers, and it's set to bring a new biome, new dungeons to explore, and new enemies to fight, plus "a formidable big bad" in the form of the titular Storm King. Here's the trailer!</p>




<p>In case you're not aware,&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite&nbsp;</em>is a spinoff mode within massively popular battle royale game&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>.</p>

<p>Released in December last year, the mode debuted to a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lego-fortnite-debuts-with-over-23-million-concurrent-players-will-get-updates-in-early" rel="nofollow">staggering number of concurrent players</a>, with that number <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-festival-launches-with-over-600000-concurrent-players-as-lego-fortnite-passes" rel="nofollow">only increasing in the following days</a>.</p>

<p>Since then,&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite&nbsp;</em>has received a number of updates, including new features, tweaks to existing mechanics, and even <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-fortnite-may-2024" rel="nofollow">a crossover with&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em></a>, among many other things.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite&nbsp;</em>for free right now as part of&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>, which is available to play on PC, PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and mobile devices.</p>

It seems like some people might be gravitating to whatever broken build they can find currently popping off online in part because they’re struggling with the early game in a way they didn’t in <em>Path of Exile 1</em> or similar games like <em>Diablo IV</em>. </p><p>This exploratory phase is part of the fun of diving into a big new action-RPG though. <em>Path of Exile </em>is a game all about deep character customization that lets players experiment with all sorts of builds until they find something that really suits their playstyle or overperforms in unexpected ways. It’s still the earliest days for <em>Path of Exile 2</em>, which came out in preview mode on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on December 6 alongside its Steam Early Access release (the game is currently $30 but will be free-to-play at its 1.0 launch). </p><p>And dealing with unexpected difficulty curves or build nerfs is better than battling down servers or long queue times. “For those still in queue, what we are doing right now is letting in players in batches so that we can make sure to monitor the backend and not overload it,” the studio <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/pathofexile/status/1865156788636848490&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/pathofexile/status/1865156788636848490" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">revealed</a></span> late on Friday. “Thanks once again for your patience and hopefully it won’t be too much longer.” </p><p>Things seem to have improved as of Monday. The concurrent player count recently dipped to 330,000 on PC, down from its weekend peak of 578,562. The record launch came despite equally big debuts last weekend from the likes of <em>Marvel Rivals </em>and <em>Infinity Nikki</em>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-game-director-reveals-new-details-about-companions/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Avowed’s Game Director, Carrie Patel, has disclosed details on how companions interact with the player in the upcoming game.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-more-interactivity-and-reactivity">“More Interactivity and Reactivity”</h2>



<p>In conversation with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/after-starfields-strict-companions-im-glad-avoweds-crew-wont-be-backseat-driving-and-second-guessing-all-your-choices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>, Carrie Patel discussed how they wanted to provide “a little more interactivity and reactivity” to companions “based on the events and conversations and quests that you’re encountering in the game.” Patel added that they wanted companions “to have a little bit more to say” about their journey together.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Patel then goes on to talk about how engaging with companions is a significant part of RPGs, but finding the ‘balance’ is also crucial. They didn’t want Avowed’s companions to “feel like someone is backseat driving and second-guessing all your choices.” Patel also compared Avowed’s companions to Starfield’s, stating that they won’t have as extreme reactions when you do something ‘evil’ but will provide some form of pushback.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-avowed-s-companions-will-have-opt-in-engagement">Avowed’s Companions Will Have Opt-In Engagement</h2>



<p>Patel then talks about the opt-in engagement players can experience with companions in Avowed. The developers have “written a lot of content for these characters for their engagement in the story with one another, with the player.” However, it’s up to the players whether they want to explore this content. For example, when they return to the party camp, players “might hear their companion say a thing or two”, but they decide whether to have the conversation and “get to know their companion a bit better.”</p>
