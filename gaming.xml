            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/planet-crafter-planet-humble-dlc-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Miju Games has announced the release date for&nbsp;<em>The Planet Crafter</em>'s upcoming&nbsp;<em>Planet Humble&nbsp;</em>DLC, and it won't be long before you and your buddies can explore a whole new planet together.</p>
<p>During today's Convergence Showcase, Miju revealed that&nbsp;<em>Planet Humble&nbsp;</em>will launch on October 9th. It'll be the first piece of paid DLC released for the game, although it has received a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/planet-crafter-2023-roadmap-promises-updates-and-more">number of updates</a> since its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/planet-crafter-release-date-10">initial launch</a>.</p>
<p>As the name suggests,&nbsp;<em>Planet Humble&nbsp;</em>brings an entirely new planet for you (and, optionally, your friends) to explore and terraform. It'll have a whole new story and set of secrets to discover, so even if you think you've rinsed&nbsp;<em>The Planet Crafter</em>, there should be plenty here for you.</p>

Miju says that you can play co-op alongside your buddies with just one copy of the DLC, so everyone doesn't need to buy it before jumping in.</p>
<p>That, says Miju, is why the DLC is "priced low", and why "only the host needs to own it"; the studio says it wants to "keep things fair and fun" in the world of <i>The Planet Crafter</i>, which is a pretty admirable goal.</p>
<p>The studio says the DLC will offer around 20 hours of gameplay and will feature a planet roughly "half the size of the original", and you'll discover an abandoned attempt to colonize said planet, as well as "megacorporations' role in its disaster".</p>
<p>You can check out the release date announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Planet Humble&nbsp;</em>right here via the Convergence Showcase.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>The Planet Crafter</em>, it's a terraforming-focused survival game in which you must explore a hostile planet, survive its dangers, and terraform it so that it's suitable as a home for humanity.</p>
<p>The game features all kinds of systems and mechanics, including base-building, resource gathering, and machine crafting, all of which you'll need to utilize if you want to survive. The mix has proven pretty popular;&nbsp;<em>The Planet Crafter&nbsp;</em>had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/planet-crafter-sales-million">racked up a million sales at last count</a>, and it's not done yet.</p>
<p>You can grab&nbsp;<em>The Planet Crafter&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1284190/The_Planet_Crafter/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>. Its&nbsp;<em>Planet Humble&nbsp;</em>DLC will launch on October 9th and will set you back just $7.99.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/final-girl-board-game-buying-guide<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>Between its deep thematic experience and variable gameplay, Final Girl is a single-player <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time">board game</a> that stands out from other <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-horror-board-games">horror board games</a>. The game's title comes from the trope of the same name, which refers to the last surviving female character in a horror movie – think Jamie Lee Curtis’ Laurie Strode from <a href="https://www.ign.com/movies/halloween-1978">Halloween</a> or Sigourney Weaver’s Ellen Ripley from <a href="https://www.ign.com/movies/alien">Alien</a>.</p><p>In a sort of multiversal twist, Final Girl’s numerous expansions each feature different protagonists – all of whom have their own individual abilities – as well as new monsters and locations. Essentially, each expansion serves as its own unique horror game, paying homage to a classic horror film or story; however, the various expansions can be mixed and matched to pit any girl against any monster in any location.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h3 data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Featured in this article</h3></p><div data-cy="catalog-view-trigger"><div><p><h3>Final Girl - Core Box</h3></p></div><div><p><h3>Final Girl: Happy Trails Horror</h3></p></div><div><p><h3>Final Girl: Haunting of Creech Manor</h3></p></div><div><p><h3>Final Girl: Slaughter in The Groves</h3></p></div><div><p><h3>Final Girl: Carnage at the Carnival</h3></p></div><div><p><h3>Final Girl: Frightmare on Maple Lane</h3></p></div><div><p><h3>Final Girl: Into the Void</h3></p></div><div><p><h3>Final Girl: Panic at Station 2891</h3></p></div><div><p><h3>Final Girl: A Knock at the Door</h3></p></div><div><p><h3>Final Girl: Once Upon a Full Moon</h3></p></div><div><p><h3>Final Girl: Madness in the Dark</h3></p></div><div><p><h3>Final Girl: The North Pole Nightmare</h3></p></div><div><p><h3>Final Girl: Terror From Above</h3></p></div><div><p><h3>Final Girl: Terror From the Grave</h3></p></div></div><p>Don’t get it twisted and think that Final Girl is merely a novel experience for the hardcore horror fanatic. On the contrary, Final Girl is widely regarded as one of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games"><u>best solo board games</u></a> that money can buy. Still, with a wealth of options when it comes to expansions, new players might be scratching their heads, wondering where to start. Well, fear not, as this handy guide offers you everything you need to know about the Final Girl Core Box and the series’ various expansions.</p><p id="final-girl-core-box"><h2 data-toc-title="Final Girl - Core Box">Final Girl - Core Box</h2></p><div catalogid="e60b942a-4578-49ea-8052-f3b235f4b150" id="207799"><div id="207799" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Final Girl - Core Box</h3></p></div><p>IMPORTANT: REQUIRES AT LEAST ONE FEATURE FILM BOX TO PLAY</p><p>MSRP: $19.99</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Age: 14+</li><li>Players: 1</li><li>Play Time: 20-60 mins</li></ul><p>Final Girl is a single-player horror tabletop series in which players take control of one of the titular final girls to fight pop culture-inspired monsters. Each expansion comes with its own set of unique mechanics and quirks, but players are generally exploring spooky locations, drawing various event cards, playing action cards, chucking dice, saving victims, and widdling down the villain’s health.</p><p>The first important thing to note about the Core Box is that it is not playable on its own. To borrow a dated but apt metaphor, think of the Final Girl Core Box as a VHS player and the Feature Film boxes (expansions) as playable tapes.</p><p>As every Feature Film box requires the Core Box, however, this is still a part of the first purchase any prospective Final Girl player will want to make. Included in the Core Box are the basic rules as well as the general components required to play any game of Final Girl.</p><p>Where players choose to go from here is largely up to personal preference, but I won’t leave you in the dark concerning recommended purchases. The remainder of this guide will mainly cover each expansion currently available in the order they were released. Under each expansion, I will discuss the various features as well as weigh out the pros and cons so you can decide which spooky adventure is right for you.</p><h2>Expansions (Feature Film Boxes)</h2></div><p id="final-girl-happy-trails-horror"><h3 data-toc-title="Final Girl: Happy Trails Horror">Final Girl: Happy Trails Horror</h3></p><div catalogid="e60b942a-4578-49ea-8052-f3b235f4b150" id="207801"><div id="207801" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Final Girl: Happy Trails Horror</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $19.99 USD</p><p>Components (REQUIRES THE CORE BOX)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Final Girl: Laurie &amp; Reiko</li><li>Monster: Hans - The Butcher</li><li>Location: Camp Happy Trails</li></ul><p>Happy Trails Horror is about as good a place to start as any. In fact, the Feature Films box is actually included with the Core Box in a separate Starter Bundle, which is listed for $39.98. However, it should be noted the bundle doesn’t save you any money compared to buying the two products separately, so there’s no financial incentive to opt for this route.</p><p>That said, Hans - The Butcher is a straightforward villain, making this an excellent place to start. Later villains can offer much more of a challenge, even for seasoned players, and may prove too frustrating for newcomers. Happy Trails Horror is the perfect entry point if you’re looking for a classic slasher akin to Friday the 13th.</p></div><p id="final-girl-haunting-of-creech-manor"><h3 data-toc-title="Final Girl: Haunting of Creech Manor">Final Girl: Haunting of Creech Manor</h3></p><div catalogid="e60b942a-4578-49ea-8052-f3b235f4b150" id="207802"><div id="207802" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Final Girl: Haunting of Creech Manor</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $19.99 USD</p><p>Components (REQUIRES THE CORE BOX)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Final Girl: Alice &amp; Selena</li><li>Monster: The Poltergeist </li><li>Location: Creech Manor</li></ul><p>Haunting of Creech Manor is one of the more unique experiences in comparison to other Feature Film boxes. First, The Poltergeist differs from other villains in that it cannot be damaged by the player. Rather, to win, the player needs to save a little girl by the name of Carolyn.</p><p>Still, while the novelty of Haunting of Creech Manor makes it stand out, difficulty can be a bit of a mixed bag. Winning or losing can feel more like a stroke of luck rather than requiring any actual skill. If the cards and dice don’t turn in your favor, it might feel like winning a round here is nearly impossible.</p><p>The change of pace makes this a must-play for experienced Final Girl fans, but it's perhaps best saved for a later pickup. That way, players can truly appreciate the unique blend of mechanics that Creech Manor brings to the table.</p></div><p id="final-girl-slaughter-in-the-groves"><h3 data-toc-title="Final Girl: Slaughter in The Groves">Final Girl: Slaughter in The Groves</h3></p><div catalogid="e60b942a-4578-49ea-8052-f3b235f4b150" id="207803"><div id="207803" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Final Girl: Slaughter in The Groves</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $19.99 USD</p><p>Components (REQUIRES THE CORE BOX)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Final Girl: Adelaide &amp; Barbara</li><li>Monster: Inkanyamba</li><li>Location: Sacred Groves</li></ul><p>Slaughter in the Groves transports players to Africa for a sight-seeing trip gone wrong where a masked killer is looking for revenge on behalf of their gods. Overall, it is an interesting idea, but it’s one accompanied by a high level of difficulty. Both the villain and the map present a wealth of challenges that can quickly result in frustration, even for veteran players.</p><p>Due to its sheer difficulty, Slaughter in the Groves should probably be a later pickup for most fans. However, those who are particularly gluttons for punishment may want to consider moving Inkanyamba and the Sacred Groves up their wish list.</p></div><p id="final-girl-carnage-at-the-carnival"><h3 data-toc-title="Final Girl: Carnage at the Carnival">Final Girl: Carnage at the Carnival</h3></p><div catalogid="e60b942a-4578-49ea-8052-f3b235f4b150" id="207804"><div id="207804" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Final Girl: Carnage at the Carnival</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $19.99 USD</p><p>Components (REQUIRES THE CORE BOX)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Final Girl: Asami &amp; Charlie</li><li>Monster: Geppetto - The Puppet Master</li><li>Location: Carnival of Blood</li></ul><p>Perhaps the biggest gripe fans of the series have against Final Girl is that it can sometimes feel a bit swingy. In other words, it may not matter how adept your Final Girl skills are; a couple of bad draws can lose you the game rather quickly. Unfortunately, that con is highlighted in Carnage at the Carnival.</p><p>The Carnival of Blood map contains numerous traps that make investigating treacherous. These traps can have damaging effects that make it nearly impossible for players to win the round if encountered at inopportune moments. Carnage at the Carnival mitigates this somewhat by making Asami, one of the included final girls, immune to traps, but that kind of defeats the point of the mechanic altogether.</p><p>That said, Gepetto - The Puppet Master, is an interesting villain in the franchise as he contains various puppet minions. Most of the villains in Final Girl fight alone, so this departure makes for an interesting twist. Due to the difficulty of the map, Carnage at the Carnival isn’t an ideal starting point, but Gepetto certainly makes this an intriguing selection for experienced players.</p></div><p id="final-girl-frightmare-on-maple-lane"><h3 data-toc-title="Final Girl: Frightmare on Maple Lane">Final Girl: Frightmare on Maple Lane</h3></p><div catalogid="e60b942a-4578-49ea-8052-f3b235f4b150" id="207805"><div id="207805" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Final Girl: Frightmare on Maple Lane</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $19.99 USD</p><p>Components (REQUIRES THE CORE BOX)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Final Girl: Nacy &amp; Sheila</li><li>Monster: Dr. Fright</li><li>Location: Maple Lane</li></ul><p>Both the Maple Lane location and Dr. Fright offer straightforward, albeit memorable, experiences that make this Feature Film box an excellent choice for beginners. Not to mention, the clear homage to the Nightmare on Elm Street series makes for a compelling and terrifying narrative.</p><p>The sleep mechanic, which requires players to fight Dr. Fight in their dreams, is an interesting twist on the Final Girl formula, and it doesn’t add a ton of bloat to the core gameplay, either. For players who already have Happy Trails Horror (or some other Feature Film box) in their collection, Frightmare on Maple Lane is a solid next option to look into.</p></div><p id="final-girl-into-the-void"><h3 data-toc-title="Final Girl: Into the Void">Final Girl: Into the Void</h3></p><div catalogid="e60b942a-4578-49ea-8052-f3b235f4b150" id="207806"><div id="207806" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Final Girl: Into the Void</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $19.99 USD</p><p>Components (REQUIRES THE CORE BOX)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Final Girl: Ellen &amp; Jenette</li><li>Monster: The Evomorph</li><li>Location: The USS Konrad</li></ul><p>This Alien-inspired Feature Film box is a fan-favorite due to its spaceship locale and its continuously evolving villain, The Evomorph. Unfortunately, what makes this entry so great is also what makes it a non-ideal starting point, a bevy of extra rules.</p><p>Those who really want to sit down and experience Into the Void (and you totally should, at some point) will first have to get familiar with the new ruleset introduced with The Evomorph and The USS Konrad. However, those who take the extra time to study up before playing will be treated to arguably one of the best boxes in the Final Girl series.</p></div><p id="final-girl-panic-at-station-2891"><h3 data-toc-title="Final Girl: Panic at Station 2891">Final Girl: Panic at Station 2891</h3></p><div catalogid="e60b942a-4578-49ea-8052-f3b235f4b150" id="207807"><div id="207807" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Final Girl: Panic at Station 2891</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $19.99 USD</p><p>Components (REQUIRES THE CORE BOX)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Final Girl: Kate &amp; Uki</li><li>Monster: The Organism</li><li>Location: Station 2891</li></ul><p>In this Feature Film box heavily inspired by <a href="https://www.ign.com/movies/the-thing-1982">The Thing</a>, players are tasked with testing patients to determine whether or not The Organism has assimilated them. This expansion differs from other Feature Film boxes in that each game begins without a monster. After the testing phase, however, there can be up to three baddies in one game at a given time.</p><p>The map itself is also rather unique because it features a hypothermia element due to the arctic setting. Not to mention, the distinct helicopter mechanic requires a bit of strategy that is not present in other box sets. As only three people can escape at one time via helicopter, players need to think through the most efficient way to save the many victims of Station 2891. Again, this is an excellent entry, but perhaps not the right one to start with due to all the added mechanics.</p></div><p id="final-girl-a-knock-at-the-door"><h3 data-toc-title="Final Girl: A Knock at the Door">Final Girl: A Knock at the Door</h3></p><div catalogid="e60b942a-4578-49ea-8052-f3b235f4b150" id="207808"><div id="207808" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Final Girl: A Knock at the Door</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $19.99 USD</p><p>Components (REQUIRES THE CORE BOX)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Final Girl: Ava &amp; Ginny</li><li>Monster: The Intruders </li><li>Location: Wingard Cottage</li></ul><p>A Knock at the Door is a home invasion expansion inspired by <a href="https://www.ign.com/movies/the-strangers-2008">The Strangers</a>. As with the film series, there are three different intruders, each of whom can act as the main antagonist at any given moment. Because of that, tension in A Knock at the Door remains high throughout. There never quite feels like there is a moment when you're totally safe.</p><p>Constant tension coupled with an interesting crafting mechanic for potential weapon-building makes each playthrough potentially quite different. A box with only a single villain to focus on, like Happy Trails Horror or Frightmare on Maple Lane, might be a better place to start. Still, A Knock at the Cabin makes its case for being an excellent entry point thanks to its exceptionally strong theme and ample replayability.</p></div><p id="final-girl-once-upon-a-full-moon"><h3 data-toc-title="Final Girl: Once Upon a Full Moon">Final Girl: Once Upon a Full Moon</h3></p><div catalogid="e60b942a-4578-49ea-8052-f3b235f4b150" id="207809"><div id="207809" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Final Girl: Once Upon a Full Moon</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $19.99 USD</p><p>Components (REQUIRES THE CORE BOX)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Final Girl: Gretel &amp; Red</li><li>Monster: The Big Bad Wolf</li><li>Location: The Storybook Woods</li></ul><p>Despite being a later entry in the franchise, Once Upon a Full Moon is another recommended starting point for newcomers. The fairytale feel of this Feature Film box is universally understandable, even for those who haven’t seen their share of horror movies.</p><p>Not to mention, there aren’t a ton of extra rules to learn, either. Essentially, it serves as the Happy Trails Horror of the franchise’s second wave of releases. It’s just a straightforward good time that should quickly get new players to the table and up to speed.</p></div><p id="final-girl-madness-in-the-dark"><h3 data-toc-title="Final Girl: Madness in the Dark">Final Girl: Madness in the Dark</h3></p><div catalogid="e60b942a-4578-49ea-8052-f3b235f4b150" id="207810"><div id="207810" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Final Girl: Madness in the Dark</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $19.99 USD</p><p>Components (REQUIRES THE CORE BOX)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Final Girl: Heather &amp; Veronica</li><li>Monster: The Ratchet Lady</li><li>Location: Wolfe Asylum</li></ul><p>The swingy-ness of the Final Girl franchise reveals itself yet again with Madness in the Dark. Perhaps more than most entries in the series, this Feature Film box can either be defeated or bring a player to their knees in a relatively short period of time, largely depending on the luck of the draw. Still, Madness in the Dark contains some interesting ideas that make a visit to this creepy asylum worth the trip.</p><p>In particular, the floors of Wolfe Asylum are littered with collectible pills. These pills can be taken for a bonus effect or stacked together for more powerful abilities. However, this mechanic's potential side effects turn Madness in the Dark into a bit of a test-your-luck game. Whether you become an overpowered monster killer or simply go mad might just determine the outcome of your playthrough.</p></div><p id="final-girl-the-north-pole-nightmare"><h3 data-toc-title="Final Girl: The North Pole Nightmare">Final Girl: The North Pole Nightmare</h3></p><div catalogid="e60b942a-4578-49ea-8052-f3b235f4b150" id="207811"><div id="207811" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Final Girl: The North Pole Nightmare</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $29.99 USD</p><p>Components (REQUIRES THE CORE BOX)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Final Girl: Cindy &amp; Mrs. Claus</li><li>Monster: Krampus</li><li>Location: Santa’s Village</li></ul><p>In a special holiday edition of sorts, The North Pole Nightmare pits final girls Cindy the Elf and Mrs. Claus against Krampus. The unique aspect of The North Pole Nightmare (other than its theme) is the present mechanic, which can either help or hurt you, depending on whether or not these gifts come from Santa or Krampus.</p><p>The North Pole Nightmare is a solid addition to any collection, especially if you’re the type of person looking for a horror-filled adventure around the holidays. Not to mention, saving the day as Mrs. Claus is just some campy fun. However, like any holiday special, The North Pole Nightmare is probably best enjoyed by those who already have some experience with the series, as its twists and turns are likely to be more greatly appreciated by existing fans.</p><h2>Mini Expansions</h2><p>In addition to the various Feature Film boxes currently available, there are a handful of smaller vignettes worth considering that offer new villains and final girls. However, as these expansions don’t include locations, they must be paired with the Core Box and one of the Feature Film boxes.</p></div><p id="final-girl-terror-from-above"><h3 data-toc-title="Final Girl: Terror From Above">Final Girl: Terror From Above</h3></p><div catalogid="e60b942a-4578-49ea-8052-f3b235f4b150" id="207812"><div id="207812" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Final Girl: Terror From Above</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $9.99</p><p>Components (REQUIRES THE CORE BOX AND ANY ONE FEATURE FILM BOX)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Final Girl: Melanie</li><li>Monster: Birds</li></ul><p>Again, smaller vignettes like Terror From Above and Terror From the Grave require the core box and a feature film box to be playable. Both vignettes, however, introduce a new protagonist and monster that can be taken to any in-game location. For example, the monsters of Maple Lane and Creech Manor can be swapped out with the killer birds included with Terror From Above. I’m not sure what killer birds would be doing on a space station, but you can definitely play that scenario out if you want to, as well.</p></div><p id="final-girl-terror-from-the-grave"><h3 data-toc-title="Final Girl: Terror From the Grave">Final Girl: Terror From the Grave</h3></p><div catalogid="e60b942a-4578-49ea-8052-f3b235f4b150" id="207813"><div id="207813" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Final Girl: Terror From the Grave</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $9.99</p><p>Components (REQUIRES THE CORE BOX AND ANY ONE FEATURE FILM BOX)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Final Girl: Patsy</li><li>Monster: Zombies</li></ul><p>An encompassing horror franchise like Final Girl just wouldn’t feel complete without zombies. While zombies have yet to receive their own standalone Feature Film box, this vignette allows the iconic horror monster to go to any location featured in previous expansions. Want to fight zombies in space or at the carnival? Well, now you can.</p><h2>Final Girl Extras</h2><p>Even beyond the various Feature Film boxes and smaller vignettes, there are several items available with the Final Girl branding that you might be curious about. For example, there are miniatures of the many protagonists and monsters, promotional final girls, additional scenario booklets, and even storage boxes for collectors.</p><h2>Bottom Line</h2><p>With decades of iconic movie and pop culture monsters to take inspiration from, there is seemingly no end in sight for the Final Girl franchise. In fact, publisher Van Ryder Games has already completed a successful Kickstarter campaign for the latest slate of Feature Film boxes and is looking to make them available for purchase soon.</p><p>For those looking to get into the series, Happy Trails Horror, Frightmare on Maple Lane, and Once Upon a Full Moon are all great Feature Film sets to purchase first, along with the Core Box. However, if one horror homage, in particular, calls to you, there’s no reason you can’t start with any of the Feature Film boxes; it just may require learning a few more rules and some additional setup time.</p><p>Luckily, for those who think Final Girl might just become their next obsession/collection, many of the titles listed above can be found for well under MSRP at retailers like Amazon.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-two-game-references-and-new-theories-from-the-trailer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>The first full <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-debut-trailer-shows-joel-and-ellie-5-years-after-the-events-of-season-1">trailer for The Last of Us Season 2</a> is officially here, giving us a look at Ellie and Joel five years after the events of the first season.</p><p>In the new season, creators Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann are starting to take viewers through the events of the second game, The Last of Us Part 2, and fans of the games will recognise plenty of familiar faces, as well as some new ones.</p><p>But alongside finally seeing elements from The Last of Us Part 2 in live-action, there are also plenty of hidden details and Easter eggs sprinkled throughout the teaser, as well as some brand new scenes that have sparked some tin-foil hat theories. So read on for everything we caught in <a href="https://www.ign.com/tv/the-last-of-us-the-series">The Last of Us</a> Season 2 teaser trailer and what we think might be happening. Don’t worry, we’ll keep things spoiler-free, except for at the end where we’ll give you a big ol’ warning.</p><h3>Familiar Faces and Places</h3><p>Bella Ramsey is reprising their role as Ellie. Set five years after the events of the first season, Ramsey’s Ellie is now living in Jackson, Wyoming. In case you don’t recall, that’s the town from Episode 6 of Season 1 where Joel is reunited with his brother Tommy.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/27/the-last-of-us-season-2-the-last-of-us-day-official-teaser-max-0-13-screenshot-1727443296542.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Speaking of Joel, the teaser shows a Miller mailbox, illustrating that the Texan has also fully settled in Jackson after the events of season one. If their living situations correlate directly to those from the game, we can infer that Ellie’s moved into her own home at this point in time and Joel is staying nearby in the town.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/27/the-last-of-us-season-2-the-last-of-us-day-official-teaser-max-0-18-screenshot-1727443296544.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p> While they were traveling companions in the first season of The Last of Us, Ellie and Joel seem more distant in Jackson, as signaled by the stern look given by Ellie as she approaches her former travel buddy’s porch. Joel can be seen plucking away at his guitar, preparing to have a conversation with his proxy-daughter. If you’ve played the game, you’ll know the importance of the conversation about to be had here…</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/27/the-last-of-us-season-2-the-last-of-us-day-official-teaser-max-0-46-screenshot-1727443296544.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Gabriel Luna also returns as Joel’s brother, Tommy. He was last seen welcoming Joel and Ellie to Jackson, Wyoming where he lives as part of a larger commune of survivors. In the teaser Tommy is holding his trusty rifle, which makes sense given his talent for long-range shooting – something he passes on to Ellie in the video game. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/27/the-last-of-us-season-2-the-last-of-us-day-official-teaser-max-0-52-screenshot-1727443296545.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>He looks on as something approaches the walls of Jackson. Moments later, the teaser suggests Jackson comes under attack by Infected and we know that Tommy has a somewhat leadership role in the community.</p><p>Tommy is shown with his wife Maria played by Rutina Wesley. Last time we saw her she was pregnant, meaning there could well be a small child running around Jackson somewhere. Tommy is looking injured and the two look distraught over something. Given what we know about the game, this could be about any number of events that happen, but is most likely either a reaction to the aftermath of the infected attack on Jackson, or something much worse.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/27/the-last-of-us-season-2-the-last-of-us-day-official-teaser-max-1-32-screenshot-1727443296546.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Throughout the trailer we can hear Future Days by Pearl Jam. This is the same song Joel plays for Ellie at the start of The Last of Us Part 2. Weirdly, this song is somewhat of an anachronism as the song was released in October 2013, but the zombie outbreak in the game began in September 2013, weeks prior to the album’s release. </p><p>The HBO series actually started its zombie outbreak a decade earlier in 2003. Of course, in the trailer this song is used completely non-diegetically, meaning that Joel isn’t playing it himself here. It would certainly be odd for him to play a song that wouldn’t have yet been written by Eddie Vedder in the show’s timeline, so we wonder what grunge deep-cut he’ll go for instead to avoid creating some sort of Pearl Jam paradox.</p><p>And here is a closer look at the guitar Joel gifts to Ellie, complete with the iconic moth design on the neck. The guitar features heavily in The Last of Us Part 2 as an item that connects Ellie and Joel, given that he teaches her how to play the instrument. It symbolizes the father-daughter relationship between the two and is an enduring part of their connection. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/27/the-last-of-us-season-2-the-last-of-us-day-official-teaser-max-0-22-screenshot-1727443296544.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>That moth can also be seen on Ellie’s forearm tattoo that she received to cover up her infected bite. The symbolism of the animal being is that no matter how dark things get, you always have to draw yourself to the light in the world – something easier said than done in the world of The Last of Us.</p><p>Just after this, we see an exact reproduction of an early scene from the game where Joel is singing the aforementioned Pearl Jam song to Ellie, continuing the show’s habit of recreating cherished memories shot-for-shot from its source material.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/27/the-last-of-us-season-2-the-last-of-us-day-official-teaser-max-0-26-screenshot-1727443296544.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3>New characters for Season Two</h3><p>We’re going to see either Ellie or Joel play the guitar quite a few times this season, surely. Here Ellie is playing a guitar she finds in a Seattle music shop for Dina. Maybe it’s friendly, maybe it’s something more. </p><p>In the game, this optional moment sees Ellie play Take on Me by A-Ha. Although it’s not a required part of the gameplay, this moment is one of the most memorable from the games.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/27/the-last-of-us-season-2-the-last-of-us-day-official-teaser-max-0-36-screenshot-1727444344227.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>In the second season of The Last of Us, Dina is played by Isabella Merced. You might recognize her from Alien Romulus. While she’s also someone who grew up after the outbreak and is able to hold her own in terms of survival, she’s got a very different outlook on life than Ellie, showing that many people have adapted differently to the post-apocalyptic world.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/27/the-last-of-us-season-2-the-last-of-us-day-official-teaser-max-0-39-screenshot-1727444344227.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Young Mazino from Netflix’s Beef will be playing Jesse, another resident of Jackson who is introduced in The Last of Us Part 2. A friend to both Ellie and Dina, we suspect that Jesse might be more important in the third season if indeed HBO decides to split up the second game into multiple seasons.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/27/the-last-of-us-season-2-the-last-of-us-day-official-teaser-max-0-48-screenshot-1727444344227.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>This shot of Ellie and Dina riding around the town’s perimeters as part of a routine security duty echoes an early mission from the game, in which Ellie and Dina take on a scouting mission around Jackson.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/27/the-last-of-us-season-2-the-last-of-us-day-official-teaser-max-0-35-screenshot-1727444344227.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>You can see an infected approach Ellie in this one scene. It certainly looks like the store that Dina and Ellie have to fight their way out of when patrolling the outskirts of Jackson in the game. But while this moment serves as a tutorial segment in The Last of Us Part Two, it precedes a chain of events that will alter Ellie’s life forever.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/27/the-last-of-us-season-2-the-last-of-us-day-official-teaser-max-0-58-screenshot-1727444344227.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Another recreation of a moment from the game, this time early on in Seattle where Ellie and Dina travel through the city’s underground subway tunnels. The red light matches that of the game as they encounter several infected and clickers. We’ve been promised a lot more infected in season two of the show, and this is a great example of the horror they bring.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/27/the-last-of-us-season-2-the-last-of-us-day-official-teaser-max-1-34-screenshot-1727444344228.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>A shot of Ellie’s knife, the one left to her by her mother can be seen her. Ellie’s mom was a bigger part of the HBO series than in the video game, so perhaps the show will expand even further on Ellie’s relationship with her mother in the second season. We may also see the return of Ashley Johnson, who played Ellie’s mother in the HBO series and voiced Ellie in the video games as further pages from the American Dream prequel comic may be referenced.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/27/the-last-of-us-season-2-the-last-of-us-day-official-teaser-max-0-52-screenshot-1727444344227.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Ellie is very upset about something. Knowing this story, it could be one of a number of things but we’ll take a swing and think we might know what moment this follows. We won’t spoil that one here, though. If you think you know, then join the club.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/27/the-last-of-us-season-2-the-last-of-us-day-official-teaser-max-1-36-screenshot-1727444344228.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Kaitlyn Dever makes her first appearance as Abby, as Catherine O’Hara’s nameless character (more on her in a bit) asks Joel, “What did you do?” Which if you know, you know. </p><p>You can also see a chain hanging from the fence post behind Abby, which may be a nod to one of the collectible dog tags from The Last of Us Part 2, so that’s a fun easter egg if that’s the case.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/27/the-last-of-us-season-2-the-last-of-us-day-official-teaser-max-1-2-screenshot-1727444344227.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Abby is trapped between a wall and a collapsing fence, under siege from infected. This is a shot-for-shot recreation of a sequence from The Last of Us Part 2’s opening hours.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/27/the-last-of-us-season-2-the-last-of-us-day-official-teaser-max-1-7-screenshot-1727444344227.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>A mysterious stranger with a gun saves Abby from an Infected. Who is it? Based on what we know from the game it’s likely Joel who’s come to help. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/27/the-last-of-us-season-2-the-last-of-us-day-official-teaser-max-1-12-screenshot-1727444344227.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Two horses are seen galloping, possibly away from the infected horde. Shot in the dark guess it’s Joel, Abby, and Tommy.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/27/the-last-of-us-season-2-the-last-of-us-day-official-teaser-max-1-14-screenshot-1727444344227.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>This is our first look at a Seraphite, sometimes known as “Scars”. They are a cult-like group from Seattle and one of the enemy factions Ellie fights against in the game. They are also the enemies of the WLF (Washington Liberation Front), who Abby is a member of.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/27/the-last-of-us-season-2-the-last-of-us-day-official-teaser-max-1-19-screenshot-1727444344228.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The Seraphites worship the Prophet, a woman who had a vision that humans should return to living off of the land again, and abandon modern technology. This mural is in reference to her.</p><p>In the same way the first season of The Last of Us explored the lives of peripheral characters like Bill in more detail, perhaps we’ll see more backstory for The Prophet – how she became a saint to her following, and how she establishes the Seraphites in Seattle?</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/27/the-last-of-us-season-2-the-last-of-us-day-official-teaser-max-1-21-screenshot-1727444344228.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>This is a shot of the WLF breaching a room. The WLF’s reliance on weaponry and brute force is the polar opposite of the nature-embracing Seraphites, and we expect to see this dynamic play out in greater detail when Ellie and Dina make their way to Seattle and see these two factions up close.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/27/the-last-of-us-season-2-the-last-of-us-day-official-teaser-max-1-32-screenshot-1727444344228.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Ellie is seen returning fire with an automatic rifle, a weapon she wields in the game. It’s unclear, though, whether she’s firing at the WLF soldiers in the shot before. The magic of editing!</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/27/the-last-of-us-season-2-the-last-of-us-day-official-teaser-max-1-33-screenshot-1-1727444344228.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>A captured Seraphite is chained to a wall. Their captor is the leader of the WLF, Isaac Dixon, played by Jeffrey Wright. Wright reprises his role from the game, in which he voiced and mo-capped Dixon. This isn’t the first time this has happened in The Last of Us HBO series as Merle Dandridge also played the live-action version of Marlene, leader of the Fireflies, whom she voiced in The Last of Us Part 1. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/27/the-last-of-us-season-2-the-last-of-us-day-official-teaser-max-1-26-screenshot-1727444344228.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3>Things Not From the Game</h3><p>It was previously announced that Catherine O’Hara, best known most recently from reprising her role as Delia Deetz in Beetlejuice Beetlejuice, would be joining the cast of The Last of Us in Season 2. However, details of her character were not revealed. It now appears that she will be playing an original character, seemingly a therapist. She’s introduced talking to Pedro Pascal’s Joel, who we see with longer hair here. He also appears to be grappling with his actions from the end of the first season, hence why he might be seeking out O’Hara’s presumed therapist in residence in Jackson, Wyoming.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/27/the-last-of-us-season-2-the-last-of-us-day-official-teaser-max-0-3-screenshot-1727444841733.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>We don’t know who she is for sure, though. Could it even be that she’s the aforementioned Seraphite prophet? A long shot, seeing as she’s long dead in the game, but it wouldn’t be the first time the show has made a big change. Trailers can be crafty and she might not actually even be speaking to Joel in this scene, after all.</p><p>This is another moment not seen in the game is a horde of infected charging towards Jackson. Is this why Tommy was seen carrying his rifle earlier?</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/27/the-last-of-us-season-2-the-last-of-us-day-official-teaser-max-1-4-screenshot-1727444870981.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The infected horde from earlier return as they slam into the barricades of Jackson. It’s worth noting that no such event occurs in the game, so we’re seeing something new here. This may play into the theory that the events of the game may be changed to reflect original concept art of Abby being welcomed into the community of Jackson as she, Tommy, and Joel escape from the oncoming horde we saw them escaping from earlier.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/27/the-last-of-us-season-2-the-last-of-us-day-official-teaser-max-1-29-screenshot-1727444902074.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Here’s where we going to go into spoiler territory for the game, so if you haven’t played it, we’d recommend you stop watching now.</p><h3>SPOILER WARNING</h3><p>In The Last of Us Part 2, Abby shockingly puts an end to Joel’s newfound homely existence by introducing his skull to a golf club. It all happens very quickly, but <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-part-2-was-once-more-open-world-how-abbys-role-changed">Druckmann later explained</a> early drafts of the story we different, and that “Abby joined the community and you were playing as this new character until she betrayed Joel later on. And it just didn't work because Joel dying is the inciting incident, and you want to get to the inciting incident as quickly as you can.”</p><p>Could we see that version of events take place in season two of the show? The fact that a horde of infected is charging toward Jackson could mean that Joel and Abby are being chased back to the settlement instead of the chalet, which is the setting of his video game demise. Obviously, it’s all guesswork at this point, but it would be an interesting way for the season to go and give us a little more precious Pedro Pascal time.</p><p>And that’s all the game details we saw in the first trailer for The Last of Us Season 2. Will Joel teach Ellie Future Days, a song that shouldn’t exist in the series? Maybe it’ll be a different Pearl Jam song, or something else altogether. Let us know in the comments what you think it could be. The return of this version of the apocalypse will arrive in the form of seven episodes on HBO sometime in 2025.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Ubisoft said the decision had been made in light of Shadow's recent release delay. As announced earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-following-learnings-from-star-wars-outlaws">Assassin's Creed Shadows will now debut on 14th February 2025,</a> instead of its previously planned November arrival. Those who had pre-ordered the game will receive refunds.</p>
<p>In its own post sharing today's news, the EGX team said it appreciated this will be disappointing for those looking to go hands-on with Assassin's Creed Shadows. However, there are still more games for attendees to try out during the event, which runs from Friday 25th to Sunday 27th October.</p>

<p>Ubisoft announced it was delaying the release of Assassin's Creed Shadows on Wednesday. At this time, the developer said the game was feature complete, but would now receive further polish. It cited "softer than expected launch for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-review">Star Wars Outlaws</a>" as a factor in its decision to move the release into next year.</p>
<p>At the same time, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-new-ubisoft-games-to-release-day-one-on-steam-starting-next-february">Ubisoft announced a full return to Steam</a>, with Assassin's Creed Shadows being the first game under the developer to get a day one release on Valve's platform since Starlink: Battle for Atlas, which released in 2019.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Fender has teamed up with Capcom to create a Telecaster inspired by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter">Monster Hunter</a>: the Monster Hunter Rathalos Telecaster.</p>
<p>The guitar's already listed in the <a href="https://www.fender.com/en-GB/electric-guitars/telecaster/monster-hunter-rathalos-telecaster-rosewood-fingerboard-rathalos-red/5602600899.html?rdl=true">UK store</a> for £1850, which makes it one of Fender's pricier iterations. There's no option to pre-order just yet, although Fender says the instrument will be available from March 2025.</p>

<p>The guitar features the iconic Rathalos emblem, along with "guild marks subtly placed throughout the body and fretboard inlays".</p>
<p>"The bold original body colour, tortoiseshell pickguard, and sleek black hardware echo the [Rathalos'] ferociousness, making this a truly unique instrument," Fender says.</p>
<p>"We're thrilled to bring this collaboration with world-leading guitar brand Fender to life in celebration of Monster Hunter's 20th anniversary," said Ryozo Tsujimoto, Monster Hunter series producer.</p>
<p>"The collaboration guitar features various elements that reflect Rathalos, one of the series' iconic monsters, with details such as claw marks, inlays, and patterns on the body. Additionally, plans are underway for in-game collaborations with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, so please look forward to that as well."</p>

<p>Japanese fans get a bonus limited edition model, too, called, confusingly, the Limited Monster Hunter Rathalos Telecaster. Pre-orders for that are now live, albeit restricted to Fender's flagship Tokyo store and Fender Japan's official online store. That version comes with a premium hard case, too.</p>
<p>Fans who don't have the best part of two grand lying around can also pick up exclusive guitar picks - there are 12 designs to collect - and a collector's pick case styled to look like the item box from the game.</p>
<p>Sounds like you won't be able to choose which pick you want to buy, though, as the "specific designs included remain a mystery until the package is opened". Also, "the pick products will be available for sale exclusively in the Asia-Pacific region", so it doesn't seem they'll be coming to the US or Europe any time soon.</p>
<p>The Japan-exclusive Limited guitar edition, however, will include the special pick case with all 12 pick designs.</p>
<p>Capcom recently revealed the PC system requirements for Monster Hunter Wilds, following news at this week's State of Play that it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-out-february-next-year">set for release on 28th February 2025</a> on PC (Steam), PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>
<p>The game will require 140GB of storage on an SSD and 16GB of memory. Minimum specs are for a 1080p upscaled resolution at 30fps, while recommended specs are for 60fps.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>On September 26, Inworld AI, the creators of the <a href="https://inworld.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leading AI engine</a> for gaming, gave creators an in-depth look into the AI-powered tools that creators will get to access in the future, supposedly to spark a new generation of innovation in gaming. Creators got a 90-minute keynote presentation that announced new products and demos, detailed discussions with industry leaders from companies such as NVIDIA and Xbox, and an indie game studio named Playroom. They have a new social multiplayer game titled Death by AI, which has had more than 20 million players since the game launched in May.</p>
<p>Inworld has a modular platform of Primitives, which allows game developers to generate complex and context-aware behaviors that are more advanced than scripted responses or traditional game AI. Inworld has no limitations on genre, and players can build an FPS or an RPG, with Inworld being able to respond to the evolving game world in a way that feels lifelike and dynamic for the players and the creators.</p>
<p><iframe title="Companion quests with AI game companions | Inworld AI Unreal Engine Demo" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A7iBmND9L-c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Primitives include specialized input and output models, as well as Systems that can orchestrate the models, coordinating them to create intelligent game behaviors. The input models are utilized to inform sensory and perception models such as Listen, Vision, State, Ingestion and Recognition. Planners are used to generate and execute plans to ensure that everything is working together as it should be.</p>
<p>There are plenty of tools within the Inworld AI system, such as the Narrative Graph, which has been co-developed with Xbox, helping visualize and manage interactive narratives by auto-generating branching storylines from uploaded content. There is also a Mass Character Generator available to help speed up the NPC creation process, using an asset library which is linked to the placeholder NPC template.</p>
<p>The games industry is troubling at the moment, with&nbsp;more layoffs&nbsp;and closures than ever. Talented developers are losing their jobs and struggling to find another, with some having to decide to leave the industry entirely. Inworld AI is aiming to help ease some of the&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/peter-molyneux-says-ai-will-be-a-real-game-changer-in-the-future-of-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">burden in the industry</a> and&nbsp;allow people to create games without the astronomical cost of game development.</p>
<p>Whether a tool like this will be successful enough remains to be seen, as it hasn't been stated what Inworld's AI has been trained on and whether it is stealing assets from other games and artists, as seen with many AI tools that are currently on the market. Inworld has uploaded a <a href="https://inworld.ai/blog/beyond-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> that details some of the tool's features and how it aims to aid game development, with many videos listed to showcase the features that creators can access in the tool.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-unite-shutting-down-belgium-netherlands<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company and developer TiMi have announced that&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Unite&nbsp;</em>is shutting down in Belgium and the Netherlands, effective late next year (yes, you read that correctly).</p>
<p>According <a href="https://www.serebii.net/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">to Serebii.net</a>, the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em>-themed MOBA will no longer be taking registrations and membership renewals after October 31st this year, nor will it continue selling in-game Aeos gems.</p>
<p>Following that, the game will become unavailable for play in Belgium and the Netherlands on November 30th next year. That means you'll have around 13 months to continue playing it after registrations end if you're in either of those countries.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-unite-shutting-down-belgium-netherlands-pikachu.jpg?itok=jZeJSw1t 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-unite-shutting-down-belgium-netherlands-pikachu.jpg?itok=BN2oiEDF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pokemon Unite&nbsp;</em>is shutting down in Belgium and the Netherlands next year.</figcaption></figure><p>Serebii's account is corroborated by a number of Dutch and Belgian&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Unite&nbsp;</em>players <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonUnite/comments/1fqgclh/goodbye_unite_belgium/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">over in this Reddit thread</a>, many of whom say they received a notice that&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Unite&nbsp;</em>is shutting down shortly after applying a new update to the game.</p>
<p>While the notice itself doesn't seem to give any reason for the game's shutdown in these countries, it's almost certainly due to their especially strict laws regarding loot boxes and gacha mechanics in games.</p>
<p>Games as high-profile as&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-backs-down-versus-belgium-loot-box-laws-removes-fifa-points"><em>FIFA</em></a> (now known as&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC</em>)&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rocket-league-loot-boxes-can-no-longer-be-opened-in-belgium-and-netherlands"><em>Rocket League</em></a>, as well as titles developed by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/loot-box-laws-are-shutting-down-two-nintendo-mobile-titles-in-belgium">Nintendo</a>, have fallen foul of Belgian loot box laws in the past.</p>
<p>Things aren't much different in the Netherlands on this front; back in 2020, the Dutch government <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netherlands-heavily-penalises-ea-over-loot-boxes-ea-appeals">heavily penalized EA</a> over the presence of loot boxes in the Ultimate Team mode of what was then known as&nbsp;<em>FIFA</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ea-sports-fc-25-ultimate-team-loot-boxes.jpg?itok=VxK5Yq9p 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ea-sports-fc-25-ultimate-team-loot-boxes.jpg?itok=ZokPFf9p 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Companies like EA have also fallen foul of Benelux's loot box laws.</figcaption></figure><p>Again, The Pokemon Company and TiMi haven't explicitly stated that Belgium and the Netherlands' restrictive loot box laws are the reason for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Unite</em>'s shutdown in those areas.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that this won't affect&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Unite</em>'s operation in other areas, so if you're still playing the game in the US, the UK, or anywhere else it hasn't yet been discontinued, you'll be fine.</p>
<p><em>Pokemon Unite&nbsp;</em>is available to play for free right now on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/pokemon-unite-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> and mobile devices. Stay tuned for more.</p>

		<p><em>While it's true talking about video games for a living forges a different relationship with the medium, all of are living through an age of bounty. There are too many video games to play, and it's impossible to ever feel "caught up."</em></p><p><em> The concept of "choice" and the overabundance of "choice" has been a reoccurring theme in this ongoing letter series with Rob and Patrick, and comes up here, too. This can often lead to a situation where you spend time with an excellent game and move on, creating a weird sense of guilt. It's my free time, I should spend it how I like? And yet, as you watch the games pile up, it can feel a little weird!</em></p><p><em>Rob and Patrick couldn't be more different in terms of the types of games they play, too. Which is probably a good place to transition to the conversation itself...</em></p><hr><p><strong>Patrick: </strong>So Rob, I’m not sure about you, but at any given time, I’m trying to juggle between three or four games that I’m playing at the same time. Some games require patience and focus and a dark room, others can be played with one eye while still chatting with one of my daughters. I took inventory before writing this, and here are the games I’m in the middle of at the moment:</p><ul><li><em>Arco </em>(93.9 hours. I’m guessing you’re wrong about that one, Steam. Probably 10?)</li><li><em>UFO 50</em> (Steam says 81.3 hours, which is also incorrect. More like two hours.)</li><li><em>Tactical Breach Wizards</em> (2 hours)</li><li><em>Star Wars: Outlaws </em>(3 hours)</li><li><em>Iron Meat</em> (1 hour)</li><li><em>The Plucky Square</em> (5 hours)</li><li><em>NFL Retro Bowl 25</em> (5 hours)</li><li><em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> (4 hours)</li><li><em>Arranger </em>(2 hours)</li></ul><p>That is not three for four games, but if I’m being honest, I’m not actually juggling all of those games, either. Some of those games—<em>Arranger, Black Myth: Wukong, Star Wars Outlaws</em>—are prime candidates for being left behind entirely. I will, inevitably, tell myself I’ll “play them over the holidays” to feel better.”<em> NFL Retro Bowl 25 </em>is something I pluck at when I want to push my brain further into mush after the Bears have disappointed me yet again on Sunday. It also doesn’t have an “ending,” really, so there’s nothing to work towards except feeling done with it.</p><p>One of my ongoing flaws is finishing games that I start, which at its best means I’m playing 7/10 games and having experiences that better inform my view of the medium, while other times it means I begin to look like a gaming hoarder who can’t make up their mind. My two children are now old enough to take care of themselves through broad swathes of the day, which is opening up more hours for me to play games, but I seem to be amassing more video games, instead?</p><p>A few weekends ago, my wife was out of town and I had five children in the house at once, but they were all playing nice with one another and I managed to play Astro Bot on my couch, beer in hand, for two hours straight without being meaningfully interrupted. One of the neighborhood parents asked if I needed help, but I declined it because I did not want to interrupt the universe.</p><p>Anyway, it reminds me of an ongoing conversation we’ve had this year about overwhelming choice. Now, it’s true that our line of work means that we’re playing more games than the average person because we need something to talk about on a podcast, but I find myself doing this with television and movies all the time, too! Every time I boot up our family room Apple TV and see how many shows my wife and I have left lingering four episodes in, I turn the TV off.</p><p>I simply do not see it. And then I start a new TV show. How is <em>Slow Horses</em>?&nbsp;</p><p>But then eventually, the guilt catches up. I managed to see the endings to <em>Nine Sols</em> and <em>Valley Peaks</em> a few weeks back because I finally said “fuck it” and dedicated an evening to both of them. I’ll probably do the same with <em>Arco</em>, because I can feel the ending of that on the horizon.</p><p>You and I couldn’t be more different when it comes to the games we play, though. There is a little bit of overlap, though, but you tend to play more evergreen-ish games, experiences where there is no definitive ending to signal “hey, you could move on if you want to.” Obviously, I’m on the other end of the spectrum, where I’m put off by games that can’t be wrapped up in a bow. I get the sense that you don’t feel nearly as much of a hangup about leaving a game behind.</p><p>But it also means I end up dipping between lots of games and not finishing many of them. How do you manage feeling “full” on a game? What do you take as a signal to move on?</p><figure><figcaption><i><em>Frostpunk 2</em></i><span> is the kind of game that has an ending, and yet, there's plenty of reason to keep going.</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Rob: </strong>A thing I got from my time covering esports was a recognition that some games you can dedicate your life to and keep learning new things, and there are people out there who will and do. I might have a fairly broad view of strategy games but I will never understand <em>StarCraft </em>a fraction as well as someone who is moved to write an essay over on Team Liquid. So there are a lot of games you could never really finish in terms of mastering them or fully understanding them. So you can’t say, “I’ll be finished with this when I really understand it.” You might never get there, because the more you understand the more you’ll realize you don’t know.</p>

For PC players, things are getting more compact. For console users, updates are beginning to be improved in a significant way. Here’s everything you need to know about all the changes happening in the Xbox ecosystem.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197260" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Agatha All Along Star Sasheer Zamata On Witchcraft And Star Trek" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="348" data-playlist="197260,197209,196923" data-current="197260"><div><p>Agatha All Along Star Sasheer Zamata On Witchcraft And Star Trek</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22805.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h99840"><a id=""></a><strong>Compact Mode</strong></h2><p>As an<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/09/25/xbox-update-september-game-bar-compact-mode/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/09/25/xbox-update-september-game-bar-compact-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Xbox blog post</a></span> detailed, PC players can now use a compact version of the Game Bar. This feature allows you to select recently played games, explore the widget store, and navigate common game launchers. The compact mode had been available to “Insiders,” and is now open to all, designed to make it less cumbersome to use when playing on smaller screens, especially if you’re streaming to mobile.</p><p>In addition to using a controller, users can now quit a running game by going to the Home widget, selecting the game, and pressing “Close.” If this sounds familiar, it’s because this feature is built into the Xbox consoles.</p><p>Turning on Compact Mode is fairly simple. To do so, all users need to do is go to the Game Bar, select “Settings,” then go under the “General” tab and switch “<strong>Compact Mode</strong>” on.</p><h2 id="h99841"><a id=""></a><strong>Game Management</strong></h2><p>Now, we can view and install all add-ons to the game they’re downloading, regardless of when they were first bought, and whether on PC or via the Xbox App. If a game that you’re installing has add-ons, they’ll be displayed in one place for you to see.</p><p>To take advantage of this feature, you need to right-click any game you have installed or visit the left navigation panel. Once there, click on “Manage” and then “Add-ons,” and you’ll be able to see it in there.</p><h2 id="h99842"><a id=""></a><strong>Xbox App</strong></h2><p>If you’re an Xbox beta member, you’ll already be able to start using features from the Xbox Game Pass app within the Xbox app, as Microsoft attempts to streamline the two. Beta members can now look through Game Pass and manage their memberships from the Xbox App. If they’re subscribed to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, they’ll be able to claim their perks and stream specific games via Xbox Cloud Gaming on iOS or Android devices. This will all soon be arriving for the rest of us, too.</p><p>Because of this, the Xbox Game Pass app will no longer support new downloads starting in November. Coo, it’s going to app heaven.</p><h2 id="h99843"><a id=""></a><strong>Xbox Consoles</strong></h2><p>If you’ve ever sat down on your couch to enjoy some Xbox gaming, and then been notified that what you want to play requires a 75GB update (hello, <em>Fortnite</em>), then this feature should give you hope. There’s a new setting that will pre-download updates, and set them live as soon as the developer says “go.”</p><p>To enable this new feature, to go to “My Games &amp; Apps” and then “Manage” and select “Updates.” From there, you’ll see all the pre-downloads, which at the moment is not very many. This feature currently only works with <em>Sea of Thieves</em>, <em>Minecraft</em>, and <em>Cassette Beasts</em>, but “many more” titles will soon support it.</p><h2 id="h99844"><a id=""></a><strong>Wish list notifications</strong></h2><p>If a game on your wish list becomes part of a Free Play Day, hits its release date, or joins Game Pass, you’ll now be notified. What a novel concept. And you can, of course, switch off this notification, although if you want to, it’s not clear why you were wishlisting things in the first place.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">Perfectionism is a great source of misery for me. It's the thing that keeps me from writing a book, striking up more conversations, and trying my hand at woodcrafting. And it's what makes me hyper-critical of the things I <em>do </em>do (if you think internet commenters can be mean about someone's writing, you would weep at what I make of my own work). But from a standpoint that I'm sure no therapist would endorse, perfection can also be <em>delightful</em>.</p><p dir="ltr">When it comes to playing games, there is no shortage of ways you can achieve greatness and soak in the enjoyment that comes with that. Clearing the screen in Tetris, pulling off a sick 360 no-scope, or turning the tables and eking out a victory with a sliver of health can all be immensely satisfying experiences.</p><p dir="ltr">But there's something I've always found about Into the Breach--and, more recently, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tactical-breach-wizards-review-breach-and-cast/1900-6418270/" data-ref-id="1900-6418270">excellent Tactical Breach Wizards</a>, which shares some design DNA with Into the Breach--that transcends the satisfaction I've ever found with any other game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374876-tsb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4374876" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374876-tsb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4374876"></a><figcaption>Tactical Breach Wizards</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374876-tsb.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">As in Into the Breach, Tactical Breach Wizards centers around the manipulation of spacing and reacting to the certainty of knowing what comes next. Within its turn-based and grid-based format, you're given insight into what your opponents will do next, meaning you know precisely what dire future awaits as soon as you click End Turn. Maybe you're going to lose a unit, fail an objective, or have to restart entirely. Not being a roguelike, as Into the Breach is, the stakes are much lower in Tactical Breach Wizards, but that clarity of the consequences of your failure elevates the impact of your choices. You can clearly see the doom to come--and then you get to bask in the pleasure of having figured out how to upend that outcome.</p><p dir="ltr">And it's the way in which you do that in Tactical Breach Wizards that makes it so enjoyable. You can directly inflict damage on foes, and that is a reliable means of dealing with them in many cases. But quite often, you have to rely on adjusting their positioning and upcoming actions to facilitate your desired outcome. Oh, you planned to attack me? Actually, you're going to spend the next turn knocking out your teammate who would have dealt me a fatal blow, after watching as half of your allies are thrown out of windows.</p><p dir="ltr">Because you can preview the result of your choices, you can play out every move on the chess board to find the best option. And that result is often so wildly beyond my initial expectations of what is possible, particularly as the game gives your characters more and more upgrades to navigate and alter the battlefield.</p><p dir="ltr">Tactical Breach Wizards eventually became a constant exercise in twisting things around on <em>every</em> turn of each level. I would spend my time in this almost zen-like state of flowing to and fro within the constraints and threats around me, manipulating enemies, probing for different possibilities until finding that absolute perfect series of moves.</p><p dir="ltr">Any time I start to find a game too easy, I'm quick to jack up the difficulty until I can be sufficiently miserable. Yet in Tactical Breach Wizards, while the thought crossed my mind periodically, I found that I ended up positively giddy with the end result of so many levels, cackling in disbelief, and I didn't want to rob myself of that sensation. I never fail a level, something that in most games would elicit boredom, due to the fact that it's usually the act of standing on the precipice of failure that generates excitement for me. Instead, the excitement here comes from seeing if I can thread the needle in a way that feels impossible when first examining a new level--and successfully managing to do so is a thrill unlike almost any other. Combine this with the number of times I would recoil at the sight of a challenging level, only to find a way to flawlessly complete it in a <em>single turn</em>, and Tactical Breach Wizards plays right into my perfection-obsessed brain.</p><p dir="ltr">It's not possible to complete every level in one turn--or at least I don't think so, though the way in which you can chain abilities to extend a single turn is one of the big gameplay differentiators from Into the Breach. But it is possible far more often than those first glimpses, even at the larger-scale maps from late in the game, would suggest. The prospect of victory seems daunting, and the notion of achieving success in one turn is laughable, but it is frequently possible and leads to an incredible feeling when managing to pull it off.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374877-tsbdefenestrate.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4374877" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374877-tsbdefenestrate.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4374877"></a><figcaption>A good ol' defenestration</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374877-tsbdefenestrate.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">My total playtime in Tactical Breach Wizards ended up far above the norm from those I've spoken with. Some of that is from doing so many of the bonus objectives and all of the side missions, none of which I was willing to miss thanks to both the game's stellar, hilarious writing and another opportunity to do what initially seemed impossible. But the bigger factor in my playtime was the excessive amount of time I'd spend on each turn, examining what approach I could take, the different outcomes that could be achieved, and the wide range of possibilities that exist. (The fact that it never gets old blasting enemies out of windows--<em>defenestrating</em> them, as the game happily teaches you--didn't hurt, either.)</p><p dir="ltr">Perfectionism might be one of my biggest challenges in life, but in Tactical Breach Wizards, it's the key to making the most of one of my favorite gaming experiences ever.</p>

                <p>StarCraft has largely been dormant since Blizzard <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starcraft-2-content-updates-have-ended-so-blizzard-can-focus-on-the-franchises-future/1100-6483434/" data-ref-id="1100-6483434">stopped updating StarCraft II in 2020</a> to focus on the future of the franchise. But now, there's a report that Blizzard is taking another stab at making a StarCraft shooter after two previous attempts failed.</p><p>Jason Schreier, who wrote the upcoming book, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-co-founder-founder-left-because-he-was-tired-of-fighting-bobby-kotick-report/1100-6526714/" data-ref-id="1100-6526714">Play Nice: The Rise, Fall, and Future of Blizzard Entertainment</a>, appeared on IGN's <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/crazy-blizzard-stories-with-jason-schreier-unlocked-661" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Unlocked podcast</a> where he revealed that the remnants of the team behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzards-untitled-survival-game-has-been-canceled-after-president-leaves-report/1100-6520603/" data-ref-id="1100-6520603">Blizzard's canceled survival game</a> are "incubating" a StarCraft shooter. Additionally, the project is reportedly being overseen by Dan Hay, who is a veteran developer with experience on Ubisoft's Far Cry games.</p><p>Although StarCraft has a rich mythology that is ripe with storytelling potential, Blizzard hasn't been able to fully translate that into a shooter yet. The first attempt, StarCraft: Ghost, started development in 2001 and it languished in development for years before Blizzard finally pulled the plug. A second shooter, StarCraft: Ares, was reportedly canceled in 2019.</p><p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-the-game-pass-titles-announced-at-xbox-tgs-2024-starcraft-remastered-legend-of-mana-and-more/1100-6526725/" data-ref-id="1100-6526725">StarCraft Remastered and StarCraft 2</a> were announced as upcoming titles on Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass. Both titles will arrive on November 5. Hopefully the response to those games will convince Activision Blizzard and its new owner, Microsoft, to finally move forward on StarCraft 3.</p>

			<p>The<a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-mod-removes-the-psn-account-requirement-patch-2-fixes-nvidia-dlss-frame-gen/"> God of War Ragnarok PC port</a> is most definitely solid, but it offers few options to scale visual settings beyond the PlayStation 5 version and sometimes looks worse than it as well.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Digital Foundry provided an in-depth look at the port, highlighting how the new version of the game is a great way to play it, thanks to shader compilation issues being pretty much non-existent, thanks to the move to DirectX 12 over its predecessor, great support for ultra-wide and super-wide aspect ratios, NVIDIA DLSS, AMD FSR, and Intel XeSS upscalers, complete with frame generation where applicable and more.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, besides hitting higher resolutions with smoother performance, God of War Ragnarok cannot look much better than the console release, as the port doesn't offer many options to scale beyond it. In some instances, the PC port even looks worse than the PS5 version in Quality Mode, due to the PC release missing the cubemap tracing system, and some effects, such as moving mist in a certain dream sequence. Portal transitions also aren't as smooth as on consoles, which is most definitely weird, as they look better even on PlayStation 4.</p>
<p>The God of War Ragnarok PC port also has some performance issues on Ryzen 3000 series CPUs and some tessellation setting issues, among other things, which could definitely be fixed with future patches. You can find Digital Foundry's full analysis <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-a-quality-port-with-small-issues-and-here-are-our-best-settings-selections">here</a> and its video version below.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fender-monster-hunter-guitar</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fender-monster-hunter-guitar-lets-you-rock-out-with-rathalos.994434/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fender-monster-hunter-guitar<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Fender and Capcom have announced a collaboration to create a&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter</em>-themed guitar, with the King of the Skies himself, Rathalos, providing the principal inspiration for the instrument.</p>
<p>In a press release, Fender and Capcom describe the Rathalos-themed guitar as an "extraordinary instrument for both game enthusiasts and music lovers", which I suppose it had better be, given that it'll cost you a whopping $2000.</p>
<p>The guitar is a special-edition Telecaster, but unlike most Telecasters, it's got a humbucker for its neck pickup and a single coil for its bridge, so you can choose between heavy, chunky tones "perfect for pairing with distortion pedals" and the thinner twang for which the Telecaster is known.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-rathalos-telecaster-guitar.jpeg?itok=7kP3yZFL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-rathalos-telecaster-guitar.jpeg?itok=RMSTcUix 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>Telecaster is a thing of beauty.</figcaption></figure><p>The basic model of this Telecaster features a&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter</em>-inspired design on both the body of the guitar and its twelfth fret marker, so you can rock out and pay tribute to Rathalos at the same time.</p>
<p>On the special Japan-only Limited Edition model, you'll find "Rathalos' distinctive wings and flame patterns", and the pickguard features "claw marks", as if Rathalos himself has attacked your guitar (or as if he's been playing it).</p>
<p>You can also expect a glow-in-the-dark effect for the fretboard's side dots and twelfth fret marker on the Limited Edition model, so if you're playing this one during a gig and you want the lights to go down, you'll still create a striking impression.</p>
<p>If you pick this one up, you won't just get the guitar; you'll get a black hardshell case as well, in addition to a certificate of authenticity proving that you own a genuine version of the instrument rather than a replica.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fender-monster-hunter-rathalos-telecaster.jpeg?itok=wBd6DZc_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fender-monster-hunter-rathalos-telecaster.jpeg?itok=pETo26XY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Just look at that finish.</figcaption></figure><p>This guitar is just one part of&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-series-sales-100-million-anniversary">20th-anniversary celebrations</a>, and the franchise is still very much going strong today; the latest installment,&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-release-date">set for release in February</a>.</p>
<p>Fender's&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>Telecaster will be available <a href="https://www.fender.com/en-US/electric-guitars/telecaster/monster-hunter-rathalos-telecaster-rosewood-fingerboard-rathalos-red/5602600899.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">via Fender.com</a> and via "authorized Fender dealers worldwide" starting from March next year. The Limited Edition model will only be available via Fender Flagship Tokyo and Fender's official Japanese online store.</p>

In <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/4696781406111167992?utm_source=SteamDB">an update on Thursday</a>, Steam says <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fsubscriber_agreement%3Fsnr%3D2_groupannouncements_detail_%2310">its subscriber agreement</a> “now provides that any disputes are to go forward in court instead of arbitration.”</p><p>Many companies include a forced arbitration clause in their user agreement, waiving a person’s right to a trial in court. Arbitration involves settling a dispute outside a legal system before an impartial third party. This method is often faster but may not get the best results for consumers, as arbitrators <a href="https://www.consumeradvocates.org/for-consumers/arbitration/#:~:text=Arbitration%20is%20a%20private%20system%20without%20a%20judge%2C%20jury%2C%20or%20a%20right%20to%20an%20appeal.%C2%A0Arbitrators%20aren%27t%20required%20to%20take%20the%20law%20and%20legal%20precedent%20into%20account%20in%20making%20their%20decisions.%20There%20is%20no%20appeal%20or%20public%20review%20of%20decisions%20to%20ensure%20the%20arbitrator%20got%20it%20right.">don’t need to consider the law</a> when issuing a decision.</p><p>Many services put mandatory arbitration agreements in their terms of service, which <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4521064">people may not even read or fully understand</a>. Disney recently <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/14/24220228/disney-wrongful-death-lawsuit-subscription-terms">attempted to dismiss a wrongful death</a> lawsuit after a woman died following an allergic reaction at one of its Walt Disney World resorts. The company argued that because the widower agreed to a forced arbitration policy when signing up for Disney Plus, he didn’t have the right to sue (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/20/24224277/disney-wrongful-death-lawsuit-waiving-arbitration">Disney later conceded</a>).</p><p>Previously, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240901011847/https://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement/">Steam’s user agreement</a> said that “you and Valve agree to resolve all disputes and claims between us in individual binding arbitration” for all disputes related to Steam, your account, hardware, or the company’s content and services. The new agreement eliminates any mention of a binding arbitration policy.</p><p>Steam doesn’t say why it decided to suddenly remove the forced arbitration clause. <a href="https://www.404media.co/steam-removes-forced-arbitration-clause-gamers-can-now-sue-valve/">As pointed out by <em>404 Media</em></a>, a group of plaintiffs recently challenged Valve’s forced arbitration policy and were able to file a class action lawsuit over Steam’s dominance.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

And, astonishingly for the increasingly mercenary game, the event is free! To get started, all you need to do is catch eight Pokémon of any type, and you’ll begin the quest, starting with a completely unexplained choice between “Sword Path” and “Shield Path.”</p><p>It’s sadly rather typical of <em>POGO</em> at this point to present players with such a decision without any prompt or warning what difference it’ll make.

So either route means you get a bunch of dreary but incredibly easy tasks—use eight berries, power up eight times, catch eight Pokémon, then explore 3km, use an incense, and catch another eight Pokémon—which will net you encounters with specific Pokémon, a few Great and Ultra balls, and a thimble-full of XP and Stardust.</p><figure id="" data-id="b21f1b926c92dfab70af63e5e92c3e49" data-recommend-id="image://b21f1b926c92dfab70af63e5e92c3e49" data-format="jpg" data-width="1440" data-height="810" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Zamazenta, sneaking in for balance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Zamazenta, sneaking in for balance." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Niantic</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b21f1b926c92dfab70af63e5e92c3e49" data-recommend-id="image://b21f1b926c92dfab70af63e5e92c3e49" data-format="jpg" data-width="1440" data-height="810" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Zamazenta, sneaking in for balance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But what are those Pokémon, you cry! Um. Yeah. If you pick Sword you’ll get rewarded with—and I’m not kidding—Koffing, Galarian Darumaka, Deino and Rufflet. If your choice is Shield, then it’s the dizzying excitement of Koffing, Galarian Ponyta, Larvitar and Vullaby. Yeah, no kidding, the rewards contain not one single Pokémon original to Galar, and just two that are at least local variants. Oh, and all of these Pokémon are regularly just found in the wild, some of them in the game <em>right now</em>.</p><p>The path choice will also give you a different set of Pokémon for a collection challenge, although both include the Galarian starters, Grookey, Scorbunny and Sobble, then bizarrely just swaps out the banal gang that make up the rest to be a trade challenge for the opposite path. Imagine having to trade to get a Seedot—that’s a thing here! And the reward for completing the catch challenge? A SKWOVET. You know, the squirrel thing that you see seventeen of every time you play, and <em>was the prize for collecting the eight Pokémon at the start of this bloody thing</em>.</p><p><em>However</em>, there is one aspect about which I don’t feel scorn, beyond that Niantic is at least not charging for this bizarre anticlimax: it’ll be possible to encounter shiny Zacian for the first time, and that’s a cool, blue dog-lion-thing. Zacian is in 5-star raids, so load up Poke Genie and start grinding for your shiny.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pokemongolive.com/post/galarian-expedition-2024?hl=en&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pokemongolive.com/post/galarian-expedition-2024?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shiny Zamazenta is arriving in raids October 4</a></span>, with the start of Galarian Expedition, along with yet another $8 Master Ball research task.</p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">ScarlettVixen has officially released Mario Adventure 3, a ROM hack (the legality of playing games with ROMs is nebulous at best) for Super Mario Bros. 3, which has been in development for 20 years. The developer stated, "It's been an extremely long project, but after 12 years, it's finally here. Many of this game's elements are iterations and polishes on concepts found in prior projects. Mario Adventure 3 is more than a 12-year project, it's a 20-year amalgamation of ideas waiting to see fruition."</p><p dir="ltr">The first version of Mario Adventure debuted in 2002, and subsequent hacks like Luigi's Coin Quest and Luigi vs. Mario continued to build on its foundation. In Mario Adventure 3, ScarlettVixen integrates features from earlier projects, while adding new elements to the game. Check out a trailer below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VN1ORLvuamI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VN1ORLvuamI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The hack includes a variety of features, such as a day-and-night cycle, weather effects, an item shop, and exploration-heavy mechanics. Players can traverse and backtrack through worlds without cutscenes, a concept introduced in Luigi's Coin Quest. Hidden collectibles unlock access to otherwise blocked areas, encouraging players to explore deeply.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition, Mario Adventure 3 features major technical upgrades, including a custom level format, an optimized tile-collision system, and rebuilt enemies. ScarlettVixen shared in an <a href="https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=viewthread&amp;t=127986" rel="nofollow ">SMW Central forum post</a> that "roughly 75% of the game has been rewritten from the ground up." New power-ups, like the Ninja Mushroom that allows wall-jumping, and a revamped item system are also introduced. The hack pushes NES hardware by displaying up to 28 colors on screen at once and features a full save system, allowing players to revisit completed levels.</p><p dir="ltr">The game's plot centers on the Malice Mushrooms invading Bowser's Kingdom, with Bowser blaming Princess Peach's kingdom for the infestation. Mario must clear the Malice to prevent a war between the kingdoms.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">The PlayStation Store has reportedly disclosed more PS5 Pro Enhanced games than originally known, revealing big-name games like Fortnite and Madden NFL 25 will look better on the upcoming system. All together, it now appears 54 titles will take advantage of the PS5 Pro so far.</p><p dir="ltr">This discovery comes from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1fq8jo5/every_ps5_pro_enhanced_game_confirmed/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit user ZXXII</a>, who says they checked "the PS Store page for a new PS5 Pro Enhanced label." GameSpot checked out <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/228748" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">store pages for Fortnite</a>, for example, that showcase a PS5 Pro Enhanced tag. The same is true for Madden NFL 25, EA Sports College Football 25, and Warframe.

The upgraded console is planned to come out in November, with the company saying that 40-50 PS5 Pro Enhanced games should be available at launch. The initial catalog of titles touted for PS5 Pro included Demon's Souls, The First Descendant, and Marvel's Spider-Man 2. Assassin's Creed Shadows will also be supported, though <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-until-early-2025/1100-6526703/" data-ref-id="1100-6526703">Ubisoft just delayed the action-adventure game to early 2025</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/my-time-with-the-ps5-pro-reaffirmed-i-shouldnt-spend-700-right-now-my-base-ps5-is-still-enough/1100-6526684/" data-ref-id="1100-6526684">GameSpot spent time with the PS5 Pro</a> and wasn't necessarily swayed to shell out $700 for the upgraded console.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-real-time-combat-mod-now-allows-party-to-get-involved/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Since the release of Patch 7 for Baldur's Gate 3, the modding scene has been inundated with new projects, as Patch 7 saw the release of the official modding toolkit. As previously covered, one particular modder named <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@tinybike" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tinybike</a> is working on turning the combat into <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-modder-working-on-real-time-combat-mod/">real-time combat</a>. Originally, they shared a video of how their progress was coming along, and it only showed the main character facing off against an enemy with no sort of party in sight.</p>
<p>There have been many new mods released for Baldur's Gate 3, as well as many being showcased as they are in production. This includes mods such as making new maps, and taking players to lands such as Avernus. This particular mod has been in production since the toolkit came out, and tinybike has released a new YouTube video that shows off the mod in detail, and how the mod has evolved since last time.</p>
<p><iframe title="Real time combat test 3 - companions &amp; timers (Baldur's Gate 3)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C0FBQknd0mU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In the description of the one-minute video, TinyBike stated that this was a "very rough draft" and started testing out the companion and ally AI battles in a new campaign on Balanced difficulty. While they've said that this is a rough draft, it still seems rather detailed and actually allows cutscenes to happen without the possibility of imminent death while you're trying to have a conversation. However, the video does take place on the Nautiloid, which doesn't exactly harbor a ton of danger. In the video, the combat is incredibly fast-paced and chaotic, with enemies dying quickly.</p>
<p>"Many people have commented that combat seems really imbalanced, which is 100% true," they stated in a previous test video also posted on their YouTube. Even in the latest test video, this also seems to be true, as combat seems to be swayed in your team's favor. In a previous test video, tinybike commented, saying, "The main challenge right now is that the built-in BG3 combat AI is only accessible during turn-based combat. Just to test things out, I'm using some simple handrolled 'AI' logic, but I suspect this won't work well for more complicated encounters."</p>
<p>The beginning combats are relatively simple to some of the ones that players encounter later on, where it's possible to end up in combat with up to twenty enemies at once. Of course, it only gets harder once you change the difficulty, which would most likely add some extra complications to coding a project as big as this. The project is progressing nicely, but features like multiple attacks, stealth, and initiative all need to be added to this mod.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/vampire-survivors-studio-poncle-moves-into-publishing.994374/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-survivors-studio-poncle-publishing<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Vampire Survivors&nbsp;</em>developer Poncle has announced that it's opening a publishing wing, but it sounds like the indie studio doesn't want to do things the way most traditional publishers do.</p>
<p>Speaking at an investor and publisher event in Liverpool in the UK yesterday (<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/vampire-survivor-developer-poncle-opens-publishing-arm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">via GamesIndustry.biz</a>), Poncle says that although it's moving into publishing, it doesn't "want IP" in the same way most publishers do.</p>
<p>Instead, Poncle wants to allow developers to "make their games", with the emphasis on "their"; the studio says it wants, in GI.biz writer Vikki Blake's words, to "work more as a label or fund" rather than as a publisher in the traditional sense.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/poncle-vampire-survivors-publisher-gameplay.jpg?itok=UVYz61Sp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/poncle-vampire-survivors-publisher-gameplay.jpg?itok=CiIn3jRt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Vampire Survivors&nbsp;</em>dev Poncle is branching out into publishing.</figcaption></figure><p>Poncle says it's looking for games made with "sincerity, passion, and depth", according to the GI.biz report. It'll offer those games support for funding, platforms, localization, and more, as well as development advice.</p>
<p>Additionally, Poncle wants to offer its signings marketing support, helping them to create what Poncle says will be "replayable, affordable, and fun" games, akin to the philosophy that birthed&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors</em>.</p>
<p>However, Poncle also says it doesn't want to sign <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pathfinder-gallowspire-survivors-10-release-date">"Survivor-like" games</a>; that's one of the studio's "insta-nos", so if you've got a&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors</em>-<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/temtem-swarm-announced-mashing-together-pokemon-like-creatures-and-survivors-style">esque game</a> to pitch, you might want to look elsewhere.</p>
<p>The newly-minted publisher's other major no-nos include Web3 games, as well as anything that uses generative AI and any kind of free-to-play mobile game. It sounds like Poncle's publishing heart is very much in the right place.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/soulstone-survivors-gameplay.jpg?itok=l75cprht 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/soulstone-survivors-gameplay.jpg?itok=AxQaScjW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Got a&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors</em>-style game to pitch? Don't pitch it to Poncle's new publishing wing.</figcaption></figure><p>Poncle has yet to announce what its first major publishing project will be, but in the meantime,&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors&nbsp;</em>is still very much firing on all cylinders.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://x.com/poncle_vampire/status/1838926583823831488" rel="noopener" target="_blank">major update "that no-one knows about" for the game</a> is in the works, and&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors&nbsp;</em>is also getting the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/vampire-survivors-getting-animated-tv-show" rel="noopener" target="_blank">animated series treatment</a>, although I'm not entirely sure how production company Story Kitchen is going to handle this one. We'll have to wait and see, I suppose.</p>

It’s an unexpected difficulty spike in a game that’s mostly about the simple joys of carving up mob after mob of brutal alien hordes, at least if you’re playing solo with AI-controlled allies.</p><figure id="" data-id="645dc3357e022956dea6d3b8b4600238" data-recommend-id="image://645dc3357e022956dea6d3b8b4600238" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Space Marine fights gargoyles.

In addition to the PVP Sparring Arena, private matchmaking, and ultrawide support on PC, the update tinkers a lot with the AI bots that accompany you during the campaign in single-player. The biggest change is that your space marine brothers will more aggressively aid your during fights without stealing too much glory for themselves:<br></p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Various inhibiting restrictions were lifted, allowing bots to be more helpful and effective, while still not beating the game for the player</li><li>Bots will now help focus-firing zoanthropes when the player attacks them.</li><li>Heavily eased restrictions on bots finishing of enemies instead of leaving them for the player, to reduce annoyance.</li><li><strong>Bots are now allowed to help with Gargoyle objectives</strong></li><li>Fixed a variety of bugs related to bots getting stuck</li><li>Fixed a bug where bots can run out of ammo on weapons without a magazine</li></ul></blockquote><p>While this has consequences for the entire campaign, the developers at Saber Interactive specifically call out the Gargoyle objectives. Previously, the AI bots would follow you around and hang back even when the health bar on one of the towers was plunging to zero. Now, they’ll actually join in the fight, similar to if you were playing with real humans. It’s also interesting to see the restriction “heavily eased” on bots finishing off enemies. Brutal finishers are a way to quickly restore your character’s shield in the middle of a tense fight. I’ll be curious to see if that becomes harder with the renewed bloodlust of the bots. </p><p>The rest of the patch deals primarily with bugs and map fixes. It also improves the customization options for dressing up your marine. Operations Mode spawns for Chaos enemies have been nerfed a lot as well, though elsewhere, enemies like the Hive Tyrant have been made more difficult in the regular campaign. A lot more content is on the way for<em> Space Marine 2</em>,&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;http:// https://kotaku.com/space-marine-2-faq-pvp-spawns-servers-veteran-co-op-1851652630&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http:// https://kotaku.com/space-marine-2-faq-pvp-spawns-servers-veteran-co-op-1851652630" target="_blank">including new classes</a></span>, but for now this looks like a nice set of tweaks.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/remedy-entertainment-gets-e15-million-loan-from-tencent/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Remedy Entertainment, the developers behind Control and Alana Wake, have entered a loan agreement with Tencent for €15 million ($16.76 million). </p>



<p>The announcement comes <a href="https://news.cision.com/remedy-entertainment-oyj/r/inside-information--remedy-enters-into-a-eur-15-million-convertible-loan-agreement-with-tencent,c4043667" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">via press release</a> from Remedy on Friday morning. It’s a move that Remedy CEO Tero Virtala says allows the company to move forward with development of games as well as self-publish future titles.</p>



<h6 id="h-related-remedy-partners-with-annapurna-to-bring-control-and-alan-wake-to-film-and-television">RELATED: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/remedy-partner-annapurna-control-alan-wake/">Remedy Partners With Annapurna To Bring Control and Alan Wake To Film and Television</a></h6>



<p>“Part of Remedy’s long-term strategy has been to strengthen our position in the value chain, to have more control over how our games are commercialized, and to grow our share of the value these games can create,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“As we move towards self-publishing, this financing will support us in developing and fully realizing the potential of the games we have in development and successfully carrying out the commercial activities of our next self-published games. Tencent’s investment demonstrates strong confidence in Remedy’s long-term vision and strategy.”</p>



<p>Remedy currently has a number of games in development, including Control 2 and Control spin-off game Project Condor. The studio is also working on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/control-2-is-now-playable-as-max-payne-1-2-remake-enters-full-production/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 remake</a> that is in full production.</p>



<p>The convertible loan agreement carries an 8% annual non-cash interest rate that will convert at €27.2($30.40) per share. The price will allow the loan to be converted up to 811,100 new Remedy shares. That represents roughly 5.98% of all shares in the company.</p>



<p>Tencent currently owns 15% of Remedy.</p>



<p>What do you think of Remedy getting a loan from Tencent? Let us know in the comments below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums.</a></p>

As part of that, has consolidated the current playlist selection into the following:</p><p> • Battle Royale Solos &amp; Quads</p><p> • Resurgence Duos &amp; Quads</p><p>Plunder, Bootcamp, and active Limited-Time Modes will remain available, and Trios will continue to be available via Ranked Play, with the current season ending on Thursday, October 17.</p><p>However, it’s what Warzone has lost, rather than what it now has, that has sparked a backlash from fans, with Duos and Trios no longer available in Battle Royale mode, and Solos and Trios unavailable in Resurgence.</p><p>This means that from now until at least the launch of Black Ops 6 on October 25, Urikztsan (the current Battle Royale map) only supports Solos, Quads, and Plunder Quads, and Resurgence has a Duos and Quads map rotation, with Trios available in Ranked Play only via Rebirth Island (by far the smallest map in the game).</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>It’s fair to say this announcement has sparked a backlash from Warzone’s hardcore community. “This might be one of the worst decisions I’ve ever seen,” said YouTuber Westie. “You’re essentially sunsetting core branches of your game and giving no real explanation at the time the change is being made.</p><p>“Some added context/information would be wonderful.”</p><p>Here’s some more reaction:</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">There is no Way hahahahah</p>— James - JGOD (@JGODYT) <a href="https://twitter.com/JGODYT/status/1839350258339631537?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 26, 2024</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Black Ops 6 isn’t even out you don’t have to butcher the playlists till it drops lil bro🙏😭</p>— HunterTV☄️ (@itsHunterTV) <a href="https://twitter.com/itsHunterTV/status/1839350382679773642?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 26, 2024</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Just say you dont want us to play Warzone till BO6 drops… this is hilarious</p>— Chris (@STYLERZ97) <a href="https://twitter.com/STYLERZ97/status/1839358649078362262?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 26, 2024</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I’m 100% positive people would rather wait 5 minutes to get into a trios or duos than be forced to play quads man down or with randoms. Worst decision I’ve ever seen. Sheesh.</p>— Ral (@Rallied) <a href="https://twitter.com/Rallied/status/1839360922349097070?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 26, 2024</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">RIP to the social media guy posting this who had zero influence over this decision 😭 <a href="https://t.co/KwmvHqz3gd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/KwmvHqz3gd</a></p>— Isaac (@IceManIsaac) <a href="https://twitter.com/IceManIsaac/status/1839354342027211162?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 26, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Raven has yet to offer an explanation for its decision, but some are speculating it has to do with a need to maintain fast-filling lobbies amid a perceived shrinking playerbase. Players are also wondering why Raven namechecked the release of Black Ops 6 in its announcement — Warzone is set to incorporate the upcoming shooter’s mechanics, weapons, and gear into the game, but there’s no explanation for why this would require a playlist consolidation.</p><p>For now, Warzone players have no choice but to play with this new, consolidated playlist offering, or, as some are threatening, quit until their favorite ways to play return.</p><p>Last month, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/verdansk-is-finally-returning-to-call-of-duty-warzone-and-fans-are-delighted">Activision announced that Warzone is bringing back the map that started it all, Verdansk, in spring 2025</a>. Verdansk is the most beloved map in Warzone’s four-year history, and it returns to the battle royale complete with iconic points of interest such as Stadium, the Train Station, and Superstore. Fans are now hoping their favorite playlists will be available in time for Verdansk’s release.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.
