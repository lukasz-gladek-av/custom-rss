<p>Yoshinori Konishi (director and programming director), Hiroki Hamaue (programmer), and Takahisa Ikejiri (art director) sat down to share their experience in coming up with this unique online multiplayer title, which is controlled entirely with the Switch 2's Mouse Mode.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-20-drag-x-drive-part-1/">part 1</a>, Konishi shares that the game was inspired by "sports such as wheelchair basketball, wheelchair rugby, wheelchair motocross, BMX and skateboarding", particularly the former. So much so that the team actually made time to try playing wheelchair basketball in real life</p><div><figure data-videoid="epMKq3hLRsg" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/epMKq3hLRsg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytepMKq3hLRsg" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/epMKq3hLRsg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/epMKq3hLRsg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5f18d0opxyrt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>

<p>Hamaue had previously rode a wheelchair "for a research project back when I was a student", but for Konishi and Ikejiri, the first time they got to experience wheelchair basketball was at an experience in Osaka.</p>
<p>In terms of prep, "No one on the team had used a wheelchair on a daily basis, so we began by gathering up reading materials so we could learn more about it", Konishi detailed. "From an encyclopedia of wheelchairs to videos and essays by wheelchair athletes and even manga about basketball or wheelchairs, we pulled together as much reference material as we could lay our hands on and studied it together."</p>
<figure data-uuid="3dabc2054903f"><a title="Drag x Drive" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3dabc2054903f/drag-x-drive.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The team even bought an everyday wheelchair and sports wheelchair, the latter of which was important for designing the vehicle in-game thanks to its angled wheels. But the problem was the team couldn't really test them out in open spaces, because the project — and Switch 2, <em>and</em> Mouse Mode — were "highly confidential".</p>
<p>"We were restricted to the small space inside the office and could only let loose down the hallway once everyone else had gone home for the day. (Laughs)" Konishi reflects.</p>
<p>Talking about the wheelchair basketball experience, Ikejiri said that he "wasn't prepared for how difficult it was to shoot the ball" as the hoop is at the same height as a standard basketball game. "But since you take the shot sitting down, my shot didn't reach the basket at all."</p>
<p>"Maneuvering a wheelchair is difficult unless you get the hang of when to apply and release force," Hamaue added, "You can't just propel yourself along smoothly in a single stroke. But it cemented for me how deep the controls are".</p>

<p>In addition to trying out wheelchair basketball themselves, the team also had the opportunity to allow wheelchair basketball players to try out the prototype.</p>
<p>Konish said that this provided valuable insight for Drag x Drive, "Because the players use wheelchairs in their daily lives, they were all really good at turning and moving backwards in the game. Of course, we learned a lot about the controls, but we gained even more insights watching them think about what to do on the court as they played."</p>
<p>Hamaue adds to this that "seeing actual wheelchair basketball players get the hang of the game and its controls so quickly confirmed to us that it could work well as an intuitive control scheme." You can even see the team try out some movements themselves in <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-20-drag-x-drive-part-2/">Part 2 of the interview</a>, including tilting.</p>

<p>All <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-20-drag-x-drive-part-3/">three parts</a> contain video clips and test footage of Drag x Drive's development, and are worth reading through, especially if you're interested in checking out the new update.'</p>
<p>Since its release in August 2025, Drag x Drive has received two free updates — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/switch-2-exclusive-drag-x-drive-scores-first-major-update-includes-local-wireless-games-and-much-more">the first added</a> wireless multiplayer while the second added a Survival Tag mode.</p>

			<p>A Chrono Trigger remake continues to be among the most requested remakes of classic JRPGs released in the 90s. Although it is not officially on the horizon, something could be brewing, judging from Dragon Quest series creator Yuji Horii's reaction to a question related to the highly requested remake.</p>



<p>Speaking during a discussion program shared on YouTube on November 30, the legendary game creator was asked if the game's <a href="https://wccftech.com/chrono-trigger-30th-anniversary-projects/">30th Anniversary projects</a> are suggesting that the game is being remade. Interestingly, Horii-san did not deny the existence of the remake, replying instead that he cannot say anything about the matter and that he shouldn't be asked about it.</p>



<p>Although Yuji Horii's reaction is most definitely not a confirmation that a Chrono Trigger remake is in the works, the fact that he did not deny its existence could be telling.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="【11/30(日)生配信】㊗️堀井雄二「旭日小綬章」受章！｜マクロン大統領の写真が！？｜「DRAGON BALL STORE」に行ってみた！｜「ドラクエ1&amp;2 リメイク」やってみた！" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nq1II1jaiuA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>This isn't the first time the creator of the Dragon Quest series, who also worked on the SNES game as one of its writers, has discussed this highly requested remake in recent months. Back in May, <a href="https://wccftech.com/yuji-horii-seems-to-accidentally-confirm-a-chrono-trigger-remake-is-coming/">a translation error made during Horii-san's appearance at the Napoli Comicon </a><span><a href="https://wccftech.com/yuji-horii-seems-to-accidentally-confirm-a-chrono-trigger-remake-is-coming/" target="_blank">sparked hopes of a remake</a>, which is reportedly <a href="https://wccftech.com/chrono-trigger-remake-considered/">only being considered for a possible HD-2D overhaul</a>, rather than</span> a full-blown remake.</p>



<p>Chrono Trigger was originally released for the SNES in 1995 and later ported to the Nintendo DS, PC, and mobile platforms. These enhanced ports include additional content not found in the original release, such as new dungeons, a new final boss, and a new ending which connects the game better with its sequel, Chrono Cross, which was <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/chrono-cross-the-radical-dreamers-edition-iconic-yet-underserved/">remastered as The Radical Dreamers Edition in 2022. </a></p>



<p>Hopefully, these enhanced ports won't be the last we hear of what is widely considered one of the finest JRPGs ever made.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sony Halts Tencent From Promoting Light of Motiram During Horizon Lawsuit, Court Dates Set for January 2026]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/tencent-will-not-promote-light-of-motiram-sony-horizon-lawsuit/</link>
            <guid>1370551</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>When Tencent first showcased Light of Motiram, practically <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-clone-light-of-motiram-announced-for-pc/">everyone online looked at it and pegged it as a clone/rip-off of Sony's Horizon series</a>. So it wasn't that much of a surprise to onlookers when Sony issued a lawsuit against Tencent, calling it a "<em>slavish clone</em>." Now, a new report from <a href="https://thegamepost.com/tencent-promote-light-of-motiram-run-public-tests-sony-horizon-lawsuit-2026-hearing/">The Game Post</a> reveals that the suit has moved into its next phase, during which Tencent has agreed not to promote Light of Motiram.</p>



<p>This new phase is also a slowing of the proceedings between Sony and Tencent, with both sides asking the court to extend the current briefing period and to schedule the court hearings on <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-fights-back-light-of-motiram-lawsuit-horizon-wasnt-original/">Tencent's motion to dismiss the case</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-calls-tencent-defence-horizon-knock-off-light-of-motiram-nonsense/">Sony's recent injunction</a> to the same date in January 2026. </p>



<p>In the meantime, according to the latest filing, which was submitted to the Northern District of California on December 1, both sides have, according to the report, "<em>engaged in discussions in order to resolve the current dispute</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>SIE requested, and the Tencent Entities agree, that (a) the extended briefing schedule and later requested hearing date will not be used to argue that SIE delayed in seeking a preliminary injunction, (b) there will be no new promotion or public testing of Light of Motiram during the pendency of the Motion for Preliminary Injunction, (c) the</em> <em>Light of Moitram release will not be moved up to before Q4 2027, and (d) the Tencent Entities will not seek expedited discovery in connection with the Motion for Preliminary Injunction</em>."</p>



<p>The hearings for the motion to dismiss and the injunction will both take place on January 29, 2026, and ahead of that, Tencent will file its reply to Sony's injunction on December 17, 2025, with Sony's reply to that reply set for January 2, 2026. Basically, everyone is taking a big breath, and in the meantime, they'll prepare for what could be the conclusion of this suit by January 29, 2026.</p>



<p>Especially if the current discussions both sides have engaged in prove fruitful, and an agreement is able to be reached even before we get to the hearings in January.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Let It Die Offline Version Confirmed, Data Will Carry Over]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/let-it-die-offline-version</link>
            <guid>1370542</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Supertrick Games and publisher GungHo Online Entertainment have announced that they're bringing an offline mode to free-to-play action game&nbsp;<em>Let It Die</em>, thus, ironically, refusing to do what the game's title suggests.</p>

<p>During a recent stream focused on upcoming sequel&nbsp;<em>Let It Die: Inferno&nbsp;</em>(thanks, <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/let-it-die-offline-version-announced" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gematsu</a>), producer Uncle Death confirmed that an offline version of the game is coming since the studio has "gotten feedback from customers for a long time" asking for the feature.</p>

<p>The producer went on to say that Supertrick doesn't yet know when&nbsp;<em>Let It Die</em>'s offline mode will be available, but that data will be carried over from the online version, so you shouldn't lose any progress when the new mode does arrive.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/let-it-die-offline-mode-store.jpg?itok=DDbVqkPo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/let-it-die-offline-mode-store.jpg?itok=bZRo6xH0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Let It Die&nbsp;</em>is getting an offline mode soon.</figcaption></figure><p>The stream didn't contain any more information about&nbsp;<em>Let It Die</em>'s offline mode, but presumably, when it does arrive, you'll be able to play it on both PS4 and PC, assuming <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pubg-ps4-and-xbox-one-support-ending-in-november" rel="nofollow">support for the former</a> hasn't <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-finals-ps4-support-ending" rel="nofollow">ended by then</a>.</p>

<p>News of&nbsp;<em>Let It Die</em>'s offline mode comes amid controversy surrounding upcoming sequel&nbsp;<em>Let It Die: Inferno</em>, which, according to its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2576150/LET_IT_DIE_INFERNO/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam page</a>, uses generative AI for several assets and elements, including voices, music, background textures, and images.</p>

<p>Of course, GungHo and Supertrick aren't the only companies to be putting their eggs in the AI basket; our <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/examining-generative-ais-usage-in-steam-next-fest-2025" rel="nofollow">very own Don's recent report</a> shows that AI usage is becoming increasingly common in games on Steam, and companies like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-generative-ai-characters-pubg-inzoi" rel="nofollow">Krafton</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-generative-ai-vp" rel="nofollow">Netflix</a> have declared an affinity for the technology as well.</p>

<p>In any case, as far as we know, the original&nbsp;<em>Let It Die&nbsp;</em>doesn't use generative AI. What it does do, however, is offer a free-to-play action experience in which you can watch the Grim Reaper pull some sick skateboard tricks, and what more could you possibly want?</p>




<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Let It Die&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/794600/LET_IT_DIE/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0747-CUSA03769_00-APPLETITDIEUS000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS4</a>, and the sequel,&nbsp;<em>Let It Die: Inferno&nbsp;</em>(which isn't free-to-play), launches on December 4th.</p>

<p>As revealed in the <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/helldivers-movie-justin-lin-sony-1236438370/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Hollywood Reporter</a>, Lin will both direct and produce the movie, with his production company Perfect Storm Entertainment handling production duties alongside longtime producer Hutch Parker and PlayStation Productions.</p>

<p>Writing duties will be handled by Gary Dauberman, who's best known for his work on movies like&nbsp;<em>Annabelle&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>It</em>. Could this indicate that the&nbsp;<em>Helldivers&nbsp;</em>movie will be heading in a more horror-oriented direction than we might previously have expected? We'll have to wait and see.</p>

<p>I'm not entirely sure I like the inference in that; it sounds to me like finding humanity in characters and finding "timely themes" in stories is somehow antithetical to video games, but perhaps I'm reading too much into things.</p>

<p>In any case, there's a lot we still don't know about the&nbsp;<em>Helldivers&nbsp;</em>movie, including what kind of story it's looking to tell and how it'll reconcile the franchise's satirical approach to individuality and democracy with movies' need to focus on individual characters.</p>

<p>What we do know is that the movie is just one of several visual media projects based on Sony games currently in the works; at the same time as the&nbsp;<em>Helldivers&nbsp;</em>movie was announced, Sony <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-helldivers-horizon-movies-ghost-of-tsushima-anime" rel="nofollow">also revealed a movie based on the&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>franchise</a>, as well as a&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima&nbsp;</em>anime.</p>

<p>Nintendo’s Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is the first new Metroid Prime game in over a decade. No one thought it would happen at one point, and it has. Unfortunately, it’s the lowest-rated game in the Prime series, but it’s still reviewed quite well.</p>



<p>Another game is ready to go under the Christmas tree: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>. The legendary franchise sees all of your hopes and dreams curl up into a literal ball as you hunt Space Pirates and Metroids. Its review scores are ultimately not disappointing, but it probably misses GOTY conversations.</p>

<p>The Metroid Prime 4: Beyond review scores have all but settled on Metacritic. As of writing, based on 63 Nintendo Switch 2 reviews, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond has an aggregate score of 80/100!</p>







<p>Before you say anything, this is a very good score. An average game is usually around the 7/10 mark, making an 8/10 verdict excellent. Long-time fans and people who’ve been hyped for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond might be a bit disappointed by this score, compared to previous Metroid Prime games.</p>



<p>According to Metacritic, the original Metroid Prime sits at 97/100, Metroid Prime 2: Echoes is on 92/100, and Metroid Prime 3: Corruption drops slightly further to 90/100. This makes Beyond the first mainline ‘Prime’ game to fall below 90, and for a while, it was even under 80.</p>



<p>Everyone is so hyper-critical about reviews and scores nowadays, when the reality is that games should be supported. Will the Metroid Prime 4: Beyond review scores stop you from buying it? Or is it a day one?

<p>Chris Avellone wants you to have a good time.</p>
<p>People often ask creatives—especially those in careers some dream of entering—”how did you get started?” Video game designers are no exception, and Avellone says that one of the most important keys to his success was one he learned early in his origin story.</p>
<p>“Players are selfish,” Avellone said, reflecting on his time designing the seminal computer roleplaying game <i>Planescape: Torment</i>. “The more you can make the experience all about them, the better. So <i>Torment</i> became that. Almost every single thing in the game is about you, the player.”</p>
<p>The true mark of a successful game is when players really enjoy themselves, and serving that essential egotism is one of the fundamental laws of game design.</p>
<p>It’s a lesson he learned long before he became an internationally renowned game designer, before <i>Fallout 2</i> and <i>Planescape: Torment</i> were twinkles in the eyes of Avellone and his co-workers at Interplay. Avellone’s first introduction to building fictional worlds came not from the digital realm but from the analog world of pen and paper roleplaying games.</p>
<h2>Table-top takeaways</h2>
<p>Avellone discovered <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em> at the tender young age of nine, and it was a formative influence on his creative life and imagination.</p>
<p>“Getting exposed to the idea of <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em> early was a wake-up call,” he told me. “‘Oh wow, it’s like make believe with rules!’—like putting challenges on your imagination where not everything was guaranteed to succeed, and that made it more fun. However, what I noticed is that I wasn’t usually altering the systems drastically, it was more using them as a foundation for the content.”</p>

<p>At first, Avellone wasn’t interested in engineering the games and stories himself. He wanted a more passive role, but life had different ideas.</p>
<p>“I never started out with a desire to be the game master,” Avellone remembered. “I wanted to be one of the players, but once it became clear that nobody else in my friend circle really wanted to be a game master—to be fair, it was a lot of work—I bit the bullet and tried my hand at it. Over time, I discovered I really enjoyed helping tell an interactive story with the players.”</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>That revelation, that he preferred being the one crafting the world and guiding the experience, led to some early experiments away from the table as well.</p>
<p>“I never pursued programming for a career, which is probably to the benefit of the world and engineering everywhere,” he joked. But he did start tinkering very young, inspired by the fantasy text adventure games he played as a kid. “I wanted to construct adventure games in the vein of the Scott Adams games… so I attempted to learn basic coding on the TRS-80 in order to do so. The results were a steaming, buggy mess, but [the experience] did give insights into how games operate under the hood.”</p>

<p>It was a different era, however, bereft of many of the resources that aspiring young game developers have at their fingertips today.</p>
<p>“It being the early ’80s, there wasn’t much access to Internet forums and online training courses like today,” Avellone said. “It was mostly book learning from various programming manuals available on order or from the library. These programming attempts were always solo endeavors at fantasy-style sword and sorcery adventures, and I definitely would have benefited from a community or at least one other person of skill who I could ask questions.”</p>
<p>Despite all of his remarkable success in the space, Avellone didn’t originally dream of creating video games.</p>
<p>“Designing computer games was something I sort of fell into,” he told me. “The idea of a game designer was an almost unheard of career at the time and wasn’t even on my radar. I wanted to write pen and paper modules, adventure and character books, and comic books. As it turned out, though, that can be a miserable way to try and make a living, so when an opportunity came to work in the computer game industry, I took it with the expectation that I’d still use my off time to pursue comics, [pen and paper] writing, etc. But like with game mastering, I found computer game design and narrative design to be fun in itself, and it ended up being the bulk of my career. I did get the opportunity to write modules and comic books later on, but writing for games became my focus, as it was akin to being a virtual game master.”</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Like many of the engineers and developers of that era, toiling in their garages and quietly building the future of computing, young Chris Avellone used other creator’s work as a foundation.</p>
<p>“One technique I tried was dissecting existing game engines,” he recalls, “more like an adventure game framework, and then finding ways to alter the content layer to create the game. But the attempts rarely compiled without a stream of errors.”</p>
<h2>The shine moment</h2>
<p>Every failure was an opportunity to learn, however, and like his experiences telling collaborative stories with his friends in <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em>, they taught him a number of lessons that would serve him later in his career. In our interview, he returned again and again to the player-first mentality that drives his design ethos.</p>
<p>First and foremost, a designer needs to “understand your players and understand why they are there,” Avellone said. “What is their power fantasy?”</p>
<p>Beyond that, every player, whether in a video game or a tabletop roleplaying adventure, should have an opportunity to stand in the spotlight.</p>
<p>“That shine moment is important because it gives everyone the chance to be a hero and to make a difference,” he explained. “The best adventures are the ones where you can point to how each player was instrumental in its success because of how they designed or role-played their character.”</p>
<p>And players should be able to get to that moment in the way they want, not the one most convenient to you, the game master or designer.</p>
<p>“Not everyone plays the way you do,” Avellone said, “and your job as game master is not to dictate how they choose to play or force them into a certain game mode. If a player is a min-maxer who doesn’t care much for the story, that shouldn’t be a problem. If the player is a heavy role-player, they should have some meat for their interactions. This applies strongly to digital game design. If players want to skip dialogue and story points, that’s how they choose to play the game, and they shouldn’t be crushingly penalized for their play style. It’s not your story, it should be a shared experience between the developer and player.”</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>A core part of his design philosophy, this was a takeaway from pen-and-paper games that Avellone has deployed throughout his career in video games.</p>
<p>“The first application was <em>Planescape: Torment</em>,” Avellone remembered.</p>

<h2>Working on Planescape: Torment</h2>
<p>It was 1995. Interplay had recently acquired the Planescape license from Wizards of the Coast, formerly TSR, the company behind <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em>. Interplay was looking for ideas for a video game adaptation and brought in Avellone for an interview. At the time, he was writing for Hero Games, a tabletop RPG publisher. Avellone was hired onto the project as a junior director after he sold the idea of a game where death was only the beginning.</p>
<p>That idea—the springboard that launched a successful, decades-spanning career—originated in Avellone’s frustration with save scumming, the process of repeatedly reloading save games to achieve the best result.</p>
<p>“Save scumming in RPGs up to that point felt like a waste of everyone’s time,” Avellone said. “If you died, you either reloaded or you quit. If they quit, you might lose them permanently. So I felt if you removed the middle man and just automatically respawned the character in interesting places and ways, that could keep the experience seamless and keep the flow of the adventure going. This didn’t quite work, because players were so used to save scumming and would still feel they had failed in some way. I was fighting typical gaming conventions and gaming habits at that point.”</p>
<p>That idea of death being just another narrative element rather than a fail state is emblematic of another pillar of Avellone’s design philosophy, also drawn from pen-and-paper games: Regardless of what happens, the story must go on.</p>
<p>“Let the dice fall where they may,” Avellone explained. “It will result in more interesting gaming stories. This was a hard one for me initially, because I would get so locked into a certain character, NPC, or letting a PC survive, that I would fight random chance to keep my story or their arc intact. This was a mistake and a huge missed opportunity. If the players have no fear of death or annoying adversaries who never seem to die because you are fudging the dice rolls to prevent them from being killed, then it undermines much of the drama, and it undermines their eventual success.”</p>

      Avellone is known for many classics, but among hardcore RPG fans, <em>Planescape Torment</em> stands particularly tall.

<p>After <em>Planescape: Torment</em>, which received nearly universal critical acclaim, Avellone continued to evolve best practices for giving players what they wanted. He eventually landed on the idea that player input could be useful even before development begins.</p>
<p>“I would often do pre-game interviews with different players,” he recounted, “to get a sense of where they hoped their character arc would go, how they wanted to play.”</p>

<h2>Lessons from <em>Fallout Van Buren</em></h2>
<p>Avellone expanded that process dramatically for <em>Fallout Van Buren</em>, Interplay’s vision for <em>Fallout 3</em>. He and the team built a Fallout tabletop role playing game to playtest some of the systems that would be implemented in the (ultimately cancelled) video game.</p>
<p>“For the Fallout pen-and-paper we were doing for <em>Fallout Van Buren</em>, for example, doing those examinations proved helpful because there were so many different character builds—including ghouls and super mutants, as well as new archetypes like Science Boy—that you wanted to make sure you were creating an experience where everyone had the chance to shine.”</p>
<p>Though <em>Van Buren</em> never saw the light of day, Avellone has said that some of the elements from that design found their way into the wildly popular <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em>, a project for which Avellone served as senior designer (as well as project director for much of the DLC).</p>
<p>Another lesson he learned at the table is that you should never honor a player’s accomplishment with a reward if you plan to immediately snatch it away.</p>
<p>“Don’t give, then take away,” Avellone warns. “One of the worst mistakes I made was after an excruciatingly long treasure hunt for one of the biggest hordes in the world, I took away all the unique items the characters had struggled to win at the start of the very next adventure. While I knew they would get the items back, the players didn’t, and that almost caused a mutiny.”</p>

<p>I asked Avellone if his earliest experience playing with other people’s code or sitting around rolling dice with his friends had a throughline to his work today. It was clear in his answer, and throughout our interview, that the little boy who fell in love with architecting worlds of fantasy and adventure in his imagination is still very much alive in the seasoned developer building digital worlds for players today. The core idea persists: It’s all about the players, about their connection to your story and your world.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>“It still has a strong impact on my game design today,” he told me. “It’s still important to me to see the range of archetypes and builds a player can make. How to make that feel important in a unique way, and how to structure plots and interactions so you try and keep the character goals so they cater to the player’s selfishness. Instead of some outward, forced goal you place on the player… find a way to make the internal player motivation match the goals in-game, and that makes for a stronger experience.”</p>
<p>Avellone carries that philosophy forward into his current project. He recently signed on to help develop the inaugural project at Republic Games, the studio founded by video game writer Adam Williams, formerly of Quantic Dream. The studio is developing a dystopian fantasy game that revolves around a scrappy rebellion fighting to overthrow brutal, tyrannical oppression.</p>
<p>“Some discussions at Republic Games have fallen back on old RPG designs in the past,” he teased, “As some older designs seemed relevant examples for how to solve a potential arc and direction in the game… but I’ll share that story after the game comes out.”</p>

More than that, I'd found myself in a world I didn't even want to be in. I'd prided myself on never killing another player in the game. Through dozens and dozens of rounds, I'd gone well out of my way to avoid such an outcome, often being slow to shoot first, even to my own detriment. I put my trust in other players, and sometimes it would prove unwarranted. Mostly, I'd resorted to diplomacy, often talking my way out of problems with other players I'd encounter. I had so many big ideas about what it takes to return to Speranza without blood on one's hands. To me, Arc Raiders was this exciting social experiment. How long can I effectively talk down other players who means me harm? In the end, the answer was about 122 hours of play.</p><p dir="ltr">The fateful encounter occurred on Stella Montis, which will be no surprise to some Arc Raiders veterans. This newest map, and the first to take place entirely indoors, is an ultra-tense setting where you are either diligently checking your corners or you're soon bleeding out on the ground. Even in solo queues, where Arc Raiders remains mostly the bastion of good-natured and helpful PvE-only players, it feels like Stella Montis is kill-or-be-killed more than the game's other maps.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Arc Raiders Review</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">I was minding my own business, cautiously looting but certainly not planning to hurt anyone, when I heard some gunfire nearby. Hiding behind some lockers, I had a clear view of this fight, except for when it wrapped into the next room via the open doors leading to a hallway. I was still within range to hear the proximity chat of those who were scrapping, and witnessed with my eyes and/or ears a scuffle that took the lives of at least two players, whose flares shot toward the ceiling from inside the hallway. I crouched a safe distance away from the noise, then continued exploring other rooms.</p><p dir="ltr">I knew then that at least one person on the map that round had ill intentions, so I was more guarded than before, but I ran into some more friendly folks, and the round proceeded as most do for me in Arc Raiders; the troublemakers are always outnumbered. A few minutes later, I'd wrapped around and upstairs, and found myself now in the same region overlooking the dramatic hallway, only now I was a floor higher. Right then, I heard a pair of voices bickering from inside the hallway. One player was upset that the other had resorted to PvP because they felt solo queues aren't meant to be so unfriendly. The two had a reasonable philosophical discussion, as you can expect, but eventually one of the voices stopped talking.</p><p dir="ltr">I opened the hallway door, which had been closed during the scuffle, and called out, "What's going on in here? You guys good?" A player called out in response, but I couldn't tell by his voice if he was the apparent aggressor or the one attacked and seemingly resorted to killing in self-defense--a quick peek in the hallway revealed three or more raider bodies, to my memory. I couldn't see the survivor, but he told me he was knocked and asked if I had a defib. I always carry one because helping strangers in this game is my favorite way to play. But still, I was unsettled by all the chaos that this hallway had played host to in just a few minutes, so I wasn't so willing to walk in the door myself. I told him, "Crawl to me. I do have a defib. Crawl to me, and I'll revive you." "Crawl to you?" he asked.</p><p dir="ltr">"Yes, can you make it in time?" I wondered, knowing his lifebar was evaporating, <em>if </em>he was truly knocked like he said he was.</p><p dir="ltr">He never said another word. Thanks to the way I peeked the corner, I saw him, not knocked, but standing--<em>sprinting</em>--into my room. He turned the corner and opened fire, and the only reason I survived is that I had a Torrente LMG with a few attachments--a decisive, unforgiving weapon at close range. Though the deceiver hit me first, my Torrente tore into him and knocked him sooner than he could knock me.</p><p dir="ltr">I'd found myself in these situations before. I hadn't killed anyone to that point in my Arc Raiders life, but I'd knocked a few. However, I always revived them or let their teammates revive them. I'd explain how I hadn't crossed that threshold yet, and I didn't want to start with them. It usually ended with them seeming thankful for my mercy.</p><p dir="ltr">I admit, I probably would've done the same with this charging liar if he gave me a chance, but he didn't. As soon as I knocked him, perhaps out of embarrassment for having been caught trying to pull a fast one on me, he used the "give up" command, effectively ending his life and crediting me with the kill.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4615056-a301fdc3-445e-43b0-a7d5-519a7fc7c464.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4615056" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4615056-a301fdc3-445e-43b0-a7d5-519a7fc7c464.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4615056"></a><figcaption>This is just some of the carnage this hallway saw, though my first kill is just off-screen on the other side of the doorway on the right.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4615056-a301fdc3-445e-43b0-a7d5-519a7fc7c464.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Before this round, I'd always wondered what I'd say to the first person I intended to kill in Arc Raiders. I'd go on some half-joking speech about how they were the first to bring me to that point, like a character in a movie who'd finally snapped, forcing them to listen to my diatribe as they crawled at my boots. But in the end, I never even got the chance. I only said one sentence to the raider before he quickly bled out: "Why'd you do it?!" Naturally, he didn't answer.</p><p dir="ltr">I felt a rush wash over me. Despite the violence that hallway had seen, I didn't see my part in it coming. I guess in the back of my head, I'd figured I'd talk my way out of a scuffle, or maybe I'd sneak away unscathed. Heck, maybe I'd just be the next gunned down, too slow to pull the trigger myself, but I certainly wasn't going to be the one leaving with bloodied hands. Until I was.</p><p dir="ltr">Since then, I've killed one other player--also on Stella Montis and also because they'd charged me and fired first, then chose the "give up" command. I still play this game in a friendly way. I always carry a defib or two. If someone calls out, "Don't shoot!" with the game's vital emote wheel, I tell them they have nothing to worry about, and I mean it. But now that I've crossed the threshold, I do feel like the mental block that left me slow on the draw has lifted. Now, if I see other raiders, I tend to ask if they're friendly. If they say nothing, I get on my guard, and even if they say they're friendly, I keep my eye on them. I still don't ever plan to start fights, but since that fateful day in the halls of Stella Montis, I'm more prepared to finish them.</p>

                <p>Mark Cerny--best known as the lead architect of the PlayStation Vita, PS4, and PS5--recently appeared on Simon Parkin's <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0hh8BAr4dqZ792CwE1db3r?si=0580cf10e978457a" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">My Perfect Console</a> podcast to choose five games he would preserve on a fictional console. While much of the conversation naturally touched on his long history with Sony, one of the most surprising and heartfelt moments came when he talked about his love for Nintendo's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pikmin/">Pikmin</a>.</p><p>Despite his deep ties to PlayStation, Cerny made it clear that Pikmin left a lasting mark on him. Cerny described playing the original Pikmin as a truly "transformative" experience. He explained how emotionally invested he became in Captain Olimar's struggle to survive and return home.</p><p>"I had this thing where I tended to play smaller, lighter games for about 10 years, so I don't know, Portal or Plants vs. Zombies or Flower or Katamari Damacy. Pikmin, I just [picked] out of that list because I thought it was such an emotionally involving story," Cerny explained. "Poor Captain Olimar, he crash lands, and he's got 30 days to reassemble his ship, or he'll run out of oxygen and die, and he's sending letters home every day."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYUJwdN07dI" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OYUJwdN07dI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>He went on to say how he loves a good story and the evolution in Pikmin 2. "I mean, I guess I'm a sucker when it comes to story, right? But then for Pikmin 2, it's totally different. So they're on Earth, they're running around picking up trash on Earth. That's the storyline, if you recall. Literally, you're running around somebody's bathroom floor in Pikmin 2. And in one of those, you're running from debt collectors, if I have that right. But that first Pikmin, yeah, that's one I just treasure.”</p><p>Although Pikmin was the emotional highlight of their conversation, Cerny also discussed the other games he selected for his fantasy console. These included Atari's Defender--a nod to his early days in the industry--as well as Sony's The Legend of Dragoon, the narrative-focused indie game Firewatch, and the highly acclaimed action-roguelike Hades. Together, his choices span several decades and represent a broad look at the evolution of game design.</p><p>Cerny stressed that he wasn't choosing games as a hardware designer, thinking about technical benchmarks. "I should also say this is not me designing a console, right? Because if I [were] doing that, it would be the usual, 'Well, how does GTA 6 play on it?' I'm just looking at interesting games over five decades."</p><p>Cerny's career has taken him through major studios, having created Marble Madness at Atari and worked on Sonic 2 after helping establish the Sega Technical Institute. Even being most associated with PlayStation hardware and Sony’s first-party studios today, seeing those plant-powered heroes on his list was quite a surprise.</p>

			<p>Work on the Cyberpunk 2077 CyberMP multiplayer mod is proceeding at an impressive pace, culminating in a recent closed test that has reportedly exceeded all development team expectations.</p>



<p>The primary goals of this highly successful test were crucial for improving the experience, including checking improved synchronization between vehicles and players, introducing a new overlay, and evaluating the overall stability of the platform under load. Judging from new footage shared online by the development team, the test appears to have been a resounding success. A Race Event held during the test ran notably well and, honestly, looks like a ton of fun, demonstrating smooth vehicle handling and client-side synchronization.</p>



<p>The new Cyberpunk 2077 multiplayer mod footage also provides a quick look at a PvP event set on a wide map not available in the vanilla game. Much like the race event, this looks intense and engaging, showcasing the potential for large-scale player conflicts within Night City. It is clear that while the core system is solid, further work will be needed to iron out the remaining issues.</p>

<p>Although the project has been in the works since before 2024, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-multiplayer-mod/">Cyberpunk 2077 CyberMP mod was officially announced only last year</a>. The team is stepping in to address the lack of an official multiplayer mode, which was <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-multiplayer-mode-was-canceled-due-to-the-games-rough-launch/">being developed by CD Projekt Red but was ultimately canceled to focus entirely on the single-player experience. </a>It's worth noting that the mod does not allow players to complete story quests together via a co-op mode. Instead, it leverages the game's mechanics to offer diverse multiplayer experiences, such as the racing and PvP events highlighted in the latest footage.</p>



<p>Hopefully, it won't take much longer for the community to experience the solid work the CyberMP mod development team is doing. More information on this <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> multiplayer mod can be found on its <a href="https://discord.com/invite/eWQbTncXbr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official Discord server.</a></p>

            <guid>1370497</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nine Dots Studio is hard at work on <em>Outward 2</em>, but studio founder, CEO, and Creative Director, Guillaume Boucher-Vidal, took a few moments out of his busy schedule to give us at TechRaptor a look at the current game. Giving us a tour of the new character creation, the ins and outs of Haboob, and what begins your adventure in Aurai, the preview was just the beginning. I also got to play a part of&nbsp;the title, feeling my way through the different areas you can explore. Here's all I learned in my&nbsp;<em>Outward 2</em>&nbsp;alpha preview.</p>

<h2><em>Outward 2</em>&nbsp;Alpha Preview | No Hand Holding Here</h2>

<p>I spent a significant amount of time diving into the nooks and crannies of<em> Outward 2. </em>While I can safely say no Trog is safe around me, I died more times than I can count to Recluses, Thespians, Manticores, and falling into the water. I harvested and ate more mushroom soup than anyone probably should. Through it all, I explored most of the Bellowgale, kept finding more stairways in Haboob than I thought possible, and discovered most creatures will absolutely maim you when given the opportunity.</p>

<p><em>Outward 2</em>&nbsp;is currently in alpha phase. There’s still a lot of work to be done on the title, and everything I played through can completely change by the time it’s released in the summer of 2026. I’m going to focus more on the general mechanics, how it compares to the original<em> <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="bc51a462-aeac-4113-b056-c6680d213c23" href="https://techraptor.net/games/outward" rel="nofollow">Outward</a></em>, and what is to come for the RPG.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/outward-2-playtest-save-your-house.jpg?itok=hBQ3V8ep 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/outward-2-playtest-save-your-house.jpg?itok=0e01NbTk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This also means I won’t be commenting too heavily on bugs, missing dialogue, game crashes, and other issues that are current works in progress for Nine Dots Studio. Though these issues can have an impact on your gameplay in the upcoming alpha playtest, they should be eradicated by the time launch comes around. These issues should be reported to the dev team so they can be addressed.</p>

<p>To start at the beginning, Character Creation has been significantly expanded. Not only do traits and backgrounds impact character origins, but they also affect starting stats, where you begin your adventure, recipes you inherently know, and can offer unique dialogue choices. On top of that, you’ll no longer have a potato for your face unless you want to. There are multiple options for hair style, eyebrows, face structure, acne, scars, makeup, and more.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/character-creation-outward-2-alpha-playtest.jpg?itok=pEcyV3e9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/character-creation-outward-2-alpha-playtest.jpg?itok=SE9HwAKI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>When it comes to getting into the meat of the game, there are a few mechanics that have stayed the same from <em>Outward</em>. Your health and stamina maximum decrease when you get injured, dying results in a random event bringing you somewhere else on the map, an equipped bag slows down your dodges, and some quests are timed. You'll meet NPCs from the original, and may even be saved by Gep, again.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are plenty more examples of things that have remained the same that you’ll stumble upon as you play, especially the difficult and brutal combat you’ll encounter. Many were worried that combat would begin to follow RTS mechanics, but fans can rest assured that the combat is the same as&nbsp;<em>Outward</em>. You have to unlock mana to use magic, skills are taught by trainers, and your attacks depending on how often you get to swing your weapon.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/outward-2-alpha-playtest-saved-by-gep.jpg?itok=13asAOOq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/outward-2-alpha-playtest-saved-by-gep.jpg?itok=0HXijLdL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>While you only have a single city to begin from during the playtest, there are hours worth of content you can experience. You’ll be able to take on multiple quests, explore at least three distinct areas, and visit a Leyline. If you make it back into Haboob, you'll even see the city change from when you were exiled. After playing through the region three times, spending at least 18 hours in the wilderness of the Bellowgale, I'm still discovering new areas and interactions with NPCs.</p>

<p>What’s available of the narrative has ensnared me completely. I want to know more about the Symposium and their research, see the different regions, and learn why you were framed in the first place. There are two other starting cities to play through their beginning adventure. The story is there in the right portion to not inform me about the world and my current situation, while keeping me on the hook for future narrative.</p>

<p>There’s so much left to uncover, and I am 100% eagerly awaiting <em>Outward 2</em>’s release so I can experience it all. Combat was exciting, exploration kept me on my toes, and completing objectives consistently felt rewarding. Once it releases, I plan on this game taking over my life for quite a while.</p>

<hr><p><em><strong>Outward 2</strong> was previewed on PC over the course of 20 hours with a code provided by Nine Dots Studio. All screenshots were taken during the course of the preview.</em></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/hbo-rolls-out-the-red-carpet-for-mad-men-by-leaving-the-barf-machine-in-2000649617</link>
            <guid>1370482</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Mad Men</em> is probably one of the best 10 television shows ever made. It’s certainly one of the most important. It came to define a late aughts “golden age” of TV when the internet was full of <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/mollylambert/115625706564/the-almost-complete-ml-mad-men-recaps-s1e1-smoke">show recaps and essays</a> and aspiring networks were racing to land prestige TV hits that would win awards and convince critics that movies were no longer the most important medium for visual storytelling. So it’s equally fitting, in a way, that the 4K re-release of <em>Mad Men</em> on HBO includes sloppy oversights that make it emblematic of media’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/hbo-max-password-sharing-price-zaslav-warner-bros-2000624901">current enshitification</a> in the streaming era.</p> <p>The <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/mad-men-stream-hbo-max-4k-1236581005/">ultra-HD makeover</a> of AMC’s period drama about an advertising agency straddling the cultural revolution of the ’60s became available on HBO Max on December 1, and it includes some unique artistic choices. The most viral of those is leaving in the barf machine for one of the series’ most memorable moments. In season 1, episode 7, “Red in the Face,” Don Draper suckers his boss, Roger Sterling, into a late lunch break filled with booze and oysters and then races him up the Manhattan high-rise stairs when the elevator goes out of commission.</p>

 <p>Sterling gets back to the office just in time to puke in front of the entire agency, including important clients. It’s an important moment that underlines a bunch of conflicting fault lines within their relationship. It’s also very gross. In the new 4K version, viewers are treated to the actual puke machine that hurls clam chowder out of a pipe next to Sterling’s face, as well as the stagehands deploying it. It’s beautifully absurd and also kind of undercuts the entire scene.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">the new 4K transfer of mad men on HBO somehow does not have any of the post-production edits added in, which means you get stuff like this where you can see the crew member manning the puke machine after Roger has too many oysters lmao <a href="https://t.co/HNgPRNOsla">pic.twitter.com/HNgPRNOsla</a></p> <p>— johnny (@bigrackspart7) <a href="https://twitter.com/bigrackspart7/status/1995756905755549751?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“This is hilarious, and the extra hand on the crew member’s shoulder is killing me,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/madmen/comments/1pbqafk/red_in_the_face_hbomax_4k_shows_staff_operating/">wrote</a> one commenter on Reddit. “Like someone else is giving him extra emotional support while he shoots fake vomit from a tube.” We’ve seen this sort of thing happen before, but it’s usually when <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/paddypadman.bsky.social/post/3m6z3bnqxjs2u">older shows get updated to newer aspect ratios</a> and stuff that wasn’t originally intended to be part of the scene makes it into the frame.</p>

 <p>The fact that the apparatus and its handlers weren’t scrubbed out in post-production, as they were for the original version of the show, raises bigger questions about just how carefully HBO handled the re-release of one of modern TV’s most storied series. What kind of penny-pinching apathy lets the barf machine skate through the review process unscathed, and in the first season no less?</p>

 <p>I casually started re-watching <em>Mad Men</em> while doing other stuff just a couple of weeks ago and made it through the first two seasons in no time. Who at Warner Bros. Discovery thought it was a good idea to bring <em>Mad Men</em> back to a major streaming platform for the first time since it left Netflix back in 2020, and not skim it for issues? Especially since it was being upscaled to 4K? If they didn’t even catch the barf machine, what else did they miss?</p> <p>Well, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/madmen/comments/1pc20pw/season_one_out_of_order_on_hbo_max/">the episode order for one</a>. At least some users, including myself, tried to watch season 1, episode 7, only to find that it had swapped places <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/madmen/comments/1pbth6b/red_in_the_face_replaced_with_5g_on_hbo/">with episode 6</a>, which had swapped places with episode 5. I guess David Zaslav didn’t want to pay someone’s nephew to sit in a room and do a final view test before releasing the 4K cut. Too busy thinking about Scrooge McDucking his way through mountains of cash if Netflix and Skydance <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/warner-bros-discovery-new-bids-netflix-comcast-paramount-1236439442/">get into a bidding war</a> over Warner Bros.</p>

            <guid>1370479</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto" data-message-author-role="assistant" data-message-id="72447a38-387f-40b8-a390-2b9e2ddb309a" data-message-model-slug="gpt-5-1">
<p data-start="0" data-end="371">With Black Friday and Cyber Monday behind us, you may think the time to save has come to an end. You couldn’t be more wrong. Lots of brands are keeping their discounts hanging around a little longer past the biggest sales event of the year. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6175/">For instance, the Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ is currently available for a drastically reduced price of $150.</a> The Samsung tablet normally sells for $220, so this 32% discount represents a savings of $70. Get it for as low as $150 for a limited time.</p>
<p data-start="0" data-end="371">The design of the Galaxy Tab A9+ is both slim and lightweight, making it perfect for on-the-go use. It’s durable enough to withstand daily handling, whether you’re commuting, working at a café, or just moving between rooms at home.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6175/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h3 data-start="373" data-end="414">Exceptional Display and Sound Quality</h3>
<p data-start="416" data-end="960">For under $150, you get an 11″ touchscreen with an LCD display boasting a 1200p resolution and a 90 Hz refresh rate. Whether you’re streaming videos or just browsing the internet, the visuals are sharp and smooth. The tablet’s built-in speakers deliver clear, rich sound, enhanced by Dolby Atmos technology to give you “cinema-like audio your ears will love.” Now those are Samsung’s words, not mine. Marketing fluff. In practice, the only similarity between the sound when watching something on this tablet and watching something in a movie theater is that they are both indeed sound. So while it’s a bit of a stretch to compare tablet sound to a full cinema experience, it certainly provides better audio than most tablets in its class.</p>
<h3 data-start="1293" data-end="1342">Storage Options and Multitasking Capabilities</h3>
<p data-start="1344" data-end="1675">When it comes to storage, the Galaxy Tab A9+ offers two options: 64 GB in the more affordable model and 128 GB in the higher-end version. This gives you plenty of room for apps, photos, and videos. However, given the rise of streaming services, you might find that you rely more on streaming content rather than downloading media. In which case, the 64 GB model should suffice.</p>
<p data-start="1677" data-end="1996">Powered by Android OS, the tablet makes it easy to multitask and switch between apps. You can view multiple apps side by side—great for when you’re managing multiple tabs in your browser or just keeping an eye on your email while working.</p>
<p data-start="1998" data-end="2273">File transfer is also a breeze thanks to Samsung’s Quick Share feature. It allows you to easily send files to another device, whether it’s running Android or iOS. Transferring photos, documents, or videos between your devices is quick and convenient.</p>


<h3 data-start="2275" data-end="2299">Perfect for Families</h3>
<p data-start="2301" data-end="2673">One feature that parents will appreciate is the Samsung Kids app. If you’re not ready to buy a dedicated tablet for your child, the Galaxy Tab A9+ offers a safe, fun, and educational environment for younger users. With its playful interface and age-appropriate content, it’s a great way to keep kids entertained while ensuring they’re using technology in a safe way.</p>
<p data-start="2699" data-end="3001" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6175/">If you’re looking for a deal, now is the time to grab the Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+.</a> The 64 GB model is priced at just $150 after the 32% discount. Don’t miss out on this limited-time offer, available on Amazon in this post-Cyber Monday opportunity.</p>

As a result, Square Enix has launched various projects to celebrate the classic RPG. This includes a <a href="https://www.jp.square-enix.com/music/sem/page/chrono/piano_soundscape/en/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>brand new album</u></a> featuring piano arrangements of character themes, a character popularity poll (Frog took the top spot, as reported by <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202511/59024" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Famitsu</u></a>), and <a href="https://www.jp.square-enix.com/music/sem/page/chrono/concert/30th/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>orchestral concerts</u></a> to be held in Japan next January.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, this sudden celebration of Chrono Trigger after very little fanfare about the cult classic has prompted speculation that Square Enix is leading up to a bigger reveal of a Chrono Trigger remake.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Hopes were reignited again among Japanese-speaking fans on November 30, when Yuji Horii was directly asked in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq1II1jaiuA" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>discussion program</u></a> on YouTube if all the recent Chrono Trigger 30th Anniversary projects and events are hinting that a remake is in the works. Horii did not outright deny it, responding with "I can't say," "You shouldn't ask that!" and "I'll get told off!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This and publishing executive Kazuhiko Torishima's jokey follow-up cries of "There is! There is (a Chrono Trigger remake)!” have led to Japanese speaking fans hoping, once again, that a remake is in the works despite the fact Square Enix hasn't made any announcement. “I wonder if it will be announced next year?” <a href="https://x.com/kasago_p/status/1995458296199667729?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>users</u></a> wondered on X.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Chrono Trigger was originally released for the Super Famicom/SNES in 1995. With the involvement of Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi, Dragon Quest creator Yuji Horii, and Dragon Ball creator Akira Toriyama, the RPG is beloved by fans and is considered by many to be one of the greatest games of all time. Although an upgraded version is currently available to play through Steam and on smartphones, fans have been calling for Chrono Trigger to get the remake treatment for years.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">25 Games That Still Deserve A Sequel</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The recent Dragon Quest HD-2D remakes have also got Chrono Trigger fans hopeful about seeing the SNES game recreated in the same style. “I want to play Chrono Trigger with beautiful graphics like these!” said <a href="https://x.com/rus_08F/status/1994982553292607650?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a user</u></a> on X. “Please, Square Enix!” Official posts by Square Enix accounts about Chrono Trigger anniversary merch have also attracted similar enthusiastic <a href="https://x.com/qvjB3Fkf25tsQVV/status/1993542117134942602?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>comments</u></a> like, “If there’s a remake I’ll definitely, definitely buy it!” In November, Japanese game news site<a href="https://dengekionline.com/article/202511/56445" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u> Dengeki Online did a poll</u></a> of games readers most wanted to see get the HD-2D treatment, and Chrono Trigger topped the list.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The situation is similar to that of Final Fantasy IX, with the game’s 25th anniversary celebrations this year also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/official-final-fantasy-9-25th-anniversary-website-set-tongues-wagging-on-potential-switch-2-nintendo-direct-remake-reveal"><u>stoking fans’ hopes</u></a> that Zidane and Garnet’s adventures are in line for the remake treatment, although in IX’s case the rumors were backed up by the infamous 2021 Nvidia leak, which showed that a FFIX remake was possibly on Square Enix’s to-do list at one point. However, it seems that for both games, the anniversary celebrations were simply a chance to revisit these classic games through events and new merch. Until an official announcement is made, all fans of both games can do is continue to express their enthusiasm for these classic RPGs to Square Enix.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West.

There were moments where I thought it might be the strongest Prime since the very first, and others where it felt like the weakest. An outdated open-world hub connects breathtaking areas that brilliantly revisit the classic first-person exploration and lock-on shooting the series is known for. Talkative companions drop a few too many hints and one-liners, but they’re redeemed by some memorable story moments and mostly charming personalities that even a crotchety Metroid fan like me warmed up to in the end. And, thankfully, Retro Studios still mostly understands it’s important to give Samus her alone time, with a relieving amount of exploration in total isolation. While some of what it attempts just doesn’t work, far more of it does, resulting in an uneven but overall impressive revival that reaches incredible heights in its best moments.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The story begins with Samus mysteriously teleporting to the planet Viewros, where she works to find a way home while also uncovering the history of the ancient Lamorn race. The hook this time around is Samus’ new psychic abilities bestowed upon her by the Lamorn. These purple-hued powers allow you to telekinetically manipulate certain objects, while also adding a new wrinkle to Samus’ standard arsenal that includes her Charge Beam, Morph Ball, bombs, and more. They lead to all sorts of different challenges that involve shifting platforms around, directing charged shots to hit multiple targets, cool momentum-based Morph Ball platforming, or searching for enough psychic energy sources to power a nearby device.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Metroid Prime 4 Beyond Switch 2 Edition Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The puzzles and suit upgrades are great overall, if a little familiar. I really enjoyed using the psychic abilities to find every last hidden item, even though they’re mostly slight remixes of returning powers rather than something truly original. I can only recall a few times where a solution felt particularly novel – but that does include one awesome cinematic moment that <em>really </em>stands out. And when we’re talking about the long-awaited continuation of one of the most acclaimed video game trilogies of all time, it’s not a major complaint to say it’s sticking relatively close to the script.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat also feels exactly like you’d expect from a modern return to Metroid Prime. You lock onto enemies and fire shots or missiles while strafing around aggressive monsters and machines. It’s not just a straight retread though; Samus feels amazing to control, with a swift forward and backward dodge, improved maneuverability when popping out of the Morph Ball, and snappier access to your visor, which is more useful than ever thanks to its psychic properties. You’ll also gain flashy elemental beams that are helpful in both combat and exploration (and also change the look of Samus’ arm cannon when they’re equipped, which is a nice returning detail). </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The puzzles and suit upgrades are great overall, if a little familiar.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Choosing your weapon and fine-tuning your aim is still fun all these years later despite its relative simplicity. Prime’s combat has always fared best when sparse encounters are supplemental to exploration, which is the format Prime 4 follows most of the time. It introduces new foes that require different tools to beat, like a swarm of hovering robots protecting three weak spots you need to fire a slow-motion charged shot at to destroy. The combat’s low points are when it does its best impression of a mid-2000s corridor shooter, occasionally focusing a bit too much on repetitive waves of enemies. At least those sections always end with something exciting, as the great lineup of boss battles is a nice mix of towering monsters and one-on-one shootouts. An early highlight is a giant plant protected by petals that thrashes its vines at you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I played almost entirely with dual-stick controls on the Switch 2 Pro Controller, which also has optional motion aiming for fine tuning when locked on to an enemy, like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/splatoon-3-multiplayer-review">Splatoon</a>. This is my favorite setup, but I dabbled with the Wii-inspired separated Joy-Con control scheme, which is also a totally viable option. The Switch 2-exclusive mouse controls are functional, and it’s neat that you can swap to them on the fly just by placing your controller on a flat surface. But I don’t see many people using them given how physically awkward the Joy-Con 2 is to use as a mouse for any extended period of time, especially when the more traditional control schemes already work so effortlessly well.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Samus’ new motorcycle also controls well, and the way it’s woven into the plot feels surprisingly natural, but what you’ll actually use it for is one of Prime 4’s biggest fumbles. You’ll mainly ride the bike in Sol Valley, a desert hub that serves as the middleground between each major location on its edges, sort of like what Hyrule Field was for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/1998/11/26/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time-review">Ocarina of Time</a>. It’s mostly empty and devoid of many interesting activities, as the same few enemy types pop up when you’re riding and all you do is fire a basic projectile or charge into them to destroy them. The desert isn’t that big, so it at least doesn’t take too long to get from point A to point B. The problem is that it’s designed as if that N64 Hyrule Field saw the Great Plateau from Breath of the Wild and said, "I can do that, too!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Almost like it’s trying to justify the motorbike’s inclusion, Prime 4 goes to great lengths to ensure you spend multiple hours riding across this drab desert just to reach the credits. It sprinkles an extremely small number of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/02/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review">Breath of the Wild</a>-like shrines on the map that house optional upgrades. The bite-sized puzzles inside those shrines are fine, but there’s absolutely no joy in discovering them when they’re just haphazardly strewn across the visually unimpressive sand, and it feels like a surface-level attempt to recapture Zelda’s open-world magic that doesn’t really work.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>A runtime-padding main objective is tied to the repetitive desert.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This wouldn’t be a huge deal, but Prime 4 ties a main objective to its repetitive desert. Samus has to collect enough green energy to preserve the history of the Lamorn civilization before it’s lost to time, which is a very cool setup. But in practice, all that entails is mindlessly driving around the desert and crashing into any green crystals you see. It’s the type of runtime-padding filler that had already outworn its welcome the <em>last </em>time a Metroid Prime game came out, and Prime 4 would be so much tighter without this quest, or even without its half-baked desert at all. It’s far from a dealbreaker since this mission is given to you very early on, meaning you can chip away at it while you’re riding to your next destination, but it’s certainly not fun regardless.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>In Prime Form</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The good news is that the places you’re riding toward are full of the strong Metroid Prime atmosphere and gameplay you came for. And Prime 4 is at its greatest when playing into the same strengths that have defined this subseries since the GameCube: lonely, haunting exploration through gorgeous, fully-realized areas that each have their own detailed backstory to uncover. Structurally, the individual maps take after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/11/12/metroid-prime-2-echoes-2">Prime 2</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/08/27/metroid-prime-3-corruption-review">Prime 3</a>’s more self-contained approach rather than <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/11/11/metroid-prime">Prime 1</a>’s interconnected spiderweb that required revisiting areas several times over with multiple entrances and exits to each. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is some backtracking involved, of course, but each region has just one entrance from the desert, and you’ll finish <em>most </em>of its main objectives on your first visit. I was delighted to find that this format fills the traditional 3D Zelda-shaped hole in my heart, as each zone essentially acts like a huge dungeon: explore, find a key upgrade, kill the boss with it, and leave. That’s not to say it doesn’t feel like Metroid – there are a few main quests and plenty of optional items I needed to come back for later. It’s just that these two series have always shared a lot of the same DNA, and Prime 4 lands closer to the Zelda style.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Every location stands on its own, which allows Retro to give each a unique tone: sometimes Samus is completely alone and it leans hard into the tense sci-fi horror isolation of Alien, and sometimes she’s accompanied by Galactic Federation companions through more scripted scenes that call upon the action tropes of its sequel, Aliens. This constant genre-shifting across levels keeps things fresh for <em>most</em> of its roughly 15-hour runtime, at least until it’s time to finish collecting all those green energy shards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In these dedicated areas, Prime 4 makes a case for itself as the best-looking game Nintendo has ever published. Its fantastical art direction is jaw-droppingly gorgeous at times, with incredible lighting, beautiful backgrounds, ornate architecture, and nicely detailed environments. It sounds great, too, with dramatic choral melodies fused with electronic sounds that fit Prime’s atmosphere extremely well. Samus’ iconic visor effects return, like the way it fogs up in extreme temperatures, or how rain droplets patter against it in a storm. Its art direction goes hand-in-hand with its world design, as the way rooms are intentionally framed upon blasting open their doors is often spectacular. To be clear, Prime 4 doesn’t reach the visual heights of the best-looking games on PC or other consoles, but a game this stunning running at a flawless 4K 60 fps on Switch 2 – with a smooth 120 fps option that lowers the resolution – is a huge step forward for Nintendo. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some locations stand alongside my favorites in the series, and when you’re methodically tiptoeing your way through each one, Prime 4 more than lives up to the trilogy’s legacy. Without giving too much away, an early highlight is Volt Forge, a gothic, futuristic factory set to a powerful rock soundtrack. It’s impressive how its rich history is intertwined with its level design: you <em>can</em> just work your way through each room and enjoy the intricate layouts at face value, or you can scan every machine and learn why they exist and what they were used for, which provides fascinating context that makes complete sense when you see it all in motion. These places feel big, important, and carefully plotted out. That worldbuilding remains an incredibly special piece of Metroid Prime.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each region is fairly linear, with usually just one correct way to go, even if multiple choices are presented. When you stumble into a room with three doors, for example, it’s most likely that one is a save room, one is blocked until you get a new upgrade, and one is the way forward. I actually think this choice suits the Prime series very well, allowing it to focus more on mood, handcrafted tension, and distinct sequences, but it’s a very different flavor than the nonlinear design the Metroid series helped pioneer more than 30 years ago. I never felt <em>truly</em> lost, even when poking around its most freeform parts. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Prime 4 makes a case for itself as the best-looking game Nintendo has ever published.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">A positive outcome of this decision is that Prime 4 feels like the best entry point into this series for new folks, easing them in to better prepare them for something like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metroid-prime-remastered-review">Prime Remastered</a>’s more complex labyrinth. It also smartly follows in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metroid-dread-review-nintendo-switch">Metroid Dread</a>’s footsteps by letting you mark your map to remember which rooms have powerups you can’t get yet, streamlining the endgame collectible cleanup.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>You’ve Got a Friend</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Most regions contain one of several Galactic Federation companions who temporarily travel with Samus before heading back to base camp. Each has their own personality and light backstory, ranging from a nerdy engineer who can barely handle a gun, to a sniper with a broken leg who is questioning his decision to join the military. Thankfully, these characters are far less intrusive than I initially feared after a particularly obnoxious tutorial section I saw in my preview demo. Their limited presence means they don’t have amazing character arcs – a more than acceptable side effect – but they do have mostly likeable personalities and provide a few highlights that give Prime 4 its own identity. I have to admit I smiled when a Samus superfan geeked out after seeing her idol transform into the Morph Ball, and it helps that the great voice acting and facial animations are another step forward for Nintendo. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">They could still use some work in the writing department, however, as they often fall back on well-worn clichés or commentary that feels out of place in Metroid, like, “There’s too many of ‘em!” during an action scene, or cracks like, “Piece of cake! Red velvet cake,” upon solving a puzzle. I’m grateful that they generally don’t outright spoil specific puzzle solutions, but they do chime in a little more often than I’d like about where to go or what to do next. Specialist Myles MacKenzie is never as overbearing as in his initial introduction, but he does frequently contact Samus on the radio to tell you the general area you need to search for your next upgrade. Prime 4 lets you toggle on-screen tips that nudge you in the right direction, so I really wish I could turn companion hints off, too. When you’re with someone on a mission – which is a major part of the campaign – certain aspects can feel outdated as well, like waiting for someone to help you open a door, hearing repetitive combat dialogue lines, or reviving them whenever they go down.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Logan Ranks the Metroid Series</h3><p>I reviewed Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, and it's great! Here are my favorite 2D and 3D Metroid games, ranked.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Prime 4 keeps these portions in check by smartly knowing when to leave you alone entirely, with multiple lengthy segments where Samus loses radio signal and no one can bother her. You spend over half of the runtime on your own, so if you’re a longtime Metroid fan who craves ambience and isolation, there’s plenty of that here, too. Overall, the companions are tolerable: while there are still several moments that probably would’ve been more epic if Samus was alone, their inclusion does lead to some fun cinematic events that wouldn’t be possible otherwise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One character who I actually wish was included more is Sylux, Prime 4’s big bad that doesn’t play nearly as big a role in the story as I expected based on Nintendo’s marketing. It’s another underdeveloped part of Prime 4 – Sylux’s amiibo figure has more detail than his personality – and it feels like he’s only here out of reluctant obligation to Prime 3’s post-credits tease from 2007. Instead, this story focuses far more on Lamorn history, which is very fascinating on its own, but doesn’t entirely make up for the disappointing feeling that something’s missing.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The Forsaken Hollows, the forthcoming DLC for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> spin-off <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Nightreign</a>, is "definitely a little bit harder" than the main game, its director has admitted.</p>
<p>That's par for the course at this point. FromSoftware is notorious for releasing DLC that expands on its games with an even higher level of challenge.</p>
<p>Still, director Junya Ishizaki has discussed the difficulties of balancing the game for both casual players and experts, based on player feedback.</p>

<p>"The main takeaway we had post-release was just there was a lot of trouble trying to get the balancing right," Ishizaki told <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-forsaken-hollows-dlc-has-reignited-my-interest/1100-6536543/">Gamespot</a>.</p>
<p>"I think balancing is just so subjective, so a lot of our thoughts post-release working up to the DLC were how can we get the balancing in mind with what we were initially envisioning, and also with that balancing set, how can we take a different approach and devise new enemies, new characters, and stuff like that to play into that and utilise the new balancing that we are working with."</p><p>The studio didn't want the game to be "so hard that new players can't get into it" but even veterans required time to figure out the intricacies of Nightreign. "So whenever people who have played the main game extensively go into the DLC content, they'll be able to have a bit of that feeling like they had when they first played Nightreign, where there's still a bit that they're trying to figure out," said Ishizaki.</p>
<p>The Forsaken Hollows is "definitely a little bit harder," he admitted, "but it's not ridiculous or anything like that, but that's still within what we would consider to be a fair challenge."</p>
<p>Perhaps the most infamous DLC for its difficulty was Elden Ring's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Shadow of the Erdtree</a>, with the final boss in particular imposing a massive challenge.</p>
<p>Ishizaki also discussed the influence of that DLC on The Forsaken Hollows, even if it's not directly intentional. For instance, the new Shifting Earth event has more verticality than previous events, just as Shadow of the Erdtree was more vertical than Elden Ring.</p><p>"[The] idea behind that was that the original map was definitely very horizontally-focused, and when looking at that through the lens of working on DLC, we were thinking where else [was there] to go but up, right?" said Ishizaki. "We can add verticality to this and do it in a way that doesn't detract from the horizontal aspect of the map. So that was where that came from; trying to figure out how we can add to it in such a way that it expands upon the verticality.</p>
<p>"It's one of those things [where] a lot of our staff have also been playing Shadow of the Erdtree as the development for Nightreign has been going on. So there's probably a little bit of influence there, but I don't think [Erdtree's influence is] necessarily intentional. It might even be almost like subconscious, but there's definitely, I think, a bit of that for sure."</p>

<p>The Forsaken Hollows also adds new poison swamp areas, which are surprisingly missing from the base game.</p>
<p>"We're definitely aware of the [swamp] meme," said Ishizaki. "It's not like there's a rule or any sort of policy here where it's like we have to have a swamp in there, but it always seems to be [that before you realise] someone's come up with the idea, it's already sort of in there, and it's just sort of taken a life of its own."</p>
<p>The Forsaken Hollows launches this week on 4th December, adding two new Nightfarers to play as - the Scholar and the Undertaker - along with other additions, including the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreigns-the-forsaken-hollows-dlc-will-see-an-iconic-dark-souls-boss-return">return of an iconic Dark Souls boss</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/one-of-the-best-looking-games-on-switch-2-digital-foundry-dives-into-metroid-prime-4</link>
            <guid>1370428</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>

<p>If you can believe it, we are very, <em>very</em> nearly at the official launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>. It's a cross-generation release, but we always knew that this was going to be a big player for the Switch 2, making the most of the new hardware's beefed-up specs to squeeze the most out of the space adventure. The question is, how does it hold up?</p>
<p>Our good friends over at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVJ_P6dzFg">Digital Foundry</a> are here to answer just that. In the above video, the tech experts break down everything you need to know about the game's performance, and we've got the full rundown for you to read through below. So, let's dive right into it.</p>
<p>Kicking things off with the visuals, DF states that the game is "truly beautiful". With crisp visor reflections, rain droplets and light peeking through cracks, the game is packed with more detail than ever before, and it's used to great effect.</p>
<p>In terms of performance, we all know that MP4 offers two different options — 'Performance' and 'Quality' — though, according to Digital Foundry, things are a bit more nuanced in actuality. In Quality, the visor 'frame' and main image appear to be rendered separately, and while the real meat of what you're looking at "generally does read as a native 4K image", it's still "very much 1440p" (1080p in handheld). The sharpness is right where you'd want it, though, with DF calling it "the best image quality I've seen from a Nintendo game on Switch 2 thus far".</p>
<p>'Performance' mode drops the resolution down to 1080p (720p in handheld), giving everything a slightly softer look. That said, the presentation remains "sharp enough" and is still sharper and clearer than <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_remastered">Metroid Prime Remastered</a> was on Switch 1 by a "significant margin".</p>
<p>But what about the much-discussed frame rate? You'll be pleased to hear that the 120fps promise (in the relevant mode) is delivered on, locking to 120, and holding it "with complete consistency" — bar the very odd, tiny dip when riding around the open world. And yes, the same level of smoothness applies to the 60fps mode.</p>
<p>The truly "mind-blowing" feature, according to DF, is the HDR, which stacks up as "one of the finest HDR presentations I've seen in years, standing shoulder-to-shoulder with the very best". So, expect those highlights to pop, and the shadows to deepen in docked. The same can't be said for handheld, mind you, where the Switch 2's native screen can't keep up.</p>
<p>And finally, the load times are right where you'd want 'em, with door opening times much reduced from the previous entries.</p>
<p>You can find the full tech review in the above video or over on <a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/">Digital Foundry's new site</a>. As for us, we were absolutely blown away by MP4, calling it "quite possibly the boldest, most well-realised Metroid game to date" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">our review</a> — read all about it below.</p>

<p>Reviews for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> are live, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">including ours</a>, although you may have noticed that it's focused on the Switch 2 Edition, and MP4 is <em>also</em> launching on Switch 1.</p>
<p>If you're looking for impressions on the original Switch version, they are coming - please bear with us. We weren't able to test on the older hardware prior to the review embargo, but we do now have access and we'll be posting our Switch 1 review just as soon as we're able to give it a thorough look.</p>
<p>It's been a long ol' wait since the game was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2017/06/metroid_prime_4_confirmed_for_nintendo_switch_but_retro_studios_isnt_involved">revealed back in 2017</a>, and with development restarting from scratch <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/01/metroid_prime_4_development_scrapped_will_be_restarted_alongside_retro_studios">in 2019</a>, everyone's understandably itching to find out every last detail about how Retro Studios' return to the Metroid universe holds up <em>on the hardware it was announced for</em>.</p>
<p>The NS2 Edition cart also works on your original Switch, so we're as eager as you to see how it compares to the 4K, 120fps version Ollie's been enjoying.</p>
<p>So, watch this space, and we'll get our verdict live as soon as we can.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/835325/metroid-prime-4-review-nintendo-switch</link>
            <guid>1370422</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>When <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em> is good, it’s <em>good</em>. The latest in Nintendo’s sci-fi exploration franchise, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22710468/metroid-dread-review-nintendo-switch">the first since <em>Metroid Dread</em> in 2021</a>, <em>Beyond</em> captures the moody sense of isolation and discovery that has been so core to <em>Metroid</em> since it debuted in 1986. Those quiet moments truly make you feel all alone on a harsh alien planet, punctuated by intense action set pieces and some incredible boss fights. At its peak, the game is among the best in the series. The problem is that Nintendo added a whole bunch of stuff on top of that — including chatty companion characters and a boring, empty hub world — which gets in the way.</p><p>Despite the 4 in the title, <em>Beyond</em> is a largely standalone experience. The latest in bounty hunter Samus Aran’s many adventures starts in the midst of a war with some space pirates, before she finds herself mysteriously transported to a faraway world. The planet is typical <em>Metroid</em> stuff: Once home to an advanced civilization, it’s now covered with ancient technology lying in slumber, and all kinds of dangerous creatures. Early on Samus learns that the only way to get home is to find a series of “transporter keys” and take them to a giant tower. Oh, and the dead alien race, which look like talking axolotls, view her as a chosen one meant to fix the mistakes that led to their downfall, which expands her quest even further.</p><div><div><p id="got-any-burning-metroid-prime-4-questions"><h2>Got any burning Metroid Prime 4 questions?</h2></p></div><p>Join me and <em>Verge</em> games reporter Ash Parrish for a subscriber-exclusive AMA on December 3rd at 1PM ET. We won’t get into story spoilers for the long-gestating game, but we can tell you if mouse controls are any good.</p></div><p>Doing all of this involves the standard <em>Metroid</em> formula. You start out with only a few abilities — a gun and the ability to turn into a little ball — and steadily gain new ones, which let you further explore. The joy in a <em>Metroid</em> game comes from unraveling its intricately designed levels, spaces full of secrets and connections between them that usually only become apparent once you have the right ability or knowledge. You’ll regularly see doors that can only be opened with a weapon you don’t have yet, or ledges too high to reach with your current abilities.</p><p>Rather than mess with what works, <em>Beyond</em> just does it really well. The levels both challenge your brain and are absolutely dripping with atmosphere. Sometimes that comes in the form of small details, like scurrying alien bugs or packs of wolves that watch your every movement. Other times, it’s more elaborate. In one abandoned factory level, you wander through eerie hallways filled with powered-down security bots. It’s very unsettling, and later, after you solve some complex technical challenges to get things up and running, the mood shifts completely as the bots come to life and attack you. <em>Beyond</em> has an excellent balance between solo exploration and action, with a handful of large-scale battles, including some white-knuckle boss fights. It also adds a few new tools to Samus’ arsenal with psychic powers that let her manipulate certain objects and slow down time to bend shots around obstacles.</p><p>If that’s exactly what <em>Beyond</em> was, it would be a brilliant game, and a welcome addition to the <em>Metroid</em> canon, one that was worth <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/13/15782806/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-switch-announced-e3-2017">the near decadelong wait from announcement to launch</a>. Unfortunately, Nintendo also decided to add some new and very un-<em>Metroid</em> elements to the game that dampen the experience.</p><p>First up are the new companion characters. It’s not like Samus has always worked solo — she previously had an AI guide in <em>Metroid Fusion</em>, for instance — but here the other characters are much more involved. Over the course of the game you’ll discover a handful of soldiers who were similarly transported to the planet, and you’ll spend much of the game working alongside them to get home.</p><p>This has a big impact on the game: While the story is usually background material in <em>Metroid</em>, where you can dig in as much or as little as you like, here it’s much more present because Samus isn’t alone. She’s still a silent protagonist, but her new crew — each of whom is a generic sci-fi archetype, ranging from nerdy gearhead to gruff sergeant — can be pretty chatty. This is mostly relegated to cutscenes in which people are constantly risking their life for Samus, though they’ll regularly chime in over the radio to provide hints as well. The dialogue doesn’t overwhelm the experience, but it also doesn’t add much to it; the characters are so forgettable that I found myself tuning them out.</p><p>More frustrating is the new hub area. While much of your time in <em>Beyond</em> is spent in those well-designed levels, connecting each of them is a vast expanse of desert, which you traverse on an <em>Akira</em>-style motorcycle. At first, it’s very cool; blazing across a highway while heavy metal blares and lightning strikes gothic alien towers in the distance is an excellent introduction to the bike. But eventually it becomes clear that the desert is a bare and boring place. There are some basic shrines where you can solve simple puzzles to unlock new power-ups, and some space junk and other points of interest to investigate. Mostly, though, you’re speeding across an empty place while getting stuck in tedious vehicular battles.</p><p>This problem becomes even worse as you progress because of the game’s structure, which necessitates lots of backtracking. So every time you need to go back to an area to use one of your new power-ups or talk to a character, it means a long trek through nothing. The game eventually devolves into an unavoidable collect-a-thon near the end, which really kills <em>Beyond</em>’s momentum as you approach the conclusion.</p><p>These parts of the game are especially frustrating because otherwise <em>Beyond</em> does so much well. While Metroidvania has become an inescapable genre, the <em>Prime</em> games are still unmatched when it comes to bringing that style of exploration-heavy gameplay into a 3D world. <em>Beyond</em> is a fitting follow-up, but you really have to push through some drab and unnecessary additions to see its best moments.</p><p><sub>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond <em>launches on December 4th on the Nintendo Switch and Switch 2.</em></sub></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/835325/metroid-prime-4-review-nintendo-switch]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Over the past couple of years, I’ve tried to switch to many different gaming keyboards and always ended up back with a Wooting 60HE. Wooting changed PC gaming with the 60HE, popularizing the use of Hall effect switches and a Rapid Trigger system that speeds up how quickly you can activate keys. Now it’s back with a v2 that upgrades the best gaming keyboard to improve its sound and feel.</p><p>I’ve been testing the $239.99 Wooting 60HE v2 over the past week, and I’m impressed with my early hands-on, but I don’t know if I would rush to upgrade from an original modded 60HE.</p><p>The Wooting 60HE v2 has the same 60 percent layout as the original, so there are no dedicated function keys or an F row. There are also no arrow keys, but Wooting has a clever “mod tap” system that lets you enable arrow keys in the right shift section of the board.</p><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6ODM2MTg0"><p><span>$<!-- -->240</span></p><div><p>Wooting’s 60HE v2 is an upgrade to the popular 60HE. It has true 8K polling, a new closed-bottom switch, and an aluminum case that together improve the sound and feel.</p></div></div><p>The big changes with the 60HE v2 are all about what comes as standard now. Wooting has really focused on improving the sound and feel of the v2 so it’s a lot closer to a modded 60HE with custom switches, dampening, and more.</p><p>Wooting has ditched the screws for the v2, opting for a pressure fit instead. I’ve been testing the aluminum case that looks and feels a lot like the alumaze cases Wooting sold as optional extras for the 60HE. The case includes a new silicon dampening option, or the regular EDPM foam.</p><p>I felt like the silicon option dampened the sound of the switches too much, so I preferred the EDPM instead. You can also just not use any dampening if you prefer that type of sound. Wooting is also using PET film to prevent the switches from making contact with the PCB, and a factory tape mod on the rear of the board. Both of these help improve the overall sound.</p><p>The switches on the 60HE v2 have also been upgraded to Wooting’s new “Lekker Tikken” switch, a closed-bottom Hall effect switch with a 4.0mm actuation range. Hall effect switches use a magnet so the board can track how far a switch has been pressed, but the sound profile has typically been worse than Cherry MX-style switches.</p><p>Wooting’s new switches have definitely improved the sound profile, but they use a longer 22mm spring that makes the switches feel a little heavier than the Geon Raws I’ve been using for months. I can usually adapt to different switches after a few hours of use, but I found myself quickly moving back to the Geon Raws as I preferred both the sound profile and feel. Wooting’s switches are still a great default switch though, and the stem wobble of the original switches has been greatly improved here.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The new Lekker Tikken switches.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The upgraded 60HE v2 is also faster than the original model, thanks to true 8kHz polling and a low input latency of just 0.125ms. That’s the same latency as the 8kHz USB polling on Wooting’s larger <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/18/24247911/wooting-80he-keyboard-gaming-hands-on">80HE that I reviewed last year</a>. I don’t think you’d actually notice this latency improvement unless you measured it, but it’s nice to have either way.</p><p>I opted to test the split-spacebar 60HE v2, and I’m still a bit undecided on whether I like it. It allows you to have three keys where you’d normally only have the single space bar. I like the idea in principle, but I found myself constantly hitting the button in the middle of the split space bar.</p><p>I found it better to assign that to a function key that would have to be paired with another key to activate, but if you can get used to this layout, then having that extra button right next to the space bar could certainly be useful in competitive games. The right-hand side of the split felt a little too far to reach to make it useful in a pinch, though.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The aluminum case comes in silver or black.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The biggest issue with a split-spacebar for me is just the lack of keycap sets that support it, but if you’re happy with the double-shot PBT ones that Wooting supplies, then it’s less of an issue.</p><p>Overall, the 60HE v2 feels like a solid upgrade to the original, but it’s not a revelation like Wooting’s first Hall effect keyboards were. The thing I like the most about the 60HE v2 is that it feels like a fully modded keyboard out of the box, so you don’t have to play around with different switch options unless you want to, and the sound dampening options are super easy to switch between, thanks to the friction fit.</p><p>At $239.99, it’s a premium PC gaming keyboard, especially now that Wooting has competition that has finally caught up. Logitech, Razer, SteelSeries, and plenty of Chinese brands now have more affordable Hall effect boards that aim to match Wooting both in terms of hardware and software. None are good enough to dethrone the 60HE v2, but if you’re on a tighter budget, then there are plenty of more affordable options now.</p><p>As I have a pair of fully modded 60HE keyboards, I’m not upgrading to the 60HE v2 just yet, but if you’ve been put off doing mods yourself and want the best gaming keyboard available today, then the 60HE v2 will be well worth the investment.</p><p><em>Photography by Tom Warren / The Verge</em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/836168/wooting-60he-v2-keyboard-gaming-hands-on]]></content:encoded>

Eagle-eyed fans of the series, however, were quick to point out a few interesting tidbits, namely the presence of what looks like a pirate ship.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Tis the season ❄️</p> <p>Free goodies will be waiting for you in your Hideout every day in December up until the 25th 🎁!<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AssassinsCreedShadows?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#AssassinsCreedShadows</a> <a href="https://t.co/ECo0kiD7yp">pic.twitter.com/ECo0kiD7yp</a></p> <p>— Assassin's Creed (@assassinscreed) <a href="https://twitter.com/assassinscreed/status/1995175995670777942?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 30, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Pirate ships are nothing new to <i>Assassin’s Creed</i>, of course. Perhaps one of the most celebrated titles in the long-running series, <i>Assassin’s Creed IV Black Flag</i>, was all about the life of a blade-wielding pirate named Edward Kenway. A remake of the classic entry has been rumored for some time, with indications that <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-ubisoft-sold-ai-2000646161">it might arrive sometime before spring of 2026</a>.</p>

While it’s a very busy image featuring murky objects in the distance and strange, abstract bright lights, it certainly looks like a ship. <a href="https://x.com/acinterface/status/1995193993760755720?s=20">Have a gander for yourself</a>:</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Wait a minute, that looks like a pirate ship, or are my eyes playing tricks on me?

Other folks on the internet are busy <a href="https://x.com/AccessTheAnimus/status/1995225976490627123?s=20">trying to crack the details</a> behind some of the text that appears briefly in the video. So far, there’s nothing definitive.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The recent Modern Day teaser for Assassin's Creed Shadows seems to imply a new puzzle that will involve some "Collective Decryption" as it happened for the previous Rift! <a href="https://t.co/ZD47FsZz3X">pic.twitter.com/ZD47FsZz3X</a></p> <p>— Access The Animus (@AccessTheAnimus) <a href="https://twitter.com/AccessTheAnimus/status/1995225976490627123?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 30, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><i>Assassin’s Creed</i> loves its mysteries, so we’ll have to wait to know for sure if there’s some piracy shenanigans on the way.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Nintendo has provided game file sizes for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond on Switch and Switch 2, letting console owners know how much space they need to download the first-person adventure game. On Switch 2, Metroid Prime 4 comes in at an estimated 31.6GB, while the original Switch version only takes up 26.3GB, per <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition-switch-2/">the Nintendo Store</a>. Intriguingly, though, the eShop accessed via Switch 2 showcases the Switch edition as taking up 28.9GB.</p><p dir="ltr">Regardless, it makes sense Metroid Prime 4 has a bigger download size on Switch 2, since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-will-get-upgraded-original-switch-games-including-metroid-prime-4-and-pokemon-legends/1100-6530551/">the game offers 4K visuals</a> in quality mode docked and 120fps in performance mode docked. There is also HDR support <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-on-switch-2-will-let-you-swap-to-mouse-controls-on-the-fly/1100-6530602/">and mouse controls</a>, courtesy of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-confirms-switch-2-joy-cons-have-mouse-like-functionality/1100-6530529/">the Switch 2 Joy-Con controllers</a>. Both versions will launch this Thursday, December 4.</p>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The wait for the game has been almost two decades in the making, as Metroid Prime 3 released in 2007. Additionally, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-2017-metroid-prime-4-announced-for-nintendo-swi/1100-6450893/">Metroid Prime 4 was originally unveiled at E3 2017</a>, months after the original Switch launched. Bandai Namco was initially developing the game, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4s-development-restarted-with-retro-/1100-6464593/">Retro Studios was brought on to reboot Metroid Prime 4</a> in early 2019. Retro was the studio behind the first three Metroid Prime games.</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo revealed a new trailer for the game in November, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-metroid-prime-4-trailer-has-space-battles-samus-flips-and-an-akira-slide/1100-6535914/">showing off space battles, Samus flips, and even an Akira slide</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Helldivers is preparing to launch a dropship to a theater near you via an upcoming film adaptation, and it just landed a big-time director. Justin Lin, best known for directing several installments in the Fast &amp; Furious franchise, will helm the project.</p><p>Per <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/helldivers-movie-justin-lin-sony-1236438370/"><em>The Hollywood Reporter</em></a>, the Helldivers movie comes from Sony Pictures and PlayStation Productions, with Justin Lin’s Perfect Storm Entertainment helping produce. Lin’s credits include directing most of the installments in the Fast &amp; Furious series, starting with <em>The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift</em> (2006) and continuing with <em>Fast &amp; Furious</em> (2009), <em>Fast Five</em> (2011), <em>Fast &amp; Furious 6</em> (2013), <em>F9</em> (2021), and <em>Fast X</em> (2023).</p><p>According to <em>THR</em>’s sources, Lin is not a gamer and is leveraging this in his pitch to “find the humanity in the characters and weave timely themes into the story, while building out a world and mythology.” The script for <em>Helldivers</em> is penned by Gary Dauberman, the writer behind the It and Annabelle franchises, as well as <em>The Nun</em>. Dauberman also wrote this year's <em>Until Dawn</em>, so <em>Helldivers</em> will be his second video game adaptation.</p>

      <p>Helldivers 2</p>
  
</article>

<p>Given that Helldivers is essentially a video game version of the cult classic film <em>Starship Troopers</em>, turning it into a movie does feel like the snake eating its tail. Helldivers centers on soldiers hailing from Super Earth, an uber-patriotic managed democracy, who defend the planet in an intergalactic war against alien bugs, as well as killer robots and other threats. The first game was released for the PlayStation 4 in 2015, and Helldivers 2 arrived on PlayStation 5 in 2024 to widespread acclaim and popularity.</p><p>The Helldivers movie does not have a specific release date or window. In the meantime, check out our reviews for <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/helldivers/b/playstation4/archive/2015/03/03/helldivers-review-game-informer.aspx">Helldivers</a> and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/helldivers-2/bullet-heaven">Helldivers 2</a>.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a> is certainly a busy guy. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a> might be out the way, but the famed game designer still has his plate full with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-teases-xbox-horror-od-with-enigmatic-first-trailer">Xbox horror OD</a>, and beyond that, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojimas-metal-gear-like-physint-is-still-so-early-in-development-hes-currently-working-on-it-all-by-myself">Metal Gear spiritual successor Physint</a>. Then there's his spirited social media presence, his regular phone calls with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a>, and now it, turns out, a swerve into Disney voice acting as he takes on the role of a mole.
</p>
<p>
More specifically, Kojima has been cast as Paul Moldebrandt in the Japanese dub of Disney's Zootropolis 2, taking over from Josh Gad (Frozen's Olaf), who plays the character in the west. And if you're wondering how Kojima got involved, Famitsu <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202512/59427">reports</a> he was directly asked to play Zootopia Police Department's mole role by the movie's director, Jared Bush.

</p>
<figcaption>Here's the latest teaser for Kojima's OD.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHCqxLtwy5g" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
Speaking to Famitsu (via Google Translate), Kojima said he accepted the role "without hesitation" after being approached, noting that while he's had "experience with cameos in live-action films and games" Zootopia 2 marks his first time dubbing an animated feature film, "and it's from Disney, of all places!"
</p><p>
Describing the original Zootopia as his "favourite film", he explained he "only took part in a small scene [for the sequel], but even at the time of recording, the level of detail was impressive." And while the recording process "went smoothly", Kojima noted he "learned a lot from the experience of actually acting. It made me realise how much attention voice actors pay to basic things like turning the pages of the script and noise".
</p>
<p>
Kojima, of course, has been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-ponders-advancing-age-and-how-long-he-can-stay-creative-as-death-stranding-studio-enters-crunch">pondering his advancing years in recent times</a>, noting back in January that he "can't help but think" about how much longer he'll be able to stay creative. "I want to keep going for the rest of my life," he added, "but is it 10 more years? 20? Every day feels like I'm racing against the clock." But those concerns don't appear to be slowing him down; currently in the works is Xbox-exclusive horror OD, which he's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/like-marmite-hideo-kojima-says-you-will-either-love-or-hate-od">previously described</a> as "something totally different" and people are going to either "love it or hate it".

            <p>Another Mega Evolution has been revealed ahead of the Mega Dimension DLC for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, this time for a fan-favourite 'mon.</p>
<p>What's more, a classic Legendary will also be making an appearance.</p>
<p>To recap, the DLC will be released on 10th December and expands the story due to spatial distortions across Lumiose City, which appear to be resulting in more Mega Evolutions - superpowered versions of Pokémon.</p>

<p>Mega Lucario Z has now been announced as part of the DLC, with the fighting/steel type sporting a new fringe and colour scheme.</p>
<p>Now, Lucario already has a Mega Evolution in Z-A, but the DLC will include this new Mega Lucario Z variant. Z Mega Evolutions require less time to initiate moves but use much more power, so are better suited to quick battles.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the iconic Mewtwo will also be making an appearance in Pokémon Legends: Z-A. The game now has an extra side mission available, where players will receive a Mewtwonite X stone and Mewtwonite Y stone as mystery gifts.</p>

<p>A couple of weeks back, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-as-mega-dimension-dlc-adds-another-mega-evolution-confirming-datamined-leaks">Mega Zeraora was officially unveiled</a>, joining Mega Raichu X and Y, and Mega Chimecho as officially revealed Mega Evolutions coming in the DLC.
