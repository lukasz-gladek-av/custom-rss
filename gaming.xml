            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/bungie-confirms-that-marathon-includes-art-assets-taken-from-an-artist-without-permission/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Once again, Bungie has been caught taking art from an artist without that artist's permission and putting it in their games, this time with <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-wont-be-a-full-priced-game-according-to-bungie/">Marathon</a>.</p>
<p>Artist Antireal posted on <a href="https://x.com/4nt1r34l/status/1923067988871147605">X</a> that the Marathon alpha is "<em>covered with assets lifted from poster designs I made in 2017,</em>" with design comparisons showing the assets were essentially copied.</p>
<p>"<em>Bungie is of course not obligated to hire me when making a game that draws overwhelmingly from the same design language I have refined for the last decade,</em>" they continued, while posting even more evidence, "<em>but clearly my work was good enough to pillage for ideas and plaster all over their game without pay or attribution.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>I don't have the resources nor the energy to spare to pursue this legally but I have lost count of the number of times a major company has deemed it easier to pay a designer to imitate or steal my work than to write me an email. In 10 years I have never made a consistent income from this work and I am tired of designers from huge companies moodboarding and parasitizing my designs while I struggle to make a living.</em>"</p>

<p>Bungie confirmed their error from the <a href="https://x.com/MarathonDevTeam/status/1923217324384903262">MarathonDevTeam X account</a>, which has a significantly smaller following than the main <a href="https://x.com/MarathonTheGame">Marathon account</a> for the game and the main <a href="https://x.com/Bungie">Bungie</a> account. It was a mistake made by the Marathon development team, so it makes sense to have an account that speaks for that team being the one to speak up, but it has the air of Bungie owning up to the mistake with a whisper, instead of with its full voice.</p>
<p>"<em><span>We immediately investigated a concern regarding unauthorized use of artist decals in Marathon and confirmed that a former Bungie artist included these in a texture sheet that was ultimately used</span></em><span> in-game</span>," the post on the MarathonDevTeam account reads.</p>
<p>"<em><span>This issue was unknown by our existing art team, and we are still reviewing how this oversight occurred.</span> <span>We take matters like this very seriously. We have reached out to</span> Antireal </em><em><span>to discuss this issue and are committed to do right by the artist. As a matter of policy, we do not use the work of artists without their permission.</span></em><span>"</span></p>
<p>This is the fourth time Bungie has been caught taking art from an artist without giving them proper credit: first in <a href="https://x.com/Cozmo23/status/1442534201165635587">2021</a>, then again in <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/bungie-says-it-will-compensate-and-credit-artist-whose-work-was-mistakenly-used-in-this-weeks-major-destiny-2-cutscene/">2023</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-to-compensate-artist-for-destiny-2-nerf-blaster-art/">2024</a>, and now once again in 2025.</p>
<p>"<em><span>To prevent similar issues in the future, we are conducting a thorough review of our in-game assets, specifically those done by the former Bungie artist, and implementing stricter checks to document all artist</span></em><span> <em>contributions,</em>" the MarathonDevTeam account continued.</span></p>
<p>"<em><span>We value the creativity and dedication of all artists who contribute to our games, and we are committed to doing right by them. Thank you for bringing this to our attention.</span></em>"</p>
<p><iframe title="Marathon | Alpha Intro Cinematic" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N4Jv5H3_yAo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In response to a separate question about the assets being lifted, Antireal confirmed that artists from Bungie, including the Marathon franchise art director <a href="https://x.com/josephacross">Joseph Cross</a>, followed <a href="https://x.com/4nt1r34l/status/1923083432713650246">them on X for years</a>, though Antireal had previously never interacted with Cross or any of the Bungie artists who followed them.</p>
<p>For the fourth time running, it's clear that Bungie has a major issue with its art pipeline. That these mistakes continue to happen is, frankly, ludicrous, and it only makes you wonder where <a href="https://wccftech.com/bugnie-attempt-at-dismissing-copyright-lawsuit-denied-by-court-due-bungies-inability-to-provide-vaulted-destiny-2-content-as-evidence/">other issues might lie</a> in its creative process.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/capcom-goes-for-deep-cuts-with-latest-fighting-game-collection.1191288/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/667921/capcom-fighting-collection-2-review-xbox-switch-steam-ps4<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>At this point, there are more than enough ways to play <em>Street Fighter II</em>. But <em>Project Justice</em> and <em>Plasma Sword</em>? Well, those are something entirely different, and much harder to find. And Capcom has made the smart decision to continue to make some of its more obscure fighters the focal point of its growing library of retro collections.</p><p>While it’s called <em>Capcom Fighting Collection 2</em>, the latest release is actually the third in the series from Capcom. The first, in 2022, focused on 2D games like <em>Darkstalkers</em>, <em>Cyberbots</em>, and, yes, <em>SFII</em>. That was followed by the long-awaited collection of <em>Marvel vs. Capcom</em> releases. The latest collection isn’t quite as focused, but instead covers eight Capcom fighters released between 1998 and 2004, spanning arcades and consoles like the Dreamcast.</p><p>Mostly these games are divided into two categories. There are a bunch of 2D crossover releases that mash up characters from different franchises. That includes two <em>SNK vs. Capcom </em>games —<em> Millennium Fight 2000 Pro</em> and <em>Mark of the Millennium 2001</em> — along with <em>Capcom Fighting Evolution</em>, which brought together characters from <em>Street Fighter</em>, <em>Darkstalkers</em>, and <em>Red Earth</em>. If nothing else, <em>Fighting Evolution</em> is notable for being a game where Ryu can fight a dinosaur.</p><p>Rounding out this half is <em>Street Fighter Alpha 3 Upper</em>, which isn’t a crossover, but <em>is</em> an excellent 2D fighter. In fact, all of these are. They’re slick and polished, filled with incredible animation and character designs, and lots of interesting mechanics based around teams and power-ups. These are games that largely came out as interest in 2D fighters seemed to be dwindling, and Capcom was throwing everything it could at keeping the genre appealing. Because of this, they’re some of the most over-the-top examples of a fighting game.</p><p>Perhaps more interesting, though, is the quartet of 3D fighters included in the collection, which were all early attempts at exploring the genre in a new dimension. They’re all pretty different because of it. <em>Power Stone</em> and its sequel were particularly ambitious, with their large, interactive levels that players could run around, collecting items and power-ups as they fought. The other two are somewhat more straightforward but with their own twists: <em>Plasma Sword: Nightmare of Bilstein</em> is built around weapons-based combat, while<em> Project Justice </em>puts you in control of various fighting teams as you punch your way through a surprisingly deep storyline about rival schools.</p><p>These games haven’t aged as well as their 2D counterparts. The controls can be a little fiddly, and the action is often slower, with floaty physics. But they still stand up, even to someone like me who never played them originally. More importantly, though, they’re finally available for a wide audience to play. Despite being a cult classic, the most recent port of <em>Power Stone</em> came out on the PlayStation Portable in 2006. This collection is long overdue for most of these games.</p><p>Aside from the games themselves, which are available in both their English and Japanese incarnations, <em>Capcom Fighting Collection 2</em> has the usual assortment of add-ons, like online support, a music player, and a collection of associated art. It’s not as robust as, say, a Digital Eclipse release like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/11/24291537/tetris-forever-review-ps5-switch-pc-xbox"><em>Tetris Forever</em></a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23451349/atari-50-review-xbox-playstation-switch-steam"><em>Atari 50</em></a>. But Capcom’s new collection nails the important thing: it’s eight classic games that all play great, showcase an interesting evolution of the genre, and are finally available for modern players.</p><p><sub>Capcom Fighting Collection 2<em> is available now on the Switch, PS4, Xbox One, and PC.</em></sub></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> now lets you chat with Darth Vader, who wields the fully operational AI-generated power of the late James Earl Jones. 
</p>
<p>
This isn't the first time Fortnite has featured the digital recreation of a now-deceased individual. Last year, it held a pop concert fronted by Juice Wrld, the young rapper and Fortnite fan who sadly died of an overdose in 2019.
</p>
<p>
But this is the first time Fortnite has let you voice chat with a character - any character, living or dead - and have them respond to you via generative AI.  Here's a look at how it works:
</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>
This frankly bizarre addition comes amidst Fortnite's ongoing Star Wars season, and after seminal Darth Vader voice actor James Earl Jones signed over the rights of his voice to Disney to enable the iconic villain's voice to continue. 
</p>
<p>
In the world of TV, this has already been used to generate Vader's voice for the Disney+ show Obi-Wan Kenobi. Now, Fortnite has partnered with Google's Gemini AI bot and ElevenLabs' Flash audio model to provide the late actor's vocals for players in real-time.
</p>
<p>
Players aged under 13 will receive a prompt asking for parental permission to chat with Darth Vader, an <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/disney?lang=en-US">Epic Games FAQ page</a> states. You can also report Darth Vader, if he says something you don't like.
</p>
<p>
"When you talk with Darth Vader, we securely send voice audio to Gemini to generate Darth Vader's response," Epic Games wrote. "Your voice audio and transcriptions of it are not stored. If you report something Darth Vader says, we will only receive Darth Vader's responses."
</p>
<p>
For now, Darth Vader only understands and responds in English, the FAQ continues. *insert Wookie noise here*
</p>
<p>
The development comes after significant pushback by established (human, living) voice actors over the encroachment of AI in video games. Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/negotiations-over-ai-are-still-holding-up-video-game-development-mass-effects-jennifer-hale-explains-why">Eurogamer chatted with Commander Shepard voice actor Jennifer Hale</a> to find out the latest developments in the ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike, with AI a key issue.
</p>
<p>
Earlier today, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/apple-blocks-fortnites-return-to-iphone-in-us">Epic Games announced that Fortnite would be going offline on iPhone for the forseeable future</a> after Apple had "blocked" its return via the App Store in the US.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/jade-raymond-leaves-haven-studios<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Industry veteran Jade Raymond has departed Haven Studios, the studio she co-founded back in 2021. The studio is ostensibly currently hard at work on live-service heist shooter&nbsp;<em>Fairgame$</em>.</p>

<p>According to a (paywalled) Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-15/playstation-executive-jade-raymond-leaves-studio-she-founded" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">article</a>, Sony didn't give a reason for Raymond's departure to Haven staffers, but Bloomberg, citing "people with knowledge of the matter", says her departure comes after an external test of&nbsp;<em>Fairgame$&nbsp;</em>about which Haven developers were "concerned".</p>

<p>Specifically, Haven's workers are said to have been worried about&nbsp;<em>Fairgame$</em>' development progress, as well as its reception during the external test. It sounds like another one of Sony's live-service gambles might be in trouble.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fairgame-heist-jade-raymond.jpg?itok=FAVNdBo- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fairgame-heist-jade-raymond.jpg?itok=0EfyB301 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Jade Raymond has departed&nbsp;<em>Fairgame$&nbsp;</em>developer Haven.</figcaption></figure><p>In a statement given to Bloomberg, Sony describes Raymond as "an incredible partner and visionary force" for Haven. The studio says it wishes Raymond "all the best in her next chapter", and that it is "committed" to supporting Haven and its new co-leads Marie-Eve Danis and Pierre-Francois Sapinski.</p>

<p>No update is provided on the progress of&nbsp;<em>Fairgame$</em>, which was initially <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-showcase-here-are-all-trailers-announcements" rel="nofollow">revealed all the way back in 2023</a>. That means it's been almost two years since Haven or PlayStation provided any kind of information about the project.</p>

<p>According to Bloomberg,&nbsp;<em>Fairgame$&nbsp;</em>was originally slated to launch in fall 2025, but the publication's sources say that the game has been delayed to spring next year. No official release window has been revealed by Sony yet.</p>

<p>If&nbsp;<em>Fairgame$&nbsp;</em>has indeed been delayed, it'll be another setback for Sony's live-service slate, which has so far arguably failed to produce a compelling result beyond <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-financials-helldivers-2-sales" rel="nofollow">last year's&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em></a>, although it has managed to produce one catastrophic failure <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-shutting-down-refunds" rel="nofollow">in the form of hero shooter&nbsp;<em>Concord</em></a>.</p>




<p>As well as&nbsp;<em>Fairgame$</em>, Sony's upcoming live-service slate includes Bungie's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marathon-release-date-gameplay-revealed" rel="nofollow">extraction shooter&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em></a>&nbsp;and an as-yet-untitled <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/teamlfg-playstation-studios-ex-bungie" rel="nofollow">project from teamLFG</a>, a studio made up of ex-Bungie staffers.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen whether these two projects - or, indeed,&nbsp;<em>Fairgame$</em>&nbsp;- can provide the live-service hit Sony so badly wants. In the meantime, though, the studio will just have to fall back on its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-sales-pass-548-milion-units-marvels-spider-man-2-has-sold-10-million-copies" rel="nofollow">slate</a> of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/horizon-forbidden-west-sales" rel="nofollow">ludicrously successful</a> single-player <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/god-of-war-ragnarok-sold-11-million-copies" rel="nofollow">titles</a>.

            <p>I have a minor but unwholesome obsession with fire that extends from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry-2">Far Cry 2</a>'s self-propagating blazes through <a href="http://www.krupskayabooks.com/wildfire/poem.html">the pyropoetics of Andrea Brady</a> to, most recently, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rescue-ops-wildfire">Rescue Ops: Wildfire</a>. In the latter, single and multiplayer firefighting sim, you must save people and battle dynamic blazes on large, countryside maps. Inspired by <a href="https://time.com/7098778/redefine-us-megafire-climate-change-study/">the increase in wildfires thanks to climate change</a>, it was developed with input from real-life French firefighters, and seems both frantic and strategic. Here's a trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>My immediate armchair arsonist question is: exactly <em>how</em> credible and changeable are these conflagrations? <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2915770/Rescue_Ops_Wildfire/">The Steam page</a> suggests that they respond to wind direction and strength. Beyond that, we can deduce things from the tools and tactics you'll use against them. A good rule of thumb is to deprive them of fuel, whether by hacking trees down or starting controlled but inevitably riskier "tactical backfires" to burn off the vegetation in the wildfire's path. </p>
<p>The Steam page also distinguishes between defensive firefighting, which is about containment, and offensive firefighting, which is about sending people in to extinguish the blaze. Naturally, you will have to worry about water supply and also, managing the hoses from your truck. Other vehicles include water bombers and helicopters for shuttling people around. The vehicle handling puts me slightly in mind of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/spintires">Spintires</a> and co. Check out the bit in the trailer where the driver eases oh-so-carefully over a bump in the road.</p>
<p>There's a campaign offering that is broken into missions, and a sandbox mode with random objectives, where you'll put everything you've learned to the test. Both can be played solo or in 2-4 player co-op multiplayer. Perhaps they could add a morbid asymmetrical mode that casts one player as a firestarter, with character classes ranging from "adorable Girl Scout with very large magnifying glass" to "<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mad-max">Mad Max</a> flamethrower guitarist".</p><p>It's all the work of Marseille-based Exkee, who've been knocking around since 2003 and have worked on, amongst other things, mobile spin-offs for Tomb Raider, Ghost Recon and Age Of Empire.</p>
<p>With regard to the climate change inspiration, the bare irony of fire simulations is that the more the in-game fire spreads, the more computing resource it generally needs, and so, the more electricity it requires to run. Still, I don't get the sense that playing Rescue Ops will be like founding a crypto-mining business. If you share my weird love of the flame, may I direct you towards <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tenderfoot-tactics">Tenderfoot Tactics</a>, an RPG in which battle maps can be wantonly reconfigured using elemental spells.</p>

The latest set from the <em>Pokémon </em>TCG, <em>Scarlet</em> <em>&amp; Violet Destined Rivals</em>, is a top-notch collection of cards bursting with Team Rocket antics, which sports (in my limited experience, at least) pull rates I don’t believe we’ve seen in this era.

It’s a problem that only just repeated itself with last week’s website-crashing launch of the next sets, <em>White Fire</em> and <em>Black Bolt</em>—the first ever split-set English-language collection—that looks likely to be as impossible to buy as just about everything else this year. Or, if you do, you’ll be paying way over MSRP to scalpers, and please don’t do that.</p><p>However, smart players will know that the best way to get cards for any set is to attend a pre-release event at their local store or club, where everyone receives seven or more packs, generally for less than $30. Those are taking place Saturday and Sunday, May 17 and 18, although I hear that even these were booking up fast weeks ago. If you can, I really recommend making the effort for <em>Destined Rivals</em>. It’s a bunch of fun, and if the 55 packs I opened are an accurate sample (thanks to The Pokémon Company for sending them over), you’re likely to pick up a good handful of super-pretty full-art cards.</p><figure id="" data-id="ab75a1b9c52b396491039bdcea5b11da" data-recommend-id="image://ab75a1b9c52b396491039bdcea5b11da" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Team Rocket's Ariana in Japanese." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Team Rocket's Ariana in Japanese." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ab75a1b9c52b396491039bdcea5b11da" data-recommend-id="image://ab75a1b9c52b396491039bdcea5b11da" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Team Rocket's Ariana in Japanese." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>So why am I so excited for this set? It’s a combination of things. It’d be silly to pretend that the first appearance of Team Rocket in the game in 25 years isn’t a big part of the thrill, and the set is rammed full of the nefarious group and their signature monsters. Among the Pokémon boosted by Team Rocket are Moltres, Zapdos and Articuno, along with newcomer Spidops, classics like Meowth and Mewtwo, and that most evil of Pokémon, Flaaffy. Meanwhile, for the forces of good, Cynthia, Misty, Ethan and Arven all join, again bringing back some favorites like Milotic, Gyarados, Psyduck and Ho-oh. It’s a real crowd-pleaser.</p><p>Secondly, those pull-rates. When I get these boxes of cards from TPCi, I sit down and open them with my 10-year-old. It’s a really solid way of gauging the levels of satisfaction, his spirit draining out of him when we’re tearing through a set like <em>Journey Together</em> and just getting endless bulk. But with <em>Destined Rivals</em>, even my Pokémon-uninterested wife wanted in, so fun was it to have a strong chance of finding an exciting card. Where <em>Journey Together </em>only had 31 full-art cards, <em>Destined Rivals</em> has an amazing 62! Double! Admittedly, that’s on top of a wild 182 regular cards (included ex), making this the biggest set since <em>Surging Sparks</em>, but with—in my admittedly unscientific sample—a seemingly much better chance of finding the special stuff.</p><p>We were especially lucky to pull the Team Rocket’s Ariana Special Illustration Rare, along with one of my chase cards, the Illustration Rare of Misty’s Psyduck. No Mewtwo, sadly, but we also got 12 regular ex cards (only two duplicates), and 11 full-arts! If you include ex in the figures, that’s a pull-rate of almost one in two! Remove the regular ex cards and you’ve still got one in five for something Ultra Rare or better. Those included the wildly gorgeous Rapidash by Rond, Mori Yuu’s extraordinarily detailed Clamperl, the delightful Team Rocket’s Murkrow (with Ariana and the Pokémon staring at one another in front of a skyline of skyscrapers) by Akira Komayama, and the splendidly silly Team Rocket’s Raticate by Mekayu (the artist who gave us the glorious Drampa from <em>Temporal Forces</em>).</p><figure id="" data-id="aa1c31e4e0fed45bafcb42b5c811ddf7" data-recommend-id="image://aa1c31e4e0fed45bafcb42b5c811ddf7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Misty's Psyduck." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Misty's Psyduck." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="aa1c31e4e0fed45bafcb42b5c811ddf7" data-recommend-id="image://aa1c31e4e0fed45bafcb42b5c811ddf7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Misty's Psyduck." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>And thirdly, the game itself! <em>Journey Together</em> was supposed to be the reintroduction of Trainer Pokémon to the live game, but it was such a damp squib. This time, things are really going to get mixed up! Team Rocket arrive with an array of brand new tricks and cheats, and while people are obviously going to build decks around Misty and Ethan, it’ll be the baddies that once more prove the most fun.</p><p>There’s the addition of Team Rocket’s Energy, which provides <em>two</em> energy to any Team Rocket Pokémon, and can be either Dark or Psychic or both! Meanwhile, Team Rocket’s Venture Bomb lets you flip a coin to find out if it’s going to do 20 damage to any of your opponent’s Pokémon, or  20 specifically to your own Active Pokémon—but being an Item card, you can do this silliness as many times as you have cards in a single turn. Giovanni, meanwhile, offers a classic evil move: you can play him to swap out your current Active Pokémon, but also do the same to your opponent, <em>and</em> choose which of their benched Pokémon goes in. Team Rocket’s Great Ball lets you flip a coin and then pull either an Evolution or Basic Pokémon from your deck depending on the result. And then Stadium card Team Rocket’s Watchtower renders <em>all</em> Pokémon without abilities! That’s going to <em>destroy</em> so many players’ tactics!</p><p>Oh, and there’s a card called Team Rocket’s Bother Bot, and while its ability is fascinating—you can flip one of your opponent’s prize cards, then pick a random card from their hand, and then choose if you want them to swap them over—I’m mostly mentioning it because I find its name very funny.</p><p>Then the Team Rocket Pokémon themselves do some real mischief. Arbok, for instance, stops your opponent playing any card with an ability (unless it’s a Team Rocket), and also does 30 damage to every single Pokémon your opponent has on the board. Articuno can prevent all attack effects just by being on the bench. Dottler lets you look at the top five cards on your opponent’s deck, and then put them back in your preferred order! Ha!</p><p>Nidoran ♀ and ♂ offer their usual teamwork options, but super-powerfully. Once you’ve evolved to Nidorina, you can do an attack that lets you search your deck to evolve any two of your benched monsters, and then Stage 2's Nidoqueen will do 180 damage for <em>one</em> energy if you have a Nidoking in play. Oh, and Ampharos, Flaaffy’s ultimate form, has an ability that means any time your opponent evolves a Pokémon, they automatically put 40 damage on it! That’s monstrous.</p><figure id="" data-id="ac61be11ab88e94798fe212cddf9b262" data-recommend-id="image://ac61be11ab88e94798fe212cddf9b262" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Cynthia's Garchomp ex" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Cynthia's Garchomp ex" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ac61be11ab88e94798fe212cddf9b262" data-recommend-id="image://ac61be11ab88e94798fe212cddf9b262" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Cynthia's Garchomp ex" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s going to be so interesting to see how people manipulate these new additions into the meta, not least when yet more cards are deliberately designed to mess up current favorite decks—Mimikyu lets you steal Tera Pokémon attacks, for instance. I think this should finally offer the shake-up the game needs in its third year of this era, before (and this is still just a rumor, but quite a likely one) next year’s switch to Mega Pokémon instead of a fourth year of <em>S&amp;V</em>.</p><p>Now, as I’ve said, my sample of 55 packs isn’t big enough to be indicative, and perhaps we just got weirdly lucky. But I have high hopes here. We’ll get a proper idea when the likes of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@DannyPhantump/videos&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/@DannyPhantump/videos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Danny Phantump</a></span> have put together their pull-rate data. Either way, there’s such a wealth of beautiful cards in the set, so much incredible art to collect, and a bunch that’ll make the live game so very interesting. Which is pretty much all I can ask for from a <em>Pokémon TCG</em> set. Other than, you know, being able to buy it. Which is going to be very, very hard to do.</p><p><em>Destined Rivals</em> officially releases on May 30, with pre-release events taking place this weekend, May 17-18.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Anyone who’s struggled through<em> Pokémon Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em> should be looking forward to less pop-in and more stability, though it remains to be seen just how much these free upgrades improve the experience on Switch 2. </p><p>There are some notable absences as well, including the<em> Xenoblade Chronicles</em> series, which feature sprawling sci-fi open worlds that can really make the existing hardware chug, as well <em>Luigi’s Mansion 3</em> and<em> Splatoon 3</em>. Another big game missing is <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons </em>which would seemingly be a perfect place to showcase GameChat video sharing when players visit one another’s islands. </p><p>Maybe Nintendo is preparing bigger, paid upgrades for those games, or maybe it’s planning to release sequels in the near future and doesn’t want its back-catalog providing to much extra competition. We’re certainly due for a new <em>Animal Crossing </em>early on in the Switch 2's lifecycle. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The expansion plays with more Trainer Pokémon cards, including Ethan, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-gold-version">Pokémon Gold</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-silver-version">Silver</a> protagonist, and brought back more nostalgia than I could cope with.

It is a real evolution for the game. From the way the new Trainer’s Pokémon open up deck-building possibilities to the much better pull rates, this set feels like they finally figured out what collectors and players want again. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It could be deemed as a mighty fresh start for The Pokémon Company, after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-pokmon-company-addresses-tcg-shortages-and-scalpers-following-destined-rivals-launch-in-new-statement">months of stock issues</a> and sets with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-review">tough pull rates</a> (although <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-journey-together-preview">Journey Together</a> had initially started getting things moving in the right direction). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I am already planning which decks to build and which cards I want doubles (or triples) of, and I haven't felt this way about a set in a while. And if stock levels can finally get sorted this year, alongside the whole of TCG, I think most trainers will have a very hard time resisting this set.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"Destined Rivals is more than just a trip down memory lane..."</p></div><p id="where-to-buy"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Where to Buy">Where to Buy</h2></p><div><ul><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QdbN61?object_uuid=42384c37-3c5e-4be4-a76e-fc7a255ec95f&amp;t=article" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Booster Bundle<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a href="https://zdcs.link/aBglGE?object_uuid=42384c37-3c5e-4be4-a76e-fc7a255ec95f&amp;t=article" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Booster Box<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a href="https://zdcs.link/aMJGom?object_uuid=42384c37-3c5e-4be4-a76e-fc7a255ec95f&amp;t=article" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Elite Trainer Box<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a href="https://zdcs.link/9gbeAq?object_uuid=42384c37-3c5e-4be4-a76e-fc7a255ec95f&amp;t=article" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pokemon Center Elite Trainer Box (Exclusive)<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a href="https://zdcs.link/akKJrr?object_uuid=42384c37-3c5e-4be4-a76e-fc7a255ec95f&amp;t=article" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Half Booster Box<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QVXrBd?object_uuid=42384c37-3c5e-4be4-a76e-fc7a255ec95f&amp;t=article" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Booster Pack<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a href="https://zdcs.link/985JDq?object_uuid=42384c37-3c5e-4be4-a76e-fc7a255ec95f&amp;t=article" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sleeved Booster Pack<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a href="https://zdcs.link/zJgqRD?object_uuid=42384c37-3c5e-4be4-a76e-fc7a255ec95f&amp;t=article" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">3 Pack Blister [Zebstrika]<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QP8YmZ?object_uuid=42384c37-3c5e-4be4-a76e-fc7a255ec95f&amp;t=article" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">3 Pack Blister [Kangaskhan]<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a href="https://zdcs.link/91jLoR?object_uuid=42384c37-3c5e-4be4-a76e-fc7a255ec95f&amp;t=article" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Build &amp; Battle Box<!-- --> </a></li></ul></div><p id="unboxing-and-impressions"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Unboxing and Impressions">Unboxing and Impressions</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I got my hands on a nice selection of <a href="https://pk.ign.com/pokemon-trading-card-game/237012/gallery/pokemon-tcg-scarlet-violet-destined-rivals-pokemon-center-elite-trainer-box-images" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Destined Rivals</a> products thanks to The Pokémon Company: a Build and Battle Box, a Booster Bundle, an Elite Trainer Box, and a full Booster Box. I want to say upfront that opening all of these felt way more rewarding than the past few sets. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Every product had its highlights, and it genuinely felt like I was hitting cards worth getting excited about instead of just shrugging and moving on.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Destined Rivals: Build and Battle Box</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Build and Battle Box set the tone early. Inside were four booster packs, a stamped promo card (Team Rocket's Tyrainitar for me) and a 40-card deck. I pulled one ex card and one Illustration Rare from the four packs, which is half decent if you ask me. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Building a quick deck from the included cards was surprisingly fun, especially since the Trainer’s Pokémon mechanics made even the starter deck feel a lot more flavorful than usual. Four Team Rocket's Tyranitar holo's please!</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Destined Rivals: Elite Trainer Box</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Sadly I didn't pull much from the Elite Trainer Box. But I did get nine booster packs, sleeves, dice, markers, and the Rocket’s Wobbuffet promo card. This ETB looks so awesome in my opinion. The red-and-black Team Rocket design is even better in person. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I think this ETB is easily one of the strongest ones we have seen recently, although like any Pokémon TCG set, pulling chase cards is 50% luck and 50% based on being a good set. So I was unlucky.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Destined Rivals: Booster Bundle</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But the Booster Bundle kept the momentum going. With six booster packs and no extras, it was just me versus the Pokégods. I pulled a couple of ex's and my favorite card of this set, Ethan's Typhlosian IR. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What a stunning card, so much movement and detail that still manages to showcase the bond between Ethan and Tyranitar. I think Booster Bundles are one of the best value products if you want a quick hit of that fresh-set excitement without destroying your wallet.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Destined Rivals: Booster Box</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Booster Box was the grand finale, and it delivered exactly what I was hoping for. I pulled multiple ex cards, a Gold card, a SIR and several Illustration Rares that made the whole opening feel exciting from start to finish. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In my opinion, this was the perfect reminder that Booster Boxes can still feel like an event, not just a slog through 36 packs hoping for one decent hit. If I was to get one of these products again, I'd go all in on a booster box.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"...It's safe to say that this is one of the best times I have had opening cards in ages." </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>But what about my first impressions with the new expansion?</strong> Well the thing that jumps out for me about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-destined-rivals-preorder-guide-2025">Destined Rivals</a> is how much better the illustrations are. Cards just feel more alive now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even commons are expressive enough that I find myself looking at them instead of instantly shuffling them into the bulk pile. It is the kind of small but powerful change that makes every pack a little adventure instead of a chore.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The return of Trainer’s Pokémon for a second time in the Scarlet and Violet era is another huge shift that I want to shout about. Building decks and collecting cards based around specific characters instead of just types gives near-unlimited theme options.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I love that Cynthia’s Pokémon feel like a cohesive team instead of a random pile of cards. It makes building and battling way more fun, and it also makes each pull feel a lot more personal.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Destined Rivals: Top Card Pulls</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Pull rates feel a lot better too. From 46 packs, I pulled 8 ex cards, 6 Illustration Rares, 1 Special Illustration Rare, and 1 Gold card. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's 16 respectable hits that don't just feel like glorified reverse holo cards. It matches the strong pull experience from Journey Together, and it is a world away from the frustrating experience I had with recent mini sets like Prismatic Evolutions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I still have nightmares about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-scarlet-violet-shrouded-fable-preview">Shrouded Fable</a>, where the pull rates were so harsh that opening it felt like a social experiment on patience. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-surging-sparks-is-the-best-scarlet-and-violet-set">Surging Sparks</a> was only slightly better. Even after opening a booster box, it mostly handed out standard ex cards like consolation prizes. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-where-to-buy-in-stock">Prismatic Evolutions</a>? That mini set was so flooded with Pokéball cards and low chances that I felt quite disappointed after previewing it. <a href="https://nordic.ign.com/pokemon/92538/news/pokemon-tcg-announces-destined-rivals-set-with-nostalgic-team-rocket-theme" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Destined Rivals</a> fixes all of that and reminds me why I love this hobby.</p><p id="best-card-pulls"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best Card Pulls">My Favorite Destined Rivals Pulls</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">In terms of pure chase cards I pulled alone, this is one of my favorite Pokémon TCG previews to date. I got 16 hits from standard exs and IRs to SIRs, with the full gallery at the top of the article. Here's my top five pulls from this Destined Rivals preview, and I think I've caught some of the best cards in this set:</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Ethan's Ho-Oh ex 239/182</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/13/ethans-ho-oh-ex-gold-rare-1747136504522.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: Christian Wait / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Special Illustration Rare artwork shows Ethan and Ho-Oh soaring across a vivid sunset, and it's just one of those cards that feels special the second you see it. Whilst that was one of my chase cards I wanted to pull going in, I'm just as happy with it's gold rare variant. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It has Ho-Oh and Ethan front and center, plus my generation two choice was Pokémon Gold, so this card has a lot of meaning to me. The card itself is very playable, allowed you to attach two basic fire energy per turn whilst causing 160 damage and healing 50 damage from each of your Pokémon. A Ho-Oh ex and Charizard ex deck would be a beast!</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Arven's Mabosstiff ex 235/182</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/13/arvens-mabosstiff-ex-sir-1747136924945.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: Christian Wait / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Arven’s Mabosstiff ex is a card that makes me love midrange decks again. Just look at how much of a good boy he is. This artwork captures everything I love about Pokémon, and also reminds me of having a good cuddle with my doggos. Epic. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Vigorous Tackle gives you solid damage early, and Boss’s Headbutt lets you turn a battle around for a massive 210 damage. With Arven’s Sandwich keeping it healthy, I think this card could be a real pain for opponents who think they can chip you down easily. I will call this deck "Mabos-switch" and you don't have enough badges to train me.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Team Rocket's Crobat ex 217/182</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/13/team-rockets-crobat-ex-full-art-1747137011418.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: Christian Wait / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This card has so much potential for a damage spread deck. Imagine sending Crobat ex in, placing damage on three opposing Pokémon in one turn, then sending in something like Shrouded Fable's Bloodmoon Ursaluna from your hand. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That would then allow you to use it's Battle Hardened ability to attach three fighting energy in one turn and use it's Mad Bite attack. It does 100 damage plus 30 more for each damage counter. Insane deck idea! I also like these full art ex cards with a trainer in the background, such a unique design. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Ethan's Typhlosion 190/182</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/13/ethans-typlosion-ir-1747137123227.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: Christian Wait / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Ethan’s Typhlosion brings the heat, literally. Buddy Blast can do massive damage based on how many Ethan’s Adventure cards you have in your discard pile, and it rewards aggressive, discard-heavy playstyles. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This IR card is my favorite card of Destined Rivals. It does such an amazing job of showing the connection Ethan has to his starter Pokémon whilst showing how hectic this moment is. Such an awesome card.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Team Rocket's Houndoom 191/182</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/13/team-rockets-houndoom-ir-1747137164397.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: Christian Wait / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Houndoom needs more love, and it got it with this illustration rare. This is one of those Pokémon that was made for a Team Rocket set. This artwork is another example of how active and agressive Destined Rivals artwork is, and also a fantastic example of how undervalued Illustration Rares are in Pokémon TCG. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's me hoping Black Bolt and White Flare turns heads with every card having an illustration variant. I'm not sure if I'd use this card in play due to the energy discard being there on a Stage 1 card, but it would be easy enough to build up on your bench for a quick hit and retreat.</p><p id="verdict"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Verdict">Should You Buy Pokémon TCG: Destined Rivals?</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I think Destined Rivals is a must-buy <strong>(with a massive caveat: if you can actually find it in stock)</strong>.

It will no longer be a <a title="Genres > Free-to-Play [393 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/free-to-play">free-to-play</a> title, instead launching at a discounted price of $15.99 / £12.99 / €15.99. Anyone who played the game during Early Access will receive the full game for free. The game was published by <a title="Companies > PLAION [608 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/plaion">PLAION</a> during the Early Access period, which amassed 250,000 players. <span id="more-965491"></span></p><p>“What a wild ride! We’ve loved every moment working with Caged Element on <em>Speed Freeks</em>, which has been especially enjoyable thanks to the community’s passion, energy, and commitment to the game,” said PLAION senior brand manager Paul Jeal in a press release. “With the community’s help, we’ve laid a really solid foundation for the game, and we’re thrilled to see it reach 1.0. We wish Wired Productions and Caged Element nothing but success as they head full-throttle to launch.”</p><p>Caged Element game director Chris Mallinson added, “We set out to make the Orkiest of <em><a title="Series > Warhammer [44 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/warhammer">Warhammer</a> 40,000</em> games, and through our Early Access period we’ve had thousands of people help us achieve that goal—along with our previous publisher PLAION. Now with Wired Productions picking up the torch, we’re launching out of Early Access and into version 1.0 with a different approach that we think players will really appreciate and enjoy. We thank both partners for their dedication to the game, along with Games Workshop. We’re of course very happy to be back with our pals at Wired Productions, since we worked with them before on <em>GRIP</em>. Now enuff o’ dat, on to da WAAAGH!!!”</p><p>Wired Productions managing director and co-founder Leo Zullo said, “Reuniting with Caged Element feels like coming home. Huge thanks to PLAION for a smooth, respectful handover, which has been months in the making. The work that’s gone into Early Access, shaped by player feedback, has been huge. Everyone at Wired is buzzing to be back alongside our friends at Caged Element. Launch is just the beginning, we’ve got big plans and plenty of surprises coming your way.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the version 1.0 release, via Wired Productions:</p><blockquote><p>The 1.0 launch brings the Free Early Access period to a close, and as a thank you to its dedicated player base, every Early Access player will receive the full 1.0 update completely free. It’s a gift from Wired Productions and Caged Element in appreciation of the support from the community.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>As part of the 1.0 update, all in-game microtransactions will be removed. Players who earned or purchased in-game currency, known as Teef in-game, during Early Access will still be able to spend it for the next 12 months, though the in-game store will no longer be available to general players. Instead, <em>Warhammer 40,000: Speed Freeks</em> will introduce a series of new downloadable content packs at launch, offering content in a more traditional format.</p><p>Originally announced in 2023 by PLAION and Caged Element, <em>Warhammer 40,000: Speed Freeks</em> has grown a passionate community around its blend of chaotic speed and explosive Orkish combat. The strategic shift in publishing has been months in the making, ensuring a seamless experience for players and the team.</p><p><em>Warhammer 40,000: Speed Freeks</em> is the adrenaline-fueled combat racer set in the brutal <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> universe! Drive ferocious vehicles equipped with powerful weapons and abilities into a full-throttle battle to the death. You’ll find that <em>Speed Freeks</em> is a fresh, Ork-y take on vehicle combat that you’ve never seen before.</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> GTA 6 (Grand Theft Auto VI) - Official Release Date Reveal | Trailer 2</p>
      </div>
<p>"So, essentially, once again, Rockstar Games broke the Internet, and we feel really good about that and what that means for the upcoming release of GTA 6," Zelnick said.</p><p>GTA 6's new trailer was the first since the debut trailer in December 2023--there was a huge amount of pent-up demand for any new footage, and people clearly ate it up. The trailer used The Pointer Sisters song <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-trailer-2-song-whats-the-tune-playing-and-do-the-lyrics-connect-to-the-story/1100-6531338/" data-ref-id="1100-6531338">"Hot Together,"</a> and the tune experienced a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-trailer-hit-almost-a-half-billion-views-right-away/1100-6531396/" data-ref-id="1100-6531396">massive spike in streams after the trailer arrived.</a></p><p>The new GTA 6 trailer was released just a few days after Rockstar Games <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-2026/1100-6531282/" data-ref-id="1100-6531282">delayed the game to May 2026</a>. While the delay announcement was a bummer for many, the trailer arriving a few days later alongside <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gta-6-screenshots-images/2900-6525/" data-ref-id="2900-6525">dozens of new screenshots</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-grand-theft-auto-6-character-revealed/2900-6537/" data-ref-id="2900-6537">character information</a> helped ease the pain.</p><p>Responding to the GTA 6 delay, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-boss-reacts-to-grand-theft-auto-6-delay/1100-6531597/" data-ref-id="1100-6531597">Zelnick said the push to 2026 "pains" him.</a> However, Zelnick said it was necessary to delay the game to 2026 because the game needed more polish.</p>

With copious examples (and others online finding even more as people pour through alpha footage) as proof, Antireal’s posts on Bluesky began to blow up, with many calling out Bungie for what looked like apparent plagiarism. Less than 24 hours later, the Marathon Dev Team X account <a href="https://x.com/MarathonDevTeam/status/1923217324384903262">posted a thread</a> confirming the “unauthorized use” of Antireal’s work.</p><p>“We immediately investigated a concern regarding unauthorized use of artist decals in Marathon and confirmed that a former Bungie artist included these in a texture sheet that was ultimately used in-game,” the X post reads. “This issue was unknown by our existing art team, and we are still reviewing how this oversight occurred. We take matters like this very seriously. We have reached out to [Antireal] to discuss this issue and are committed to do right by the artist.”</p>

</article>
<p>The thread continues, “As a matter of policy, we do not use the work of artist without their permission. To prevent similar issues in the future, we are conducting a thorough review of our in-game assets, specifically those done by the former Bungie artist, and implementing stricter checks to document all artist contributions. We value the creativity and dedication of all artists who contribute to our games, and we are committed to doing right by them. Thank you for bringing this to our attention.”</p><p>You can see Antireal’s first claim of art theft in the image below, a set of comparison pictures – the evidence is pretty damning. As more people find more examples of her art in Marathon, it’s looking more widespread than originally believed.</p><p>Sadly, Antireal is no stranger to this kind of art theft. “I don’t have the resources nor the energy to spare to pursue this legally but I have lost count of the number of times a major company has deemed it easier to pay a designer to imitate or steal my work than to write me an email,” she writes on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/antire.al/post/3lpa4gikk722l">Bluesky</a>. “In 10 years, I have never made a consistent income from this work and I am tired of designers from huge companies moodboarding and parasiting my designs while I struggle to make a living.”</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/video-games/2025/05/16/marathon-playstation-bungie-video-game/"><em>The Washington Post</em></a>, Antireal said, “I’d kind of had to learn to shut up about these cases because they’ve happened so constantly over the past 10 years. It was tiring to be viewed as ‘someone who complains’ more than as an artist. But the response this time has been overwhelmingly understanding and I’m extremely thankful for the support.”</p><p>That response is likely what prompted Bungie to finally step in, as the amount of evidence surfacing of Antireal’s art appearing in Marathon is undeniable. <a href="https://x.com/awawawhoami/status/1923084243791483378">Some of Antireal’s art found in Marathon dates back as far as 2017</a>, while others are more recent. Antireal also <a href="https://x.com/4nt1r34l/status/1923083432713650246">says</a> that Marathon’s art director, Joseph Cross, has followed her on X for years (and a few others from Bungie) but that the two have never communicated.</p><p>Bungie claims the lifted art results from a former artist’s texture sheet. It is investigating how this stolen art slipped through the cracks – cracks that Cross is likely responsible for keeping an eye on, considering he’s Marathon's art director.</p><p>This is not the first time Bungie has plagiarized an artist’s work. In 2023, it announced it was compensating and crediting an artist whose art was mistakenly used in a cutscene in Destiny 2, as reported by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/game-development/princeton-review-top-game-design-schools/"><em>PC Gamer</em></a>.</p><p>Marathon launches September 23 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. With so much of Antireal’s art currently in the game, it’s unclear how this will affect its release. Between needing to correct this situation and a lukewarm reception to the game’s recent Alpha, it wouldn’t be surprising if Bungie and publisher Sony Interactive Entertainment delayed Marathon to address these issues.</p><p>In the meantime, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/12/bungie-shares-first-marathon-gameplay">check out the first gameplay from Marathon</a>.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Take-Two has four games headed to Switch 2: Borderlands 4, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sid-meiers-civilization">Sid Meier's Civilization</a> 7, and the 2K Sports games NBA 2K and WWE 2K.</p>
<p>Zelnick claimed this is a "bigger array of releases than we've ever offered before with a new Nintendo platform."</p>
<p>He continued: "Historically being a third-party in the Nintendo business has been a bit challenging. I think Nintendo's been very forthcoming in addressing that, and we're stepping up too because we have great optimism for the platform."</p>
<p>Zelnick then commented on other potential games heading to Switch 2. "In terms of what we would bring to any platform, we address it on a case-by-case basis," he said. "We obviously want to be where the consumers are. But we would not necessarily bring every title to every platform. There are also great catalogue opportunities as well."</p>
<p>Could Red Dead Redemption 2 be one of those catalogue opportunities?</p>
<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-4-for-ps5-xbox-series-xs-reportedly-in-development-could-release-this-year">rumours emerged of a GTA 4 port for modern consoles</a>, with reliable insider Tez2 stating "by now it should've gone up a year in development". Perhaps that will include Switch 2.</p>
<p>Zelnick has also commented on the recent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-delayed-to-2026">delay of GTA 6</a> into next year, stating the decision was made to ensure <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-delay-so-rockstar-could-achieve-its-creative-vision-with-no-limitations-says-take-two-boss">Rockstar "achieves its creative vision with no limitations"</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/16/nintendo-details-12-free-switch-2-game-updates-resolution-frame-rate-hdr-gameshare/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Nintendo has detailed the free <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a> game updates that will be coming to a bunch of their first party games alongside the console’s release on 5th June 2025. Across 11 games (12 on a technicality), there’s a range of different Switch 2 specific improvements, including higher resolutions, better frame rates, HDR support and, for multiplayer titles, the addition of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/heres-how-nintendo-switch-2-gameshare-lets-you-share-multiplayer-games-with-other-switches/">GameShare</a>.</p>
<p>In contrast to the premium Switch 2 Edition game upgrade, which start at £8 / $10 and can bring a big batch of added content and features, these are less significant patches that are being sent out for free.&nbsp;That these games were getting free updates was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/these-games-are-getting-free-nintendo-switch-2-upgrades-from-nintendo/">already known</a>, but this now confirms what exactly each game is getting.</p>


<p>Included in the list are games that have some notorious performance issues, like Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, or could simply do with having some kinks smoothed out, like the hitching of the Link’s Awakening remake. What’s surprising, when factoring the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/24/nintendo-switch-2-edition-game-upgrade-prices-set-at-8-and-17-depending-on-the-game/">paid Switch 2 Editions for Breath of the Wild and Metroid Prime 4</a>, is that some games here are getting HDR support for free, and there’s even Game Builder Garage getting mouse mode support.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-will-not-support-vrr-in-docked-mode-nintendo-finally-confirms/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Nintendo has finally put to bed a bit of confusion players had about the Nintendo Switch 2. The console supports variable refresh rate (VRR) while in handheld mode, but Nintendo has officially clarified that it does <strong>not</strong> support VRR while in docked mode.</p>
<p>The confusion began when, after the full reveal of the Nintendo Switch 2 at the beginning of April, Nintendo's websites in the US, Canada, the UK, and Europe <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-might-not-support-vrr-when-docked-after-all/">all mentioned that VRR was supported</a> in docked mode. It was then removed from the US and Canadian websites, but kept on the UK and EU websites. The mention of VRR being supported in docked mode was later <a href="https://x.com/oliemack/status/1912925904046899619">removed</a> from the UK and EU websites as well.</p>
<p>So did it support VRR in docked mode, or didn't it? The removal seemed to suggest that it didn't, but Nintendo had yet to provide a clear response.</p>
<p>In a statement sent to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/nintendo-apologises-for-error-with-mention-of-switch-2-vrr-tv-support">Nintendo Life</a>, they finally provided that clear response and apologized for the mistake of publishing it on their websites in the first place.</p>
<p>"<em>Nintendo Switch 2 supports VRR in handheld mode only. The incorrect information was initially published on the Nintendo Switch 2 website, and we apologize for the error</em>," the statement reads.</p>
<p>When asked if VRR support for docked mode would be added in a future update, Nintendo replied, "<em>We have nothing to announce on this topic</em>."</p>
<p>A disappointing end to this saga, but an end for now, nonetheless. It's always possible that Nintendo is working on adding VRR support for docked mode for a future firmware update, but at least for launch, we know that VRR is a handheld-only feature.</p>

      <div><p>Nintendo has released a list of the original Switch games that will be getting free Switch 2 upgrades when the console launches next month.</p>

<p>The Switch 2 is due to arrive on June 5th, and a range of games for the original Switch will be getting boosts to visuals and performance on the day of the new machine's release, free of charge.</p>

<p>These upgrades are separate from the Switch 2 Edition range, which will give a number of original Switch games more drastic visual and performance makeovers and which will cost extra on top of the original titles. A number of Switch 2 Edition games will <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-launch-lineup" rel="nofollow">also be available at launch</a>, though.</p>

<ul><li><i>ARMS</i>: optimized handheld and docked visuals, optimized&nbsp;framerate, HDR support</li>
	<li><em>Big Brain Academy: Brain vs. Brain</em>: GameShare support for up to four people in Party Mode, plus GameChat support</li>
	<li><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/captain-toad-treasure-tracker" rel="nofollow"><em>Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</em></a>: optimized handheld and docked visuals, HDR support, GameShare support for two players</li>
	<li><em>Clubhouse Games: 51 Worldwide Classics</em>: GameShare support for up to four players, local and online GameChat sharing</li>
	<li><em>Game Builder Garage</em>: optimized handheld and docked visuals, Joy-Con 2 mouse controls</li>
	<li><em>New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe</em>: optimized handheld and docked visuals</li>
	<li><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet" rel="nofollow"><em>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet</em></a>: optimized handheld and docked visuals, optimized framerate</li>

	<li><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em>: optimized handheld and docked visuals, HDR support</li>
	<li><em>The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening</em>: optimized handheld and docked visuals, HDR support</li>
</ul><p>It's not clear whether games like&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet&nbsp;</em>or the&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>games will be getting full 60fps support or simply stabilized framerates, but given that the two&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>games run at what appears to be an uncapped framerate anyway, I'd expect smoother performance in both.</p>

As A16z marketing partner Ryan K. Rigney </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.pushtotalk.gg/p/the-games-industry-is-deprofessionalizing">defines it</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, deprofessionalization is a phenomenon driven by the overperformance of older titles (particularly free-to-play live service games), large studios struggling to drive sales, and the outsized success of some solo developers and small teams.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These three forces, he argues, will combine to "drive career professionals from the traditional, professionalized side of the games industry."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Some of these people will decide to go indie," he continues. "Others will leave gaming altogether. And in between there’s a vast spectrum of irregular working arrangements available."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Is this trend real? It sure felt so at PAX East 2025. It's no secret that the COVID-19 pandemic led to many game companies decamping from expo floors, retreating to either all-online promotion or in-person community meetups structured around intermittent panels. Gone are the days where a chunk of the development team can get one-on-one facetime with players—shifts in supply and demand have simply moved where marketing takes place.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But something else lurked under the surface. Some notable studios like Behaviour Interactive and Funcom had classic booths up on the show floor. Devolver Digital had maybe the tallest booth on display—but it was only using it to showcase three games: </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.mycopunkgame.com/">Mycopunk</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2742830/Monster_Train_2/">Monster Train 2</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2742830/Monster_Train_2/">,</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.devolverdigital.com/games/botsu">Botsu</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. The bulk of the remaining space was taken up by small publishers and game studios.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/epic-games-ceo-resubmits-fortnite-to-apple-app-review-after-suggested-obstruction" target="_self" data-discover="true">Epic Games CEO resubmits Fortnite to Apple App Review... again</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Wandering through these booths, I found a mix of truly excellent and inspiring games. But also found myself bubbling with frustration. Few of the developers on display were working on teams larger than three people. They talked about publishers wanting ever-more-expensive offerings as part of their pitch deck. Short-term contractors seemed to be the best way to plug gaps. Why did it feel like so few proper businesses were fighting to get their games in front of players at PAX?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Speaking with Rigney and other developers, I sensed that "deprofessionalization" isn't just a catchy phrase to describe demand-side economics in game industry hiring. It's a frustrating reality that may undervalue games from big and small teams alike.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Deprofessionalization is built on the back of devaluing labor">Deprofessionalization is built on the back of devaluing labor</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Rigney offered some extra nuance on his "deprofessionalization" theory in an email exchange we had before PAX. He predicted that marketing roles at studios would be "the first" on the chopping block, followed by "roles that seem replaceable to management (even if they're not)."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ea-s-new-hybrid-work-policy-requires-a-minimum-of-three-in-office-days" target="_self" data-discover="true">Report: EA's new hybrid work policy requires a minimum of three days in-office</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The winners will be the creative renegades. I'm talking about the people making work that would have never gotten greenlit at one of these bigger publishers in the first place. Some of these creatives will start their own studio, or dabble in side projects...This is the only creative industry on the planet where one person can make $100 million making something by themselves."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That held up in my survey of the games boothing at PAX. The developers of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mycopunk</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2783280/Cat_Secretary/">Cat Secretary</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> had some of the larger teams on the floor of about 5-6 people. Indie publisher Playism was showing off a number of excellent-looking games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mind Diver</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Break Arts III</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Executive producer Shunji Mizutani told me the average team size the company is looking to back is around 1-3 developers (though he said it's not a hard and fast rule).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">My favorite game I saw, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.weharvestshadows.com/">We Harvest Shadows</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is being developed by </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/555150/The_First_Tree/">The First Tree</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> solo developer David Wehle. Wehle explained that he's hiring a contract coder to help with the dense system design fueling the "farming" part of his "horror farming simulator." The story was the same everywhere I went. Solo devs, two-person teams, and publishers fishing for low-budget indie hits were the talk of the show.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sony-is-considering-to-pass-on-trump-tariffs-to-hardware-prices-and-sees-us-manufacturing-possible" target="_self" data-discover="true">Sony may 'pass on' Trump tariffs to customers, is considering US manufacturing on hardware</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I want to be clear here—no one I spoke with at PAX East should feel "obligated" to give anyone a job. They're small teams making the most of limited resources, and it's the acceleration in game development technology that's made it possible. What feels wrong is how few people seem to benefit from this status quo.</span></p><p>Image via ReedPop.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To go back to Rigney for a moment, his key example of a post-deprofessionalization game developer is veteran developer Aaron Rutledge, a former lead designer on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>League of Legends</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Call of Duty: Black Ops 4</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Apex Legends</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. After leaving Respawn Entertainment in 2024 he founded a consultancy firm Area Denial, acting as a "gun for hire" for studios.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Rutledge deserves his success, and the life of a traveling creative called on by other studios sounds romantic. But as a foundation for game development, it's a framework that celebrates the few over the many. It narrows which roles are considered "essential" for making great games (often designers or programmers) and treats other positions as somehow less essential. You could see someone like Wehle hiring someone like Rutledge to bring some of that triple-A experience to a small game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But that feels like the polar ends of who can benefit in the deprofessionalized world—developers with the stability to swing big for big-shot ideas, and programmers or designers with deep career experience that can be called in like a group of noble mercenaries. People in between will be left out.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Who gets left behind in a world mainly filled with small teams?">Who gets left behind in a world mainly filled with small teams?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">My PAX trip validated my fear that three professions are especially vulnerable in this deprofessionalized world: artists, writers, and those working in game audio or music. These roles seemed vulnerable because on these small teams, they were the roles developers mentioned doing in some kind of shared or joint fashion.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">All three risk compartmentalization as "asset creators," their work treated as products you can purchase off the store shelf.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Every artist in games knows how hard it is to make a living doing what you love. In-house artist positions have faded away as companies look overseas to produce as many assets as humanly possible at the lowest living wage. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://aftermath.site/ai-video-game-development-art-vibe-coding-midjourney">Enthusiasm for AI-generated assets</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/art/how-devs-can-spot-ai-generated-3d-models">that look like dogshit</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">) are nudging this trend along. In the "gun for hire" mindset, working artists aren't worth anything to game development because they're producing goods to be used, not participants in the process. Art directors are in a slightly more stable position, but only by virtue of knowing "what looks good" and telling someone else what they want to do.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As someone who recently shipped his second game as a writer, the cuts to game narrative teams hit close to home. The GDC 2025 State of the Industry survey </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://gdconf.com/news/gdc-2025-state-game-industry-devs-weigh-layoffs-ai-and-more">reported that of the 11 percent</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> of developers laid off in the last year, 19 percent of them worked in game narrative, the highest of any responding demographic. Two diverging trends are hurting this field: the growth of successful games that don't feature much narrative (either focusing on deep game mechanics or story-lite multiplayer) and the spread of story-driven games authored by the creative director and maybe one or two collaborators create conditions that lower the number of available jobs.</span></p><p>Image via ReedPop.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game writers have long described frustration with how they're treated by the industry, often brought in later in the process and sometimes treated as if they lie in opposition to the rest of the development team. Some studios leaned on the job title of "narrative designer" for professionals who write and implement narrative events, but that still speaks to a mistrust of the profession, that producing words isn't enough to bring value to a team.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Finally, game audio and music professionals both produce work that can be bundled into licensable libraries, with implementation left to designers on a team. Sometimes this work is essential, the number of sounds a game needs can't be produced by an individual human. And composers don't always want to be tied to one studio—working with multiple teams frees them to explore creative projects and keep working when they aren't necessarily needed in a day-to-day game development environment.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But again, treating them this way puts them on the rim of the game development wheel, implying their labor could be deprioritized by true talent that deserves to reap the benefits of game design.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="A decentralized creative community needs to benefit creatives">A decentralized creative community needs to benefit creatives</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Rigney explained to me that the game industry has one ace up its sleeve that other creative fields don't: its "indie" market is a commercially viable market. "People are paying for these games!," he exclaimed. "This is not happening for indie filmmakers. This isn't happening for books. What's happening for indie games and small studios won't replace the jobs lost at the major publishers, but it will create opportunity for the most creative and most determined people."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But don't rush off to start your indie dreams—it's still as true as it was for years that most indie games do not succeed. And those that don't succeed can still be financial fodder for the shovel merchants of the worlds—your technology companies, your payment processors, your game platforms, your investors, etc. Plenty of companies are standing ready to profit on the devs gunning to be the next </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Schedule I</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Is there a way deprofessionalization can benefit the developers left behind? Rigney raised one fair point: part of the reason some indies are running circles around large companies is that those companies can mismanage creatives so badly they go for years without shipping a game. If someone smart could crack that problem—improve management at large organizations and make sure games make it out the door—that could be a way to balance the trend.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Right now none of the solutions are well equipped to solve all the problems. I work in venture capital, which isn't great for funding individual games, but can work well when funding teams that are pursuing large scale growth via some new distribution or technological edge."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Indeed, PAX East showed that we need creative solutions. One shouldn't need to be a social media wunderkind, years of hard-to-earn triple-A experience, or be a jack-of-all-trades to have a career in game development. That path does bring us some wildly inventive games—but leaves us with a community of developers hustling on gig work to keep their dream alive.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Update 5/16</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: This piece has been updated to clarify Rigney's job title at A16z.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div data-testid="contributor-summary-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

		<p>Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine is a game that has sat in my backlog for years, and following the release and popularity of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/04/space-marine-2-review-warhammer-40k/">Space Marine 2</a> last year, I thought it high time to delve into the first game and expand my very limited experience of the Warhammer universe. So, how does this 2011 third person hold up nowadays?</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40K Space Marine - Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QBB66g1PviE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine is a prime example of the third person shooters that released during the PS3/Xbox 360 era. It has some big set pieces, lots of areas with obvious cover interconnected by primarily brown environments, and a ton of bloody violence. The game borrowed from its contemporaries, in essence being a Warhammer version of Gears of War. As Captain Titus, you are sent to the Forge world Graia as part of the Vanguard to push back an Ork invasion, and protect its assets. Captain Titus is the embodiment of an Ultramarine, running towards danger with guns blazing and no fear of any potential harm. Okay, it is more of heavy thumping jog due to wearing towering combat armour. Very nice and blue armour.</p>
<p>Space Marine’s story is one of factions vying for control over a powerful resource, each with their own agendas. One side wants to hold power, while another wants to tear everything down and bring about a new order to the galaxy. It is a tale we have seen hundreds of times, and Space Marine follows the well-trodden tropes without deviating all that much. Maybe doing so would have been considered heresy? What does help is Captain Titus, whose character is stoic throughout the story but isn’t afraid to think for himself to get the job done, even if it means interpreting the rules slightly differently to others. One of his battle brothers, Sidonus, understands this while his other, Leandros, still needs to learn that lesson.</p>


<p>The gameplay of Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine does still hold up. The shooting feels decent, even if feedback could have been a bit more impactful, while the melee combat is very satisfying, whether you’re using the chainsword, axe, or the big thunder hammer. What makes all of these satisfying are the enemy hordes you battle. Space Marine sends waves of Orks at you through much of the game, making the action frenetic as you deal with the different enemy types. Swing a sword to cut through them and using a laser rifle to one-shot ranged enemies. The boss fights could have been a bit more entertaining, though. The way the final enemy is set up through the story of Space Marine makes it seem like a big one-on-one fight with him will be the main event of a box office pay per view. Instead, the end boss disappoints by being a QTE event after facing off against waves of his various minions, from weakest to strongest.</p>
<p>What was surprising about Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine is that the online multiplayer still works, at least on PC. Though there was a little bit of a wait to fill a lobby, there are people still playing the online of Space Marine, even with the glitzier sequel. More people were in the PvP playlists, with that having the standard modes such as deathmatches and zone captures. The real fun, for me anyway, was the PvE mode where you and up to three others face off against enemy waves, moving through different maps to get to a final objective. This mode also throws quick challenges at you, like killing 20 enemies in 20 seconds or getting a number of headshots. If you want to experience what online multiplayer was like in 2011, then jump on Space Marine as soon as you can.</p>
