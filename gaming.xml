            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/z-man-games-announces-arkham-horror-lovecraft-letter-eldritch-twist-on-classic<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Z-Man Games has announced <em>Arkham Horror: Lovecraft Letter</em>. The tabletop developer known for <em>Carcassonne</em> and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/pandemic-hot-zone-north-america-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Pandemic</em></a> series is putting an eldritch horror twist on one of their classic card games, <em>Love Letter</em>.</p>

<h2>The <em>Arkham Horror: Lovecraft Letter</em> Announcement</h2>

<p>According to its <a href="https://www.zmangames.com/game/arkham-horror-lovecraft-letter/" rel="nofollow">store page</a>, <em>Arkham Horror: Lovecraft Letter</em> is a chilling twist on the <em>Love Letter</em> card game. <em>Love Letter's</em> original creator, Seiji Kanai, was the lead designer on this eldritch horror-themed spin-off.</p>

Players will delve into the madness of the world of H.P. Lovecraft, face eldritch horrors, and uncover allies in a protracted game of wits. Can you hold on to your sanity and outsmart the things beyond mortal ken? Or will you succumb to the unyielding terror that comes from knowledge of what lies beyond?</p>

<p><em>Arkham Horror: Lovecraft Letter</em> isn't the first spin-off of <em>Love Letter</em>. The series has seen plenty of creative license. Spin-offs that include a Marvel superhero take, <em>Infinity Gauntlet</em>, a tie-in to the British period drama series <em>Bridgerton</em>, and a licensed Star Wars title, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/star-wars-jabbas-palace-card-game-brings-new-bargains" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Jabba's Palace</em></a>.</p>

<p>This is thanks to Love Letter's simple yet strategic card gameplay. The result is a game that is easy to learn but hard to master.</p>

Certain cards have a secondary effect, ones that may provide you an extra edge, but will cost you sanity. Do you push your luck or go mad?</p>

<p><em>Arkham Horror: Lovecraft Letter</em> is now available for pre-order at an MSRP of $14.99. The pre-order includes special Collector's Edition packaging for dedicated board game players and collectors alike. It contains the following:</p>

<ul><li>27 cards</li>
	<li>18 Double-Sided Tokens</li>
	<li>6 Reference Cards</li>
	<li>1 Rulebook</li>
	<li>1 Lovecraft-themed Velvet Bag</li>
</ul><p>The game is expected to ship March 28, 2025.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-clarifies-assassins-creed-animus-hub-rumors/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-clarifies-assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-animus-hub-rumors.1037115/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-clarifies-assassins-creed-animus-hub-rumors/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>On Thursday, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-animus/">details regarding</a> the Assassin’s Creed Animus Hub made their way online thanks to a leaker. The leaks showed a Battle Pass for the game that included various cosmetics and even pets that could be unlocked. </p>



<p>This led to speculation about what else could be included in the Battle Pass and within Animus as a whole. After rumors continued to swirl about the possibility of paid extra content within the Hub, Ubisoft decided it was best to comment on the claims.</p>



<p>In a post on the game’s <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1gs3ahg/a_message_from_the_team_on_the_animus_hub/?rdt=40110" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official subreddit</a>, community manager Ubi_Waldo clarified some details about the Animus Hub and what players can expect from the offers.</p>



<h6 id="h-help-insider-gaming-take-our-2024-reader-survey">HELP INSIDER GAMING:&nbsp;<a href="https://forms.gle/wvT7oBtvjZLVmrEv9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Take Our 2024 Reader Survey</a></h6>



<p>“It has come to our attention that inaccurate rumors have been circulating online regarding the upcoming Animus Hub (ex-codename Infinity),” Ubi_Waldo said. </p>



<p>He then went on to clarify that all rewards in the Animus Hub will be “entirely free”. He also said “players will have access to regular content &amp; missions at no extra cost”. Lastly, there are “no paid subscriptions or paid battle pass” within the Animus Hub.</p>



<p>He closed his remarks stating that more details on what the Animus Hub will offer will come as the launch of Assassin’s Creed Shadows gets closer.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-infinty-news/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the first to report</a> on the Animus Hub, formerly known as Infinity. The hub will act as the launcher for all Assassin’s Creed games moving forward.</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows launches on February 14, 2025 after being <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed from its original</a> November release. The game will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>



<p>What do you expect to see from the Animus Hub when it launches alongside Assassin’s Creed Shadows? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/forums/assassins-creed.19/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>. </p>

which were tokens players earned in Modern Warfare 3 and Warzone prior to Black Op 6's launch, were never intended to be added to Black Ops 6 in Season 1. The tokens showing up yesterday was an error, and this has now been corrected to only show those XP tokens available for use in Warzone.</p><p dir="ltr">On the multiplayer side of the update, the popular Nuketown 24/7 playlist was added back to the game for both core and Hardcore playlists.</p><p dir="ltr">The update patched map exploits on Hideout and Payback, which previously allowed players to go outside of the intended playspace.

Even though it doesn’t have many proper applications, this niche movement option is a great tool to have under your belt.</p><h2 id="h84405"><a id=""></a>How to Perform Super Movement</h2><figure id="" data-id="3009c67360201d05cb63d2edee59f747" data-recommend-id="image://3009c67360201d05cb63d2edee59f747" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Hit flies upward toward Great Ape Baby, trailing next to his Super Galick Gun super attack." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Hit flies upward toward Great Ape Baby, trailing next to his Super Galick Gun super attack." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3009c67360201d05cb63d2edee59f747" data-recommend-id="image://3009c67360201d05cb63d2edee59f747" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Hit flies upward toward Great Ape Baby, trailing next to his Super Galick Gun super attack." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Super Movement is a technique that’s only available in the Sparking! state. That means you’ll need to charge your Ki to its maximum and beyond at the cost of a skill count. <strong>Once you’ve entered Sparking!, use a Dragon Dash (RT+A for Xbox and R2+Cross for PlayStation) and then press the Guard button (RB or R1).</strong> Your character will quickly start vanishing left and right with little recovery time. Keep on pressing the button and they’ll look like they’re flickering across the stage.</p><p>You’ll mainly want to use this to dodge supers or Ultimate Blasts. With the right timing, you can even avoid supers with the most annoyingly perfect tracking. It won’t be as useful against obscenely large attacks such as a Spirit Bomb though.</p><p>Not everyone on the roster can use Super Movement. Larger characters like Toppo and Broly, in addition to giants like Great Ape Vegeta and Janemba, simply don’t have access to the technique. The lines do get a bit blurred when it comes to different forms, as Jiren normally can’t use Super Movement, but his Full Power version can. I was lucky to figure that out while unlocking his <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-jiren-endings-guide-1851680142&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-jiren-endings-guide-1851680142">confusing endings</a></span>, but figuring it out for most other characters will just be trial and error.</p><h2 id="h84406"><a id=""></a>Don’t Mash – Use Super Movement Sparingly</h2><p>The biggest piece of advice I can give regarding this technique is to not overdo it. Yes, I completely agree that spamming it and seeing your character zip across the screen looks awesome! Unfortunately, there are some pretty big downsides to doing this:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Super Movement drains your Ki, typically around a quarter of a bar. With the Ki gauge already depleting in Sparking! and Super Movement costing a bar with just a few uses, it’s easy to waste your limited time in this high-powered state.</li><li>Your character won’t be moving around randomly – there is a pattern. Super Movement has you quickly swaying from side to side. This doesn’t mean the opponent will be able to easily hit you, but it is possible to dodge and then zip right back into a rush super or beam attack.</li><li>The technique will typically track toward your opponent. It’s pretty great for quickly converting from one direction back to the enemy, but sometimes it’s too quick for the camera to keep up. This is especially notable when using Super Movement with the stick pushed to the side, as the camera will struggle to stay focused on you.</li></ul><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-rush-super-landing-guide-1851673589&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-rush-super-landing-guide-1851673589"><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em>’s Rush Supers Can Be A Super-Rush Once Mastered</a></span></p><p><strong>As cool as it looks, I strongly suggest performing Super Movement only once or maybe twice at a time.</strong> It only takes one well-timed use to dodge a super or ultimate blast. The only reason to spam it a little is if you’re dashing straight to your opponent and want to freak them out a bit. It can look pretty intimidating when someone is zigzagging at high speeds in your direction.</p><h2 id="h84407"><a id=""></a>Consider Some Ability Items</h2><figure id="" data-id="e918ec1386b894e4e9fe390100f3862b" data-recommend-id="image://e918ec1386b894e4e9fe390100f3862b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Ability Items tab in the Shop menu, with The Secret to Super Movements item highlighted." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Ability Items tab in the Shop menu, with The Secret to Super Movements item highlighted." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e918ec1386b894e4e9fe390100f3862b" data-recommend-id="image://e918ec1386b894e4e9fe390100f3862b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Ability Items tab in the Shop menu, with The Secret to Super Movements item highlighted." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Being careful with Super Movement isn’t the only tip we’re sharing. If you need extra leeway to work around Super Movement’s limitations, or maybe just want to flex with it more, you might want to consider making room for some choice Ability Items.</p><p>The primary issue we want to treat with these is how much the technique drains your Ki. In addition to general Ability Items that help conserve Ki, some specifically work with Super Movement. Here are the ones to look out for:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>The Secret to Super Movements – Reduces the cost of Super Movements for the Sparking! Gauge.</li><li>The Secret to Dragon Dashes – Reduces the Ki needed for Dragon Dashes.</li><li>Style of the Strong – Sparking! Mode lasts longer.</li><li>Dragon Heart - Increases Skill Count after dodging a Blast or Ultimate Blast with a High-Speed Movement.</li></ul><p>Super Movement is certainly one of the more niche mechanics in <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em>, with plenty writing it off as being useless. While many are rightfully sad that spamming can be detrimental, you can benefit from mastering this. It’s still obscure enough that you can scare or confuse the hell out of someone online using it. Plus, I can confidently say that nothing has felt as cool as dodging a beam super and flying alongside it to deliver a beat down. It gives big power level energy and we should all be here for it. </p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This adds two new campaigns set in a location full of sinister secrets and nightmarish creatures, while the Forbidden Woods expansion introduces two captivating campaigns set inside of a twisted wilderness.</p><h2>Bloodborne: The Board Game expansions</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4379947-bloodborne-expansions.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4379947" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4379947-bloodborne-expansions.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4379947"></a><figcaption>Bloodborne: The Board Game expansions</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4379947-bloodborne-expansions.jpg"></figure><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bloodborne-Forsaken-Cainhurst-Expansion-Strategy/dp/B08WYN3N6B?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Forsaken Cainhurst Castle expansion</a> -- $52.49 (<del>$60</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bloodborne-Chalice-Expansion-Strategy-Adventure/dp/B08W2519T2?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Chalice Dungeon expansion</a> -- $63 (<del>$80</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bloodborne-Hunters-Expansion-Strategy-Adventure/dp/B08W1XWRLG?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hunter's Dream expansion</a> -- $40</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bloodborne-Forbidden-Expansion-Strategy-Adventure/dp/B08WYRNV55?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Forbidden Woods expansion</a> -- $60</li></ul><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/get-dark-souls-board-game-for-only-51-and-roleplaying-sourcebook-for-30/1100-6527696/">Get Dark Souls Board Game For Only $51 And Roleplaying Sourcebook For $30</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-disc-drive-is-sold-out-at-most-retailers-but-walmart-has-it-for-now/1100-6526391/">PS5 Pro Disc Drive Is Sold Out At Most Retailers, But Walmart Has It (For Now)</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-preorders-live-at-amazon-walmart-and-best-buy/1100-6526406/">The PS5 Pro Is Available Now And Eligible For One-Day Delivery At Amazon</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-is-on-sale-for-a-great-price/1100-6527148/">Zelda: Echoes Of Wisdom Is Already On Sale For 25% Off</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-collectors-edition-preorders-available-ahead-of-this-weeks-launch/1100-6525830/">Dragon Age: The Veilguard Collector's Edition In Stock On Launch Day For PS5 And Xbox</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/special-edition-lord-of-the-rings-trilogy-4k-gift-set-releases-this-holiday-preorders-live-at-amazon/1100-6527414/">Lord Of The Rings 4K Gift Set Releases This Holiday, Comes With One Ring Collectible</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/build-shadow-the-hedgehogs-head-out-of-720-lego-bricks-for-only-56/1100-6525229/">Target's Exclusive Shadow The Hedgehog Lego Set Is Discounted Just Weeks After Its Release</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/king-boos-haunted-mansion-lego-mario-set-gets-first-price-cut-at-amazon/1100-6525381/">King Boo's Haunted Mansion Lego Mario Set Gets First Price Cut At Amazon</a></li>   </ul> </div>

A total of five WoW Tokens would be necessary to buy the least-expensive version of Avowed, for a total of about 1.4 million gold.</p><p>This is a pretty roundabout method of buying a game like Avowed, but it is possible, at least in theory.</p><p>Avowed launching on Battle.net caught some people by surprise, but it isn't totally strange, as Microsoft now owns Battle.net by way of its purchase of Activision Blizzard. The game's $70 standard edition and $90 digital premium edition (which comes with five-day early access) will both be available on Battle.net.</p><p>Alternatively, Avowed will launch on Xbox Game Pass for Ultimate subscribers. Avowed was originally set to launch in 2024 before being delayed to 2025. The delay wasn't for quality reasons, however, but came down to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-boss-says-avowed-was-delayed-due-to-scheduling-not-quality/1100-6527757/" data-ref-id="1100-6527757">scheduling it to help Game Pass</a>.</p>

The letter references <a href="https://www.adl.org/resources/report/steam-powered-hate-top-gaming-site-rife-extremism-antisemitism">a report by the Anti-Defamation League</a> that identified a large number of user accounts and user-created groups “that glorified antisemitic, Nazi<strong>, </strong>white supremacist, gender- and sexuality-based hate, and other extremist ideologies” on the PC gaming platform. </p><p>The letter features a high-level view of the kind of hateful content the ADL found on Steam. That includes “40,000 groups with names that included hateful words, with the most prominent being ‘1488,’ ‘shekel,’ and ‘white power’.” Warner’s letter highlights how the apparent preponderance of hateful content on Steam is in violation of the platform’s own <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fonline_conduct%2F">online conduct policy</a>, which explicitly prohibits “encouraging real-world violence” and posting or uploading “illegal or inappropriate content.”</p><p>“It is reasonable to question how committed Valve is to effectively implement and enforce Valve’s own, self-created Conduct Policy for its users,” the letter reads.</p><p>Content moderation has long been an issue for Steam. Valve only implemented <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/20/17882276/valve-steam-discussion-board-comments-content-moderation-review-change">moderation of its video game discussion boards in 2018</a> after previously leaving the responsibility to the developers themselves. Warner’s letter is the third sent by Congress to Valve over the last <a href="https://www.hassan.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/senators_hassan_calls_on_largest_gaming_company_to_address_online_extremism.pdf">three</a> <a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2023-03-28%20Letter%20to%20Valve%20re%20policies%20on%20extremist%20content.pdf">years</a> asking the company to answer for the extremist content that has proliferated on Steam. So far, Valve has not publicly responded to these letters. And though Warner’s letter threatens Valve with “more intense scrutiny from the federal government” if it fails to take meaningful action against hate content,<strong> </strong>First Amendment protections prevent the government from punishing companies for hosting legal —&nbsp;albeit hateful — speech.</p><p>Warner’s letter to Valve concludes with a list of questions about the company’s current enforcement practices, the size of its moderation team, and what steps it’ll take in the future to limit hateful content. Warner has asked for a response no later than December 13th. Valve has not responded to <em>The Verge</em>’s request for comment.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Today, Techland announced that Dying Light 2: Stay Human has been updated to take advantage of the new PS5 Pro console <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-5-pro-hardware-the-next-gen-graphics-upgrade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> last week by Sony. The visual improvements empowered by ray tracing and/or higher graphics settings apply to all four presets:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Balanced:</strong> Upscaled 4K at 60 FPS. Now with increased base resolution (1512p), improved Global Illumination, Screen Space Reflections and Sub Surface Scattering Quality.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Resolution:</strong>&nbsp;Native 4K at 30 FPS. Now with better Contact Shadows, Global Illumination, Screen Space Reflections and Sub Surface Scattering Quality.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Performance:</strong>&nbsp;Upscaled 4K with VRR, up to 120 FPS. Now with increased base resolution (1440p), better Contact Shadows, Global Illumination, Screen Space Reflections, Spot Shadows, Sub Surface Scattering Quality and Fog Quality.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Quality:</strong>&nbsp;Upscaled 4K at 30 FPS with Ray Tracing. Now with increased base resolution (1440p), better Contact Shadows, Global Illumination and Sub Surface Scattering Quality.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It's the perfect time for new PS5 Pro owners to check out the game even if they don't own it. Sony has announced that Dying Light 2: Stay Human is part of the new PlayStation Plus lineup and will be available for PS Plus Extra and Premium subscribers starting Tuesday, November 19.</p>
<p>The game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dying-light-2-stay-human-apocalypse-divided/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched </a>in February 2022 to an eight out of ten score here on Wccftech. Here's the final quote from reviewer Nathan Birch:</p>
<p><em>Dying Light 2: Stay Human is another exhilarating parkour and zombie-pummeling playground from Techland, although at times, the seams holding it all together are a bit obvious. Given the game’s glitches, minor gameplay annoyances, and crudely bisected story and world, reports of behind-the-scenes issues feel all-too-plausible. That said, the foundation here is rock solid, and Techland has proven they’re capable long-term builders, so I’m confident Dying Light 2’s embers can be stoked to a full flame in time.</em></p>
<div>
<p>Since then, Techland has improved the game with nearly twenty big patches in various areas, even adding <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-2-reloaded-edition-qa-franchise-director-talks-firearms-10-new-hours-of-gameplay-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">firearms</a>. While there are no more story DLCs planned due to the developer's focus on <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-qa-techland-on-the-games-origins-the-return-of-kyle-crane-vehicles-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dying Light: The Beast</a>, more patches will still be <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-2-will-still-be-supported-albeit-without-story-dlcs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> for the game in the future.</p>

Thunderful Group, which develops and publishes the acclaimed SteamWorld series alongside several other titles, has announced it's laying off between 80 and 100 employees as part of its second round of "restructuring" in less than a year - saying it sees "no other alternatives in order to ensure the Group's long-term sustainability and resilience".
</p>
<p>
Thunderful came into being in 2017 after the merger of Swedish indie developers Image &amp; Form and Zoink, and has since expanded to including several other publishers and developers, including Cloud Gardens studio Coatsink and Somerville developer Jumpship. In January, the company announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/thunderful-group-to-implement-restructuring-programme-affecting-around-20-percent-of-staff">laying off around 20 percent of its staff</a> as part of a "restructuring programme" management believed would "strengthen the Group's long-term competitive position", but it now seems Thunderful failed to achieve its initial goal.
</p>
<p>
In an <a href="https://thunderfulgroup.com/news-room/press-releases/2024-11-14-thunderful-group-implements-strategic-restructuring-program-doubling-down-on-third-party-game-publishing-and-scaling-back-internal-development-resulting-in-write-downs-of-220-240-msek">statement shared on its website</a>, Thunderful - which also divested its distribution business earlier this year - confirmed it was undertaking a further round of restructuring as it looks to scale back internal development and 'double down' on third-party game publishing.

<p>
"Whilst significant reductions in cost levels were achieved this year," it explained, "revenue targets have not been met and the Group is still struggling with negative cash flow." As a result, the company has made the decision to lay off a "large portion of the development team", impacting between 80 and 100 employees. Thunderful says its shift from in-house development to external publishing will "reduce the Group's fixed costs and allow for greater flexibility, enabling faster, diverse game releases by leveraging external talent and resources in a balanced manner, while still retaining some internal development capacity."
</p><p>
"It is regrettable to announce a second restructuring of Thunderful in less than a year," Thunderful Group CEO Martin Walfisz added, "but we unfortunately see no other alternatives in order to ensure the Group's long-term sustainability and resilience... We have many talented and dedicated employees, and it is with great regret that we are forced to part ways."
</p>
<p>
Back in February, Thunderful <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steamworld-build-underperformed-says-publisher-thunderful">admitted</a> last year's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/steamworld-build">SteamWorld Build</a> - the first new game in the SteamWorld series since 2019 - "fell slightly short of expectations", and that it was putting the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steamworld-headhunter-is-a-brand-new-co-op-action-adventure-from-image-and-form">previously announced SteamWorld Headhunter</a> "on hold". Its most recent title, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/steamworld-heist-2">SteamWorld Heist 2</a>, arrived this August, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steamworld-heist-2-review">earning itself three out of five stars</a> in Eurogamer's review. "The core of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/steamworld-heist">SteamWorld Heist</a> still burns brightly in this turn-based tactics sequel," Katharine Castle wrote, "but its bid to go bigger and better is a risk that hasn't quite paid off."

Call of Duty's battle pass tiers include tons of fancy cosmetic items, XP tokens, and CoD Points to earn back.</p><p dir="ltr">In the past, the standard pass has always felt like a good deal, because you'd invest 1,100 CoD Points to purchase the pass, and if you complete all the tiers, you'd earn a total of 1,400 CoD Points back throughout all the tier rewards. That extra 300 CoD Points (just over $2) could be saved or put towards a shop bundle.</p><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 6's battle pass now only includes 1,100 CoD Points to earn back.

This pass includes the campaign's Sevati "Sev" Dumas as a playable operator, several weapon blueprints, and even Gobblegums for Zombies.</p><p dir="ltr">On a more positive note, any of the double XP tokens you might have left over from last year's Modern Warfare 3 and Warzone have now been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/your-modern-warfare-3-double-xp-tokens-are-now-in-call-of-duty-black-ops-6/1100-6527774/">carried over to Black Ops 6</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/multidimensional-free-to-play-shooter-strinova-gets-release-date.1036974/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/strinova-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher iDreamSky has announced the release date for free-to-play anime shooter&nbsp;<em>Strinova</em>, which was one of the most popular demos during the most recent Steam Next Fest event.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1282270/view/6492596291873275919" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post on Steam</a>,&nbsp;<em>Strinova&nbsp;</em>will launch on PC on November 21st, which means we're less than a week away from its release at time of writing. The release is set for 4pm Pacific, so depending on your time zone, you may have to wait until the following day to check it out.</p>

<p>More specifically,&nbsp;<em>Strinova&nbsp;</em>managed to secure the top spot on the Next Fest's Daily Active Demo Players board, as well as reaching the top three in the Trending Upcoming Games list. Suffice it to say people are excited for this one.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/strinova-release-date-combat.jpg?itok=ZRpp0jxu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/strinova-release-date-combat.jpg?itok=q5OGLwBK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you've ever wished&nbsp;<em>Paper Mario&nbsp;</em>was a third-person anime shooter,&nbsp;<em>Strinova&nbsp;</em>is for you.</figcaption></figure><p>It must be said that&nbsp;<em>Strinova&nbsp;</em>has some pretty unique mechanics going for it, if nothing else. Essentially, it's a blend of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/genshin-impact" rel="nofollow"><em>Genshin Impact</em></a>-style anime visuals, arena shooter combat, and a singular gimmick that might help it stand out from the crowd.</p>

<p>With the touch of a button, your&nbsp;<em>Strinova&nbsp;</em>character can switch from 3D to 2D, allowing them to squeeze through passages, swim through ceilings, and zip up walls. You can also glide while you're in 2D form.</p>

<p>The catch is that you won't be able to fire your weapon while you're 2D, so it's kind of like moving through ink in&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/splatoon-3" rel="nofollow"><em>Splatoon 3</em></a>; you'll need to switch back to 3D in order to fire at enemies, but obviously, that will also make you a bigger target.</p>




<p><em>Strinova&nbsp;</em>will be completely free to play, and it'll boast a variety of gameplay modes, including stalwarts like Team Deathmatch. More modes and features will be added over time, too.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen whether this one can stand out in the crowded marketplace of free-to-play multiplayer shooters, but if you'd like to find out,&nbsp;<em>Strinova&nbsp;</em>will launch on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1282270/Strinova/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a> on November 21st (or 22nd, depending on where you are in the world).</p>

After fans unlocked the scene in question, some weren’t thrilled at how it seems to rewrite the history of the series. Responding to this, <em>The Veilguard </em>creative director John Epler has tried to clear up some interpretations of the scene.

After the credits roll, we see illustrations of several key moments in the <em>Dragon Age </em>series. This includes Loghain betraying the Grey Wardens in <em>Dragon Age: Origins</em>, Bartrand stealing the lyrium idol in <em>Dragon Age II</em>, and Corypheus tearing The Breach into the sky in <em>Inquisition</em>. However, the difference is these scenes are depicted with cloaked figures called the Executors. The implication is that the Executors have been pulling the strings of the <em>Dragon Age </em>universe all along, and some fans have taken this to mean that this faction has been controlling the villains of each game to do their bidding.</p><p>Epler took to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/eplerjc.bsky.social/post/3laxp3bf6mk2o&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/eplerjc.bsky.social/post/3laxp3bf6mk2o" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bluesky</a></span> to clear this misconception up using the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://rot13.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://rot13.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ROT13 cipher</a></span> to hide spoilers from those who haven’t beaten the game yet. But his translated message explains that while the Executors have perhaps nudged history over the decades, Loghain, Bartrand, and Corypheus were all acting of their own free will.</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>“[T]he word choice of balanced, whispered, guided is VERY DELIBERATE,” Epler’s deciphered message reads. “No one was forced or coerced or controlled into making any choices.</p><p>It’s extremely important that ultimately everyone made their own choices. they still own the consequences of these decisions, because <em>Dragon Age</em> is still a series about people making decisions of their own free will and those decisions having consequences”</p></blockquote><p>It’s unclear just how the Executors “guided” past <em>Dragon Age </em>villains, nor do we have a concrete sense of what they hoped to gain by pushing history in those directions. Right now, the running theory is they may be involved with the Forgotten Ones, elven gods who were long removed from the contemporary pantheon elves worshipped before the events of <em>The Veilguard</em>. Whatever the truth is, <em>The Veilguard</em>’s post-credits scene heavily implies they will play a major role in the next <em>Dragon Age </em>game, but that’s probably several years away as BioWare shifts focus to the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-teaser-n7-day-andromeda-1850999958&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-teaser-n7-day-andromeda-1850999958">upcoming fifth <em>Mass Effect</em></a></span>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
