However, a demonic army invades Hayabusa Village while he’s gone--and it’ll be up to the young Kenji Mozu, this apprentice, to fend them off. But do to that, he’ll need help from the infamous Black Spider Clan.</p><p>Ragebound will feature dual protagonists (Kenji Mozu and Kumori), and you’ll need to master both their skills to survive. The game is looking to combine modern gameplay mechanics with old-school visuals, and it’s shaping up to be a unique addition to the iconic Ninja Gaiden franchise. If you can’t wait to play until September 12, the digital version launches on July 31.</p><p>Be sure to also check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-4-preorders-are-live-supports-play-anywhere-on-xbox-and-pc/1100-6532333/" data-ref-id="1100-6532333">Ninja Gaiden 4 preorders</a>, as there’s a nice bonus for reserving a copy in advance.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/rainbow-six-siege-x-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">I play a lot of competitive shooters – and I mean <em>a lot</em> of competitive shooters. Whether it’s being an unfortunate son in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gray-zone-warfare-early-access-review"><u>Grey Zone Warfare</u></a>, flipping cards in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fragpunk-review"><u>FragPunk</u></a>, or smashing and grabbing  in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-finals-review"><u>The Finals</u></a>, this has been my default “gaming night with the friends” genre since I was in school many, many (many) years ago. And even after many thousands of hours spread across Destiny, Call of Duty, Halo Infinite, and Valorant, there is something about the action on the Rainbow Six series that stands out and just feels right. Now that Rainbow Six Siege is celebrating its tenth year with a massive new update in the form of Rainbow Six Siege X, it seems like a perfect time to reevaluate how this popular tactical shooter stands among its peers after a decade of tweaks, updates, and additions. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The fundamentals of Siege are as strong as ever, which is great to see. Bomb is the headliner mode: Two teams take turns on offense and defense trying to either fortify position and protect a bomb, or battle their way in to defuse it. That setup has been around for decades (and is also the core mode of games like Counter-Strike) but Siege’s distinctive entrenchment and destruction mechanics make its version stand out, and both sides of that coin are extremely fun. I love throwing down a bunch of temporary walls, setting up razor wire or other boobie traps, and getting ready to ambush attackers. And it’s just as satisfying on offense, knowing the other team has set up similar defenses, and blowing a wall open with some thermite to bypass all of it and get the drop on the enemy. The fast time-to-kill rewards position over twitch skill, and I appreciate the way the relatively slow aim-down-sites animation forces you to decide before a fight how you want to engage. This is a thinking man’s shooter, through and through. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The cast of playable characters is an impressive 75 Operators. Each has a different loadout and slightly unique playstyle, with half reserved for Attackers and the other playable only when you are on Defense. They do a great job catering to different playstyles, whether you want to smash through walls with your big hammer as Sledge, or dash around at high speed as Oryx. It is surprising that the Siege X update didn’t add anyone new to the roster, though we did get Rauora just a few months ago. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Dual Front mode hasn’t yet grown on me in the time I’ve spent with it so far.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to Bomb, Siege X adds a new 6v6 mode called Dual Front, but that one hasn’t yet grown on me in the time I’ve spent with it so far. Here, both teams have an area to attack and another to defend simultaneously. There are no restrictions on what type of character you can use, though only 37 of the 75 operators are eligible selections. The single available map is enormous, which, combined with the fast time-to-kill of Siege, means you tend to spend just a very small fraction of the match duration involved in actual action. Unlike in Bomb you can respawn after you die, which seems like it would make this a good mode for onboarding new players, but so far I feel like it really just takes away the pulse-pounding stakes that make Siege what it is. </p><div id="rank-rainbow-six-siege-xs-operators" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Rank Rainbow Six Siege X's Operators</h3><h3>Rank Rainbow Six Siege X's Operators</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Siege X is built around a limited free-to-play model. I say limited because, while you can absolutely play Siege X for free, it locks some key modes, like Ranked and Siege Cup, behind a paywall. You’ll need to spend around $20 USD if you want access to those. That seems like an odd choice for something that already has a robust shop and battle pass system for generating money, particularly when other popular games, like Marvel Rivals, don’t do any such segmentation between paid and unpaid players. The community has long been a bit weary of how slow progression and a protracted Operator unlock pace push people towards the paid battle pass, but with the revamps in Siege X I still need to spend more time unlocking things to get a feel for how much better or worse that has gotten. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>One of the hallmarks of Siege has always been the way you can punch through walls.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the hallmarks of Siege has always been the way you can punch through walls, breach barriers, or come crashing down through the ceiling into your assault, but that feels like it could’ve used an update for this relaunch. For all the walls you can Kool-Aid Man through, there are still a surprising amount of invincible barriers, like thick walls, certain window coverings, and any sort of furniture that make its destruction system less flexible than a more modern game might be. This is especially true on rooftop maps, which limit your options for a vertical breach to the small number of predetermined access points. Those limitations really stand out when other games that’ve come along since Siege first paved the way let you smash through almost anything. I’m not saying Siege needs to let you literally bring down the house, but the fact that I can’t throw some thermite under the bomb and drop it through the floor like I can with the bank in The Finals really sticks out. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A decent audio system, especially headphones, has always been an advantage in Siege thanks to its outstanding sound design, and Siege X has noticeably improved it. Explosions and gunfire sound as great as ever, but it’s the ability to locate the general direction of sounds really impresses me. It’s always been handy for finding enemies trying to get the drop on you, but the revamped soundscape now feeds a lot more detail into it. The most significant difference I’ve heard is in footsteps above and below you – once you learn to recognize the difference between the boomy noise above versus the more hollowed-out sounds below you can start to close your eyes and pinpoint exactly where threats will come from, which is such a cool gameplay-based reward for paying attention to the details. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Justin's favorite multiplayer shooters</h3><p>Fragging is better with friends, and these are the best games for it.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a few other extremely situational upgrades I quite like. Rappelling is one of the most fun offensive options in Siege X: Hanging upside down like a tactical Spider-Man and getting the drop on enemies watching stairways and doors is supremely satisfying, though until now the actual usefulness in combat has always been somewhat limited. That’s because the rope has tended to leave you a sitting duck – or a pinata – if the enemy sees you. But new options to sprint along the wall or jump around corners means getting spotted isn’t instant death, and I’ve found myself using it a lot more as a result. On top of that, new destructible objects like gas pipes and fire extinguishers can be shot to create jets of flame or smoke. It’s extremely rare for that to matter in a fight, but it does have a very cool cinematic flair with just a touch of area control that I really appreciate. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">All that said, I’m still early enough in my return to Siege that I’m not quite ready to render a final verdict on its new iteration. I can certainly say that Siege X is a lot of fun to play, and mastering every Operator will be enough to keep me busy for the long haul. I’m a big fan of most of the new additions like the improved sound design, more mobile rappelling, and destructible elements, though at this point I don’t know if Dual Front will be a destination mode – I need to give it more time to gel before I write it off. Overall, I think this a solid step forward that I’m eager to keep playing and evaluating, so stay tuned for the full review next week.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

This mapping-focused build is all about going fast and clearing screens.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Maxroll’s Necromancer-in-Chief HelmBreaker has updated all 3 of his minion guides. The classic <a href="https://maxroll.gg/poe/build-guides/poison-srs-necromancer-league-starter" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Poison Summon Raging Spirits</u></a> is still a great choice in 3.26.

While a bit less tanky than some of the above builds, Ice Trap is easy to get off the ground and frozen enemies can’t fight back.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you prefer mines to Traps Aer0’s <a href="https://maxroll.gg/poe/build-guides/ice-shot-of-penetration-miner-deadeye-league-starter" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Ice Shot of Penetration Deadeye</u></a> is a glass cannon screen-clearing machine.

The front is accented by glossy gold artwork, and the back is purple with "Thanos" written in large block letters across the center.</p><p>The face buttons are purple and gold (two of each), and the D-pad and triggers match the glossy gold accents. It comes with one purple stick and four gold sticks.</p></div>                      </div>   </div><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4513531-marvelcontrollers.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4513531" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4513531-marvelcontrollers.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4513531"></a><figcaption>GameSir G8 Plus Galileo</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4513531-marvelcontrollers.jpg"></figure><p>The G8 Plus is equipped with Hall Effect sticks that feel smooth and precise. Hall Effect sensors are considered "anti-drift," so they should hold up well over time. The Joy-Con 2 Controllers have ALPS sticks, and some users have already started experiencing problems with drift.</p><p>As mentioned, there are several other features that make it a compelling option for Switch 2. It has a pair of remappable back buttons, one on each side, and a traditional D-pad. The back buttons can be remapped on the controller itself or in GameSir's mobile app.</p><p>It also has a 6-axis gyroscope for motion controls and rumble motors on each side. With a more traditional controller form factor, the G8 Plus has better ergonomics than the Joy-Con 2.</p><p>The face buttons have the Xbox Controller layout, so A/B and X/Y are flipped. By default, Nintendo consoles will register the buttons <em>as they are labeled</em>, which may confuse some players. But there are two solutions to this problem. The G8 Plus has hot-swappable face buttons and sticks, allowing users to remove the faceplate, pop off the button caps, and switch their positions. If you don't want to do this every time you switch between playing on mobile and Switch 2, you can enable "Switch mode" by holding the program button (M) and A. In this mode, the Switch registers A/B and X/Y as opposites.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4513536-gamesirg8plus.png" data-ref-id="1300-4513536" data-ratio="0.558" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4513536-gamesirg8plus.png" data-ref-id="1300-4513536"></a><figcaption>GameSir G8 Plus with Nintendo Switch 2</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4513536-gamesirg8plus.png"></figure><p>Inside the box, you'll find three additional stick caps that can replace the traditional sticks that come preinstalled. The trio of alternatives includes a domed model, a tall stick for FPS games, and a short stick with a smaller cap. Speaking of FPS games, you can enable hair trigger mode, which actuates the right and left triggers with shorter pulls.</p><p>There are a couple potential downsides to keep in mind when using the G8 Plus with the Switch 2. While the grip holds the Switch 2 securely in place and has a rubberized bridge and pads on each side to help prevent scratches, it doesn't connect to the console like the Joy-Con controllers. When carrying the console around, you probably want to make sure you are holding the Switch 2 itself, not just the grip. Due to the Switch 2's size, the edges extend beyond the top and bottom of the grips, leaving them exposed. You may want to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=switch+2+protective+shell&amp;crid=2HOI563YOYZEL&amp;sprefix=switch+2+protective+shell%2Caps%2C88&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_1&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">add a protective shell to the Switch 2</a> when using the controller. Additionally, keep in mind that you will need to remove the Switch 2 from the cradle to dock it.</p><p>I often use the G8 Plus when gaming on iPhone. Platform versatility is a major perk here. It's inevitable that manufacturers will release handheld Switch 2 controllers, but it's unlikely many of them will work with other devices. So even if you wind up purchasing a different controller or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dbrands-nintendo-switch-2-killswitch-grip-is-up-for-preorder/1100-6532032/" data-ref-id="1100-6532032">adding an ergonomic grip to the console</a>, the G8 Plus doesn't need to collect dust. You can even use it as a wireless controller on Switch 2 (or Switch) when playing on your TV.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-spider-man-magic-the-gathering-trading-card-restock-amazon-preorder/1100-6529819/">Marvel's Spider-Man Magic: The Gathering Preorders Restocked At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-bogo-50-off-movie-sale-includes-brand-new-4k-blu-ray-steelbooks-box-sets/1100-6529351/">Amazon BOGO 50% Off Movie Sale Includes Brand-New 4K Steelbooks &amp; Box Sets</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-book-sale-buy-one-get-one-50-percent-off-fantasy-sci-fi-horror-novel-box-sets/1100-6527091/">Amazon B1G1 50% Off Book Sale - Popular New Novels, Box Sets, And All-Time Greats</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdo-nintendo-switch-2-controller-compatibility-how-to-guide-best-switch-2-controller-deals/1100-6532267/">8BitDo's Best Controllers Get Switch 2 Support - How To Set Them Up And Why It's A Big Deal</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-5440-page-complete-history-of-middle-earth-box-set-is-only-106-at-amazon/1100-6526926/">The 5,440-Page Complete History Of Middle Earth Box Set Is Only $106 At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-microsd-express-card-deals-nintendo-switch-2-samsung-sandisk-amazon-walmart/1100-6530578/">Walmart Has 512GB Switch 2 MicroSD Express Card For $65</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-restock-launch-week-buying-guide-major-retailers-walmart-target-best-buy/1100-6531967/">Nintendo Switch 2 Restocks - Where To Buy The New Console</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstations-dualsense-edge-ps5-controller-is-on-sale-for-its-best-price-yet/1100-6531846/">DualSense Edge PS5 Controller Drops To Best-Ever Price For Days Of Play</a></li>   </ul> </div>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is having an incredible launch, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-debuts-with-3-5-million-units-sold-in-4-days/">selling 3.5 million units</a> in just four days, and selling twice as fast as the original <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-nintendo-switch-2-is-selling-twice-as-fast-as-the-og-switch/">Nintendo Switch</a>.</p>
<p>Adding to that incredible launch, Circana analyst and executive director <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lrj7u74vi22v">Mat Piscatella just reported</a> that the Nintendo Switch 2 set a new record for launch week sales in the US, selling 1.1 million units in its first week on the US market, which beat out the previous record holder, the PlayStation 4.</p>
<p>Piscatella also reported that <strong>79%</strong> of players who bought a Switch 2 during its launch week also bought Mario Kart World, either through the console bundle or separately. Cyberpunk 2077 and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom were the next two best-selling Switch 2 games behind Mario Kart World.</p>

<p lang="en">Nintendo Switch 2 set a new all-time launch week unit sales record for video game hardware in the US, with over 1.1 million units sold during the week ending June 7, 2025 (excludes sales from the My Nintendo Store). The record was previously held by PlayStation 4.</p>

<p>Everyone expected the Switch 2's launch to be a major event for the year, but no one could have expected it to do this well so quickly. It'll be interesting to see how well sales keep pace throughout the rest of the year, and if the Switch 2 will be able to set even more records by the end of 2025.</p>
<p>While no one could have expected the Switch 2 to do this well, it's also not the biggest surprise. The new handheld has been extremely well-received by critics and fans alike. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/">In his review, Wccftech's Chris Wray wrote</a>, "<em>The Nintendo Switch 2 is an excellent console, a clear upgrade from the Switch with some clear quality of life improvements. It also feels like a more professional console, with a larger screen, crisp and clear, and the ability to run up to 4K when docked. For all its benefits, of which there are many, this will be a console to buy</em>."</p>

Tabletop studio Maestro Media and developer Supercell have announced <em>Clash of Clans: The Epic Raid</em>, which will bring the comedic tactics game to gaming tables via a Kickstarter campaign this Summer.</p>

<h2><em>Clash of Clans: The Epic Raid</em> is Coming to Kickstarter</h2>

<p>According to an official press release, <em>Clash of Clans: The Epic Raid</em> will adapt the 2012 mobile game enjoyed by millions into a rewarding strategic tactics board game. Players will build bases, deploy troops, and raid opponents in fast-paced battles designed to capture the excitement of the source material.</p>

The game will include miniatures of different <em>Clash of Clans</em> units and outposts. The map will be composed of hexagonal tiles. There is even some resource management elements used for building defenses and recruiting new units.</p>

<p>The lead designers of <em>Clash of Clans: The Epic Raid</em> are Eric M. Lang and Ken Gruhl. Lang is an award-winning board game designer who has a history of adapting beloved video game properties to the tabletop format.

With the game just a few months away from release, the development team at Gearbox Software has created a new YouTube show, Beyond the Borderlands, to chronicle its progress. And the first episode focuses on what it takes to create a memorable <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/borderlands-4-all-vault-hunters-classes-skills/2900-6583/" data-ref-id="2900-6583">vault hunter</a>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBouTQJONGw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mBouTQJONGw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"We want them to be somebody that players and ourselves can relate to," explained art director Adam May. "A comic book [hero] is frequently a good reference point for us. You want to get something that feels familiar and play as somebody [you] actually want to be in real life. It starts with the ideation of trying to define and decipher what kind of fantasies we want to build for players."</p><p>The team also explained that pitches for new vault hunters come in from all over the company, and sometimes character pitches are combined into new combinations. According to lead character designer Nick Thurston, "The guiding principle of Borderlands, just in general, is just to be badass. The abilities, the gear, everything; it all has to be the things that our community expects. They can be from any walk of life. They can bring anything to the table, but ultimately they have to be cool and they have to be fun to play."</p><p>The price for Borderlands 4 hasn't been announced yet, but Gearbox Software boss Randy Pitchford caused some controversy when he suggested that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/real-fans-will-find-a-way-to-make-it-happen-if-borderlands-4-costs-80-says-randy-pitchford/1100-6531677/" data-ref-id="1100-6531677">"real fans"</a> will find a way to come up with $80 to buy it, if it costs that much. Pitchford subsequently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-boss-says-he-didnt-mean-to-trigger-people-with-comments-on-the-price/1100-6531910/" data-ref-id="1100-6531910">walked that statement back a bit</a>.</p><p>Borderlands 4 will hit PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on September 12. A port will also be released on Nintendo Switch 2 at a later date.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Though <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-world/" data-ref-id="5000-658545">Mario Kart World</a> may be Nintendo Switch 2's headlining attraction, the most alluring part of the system's launch lineup for Olds like me is its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-gamecube-game-coming-to-switch-2s-switch-online-library/2900-6400/">GameCube library</a>. After more than 20 years, Nintendo has finally decided to crack open its vaults and bring some of GameCube's most-beloved titles to a modern console--the first time most of these games will be available officially since their original release.</p><p dir="ltr">For many, however, the excitement over GameCube titles was quickly tempered by the fact that a meager <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-will-get-gamecube-games-through-nintendo-switch-online-new-gamecube-controller/1100-6530559/">three are available at the outset</a>--the thinnest selection any Switch Online classics library has launched with. But as frustrating as it may feel to have to wait for more games to hit the service, this methodical rollout has long been an intentional strategy on Nintendo's part, and it took me many years to understand and appreciate its benefits.</p><p dir="ltr">This slow release cadence is hardly exclusive to the Switch Online service. Ever since Nintendo first established its own digital storefront with the Wii Shop, the company has been deliberately measured when re-releasing its legacy titles. In the lead up to the Wii's launch, Nintendo touted its digital shop as a repository of classics--a place where players could easily purchase the best Nintendo games of yesteryear and play them alongside new releases on one system. And indeed, by the end of the Wii's life, more than 400 had made their way to the Wii Shop, giving Wii owners access to a wealth of beloved games from years past.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4513506-6734618043-22653.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4513506" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1024" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4513506-6734618043-22653.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4513506"></a><figcaption>The biggest draw of the Wii Shop was being able to purchase games from older consoles, but Nintendo's own classics arrived sporadically.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4513506-6734618043-22653.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">That was certainly not the case at launch, however. While a selection of older games was available right from day one, the early offerings left much to be desired. The Wii Shop launched with fewer than a dozen first-party titles, most of which were Nintendo Entertainment System games from back in the 1980s and 1990s. Anyone eager to revisit a particular classic such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/" data-ref-id="5000-1272">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a> was out of luck; the only Nintendo 64 title available at the outset was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/super-mario-64/" data-ref-id="5000-2007">Super Mario 64</a>, and it would be months before more N64 games arrived.</p><p dir="ltr">This trickle of games was even more exasperating on the Wii U. After spending the previous six years steadily amassing a respectable selection of Virtual Console games on the Wii, Nintendo effectively wiped the slate clean when launching the Wii U eShop. Since the extant Virtual Console lineup was incompatible with Wii U's GamePad controller, Nintendo decided to release new versions of these games tailored specifically to the system--which meant the company once again would be building up its retro catalog from scratch.</p><p dir="ltr">To Nintendo's credit, it did take steps to mitigate the inconvenience for users. Wii owners had the option to transfer their system data--including their Virtual Console collection--to the Wii U, so customers weren't forced to buy their games a second time. The Wii Shop was still accessible on the new console as well, although it was nested within the separate Wii menu. Thus, any games purchased from it (or transferred over from a Wii) had to live within a separate user interface and could not take advantage of Wii U features like off-TV play. Even more notably, Nintendo also offered an upgrade path for returning users. If you previously purchased a Virtual Console game on the Wii, you could <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wii-u-virtual-console-getting-n64-and-nintendo-ds-/1100-6426337/">upgrade to the Wii U version</a> of the same title for a small fee.</p><p dir="ltr">As welcome as these steps were, however, they were once again undermined by Nintendo's slow release schedule. The Wii U eShop launched with <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/nintendo-announces-launch-lineup-for-virtual-console-on-wii-u/" rel="nofollow ">just eight Virtual Console games</a>, the biggest of which was Super NES launch title <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/super-mario-world/" data-ref-id="5000-3700">Super Mario World</a>. It would take another several months for other classics like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-a-link-to-the-past/" data-ref-id="5000-4617">The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/super-metroid/" data-ref-id="5000-17693">Super Metroid</a> to hit the storefront, while N64 games wouldn't arrive until <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wii-u-virtual-console-getting-n64-and-nintendo-ds-/1100-6426337/" data-ref-id="1100-6426337">two years later</a>. Nintendo did ramp up the rate of releases as the Wii U struggled to gain traction, and the eShop eventually offered Game Boy Advance, DS, and even Wii titles, giving it an even broader range of Nintendo classics than the Wii Shop ever boasted. Still, the paltry early lineup, coupled with Wii U's frequent software droughts, made the wait for a particular game excruciating.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4513509-4972425557-maxre.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4513509" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4513509-4972425557-maxre.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4513509"></a><figcaption>Game Boy Advance games didn't start hitting the Wii U eShop until a year after the system's first Virtual Console titles launched.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4513509-4972425557-maxre.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Given this history, then, it was not unexpected to see Nintendo continue this strategy on the Switch. With the advent of the Switch Online service, the company has opted to take a different approach to repackaging its legacy games, offering players access to a growing library of them for a subscription fee rather than selling each title individually on the eShop. But though the delivery model may be different, the pace of releases remains just as languid.</p><p dir="ltr">Early adopters had to endure a lengthy wait before the first Nintendo classics appeared on the system. The Switch Online service did not launch until 2018, more than a year after the Switch itself hit the market, and the only titles available at the outset were, once again, NES games. It would take several more years for Nintendo to gradually introduce SNES and Game Boy libraries to the base Switch Online service, while a premium Switch Online + Expansion Pack plan launched in 2021 and offered N64, Sega Genesis, and eventually Game Boy Advance titles as well.</p><p dir="ltr">As frustrating as it has been to see Nintendo repeat this slow rollout, its advantages have become much clearer in the Switch era. Most obviously, Nintendo often uses classic games to fill in any gaps in its release calendar. While titles are added to Switch Online fairly regularly, the company likes to trot out a particularly beloved game when there is little else on the way to the console, ensuring users remain engaged even during quieter months. The wait between releases is also more bearable when there's a library of other titles to sample in the meantime. A curio like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/devil-world/" data-ref-id="5000-12883">Devil World</a> may not be attractive enough on its own to convince someone to plunk down $5, but it's much more enticing to try when it's part of a service you are already paying for.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="985580638" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

savor each of these titles for the classics they are. With the sheer number of games available to play nowadays (and the increasing prominence of subscription services offering access to them), many publishers and platform holders have come to treat gaming as disposable entertainment. By overwhelming their audience with options, companies are implicitly encouraging players to only dabble in a game and then move on to the next whenever the fancy strikes. This inexhaustible array of choices means few users actually play a game to completion before their attention is diverted to another one. In contrast, by doling out only a handful of legacy games every month, Nintendo positions each as a noteworthy release in its own right, while also giving players ample time to experience it before more arrive.</p><p dir="ltr">This is especially relevant for GameCube games. Whereas NES and even SNES titles can often be completed in a handful of hours, N64 and GameCube games are much closer in depth and duration to modern titles and require a much more significant time investment to play. Many can take more than 20 hours to finish, which makes Nintendo's decision to space them apart a boon to players. As eager as I am to revisit <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fire-emblem-path-of-radiance/" data-ref-id="5000-20450">Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</a> for the first time in two decades when it eventually joins the service, it's been nice to leisurely devote my attention to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-the-wind-waker/" data-ref-id="5000-3301">The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</a>--the only single-player adventure currently in Switch Online's GameCube lineup--in the interim.</p><p dir="ltr">Although it's undoubtedly still aggravating to wait for a particular favorite to hit the service, Nintendo's methodical drip-feed of classics has its merits. By meting out its legacy games gradually, Nintendo gives players enough time to properly delve into and appreciate them, which in turn preserves the allure of these games and makes their eventual arrival feel like a significant occasion. More than other publishers, Nintendo understands the value of its vast back catalog and treats it with the reverence and care these titles deserve. And unlike on Wii and Wii U, there's no shortage of other games to tide fans over while they wait for their favorite classic to arrive.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-more-than-doubles-sonys-previous-steam-ccu-record-for-single-player-games/">Stellar Blade</a> has been a huge success for its independent developer, Shift Up, which was previously a mobile game developer before it embarked on making a triple-A action game. With a sequel confirmed to be on the way, and Shift Up still working on the mobile series that helped grow the studio in the first place, the future should be incredibly bright for Shift Up.</p>
<p>And it largely still is, but some of the company's investors are fearful that Shift Up could lose its independence, putting a fog over the future of the studio and its current path. According to a report from the South Korean publication <a href="https://g-enews.com/article/ICT/2025/04/202504141448301089c5fa75ef86_1">Global Economic</a> (spotted by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/stellar-blade-studio-shift-ups-independence-at-risk-due-to-tencent-ties-investors-fear/">Automaton</a>), Shift Up's investors are concerned with how narrow the split is between Shift Up chief executive officer Hyung-Tae Kim's shares and Tencent's.</p>
<p>Hyung-Tae Kim currently owns 39% of the studio, while Tencent is just under 5% behind him, owning 34.58% of Shift Up. The concern is that Tencent could overtake Hyung-Tae Kim by buying up more shares, and combined with the fact that Tencent is the company Shift Up works with to publish its mobile games, the studio could lose its power to make decisions for itself.</p>
<p>Tencent has been making strategic investments in companies across the video game industry for years now, with their fingers in the pies of studios like <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tencent-subsidiary-focus-on-narrative-driven-live-service-mobile-games/">Ubisoft</a>,<a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-is-getting-a-e15-million-loan-from-tencent/"> Remedy</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-china-tencent/">Epic Games</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-become-funcoms-largest-single-shareholder/">Funcom</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-has-increased-its-stake-in-fromsoftware-parent-company-kadokawa-edging-closer-to-sonys-share/">FromSoftware's parent company Kadokawa</a>. In the case of Riot Games, Tencent outright <a href="http://wccftech.com/tencent-buys-the-rest-of-riot-games-owns-league-of-legends-maker-outright/">bought the studio after consistently increasing its stake</a>.</p>
<p>It's still too early to tell if Shift Up is in real trouble of being acquired by Tencent, but considering that Tencent is a key factor in Shift Up's revenue through the studio's mobile games, and how close Tencent is to being the studio's largest shareholder, it does feel like Tencent is primed to add Shift Up to its internal portfolio of studios.</p>

<p>"Sometimes I like to just say, 'Get it done. Do it dirty. Do it the way we used to do it!" Weber said.</p><p>This development philosophy worked out for the studio, as The Witcher 3 sold <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-best-selling-video-games-of-all-time/2900-4814/#10" data-ref-id="2900-4814">more than 60 million copies</a> and is one of the top 10 best-selling video games of all time. For The Witcher 4, Weber said CD Projekt aims to "do justice" to the franchise's story history by trying to retain what made The Witcher 3's development special. But the Polish studio is also trying new things.</p><p>"There are [also] new questions we want to answer, because this is supposed to feel like a true sequel, not just redoing what we did before. And I think it's really [about] trying to have that healthy mix of moving forward and also trying out some new things," Weber explained.</p><p>The Witcher 4 doesn't have a release date yet, but it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-4-release-date-is-not-soon-as-dev-discusses-why-it-wont-use-genai/1100-6530369/" data-ref-id="1100-6530369">not expected to launch until 2027 at the soonest.</a> It's one of multiple games in development now at CD Projekt. Some of the others include <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6526333/" data-ref-id="1100-6526333">Cyberpunk 2</a>, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-remake-everything-we-know-about-the-open-world-remake-of-the-classic-rpg/1100-6528839/" data-ref-id="1100-6528839">remake of the original Witcher</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-dev-partners-with-pokemon-go-owner-for-a-new-game-based-on-its-ip/1100-6530370/" data-ref-id="1100-6530370">a game produced in partnership with Saudi Arabia. </a></p><p>The Witcher 4 focuses its story on Ciri, and this has generated some amount of debate and controversy. Some people are calling the game "woke," but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-4-is-not-woke-for-starring-ciri-geralt-voice-actor-says/1100-6531680/" data-ref-id="1100-6531680">Geralt's voice actor has slammed these critics.</a> In other news, a new tech demo for the game debuted recently, and while it looked very impressive, the developers want people to know <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-tech-demo-wasnt-actually-the-game-says-cd-projekt-red/1100-6532043/" data-ref-id="1100-6532043">it wasn't actually the game.</a></p>

			<p>KRAFTON revealed that inZOI, the life simulation game that <a href="https://wccftech.com/inzoi-eclipses-1-million-copies-sold-in-its-first-week/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">debuted</a> a few months ago in early access, has received its official ModKit update. Users can now <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/inzoi-modkit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">download</a> the tool via the Epic Games Store to craft and share mods.</p>
<p>The ModKit includes official plugins for the 3D design tools Maya and Blender, making it easier to create custom 3D assets. Players can upload their mods to CurseForge, a modding community platform operated by Overwolf, where they can be saved as separate files and shared freely.</p>
<p>Last month, KRAFTON announced plans to update inZOI’s modding features in three stages throughout the year. Alongside the inZOI ModKit, the update that's now live introduces modding tools for outfit sets and furniture and a data editor to simplify the editing of game data. The September update will introduce modding features for character appearances, architectural elements, and interaction-based content. Lastly, the December update will empower players to create deeper and more diverse content by enabling them to edit scripts and access localization tools.</p>
<p>To bolster the inZOI modding ecosystem, KRAFTON is hosting two global contests this month. In collaboration with CurseForge, the 'Next Top Modder' hackathon will be open from 19 June to 1 August, with modders competing for a share of $11,000 and a chance to have their creations featured as official in-game content. Categories include Best Dress Set, Best Furniture Mod, Community Favorite, and Most Mods Submitted.</p>
<p>KRAFTON is also collaborating with CONNECT, a 3D fashion creator platform operated by CLO Virtual Fashion, to launch the ‘Every Style Starts with You’ outfit design contest, also running from 19 June to 1 August. 15 winning entries will eventually be selected, with up to $26,200 in prizes available. The contest invites creators to design complete outfits, with categories including Ready-to-Wear, Fun &amp; Playful Designs, and Conceptual Outfits inspired by fantasy worlds and imaginative storytelling.</p>

<p>CEO CH Kim stated:</p>
<p><em>With the inZOI ModKit update, we’ve laid the groundwork for players to take the lead in shaping the game’s narrative. We will continue to make updates to the game based on various player feedback.</em></p>
<p>The developers haven't planned any Steam Workshop integration for the time being. However, they may reconsider the feature depending on community demand.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/elden-ring-board-game-realm-of-grafted-king-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Combining open world exploration and challenging combat, the Tarnished can rise and take on <em>Elden Ring the Board Game:&nbsp;Realm of the Grafted King</em>. But does it capture the feel of the lauded video game? We enter the&nbsp;Lands Between to find out.</p>

<p><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/elden-ring-review" rel="nofollow">Elden Ring</a> is probbbaly one of the greatest video games of all time, and for the last few years, Steamforged Games have been capturing the feel of video game IPs on the tabletop, including <a href="https://techraptor.net/originals/video-to-tabletop-resident-evil-2-board-game" rel="nofollow">Resident Evil</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/day-with-monster-hunter-world-iceborne-board-game" rel="nofollow">Monster Hunter</a>, and <em>Dark Souls</em>, which got a <a href="https://techraptor.net/originals/video-to-tabletop-part-2-board-game-dark-souls-board-game" rel="nofollow">board game</a>, and a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dark-souls-card-game-review-pick-class-shuffle-cards-and-prepare-to-die" rel="nofollow">card game</a> (which is still one of my favorite games of all time). The <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dark-souls" rel="nofollow">Dark Souls</a> video game is developed by FromSoftware, also the creators of the <em>Elden Ring</em> video game, so it was only natural that Steamforged Games picked that up, and after a successful Kickstarter, it's now heading to retail.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-the-board-game-2.jpg?itok=v1ma7O2x 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-the-board-game-2.jpg?itok=wkVSRkjl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Elden Ring the Board Game: Realm of the Grafted King</em> contains a huge amount of content.</figcaption></figure><h2>Opening A Monster&nbsp;</h2>

<p>The first thing you'll notice about <i>Elden Ring the Board Game: Realm of the Grafted King </i>is the size of the box (other smaller sets are available, and we discuss those below). Realm of the Grafted King is a mammoth box, and not just because of the number of miniatures it contains (which is substantial in number, 54, and the size of some of them), but the wealth of paper material that's also inside, including 1227 cards, and 6 books (1 rulebook, 1 scenario book and 4 encounter books).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite the scale of the box, getting into your first game isn't as daunting as it appears, which for new players is considerable (but there's a better entry point if you're brand new to board games, and we discuss below). Opening the box for the first time, there are several card decks to sort and the rulebook to read, but the actual setup simply involves gathering the components for each player's chosen character (in RofGL there are 4 choices) and then you open the scenario book at the Stranded Graveyard and the game begins.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-the-board-game-5.jpg?itok=LIwxZE6U 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-the-board-game-5.jpg?itok=JSmA-BM- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Each&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring the Board Game: Realm of the Grafted King </em>character starts with a class ability, and weapons that set your characters combat deck.</figcaption></figure><h2>Welcome To The Lands Between</h2>

<p><i>Elden Ring the Board Game: Realm of the Grafted King</i>, and all the other sets have 5 different types of gameplay. The game starts with the narrative, where players read through the scenario book and make decisions. Those familiar with the <em>Fighting Fantasy</em> books of old will feel nostalgic, but this also takes the place of a Games Master who usually controls the narrative in roleplaying games (or app, as so many digital hybrid board games are starting to take on).</p>

<p>The bulk of<em> Elden Ring the Board Game</em> gameplay is split between exploration, where players slowly build a map made up of hex pieces where they can interact with non-player characters, narrative elements, and enter combat areas, which make up the rest of the gameplay. Combat is split between dungeons, where the Tarnished work their way through enemies until they face a boss, gauntlet, where players face waves of enemies and also boss battles, where players take on powerful enemies.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-the-board-game-8.jpg?itok=Wn2kqBu_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-the-board-game-8.jpg?itok=AtYcLlSi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Enemies in&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring the Board Game: Realm of the Grafted King</em> have fixed attacks, unique even among those of the same type, and bosses have multiple attacks in a unique combat deck.</figcaption></figure><p>The combat in <em>Elden Ring the Board Game </em>is entirely diceless, and instead uses cards to randomise combat (and other tests). Attribute cards contain symbols from 5 attributes, and when a test is required, it will detail how many points each attribute is worth, or the effect gained on a combat card. During combat, players also use an individual combat deck, which is made up of cards indicated by their Tarnished's equipped weapons. This allows you to tailor your combat deck to suit your play style with the weapons and items that you find.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-the-board-game-7.jpg?itok=qw0POuge 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-the-board-game-7.jpg?itok=l1Wod9Ap 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Combat in&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring the Board Game: Realm of the Grafted King</em> takes place on grid maps, and attacks target areas depending on the character and enemy positioning.</figcaption></figure><p>All combat takes place on battlefield grids made up of 1 or more of the Encounter Books (my first fight using all 4 books was a very exciting moment). These grids have combat lanes, which, depending on the position of your miniature, can target specific areas in the enemy grid. There are also 3 different rows for the player characters, with different effects depending on where they are positioned. Right at the front of the grid, head-on to the enemy, allows players to draw 2 cards from their attribute deck when making attacks, choosing which they use for maximum attack potential. The centre lane allows them to move their initiative card, gaining an element of control on when they act during the turn, and the furthest lane back allows you to draw 2 cards when making a defensive action, choosing the card with the best attributes for your defense.</p>

<p>Enemy attacks are also handled by cards, and each enemy has a unique card, unique even between those of the same type, which lists their behaviors for movement and attacks. Bosses have their own deck of attacks and attack multiple times each turn.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-the-board-game-6.jpg?itok=pmO0Enpw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-the-board-game-6.jpg?itok=s0vo6GK5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Prophet in&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring the Board Game: Realm of the Grafted King</em> starts with the Finger Seal and Rickey Shield, and the 10 cards that form that combination's combat deck.</figcaption></figure><h2>Rise Tarnished</h2>

<p>Each <em>Elden Ring The Board Game c</em>ore set has different Tarnished characters to play (we discuss the different sets below), and<em> Elden Ring the Board Game: Realm of the Grafted King </em>includes the following:</p>

<ul><li>Astrologer - This class likes to&nbsp;chain attacks together for combination bonuses</li>
	<li>Prophet - Has healing abilities, but also starts with the highest damage-dealing card out of the starting characters</li>
	<li>Samurai - An agile fighter, most cards allow them to move and strike</li>
	<li>Vagabond - A defensive fighter who can shove enemies to reposition them for effective attacks</li>
</ul><p>Each character starts with a weapon and shield, which have their own combat decks, their own unique attributes deck, a class feature, and a unique quest to set them off on their campaign.</p>

<p>During the campaign, after each scenario, players can buy new weapons, armor, talismans, trait, and attribute cards (buying and equipping new weapons and armor also changes the combat deck), or they can upgrade weapons and attach memories to cards, which add spell cards to your combat deck.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-the-board-game-4.jpg?itok=MVYsgwO7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-the-board-game-4.jpg?itok=7tM_y81a 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Elden Ring the Board Game: Realm of the Grafted King </em>comes with 4 encounter books, which have the combat play mats and can be combined for larger maps.</figcaption></figure><h2>Guiding Light</h2>

<p>As you might have guessed from the contents of <em>Elden Ring the Board Game: Realm of the Grafted King</em>, it offers a significant playtime out of this box. Each scenario takes around an hour, with some stretching a little longer depending on player choices while they're exploring, which sets you up for over 50 hours to finish the campaign. There's replayability out of the box as well, with the 4 different characters to explore, different builds for them to make, and the exploration map will look different each time too.</p>

<p>Realm of the Grafted King can also be combined with other sets. There are 2 other core sets,&nbsp;Weeping Peninsula and&nbsp;Stormveil Castle, which have smaller campaigns, but still contain 4 player classes to choose from. Both of these boxes include 2 new classes, and 2 that are already included in Realm of the Grafted King. Those duplicates contain a unique sculpt, and come with different class quests and starting decks for a different experience.</p>

<p>All 3 of the core sets can be combined, or played independently, but there are also additional add-on sets,&nbsp;Limgrave Depths,&nbsp;Erdtree Avatar, and&nbsp;Flying Dragon Agheel that add new rules and enemies to your games, but they can only be added to the Realm of the Grafted King set.</p>

<p><em>Elden Ring:&nbsp;Weeping Peninsula</em> is the ideal starting point for anyone who's new to board games and is looking to pick this up because they're an <em>Elden Ring</em> video game fan. Which can then be combined with Realm of the Grafted King, reviewed here, and additional sets for extra content. If you like what you've read here, and want to just get straight into the longest campaign, then Realm of the Grafted King won't disappoint.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-the-board-game-3.jpg?itok=-QsELwS9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-the-board-game-3.jpg?itok=SaN9wAQm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>2 other&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring the Board Game</em> sets are available, both can be played seperately or combined with each other.</figcaption></figure>

<p><em>Elden Ring the Board Game: Realm of the Grafted King </em>is a monster of a game in size and depth. It opts for sheer volume of content over the app control that many games are starting to take on. The blending of narrative and exploration is done well, and while combat is challenging (bosses are very challenging), it feels rewarding, and the combat and attribute deck that you can customise over the game are particularly well done. This box, RotGK, will be quite daunting for a brand-new tabletop player, and they should probably look to start their <em>Elden Ring</em> tabletop journey with Weeping Peninsula instead.</p>

<p>Each of the 4 player classes feels unique and offers a different experience, and the game plays well solo, or up to 4 players, I had the best experience playing solo, with 2 characters (samurai of course and astrologer) to get the blending of abilities, but being able to play through the game and experience the campaign my way. Despite the huge box size, there does feel like there's a lot more to explore in the Lands Between. We're only touching the surface in terms of weapons, class builds, enemies, and areas in <em>Elden Ring the Board Game</em>, and I hope that we get more.</p>

                <p>Sony has shared a new report with investors that touts PlayStation 5's marketplace gains and the continued expansion of PlayStation Plus' subscriber base. The latter has been so successful at adding users to the highest subscription tiers that Sony is already considering a price increase for PS Plus "to maximize profitability."</p><p>Following the release of <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/business_segment_meeting/pdf/2025/GNS_E.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the report online</a>, Sony Interactive Entertainment president and CEO Hideaki Nishino appeared on a <a href="https://www.irwebmeeting.com/sony/vod/20250613/x8R5srwN/bsm_02_en/1_GNS/fireside_chat/index.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">fireside chat</a> and spelled out that the only direction for PlayStation Plus pricing is up.</p><p>"The PlayStation Plus service offers great value for our players, and we will continue to add more value and adjust our pricing strategy in a dynamic way to maximize profitability," said Nishino.</p><p>Currently, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps-plus/" rel="noopener noreferrer">PS Plus</a>'s Premium tier costs $160 per year in the US, while the Extra costs $135 and the Essential costs $80.</p><p>Nishino's statement came after Sony's presentation indicated that 38% of all PlayStation Plus subscribers opted for the top two tiers, Premium and Extra. Furthermore, the percentage of PS Plus subscribers on the Extra tier increased from 16% to 22% from Sony's 2022 fiscal year to its 2024 fiscal year. In that same period, PlayStation Plus Premium subscribers rose from 13% to 17% of all PS Plus users.</p><p>Nishino noted that Sony would "add more value" to PS Plus subscriptions to justify increasing the price. It's unclear exactly what that might entail, especially since Sony has steered away from following Game Pass' path of dropping AAA games on the service on day one.</p><p>As recently as last April, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-plus-prices-have-increased-in-certain-regions-but-not-the-us/1100-6530919/" data-ref-id="1100-6530919">Sony raised PS Plus prices</a> in several countries, while sparing the US from any immediate increase. Players in North America may not be so lucky next time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686128/splatoon-3-switch-2-update-overview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/16/24075342/splatoon-3-family-bonding">Splatoon 3</a> </em>already looked phenomenal on the original Switch, in a way that seemed to defy the console’s hardware limitations. The game’s paint-slicked visuals were gorgeous, and its chaotic battles were a testament to how well the Switch could run software that was fine-tuned to make the best of its specs. What was most impressive, though, was the way <em>Splatoon 3 </em>kept refreshing itself for years after its initial 2022 release with a steady stream of new clothes, weapons, stages, and a nifty DLC expansion.</p><p><em>Splatoon 3 </em>felt like it had reached its zenith on the original Switch — so much so that a full-on sequel seemed like the franchise’s logical next step as Nintendo prepared to release the Switch 2. But thanks to an unexpected update, <em>Splatoon 3 </em>plays like a slicker, sleeker, and more modern shooter on the new console. And while the improvements aren’t quite as dramatic as what we saw with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/fortnite/681222/fortnite-nintendo-switch-2-hands-on"><em>Fortnite</em></a>, they’re big enough to make <em>Splatoon 3 </em>feel like it’s more than capable of holding down the fort while Nintendo focuses on developing whatever’s next.</p><p>While battles within <em>Splatoon 3 </em>have always maxed out at 60fps, the first thing that jumps out about the game post-update is how that high framerate can now also be seen basically everywhere you guide your Inkling character. In the past, nonmatch locations like Splatsville, Inkopolis, and the Grand Festival Grounds never looked bad, per se. But there was a roughness to characters’ animations as they walked around and a stiffness to the way the environment moved that made those places feel like they were trying hard to not push the original Switch past its limits. </p><p>After the new Switch 2 update, which also bumps the game’s resolution up, everything in Inkopolis flows with a delightful slickness that makes the place feel alive. Inklings’ steps and idling poses are still measured and slow, but there is a gracefulness to them now that made me pay closer attention to people’s avatars. And while the update doesn’t bring any drastic changes to <em>Splatoon 3</em>’s character models, you can clearly see the fine details of their stylish hypebeast fits and the way light interacts with the glossy, reflective surfaces of their skin.</p><p>Better-looking NPCs hanging out in lobbies might not seem like a big deal, but it’s an important part of the <em>Splatoon </em>experience because of the way most of the characters you see in places like Inkopolis are actually other players’ avatars. The added visual polish works to remind you that <em>Splatoon</em> <em>3</em> is very much a community-focused game that still has a dedicated playerbase, and as I walked around, it was great seeing so many higher-resolution characters sharing messages about how they were enjoying the update.</p><p>You can also feel how much more horsepower the Switch 2 is working with in how quickly <em>Splatoon 3 </em>now breezes through its loading screens as you’re getting ready to dive into a match. Once you’re actually in a battle, you can really start to get a sense of how the update impacts <em>Splatoon 3</em>’s core gameplay on the Switch 2 and why, for people still playing on the original Switch, Nintendo decided to strip out some of the background visual elements in certain competitive modes.</p><p>On the whole, regular PvP matches ran every bit as well at 60fps as they did on the first Switch, but you can see that background elements in the far off distance, like the jellyfish spectators, now move much more smoothly. It stands to reason that Nintendo chose not to drastically change how <em>Splatoon 3 </em>battles run on the Switch 2 so as not to put players on the original Switch at an unfair disadvantage. That’s also probably why, after the update, some of the background elements in the Splat Zones / Tower Control /Rainmaker / Clam Blitz modes have been removed on the first Switch. In my experience, this didn’t really change all that much because you’re meant to be focused on painting the ground and splatting your enemies. But those changes likely help the Switch dedicate more of its energy to displaying the important things well.</p><p>Even when there’s a horde of enemies swarming in Salmon Run mode, their animations are much, much smoother, which actually makes it easier to keep track of what’s going on as matches become more hectic. It was still almost impossible to get my teammates to pull it together when a Horrorboros showed up and started hurling paint bombs at us, but that felt like the sort of issue that might be more easily addressed in a follow-up game that makes use of the <em>Switch 2</em>’s voice chat feature.</p><p>For both consoles, the update also introduces a slew of remixed weapons. Giving standard weapons, like the Aerospray, different sub-weapons has always been a core part of <em>Splatoon</em>, and the new kits are essentially an invitation to try out your old favorites with a couple of new tricks attached that encourage unique play styles.For longtime <em>Splatoon 3 </em>players, everything about the update really serves as a reminder of how much fun the game has always been. But it also feels like Nintendo is making an effort to bring more players into the fold ahead of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/684199/splatoon-raiders-switch-2-spinoff"><em>Splatoon Raiders</em>’ launch</a>. And, as nice as it would have been to have a new <em>Splatoon </em>title for the Switch 2’s launch, it’s fantastic to see Nintendo making moves that benefit the entire Switch family as a whole.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/summer-game-fest-los-angeles-protests-ice-immigration-police<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The summer sun beams as a crowd, walking in something that would resemble a line if observed from outer space, snakes down a Los Angeles street. It’s so long that I can’t see its beginning or end. As far as my tired eyes can tell, it just goes and goes until, off in the distance, it meets the horizon. Some people carry signs lambasting ICE and Nazis; one has Hello Kitty waving a Palestinian flag on it. Other protesters run the gamut from looking like they stopped here on their way to brunch to wearing full costumes. There is a Labubu cosplayer holding an anti-ICE sign atop a bridge. Social media <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ruemcclammyhand.bsky.social/post/3lr4zldank22c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quickly declares them a hero</a>.</p><p>The scene is one of tense revelry. Resistance moms, 2020-hardened black bloc types, and everyone in between share space, sometimes chanting, sometimes singing, sometimes marching in silence – all aware that cops lurk on the periphery, and that with cops comes violence. Suddenly, we all hear a loud popping sound far away enough that we can’t quite pinpoint it. An acquaintance checks their phone; apparently the police just deployed tear gas.&nbsp;</p><p>I check my phone, too. Oh no, I realize, I have to leave. For my video game appointment.</p><p>I turn to tell the friend I accompanied to this immense Sunday, June 8 protest, a games journalist I will not name because they were out marching during work hours. “Me too,” they reply. “I’ve got one in, like, 40 minutes.”</p><figure><blockquote><p>Oh no, I realize, I have to leave. For my video game appointment.</p></blockquote></figure><p>There’s no calling a car in the kind of traffic these teeming streets have produced, so I resolve to run back to the site of Summer Game Fest’s Play Days event, a bonanza of demos and meeting opportunities meant to be a smaller stand-in for what E3 once was. Fortunately, the venue is only a little over a mile away from the still-swelling crowd, so I narrowly make it in time for my scheduled presentation of Capcom’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-impressions-preview-souls-orbs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Onimusha: Way Of The Sword</em></a> and <em>Resident Evil 9</em>. I am drenched in sweat, clothes clinging to me like I just emerged from a swimming pool. This attracts a few stares, but the problem solves itself when I’m escorted into a cool, dark theater occupied by around 30 other games journalists and content creators.&nbsp;</p><p>But the whiplash is impossible to ignore. Where the last crowd I was part of whooped and hollered in defense of their rights and the rights of others, this one goes positively apeshit for a menu option. The <em>Resident Evil 9</em> demo, an understated affair that centers around a tall monster woman <a href="https://screenrant.com/resident-evil-village-lady-dimitrescu-simulation-stepped-on/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">perhaps pointedly</a> engineered to look <em>un</em>-hot, ends with the player pausing the game and switching from first-person – the viewpoint of the last couple mainline series entries – to third-person. The crowd goes wild. I feel like I’m on a different planet than I was less than an hour ago.&nbsp;</p><p>Welcome to Summer Game Fest. Also, American society is collapsing, so welcome to that, too.</p><hr><p>Sunday afternoon develops a predictable rhythm: I play a game. I check my phone. I play another game. I check my phone. I play a third game. I check my phone. Police, I learn from local reporters on Bluesky and Hasan Piker’s stream, have turned the chill, at times downright joyful march I was part of into a battleground. Using flashbangs, tear gas, and vehicles, they kettle protesters onto a highway. Reporters and protesters <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/melbuer.bsky.social/post/3lr2in7bowc2l" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sustain grievous injuries</a> from “less lethal” weapons, which crucially – even according to their own designation – remain at least situationally lethal. Protesters call automated Waymo cars <a href="https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/the-weaponization-of-waymo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to light on fire</a>, which is incredibly funny.&nbsp;</p><p>Summer Game Fest is just far away enough from the action that those desperate sounds don’t reach our ears, but the helicopters buzzing overhead certainly do. After a certain point, they become a background noise it would be easy to tune out if not for what they represent: a government, derelict of duty, surveilling and attacking its own people.</p><p>As afternoon fades to early evening, I sit down to try out a <em>John Wick</em>/kung-fu movie-inspired action game called <em>Spine</em>. The game is rough around the edges, but its action is stylish and propulsive, while everything else about it harks back to 2009 in a way that makes me question how it’s getting made today (complimentary). Moreover, the enthusiasm of its Cyprus-based dev team is infectious. Midway through the demo, they tell me about the game’s world and story.</p><p>"It's kind of dystopian, and this city [where the game takes place] is completely messed up,” says community lead Artur Ovchinnikov. “It's controlled by a big corporation called Tenzer Corp, and the head of the corporation is some kind of... artificial intelligence, but government system. There is a social rating system. [The government] is controlling every [person], every movement. There is a gap between rich people and poor people. But in the beginning of the game [main character] Redline doesn't care about this thing. She's trying to rescue her brother. She doesn't care about all these social problems in this city, but the deeper she gets into the mission of rescuing her brother, the deeper she gets into this rebellious stuff."</p><figure><figcaption>Aftermath</figcaption></figure><p>This is far from the only time that I’ve heard about games exploring eerily relevant themes; not just recently, but today. During <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPa7KaQXp8g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft’s SGF-adjacent showcase</a>, a trailer for sci-fi puzzle adventure <em>Planet Of Lana II</em> began with its young protagonist explaining how “they came to our home” and “took everyone” as ships that resembled bombs rain from the sky. On Bluesky, musician and video game critic <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ellaguro.bsky.social/post/3lr4hftacys2n" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Liz Ryerson</a> acknowledged the elephant in the room: “I hope we are all not so desensitized that we can all appreciate the irony of Xbox showing off games that look like this in their showcase given why a lot of people are not watching this stream,” she wrote.</p><p>Despite the pro-Palestinian Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement’s ongoing <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-bds-games-journalism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">boycott of Xbox products</a> – which has resulted in one studio <a href="https://aftermath.site/ice-water-games-tenderfoot-tactics-xbox-store-removed-bds" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pulling its game from the Xbox store</a> entirely – millions still watched Microsoft’s film-length video game commercial. But <a href="https://aftermath.site/at-this-years-game-awards-nobody-won" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as with previous Keighley carnivals</a>, each time games’ themes hit a little too close to home without acknowledging the broader context in which they exist, the disconnect becomes harder and harder to ignore. (I would’ve liked to ask Microsoft developers for their thoughts on this uncomfortable tension, but even after repeated requests, Microsoft did not allow me to attend its event.)</p><p>All this in mind, I decide to ask <em>Spine</em>’s developers what they think of the situation unfolding around them in LA, a clear instance of the exact sort of government overreach and class division they pride themselves on exploring in their game. This question is not met with enthusiasm.&nbsp;</p><p>"That's a tough question," art director Alexander Nemov replies awkwardly, adding that he hasn't spent much time in America. "Probably I don't have anything in the moment."</p><hr><p>After SGF winds down for the day, I attempt to rejoin the protest. This proves impossible; night has fallen, and cops have blocked the streets leading to the bulk of the crowd. Displaced protesters find themselves in uneasy across-the-way staring contests with armed and armored officers. Meanwhile, lines of police cars blare their sirens while blasting to some unknown destination, their irritating mechanical shrieks only drowned out by protest supporters sporadically driving by in their own vehicles, honking horns and hoisting flags. Eventually, I elect to call it a night.</p><p>Just a few streets over, I once again feel like I’m inhabiting a different planet. Despite what right-wing and even centrist media might tell you, Los Angeles has not descended into chaos. To take it a step further, neither has <em>downtown </em>Los Angeles, the mere slice of the gargantuan pie that is southern California’s best-known region where protests are taking place. “Fuck ICE” graffiti and the odd person carrying a sign advocating a similar message aside, you would not know that this place was the site of what Trump and his cronies are trying to deem an <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-trump-accuses-some-los-angeles-protesters-of-being-paid-insurrectionists" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">insurrection</a>. People meander between bars, restaurants, and other destinations. Cars drive by at normal speeds and refrain from honking their horns. A dude on a bike asks some alt kids who are walking behind me if they’re in a band. They laugh.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Aftermath</figcaption></figure><p>Keighley’s show must go on, for he is the oddly wooden impresario fate has chosen to give us a WORLD EXCLUSIVE preview of the sinking of the Titanic, but it never feels like SGF is in real danger of grinding to a halt.&nbsp;</p><p>The next day, while wandering the Summer Game Fest show floor, which is really more of a big room in a small village of kiosks, cafes, and food trucks, I overhear a telling conversation between PR people.&nbsp;</p><p>“[The protests] are just far enough that it doesn’t really affect anything,” says one.</p><p>“Affect <em>anything</em>?” replies another.</p><p>“Affect… the show,” the first clarifies.&nbsp;</p><hr><p>That’s not to say it’s easy to just ignore the protests amassing nearby each day, nor does it seem like many developers attending Summer Game Fest want to. While I ask a fair number how they’re feeling about the situation, the topic comes up organically more often than not. Some want to know what being in the thick of a protest was like. Others volunteer information about the small ways daily demonstrations escalated by police into violent confrontations have impacted them. For example, one journalist shows me how both the Lime and Bird scooter apps have placed heavy restrictions on an area that includes SGF due to protesters’ proclivity for throwing scooters at cop cars, which – as with the Waymo situation – I must point out is incredibly funny.</p><p>But the overriding sentiment SGF attendees feel the need to convey, as though it’s a weight threatening to cave in their chests, is guilt. Multiple PR people repeatedly lament that they can’t make it out into the streets because of job obligations. The aforementioned journalist tells me that they at least donate money to relevant causes. Another journalist concurs with a statement they heard while drinking and networking in the nearby JW Marriott hotel lobby the night before: “We’re the bad guys in <em>The Hunger Games</em>.” They go on to add that they believe SGF attendees are doing “a lot of fiddling while Rome burns.”</p><figure><blockquote><p>I think for me, though, guilt's maybe not quite the right word. Maybe something more like confusion, frustration. What do I do? What can I do?</p></blockquote></figure><p>Asked directly about the awkward middle ground they’ve unwittingly wandered into, a few developers eschew guilt in favor of pragmatism.</p><p>"Whatever gets you going and pushes you into action, if guilt is what does it, sure. Feel what you're gonna feel,” says Alx Preston, founder of <em>Hyper Light Drifter</em>, <em>Hyper Light Breaker</em>, and <em>Possessors </em>studio Heart Machine. “I think for me, though, guilt's maybe not quite the right word. Maybe something more like confusion, frustration. What do I do? What can I do? What should I be doing because I have a responsibility to the team, the company, the things we've been working on for a long time, everyone else that works at Heart Machine.”</p><p>Preston contends with health issues that limit his physical capabilities. Still, he can’t help but feel a responsibility to the city that molded him.</p><p>"I think there's some idea there, especially as someone who's lived in Los Angeles for 20 years, that I should be there for those protests,” Preston says. “I should be doing something to contribute to that in some way or another. But what's my platform? What's my capacity? What am I able to do? ... It's in moments like these where you're weighing your personal responsibilities versus societal and community priorities versus work and capitalism to support yourself in a system that you don't control. That's the math that everyone's doing more or less every time these [major historical] events start to come together."&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Aftermath</figcaption></figure><p>This feeds into a larger question many find themselves asking in these increasingly tumultuous times: What is the point of making, playing, critiquing, or reporting on video games when it feels like the world is ablaze? And in the case of an in-person event hosted in the United States like Summer Game Fest (or others of potentially greater consequence <a href="https://aftermath.site/gdc-2025-travel-visa-san-francisco-donald-trump-mahmoud-khalil" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like PAX and GDC</a>), is it worth potentially putting yourself in harm’s way?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"It's a weird time right now being here in LA and inside this air-conditioned warehouse while people are getting arrested for no reason,” says Chandana Ekanayake, co-founder and creative director of <em>Dosa Divas</em> and <em>Thirsty Suitors</em> studio Outerloop. “It's been surreal as a naturalized citizen in the US where I could probably get deported for no fucking reason. And it's like, oh, we're here talking about video games. But a lot of the themes, as a creator, and thinking about this stuff, it does go into the game itself. … For me, I want to put a little hopefulness into the world. I have two teenage sons, and I want to leave something for them. I want the world to accept them for who they are."</p><p>Some are forced to keep their guards up more than others. Veerender Jubbal, a Sikh games writer and reporter who lives in Canada, entered the United States for SGF on the back of mounting tensions between the two countries, as well as horror stories like <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/19/canadian-detained-us-immigration-jasmine-mooney" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that of Jasmine Mooney</a>, a Canadian who got detained by ICE for two weeks despite being white and therefore (you would think) an unappealing target to the racist motherfuckers in charge.&nbsp;</p><p>"If a Canadian white woman can get detained for two weeks, then someone like myself, with a turban and a beard – and [who is] a Sikh journalist advocating on representation and those sorts of things – [is in significantly greater danger]," says Jubbal.&nbsp;</p><p>But Jubbal still sees games – and the opportunities that arise from a trip to the US – as worth the risk. He cautions people against viewing games, even in a purely entertainment-based capacity, as frivolous.&nbsp;</p><p>"I've said this to white games journalists who feel like this is all superfluous and stuff, but I've done so much map and guide work,” says Jubbal. “That aids in helping people distract themselves from what's going on, especially… people of color."</p><figure><blockquote><p>I feel completely powerless in my life right now, and I'm somewhat soothed by games that embolden me to become the opposite.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Another games journalist whose parents are currently in the process of immigrating, which limits their ability to speak publicly on these matters, concurs.</p><p>"I was thankful for SGF taking so much of my time and attention away from the very real rise of fascism and noxious xenophobia, which could impact my life in a way that makes me truly sick to think about," they say. "I feel completely powerless in my life right now, and I'm somewhat soothed by games that embolden me to become the opposite."</p><p>They regret not being able to join the protests – or even post about what they believe in online, despite pressure from peers – out of concern for their parents, but they nonetheless hope others can learn from this moment.&nbsp;</p><p>"SGF also made me realize that I want people to know that an 'illegal immigrant' does not fit any one box or set of adjectives," they say. "If you stand next to me, you're standing next to someone directly impacted by a domestic human rights crisis. I, and many others, don't want to tell you that, because we're afraid."</p><hr><p>Despite E3’s demise, one of its grand traditions persists during Summer Game Fest: the advertizing real estate on the Hotel Figueroa mural, reserved exclusively for those with pockets so deep that when they reach for their wallet, a mole person hands it to them. This year, the honor goes to <em>Final Fantasy</em>’s collaboration with <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>, resulting in a multi-story ode to Cloud, Sephiroth, and, implicitly, brand synergy as a concept.&nbsp;</p><p>A photo of the mural <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ethangach.bsky.social/post/3lrbtfdlpqc2y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">makes its way onto the<em> Magic: The Gathering</em> subreddit</a>, albeit with a twist: It was clearly taken during a protest, with signs and flags framing it, which leads a moderator to step in and request that users avoid discussing politics. “Let’s just appreciate the picture,” they say.</p><p>“Considering the picture, this is a crazy ask,” one user replies.</p><p>Even with fascism almost literally knocking at the front door, some will prioritize the longstanding gaming culture tradition of sticking their fingers in their ears and ignoring inconvenient politics. It is a tendency born first and foremost of propaganda and privilege, but Ben Myres – the creative director of <em>Relooted</em>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/relooted-game-africa-museum-visa-nyamakop-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a game about reclaiming African artifacts from Western museums</a> that got announced during SGF and that’s getting lambasted online by all the usual suspects – has an additional explanation for the social consciousness divide between some game developers and some of the people who play games.&nbsp;</p><p>“To make a game… you have to be deeply empathetic, almost by default, because you're making something for someone else to experience,” he says. “But on the player side, you're used to being centered in the game. You become the center of that experience. So I think it changes something in your head: The entitlement manifests to such an extent because that's your default. The developers are used to creating something for someone else, while some people who play games are used to everything being about them."</p><p>Perhaps it’s an oversimplification, or just one beam that splits into a prism of problems, but a worthwhile question emerges: What will happen to the people raised in these pockets of gaming culture as political situations like those that occurred during Summer Game Fest become more common? As Aftermath contributor Autumn Wright <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/theautumnwright.bsky.social/post/3lr4hza3a7k2d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pointed out</a>, “imperialism and the consumerism are always happening all the time,” and with America turning its imperial tactics toward its own core, it is extremely likely that we’ll see more and more strange bedfellows of this sort, until they’re no longer strange at all. Protests, skirmishes, and riots outside of conventions, conferences, and concerts – maybe inside them too. People moving between one and the other, trying for as long as possible to maintain a sense of normalcy, <a href="https://aftermath.site/summer-game-fest-2025-switch-2-launch-geoff-keighley" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to cosplay it even as industries enter freefall</a> and infrastructure collapses. We’ve hit a tipping point, and unless the powers that be decide to suddenly stop agitating, we can’t turn back.</p><p>In that sense, perhaps this year’s Summer Game Fest gave us the ultimate preview: one of the world to come. If that ends up being the case, great job, Geoff. You've really outdone yourself.</p><hr><p>Despite this year’s Summer Game Fest being characterized by a pervasive disconnect, the events of the past week eliminated another, less obvious disconnect from previous years. As Minn/Max’s Janet Garcia writes in what was originally going to be a response to my questions about her time at Summer Game Fest, but which blossomed into <a href="https://pentopixels.com/article/summer-game-fest-2025-ice-protests-la" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a truly excellent standalone piece</a>:</p><blockquote><p>This is my third year at Summer Game Fest and with every year come disparaging comments about Los Angeles. It builds up quickly: “I hate downtown LA. I hate LAX. I hate how dirty it is here. I hate the sirens outside my hotel window. I hate the traffic. I hate how expensive the uber is tonight.” The list goes on.&nbsp;</p><p>LA’s biggest haters from the games industry would be quick to say they’re only here because they have to be for work. For some of them, that’s probably true. But for many I know that it is not. The reality is they wanted to attend SGF: for their own coverage, for the opportunities, to network, for the experience, that list goes on too.&nbsp;</p><p>People are quick to reap LA’s benefits while dismissing the entire culture. People will exclusively take from LA then claim the city is fake. As if there was anything genuine about coming to a city to get what you need while complaining the whole time that you needed it at all.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m sure they’d be ready to clarify that it’s not the people, it’s the city itself, and that’s frankly even more frustrating: the fact that they think the two can be divorced. That the place can be separated from the people.&nbsp;</p><p>It can’t.</p><p>But behind fencing, blocked roads, security-guarded metal detectors, and the tall hedges of SGF's campus, it’s easy to pretend. They can imagine they’re not in the city they love to hate. This year, they couldn’t.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Willingly or not, SGF attendees were gifted a front-row seat to authentic community action, to people united by a common cause putting their bodies on the line for others, whether those were their neighbors or people they’d never met. There’s been endless discourse about optics and protesting The Right Way, whatever that means, but when the dust settles – whether in a few days, a few months, or a few years – that’s the only part any serious person will remember. The rest, including and perhaps especially SGF 2025, will be little more than a footnote.</p><hr><p>The final evening before my flight back to NYC from LA, I attend one more protest. By this point the mayor has implemented a curfew – the exact thing that led to me getting arrested when I lived in Virginia back in 2020 – causing me to immediately question the wisdom of my decision. But curiosity and the sense of duty that comes with any form of journalism, even that which centers mostly around video games, get the better of me.</p><p>When I arrive at downtown LA’s federal building, the location where crowds have been convening for the past couple days, I’m stunned at how few people are present. A small handful of protesters and reporters mill about while a tiny woman, voice bolstered by the great equalizer that is a megaphone, shouts at 15 or so National Guard troops guarding the building’s entrance. I feel secondhand embarrassment even though I know I shouldn’t, if only because I can’t stop imagining how awkward that same scenario would be if I was in her shoes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I find more protesters gathered outside the nearby US Justice Department building, but again, the scene is more ghost town than showdown. “It’s gonna be 4,000 National Guard and 700 marines versus 50 unarmed bystanders,” one protester jokes to their friends.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Aftermath</figcaption></figure><p>I consider packing it in, but little by little, the crowd grows, bolstered by people of all stripes wrapping up work and – instead of resting, scrolling on their phones, playing video games, or some combination of the three – taking to the streets. Around 30 minutes before curfew, we make our way back over to the federal building, where an actual crowd has formed. We combine our forces and begin chanting, which causes the federal building to fart out more cops and National Guard soldiers. It’s still not the most impressive display on our part, but it’s something.</p><p>Then, with 20 minutes left before curfew, a colossal horde of protesters – I’m talking hundreds – rounds a corner, and suddenly we’re cooking with the kind of propane that would bring Hank Hill to his knees. It’s like some shit out of a movie: people whooping and cheering, beside themselves with glee now that the cavalry has arrived. The two crowds move to meet each other. “The people united will never be divided,” they repeatedly chant, a protest classic that’s become a favorite of mine because nobody can agree on whether it’s supposed to end with “divided” or “defeated.”</p><p>The crowd is ultimately divided that night, but not defeated. Protesters return the next day, and the day after. Across the country, others do the same. Now they’re <a href="https://lapublicpress.org/2025/06/ice-raids-separate-families-bring-los-angeles-together/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">joining rapid response networks</a> run by immigrant rights groups and learning about mutual aid. They’re realizing just how deep their roots run.</p><p>“You go to a protest, and you’re talking to everyone all of sudden,” a community organizer named Mar told <a href="https://lapublicpress.org/2025/06/ice-raids-separate-families-bring-los-angeles-together/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LA Public Press</a>. “When is the best place to meet, if not when fighting back?”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>There will always be more of us than there are of them; connection will always come more naturally than fear. We will win. It’s just a matter of time.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
