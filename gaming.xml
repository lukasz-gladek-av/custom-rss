            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ghost-of-yotei-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and Sucker Punch have announced the&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yōtei</em> release date, and it won't be long until you can check out the studio's sequel to&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>.</p>

<p>Per a new PlayStation Blog <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/23/ghost-of-yotei-comes-to-playstation-5-on-october-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, the game, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ghost-of-yotei-ghost-of-tsushima-followup-2025" rel="nofollow">first announced back in September</a>, will be launching exclusively for PlayStation 5 on October 2nd. If <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ghost-of-tsushima-announced-for-pc-with-nvidia-dlss-3-amd-fsr-3-unlocked-frame-rate-and" rel="nofollow">its predecessor</a> is anything to go by, however, we can probably expect a PC port somewhere down the line as well.</p>

<p>Pre-ordering the game will get you a special in-game mask and a set of PSN avatars, and multiple editions of the game will also be available, each of which comes with its own set of bonuses.</p>

<p>The Collector's Edition, meanwhile, gets you everything in the Digital Deluxe Edition, as well as "a replica display edition of Atsu's Ghost mask", which is made from resin and measures 6.8 by 5 by 5.9 inches.</p>

<p>Not only that, but you'll get a number of other goodies, including a replica sash inscribed with the members of&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yōtei</em>'s villainous Yōtei Six faction, plus a number of other great physical goodies. Sucker Punch&nbsp;says it considers this Collector's Edition "the best Collector's Edition we've ever produced".</p>

<p>All of this was announced alongside a brand new trailer that shows off the aforementioned&nbsp;Yōtei Six faction, as well as giving a couple of new glimpses into the game's world. You can check that trailer out here.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yōtei</em>, it's a followup to Sucker Punch's 2020 game&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>. Taking place over three hundred years after the events of that game,&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yōtei&nbsp;</em>follows Atsu, a woman on a quest to avenge her family against the Yōtei Six.</p>

<p><em>Ghost of Yōtei&nbsp;</em>launches exclusively for <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/ghost-of-yotei/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a> on October 2nd.</p>

He previously worked at <em>Android Police</em> and <em>Tech Advisor</em>.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Shortages of the Switch 2 look increasingly likely after Nintendo admitted today that it “cannot fulfill” all of the preorder applications it has already received through its own Japanese store. </p><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/Nintendo/status/1914982671522083155">statement on X</a> via Nintendo’s Japanese account, president Shuntaro Furukawa confirmed that the company’s storefront has received 2.2 million applications to preorder the new console in Japan alone. That’s a number that “far exceeds our expectations, and far exceeds the number of Nintendo Switch 2 consoles that can be delivered from the My Nintendo Store on June 5th.”</p><p>In its first month on sale the original Switch <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/historical_data/index.html">sold 360,000 units in Japan</a>, suggesting that Nintendo is seeing six times the demand for its sequel. The Japanese demand for day one is almost as high as the 2.74 million Switch consoles the company sold worldwide in its first few weeks in 2017.</p><p>Furukawa didn’t say how many consoles Nintendo has ready for the launch, but only that “a significant number of customers” won’t be lucky in the My Nintendo Store lottery. Those who don’t get a console will be automatically re-entered into a second lottery, while third-party retailers in Japan will begin taking preorders tomorrow, April 24th. In Japan Nintendo is offering two versions of the Switch 2: a Japanese-only model for ¥49,980 (about $350) and a ¥69,980 (about $500) multilingual version which is exclusively available through the My Nintendo Store.</p><p>Preorders have already been open for several weeks in some parts of the world, including most of Europe, and stores have sold out fast. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643616/nintendo-switch-2-us-preorders-date">US preorders open tomorrow</a> for $449.99, following an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643483/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-delayed-tariffs">initial delay</a> over tariff concerns.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered - Official Full Reveal Presentation</p>
      </div>
<p>The ratings change was partially due to depictions of blood and gore that were more graphic in-game than initially anticipated, but the ESRB had also picked up on a partially nude female model that could be accessed in the PC version of the game using mods. This inclusion--however it ended up in the game's files--resulted in Oblivion getting a "Nudity" label until the offending files were patched out.</p><p>Oblivion Remastered has been rated under the original Oblivion ESRB listing, and so it has the same rating description as the original: Violence, Blood and Gore, Sexual Themes, Language, and Use of Alcohol. Despite getting the same rating, the remaster has a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-and-different-in-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered/2900-6492/" data-ref-id="2900-6492">number of changes</a> from the 2006 classic, including new lines of dialogue as well as plentiful quality-of-life changes.</p><p>Oblivion Remastered is out now on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X|S, and is included on Game Pass for Xbox and PC. While Bethesda doesn't <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-install-oblivion-remastered-mods/1100-6531034/" data-ref-id="1100-6531034">officially support</a> mods for the remaster, it's still possible to mod the game, and the modding scene is lighting up.</p><p>If you're just getting started in Oblivion, or coming back to it after a long break, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-walkthrough/1100-6147085/" data-ref-id="1100-6147085">full walkthrough</a> for a guide to all aspects of the game.</p>

This morning, Bethesda shared a livestream showcasing the game and explaining their love for arguably the most important entry in the franchise, even if it is not necessarily the most popular. Virtuous developed the remastered version of the game. Bethesda's Todd Howard also made reference to the fact that work on the sixth Elder Scrolls is obviously continuing, but the stream was wholly focused on Oblivion.</p>

<p>The Remastered subtitle is almost as misnomer as footage of the game does make it look like a complete remake. Seeing screenshots and gameplay of the two games side by side shows a stark difference. Every asset was redesigned, and the Unreal Engine has allowed the team to create a significant overhaul in the lighting department. Lip-syncing has also been improved to, hopefully, make speech look better. All of the "quirky" dialogue remains, but new voiceover has been recorded to make the races feel more unique.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kk5cymSWmqo" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Gameplay has also been addressed with significant changes to the game's feel, UI, and audio design. New effects and better enemy hit reaction should also make combat feel better. Sprinting has also been added to the game, despite internal debate about whether or not it should be included. The minigames, like lockpicking, however, remain mostly untouched.</p>

<p>Bethesda also confirmed that all of Oblivion's add-ons and expansions will be included, but the stream did not make reference to Oblivion's notorious horse armor.</p>

<p>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered is available today on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC.</p>

			<p>Amerzone: The Explorer’s Legacy has quite the history, this remake bringing back Benoit Sokal’s Amerzone from 1998, which itself was based on a comic strip from 1986. Amerzone was the first major adventure game Sokal was behind, setting the foundations for its better known cousin, Syberia. Microids’ remake has a lot to live up to from a reputational perspective, and it generally does.</p>
<p><iframe title="Amerzone: The Explorer's Legacy - Story Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q62WD2p-uaA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Amerzone: The Explorer’s Legacy puts players in the shoes of a nameless journalist, who has their first big break with the opportunity to interview the explorer Alexandre Valembois. Valembois has agreed to speak about his trip to the mysterious South American country of Amerzone, which took place approximately 50 years prior to the events of the game. However, the invite for an interview takes a turn and it leads to the journalist embarking on a trip to Amerzone to return an egg.</p>



<p>This isn’t any old egg that you buy by the half-dozen, but one that ties into the mythology of the indigenous people of Amerzone, holding within it a unique species of bird that is believed to bring good luck to Amerzone. It may seem like a superstition, but since the egg left the country, Amerzone has fallen into a military dictatorship and the indigenous groups have been all but wiped out. Getting to Amerzone is no easy feat since the country’s borders are closed with any interlopers shot on sight. Luckily for the journalist, Valembois has built a vehicle called a Hydrofloat that has all sorts of modes that allows someone to travel from the Brittany coast of France to the secretive South American nation and within it too.</p>

<p>Amerzone: The Explorer’s Legacy is the very definition of a point and click adventure game. There is no free movement for players. Instead you look in a direction where an arrow appears, press a button, and the character will move along a predetermined path on their own. You can watch the walking animation or choose to skip and be instantly be transported to the next location. In most areas, you will find items to interact with that will either be useful items that you put in your inventory or provide you with information.</p>

<p>You see, aside from attempting to return the egg to its rightful place the journalist is documenting their journey too. Along the way, different investigations will pop up and you can decide to dig further into these by exploring each location thoroughly or moving on and focusing on the main path. Naturally, you will come across items related to these side investigations, and most will draw you in. Amerzone’s environmental story telling is excellent providing a lot of contextual information so you can piece together what has happened in the past, whether it is to do with Valembois’ own story or something completely different.</p>
<p>Amerzone’s main story is fine and does move along at a decent pace. It has some good writing but there are moments which could have benefited from having a bit more of a build-up or not being quite so predictable. You can guess what will happen with the main story beats pretty early on, but with a game like this the journey is more important. The Traveler mode will have more documents and clues to find in the environment to help with puzzles, along with a hint system that will eventually give you the answer if you get stuck. The Adventurer mode, meanwhile, provides fewer clues meaning you will get stuck more often and have to connect the clues yourself to find solutions.</p>

<p>Amerzone: The Explorer’s Legacy does look very good with environments that have lots of detail to them, from thick foliage in the jungles to some nicely designed beaches on Shipwreck Island. There are some minor performance issues here and there with a bit of stuttering, but on the whole the game performs fine too, and it’s hardly an issue for this style of game. Amerzone’s music is well done too with tunes that fit the atmosphere, though there are moments of silence that could have been filled with song.</p>

<p>Also available for pre-order from May 2nd will be the Ghost of Yotei Collector's Edition, which will include all the bonuses available in the other editions of the game as well as a replica display edition of Atsu's Ghost mask, a replica of Atsu's sash, a replica of the Tsuba from Atsu's katana and a pouch of coins and instructions to play Zeni Hajiki, a game that will also be played in the game.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gematsu.com/2025/04/ghost-of-yotei-launches-october-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>The Onryo’s List</strong></p><p>Alongside today’s news, we’ve also released our latest trailer for <em>Ghost of Yotei</em>, “The Onryo’s List.” Sixteen years ago in the heart of Ezo (called Hokkaido in present day), a gang of outlaws known as the Yotei Six took everything from Atsu. They killed her family and left her for dead, pinned to a burning ginkgo tree outside her home. But Atsu survived. She learned to fight, to kill, and to hunt, and after years away she has returned to her home with a list of six names: The Snake, The Oni, The Kitsune, The Spider, The Dragon, and Lord Saito.</p><p>One by one, she’s hunting them down to avenge her family, armed with the same katana used to pin her to that burning tree all those years ago. But while Atsu’s story begins with vengeance, she’ll find there’s more to her journey than just revenge. As she explores Ezo, Atsu will meet unlikely allies and forge connections that help give her a new sense of purpose.</p><p>We hope the brief looks in today’s trailer give you a taste of what you can expect from <em>Ghost of Yotei</em>. Beyond your first look at the Yotei Six, you’ll spot some of the gorgeous scenery of Ezo as well as a handful of Atsu’s new weapons, a few of her allies, and even a new gameplay mechanic that will allow you to glimpse Atsu’s past and understand everything that was taken from her.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>But we’ve only scratched the surface. In <em>Ghost of Yotei</em>, we’ve built upon and evolved the way you explore the open world, offering even more freedom and variety than in <em><a title="Games > Ghost of Tsushima [32 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a></em>. You’ll choose which leads to follow as you pick which Yotei Six member you want to hunt down first. Atsu can also track other dangerous targets and claim bounties, or seek out weapon sensei to learn new skills. Ezo is wild, and as deadly as it is beautiful. As you trek across the open world you’ll find unexpected dangers and peaceful reprieves (including some returning activities from Tsushima), and you’ll be able to build a campfire anywhere in the open world for a rest under the stars. We want you to have the freedom to explore Ezo however you decide to, and we can’t wait to share more.</p><p><strong>Pre-Orders</strong></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ghost-of-Yotei_Pre-Orders_04-23-25_001.jpg"></a></figure><p>Today we can also reveal that pre-orders for <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> begin next week, on May 2 at 10:00 a.m. in your local time zone (10:00 a.m. ET for those in the United States), and you’ll be able to choose between multiple different editions, including our amazing Collector’s Edition.</p><p>First, if you pre-order any edition of <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> you’ll receive a unique in-game mask, as well as a set of seven <a title="Platforms > PlayStation [47,430 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation">PlayStation</a> Network avatars featuring concept art of Atsu and each member of the Yotei Six at launch.

Collector’s Edition pricing will be announced at a later date.</p><p>This packed edition includes all of the pre-order bonuses, all in-game items from the Digital Deluxe Edition, and a digital copy of the game, as well as a replica display edition of Atsu’s Ghost mask. The mask is built to-scale with Jin’s mask from our <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> Collector’s Edition. If you have both, they look great next to each other on a shelf! The mask measures 6.8 x 5 x 5.9 inches and is made of resin, plus includes its own display stand.</p><p>Also included is a replica of Atsu’s sash, complete with the names of all six members of the Yotei Six (but you’ll have to cross them off yourself). The sash measures 71 inches long and is made of a cotton blend, a perfect cosplay accessory or wall decoration.</p><p>There’s also a replica of the Tsuba from Atsu’s katana, forged by her father in the image of two twin wolves. This Tsuba measures roughly 3 x 3 inches and also includes its own display stand.</p><p>In addition to all of the above, the <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> Collector’s Edition also includes a pouch of coins and instructions to play Zeni Hajiki, a game of skill you’ll play throughout <em>Ghost of Yotei</em>. There’s also a foldable papercraft ginkgo tree along with a wolf at its base, and a set of four 5 x 7-inch art cards featuring the sash, the wolf, Atsu’s Ghost mask, and our key art.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Developed by Sucker Punch Productions, the game is a sequel to the critically acclaimed Ghost Of Tsushima.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVBLJYjSAhg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PVBLJYjSAhg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/23/ghost-of-yotei-comes-to-playstation-5-on-october-2/" rel="nofollow ">In a blog post</a>, Sucker Punch revealed more about Ghost of Yotei's plot, which revolves around the protagonist Atsu hunting down the Yotei Six, a gang of outlaws who murdered her family. While Atsu was left for dead, she survived her encounter with the gang--made up of members known as the Snake, the Oni, the Kitsune, the Spider, the Dragon, and their leader Lord Seito--and she spent the next 16 years learning to fight. Armed with the same katana used to pin her to a burning tree, Atsu's story will see her explore Ezo and find new allies in her quest for revenge.</p><p>Sony also revealed the various editions for the game that will be available to preorder starting May 2. All preorders will come with several bonuses, including a unique in-game mask for Atsu to wear and a set of seven PSN avatars featuring concept art of Atsu and each member of the Yotei Six.</p><p>There'll be a $70 standard version of the game, and the Ghost of Yotei Digital Deluxe Edition is priced at $80. This one includes a digital download key for the game, The Snake's armor set, an alternate dye for your starting armor set, a unique horse color, a unique saddle dye, an in-game charm, a gold sword kit, and an early unlock of Traveler's Maps that can be used to find statues throughout Ezo. Discovering these will allow you to upgrade your skills more easily.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4481014-ghost-of-yotei-dd-edition-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4481014" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4481014-ghost-of-yotei-dd-edition-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4481014"></a><figcaption>Ghost of Yotei Collector's Edition</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4481014-ghost-of-yotei-dd-edition-3.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4481015-ghost-of-yotei-dd-edition.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4481016-ghost-of-yotei-dd-edition-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4481015,1300-4481016" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4481015-ghost-of-yotei-dd-edition.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4481016-ghost-of-yotei-dd-edition-2.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4481015-ghost-of-yotei-dd-edition.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4481016-ghost-of-yotei-dd-edition-2.jpg"></figure><p>While its pricing hasn't been revealed yet, Sony did show off what the Ghost of Yotei Collector's Edition contains.

            <p>The <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a> team has announced the release date for its highly anticipated sequel.</p>
<p>Ghost of Yōtei will launch on Playstation 5 later this year, on 2nd October.</p>

<p>"It's been nearly five years since we shipped <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a>, and in that time we’ve been hard at work making Ghost of Yōtei something special," wrote Sucker Punch's Andrew Goldfarb, announcing today's release date news. </p>
<p>"While the stories are unrelated, it's important to us to make this a worthy follow-up to Jin's journey, and we can't wait for you to experience Atsu's quest for vengeance later this year."</p>
<p>The studio also released a new trailer for Ghost of Yōtei, which you can check out below.</p>
<p>This trailer gives us more insight into Atsu's aforementioned quest for vengeance. We already knew she was seeking revenge for her ravaged home and family life, but now we know just <em>who </em>it is she is hunting down - that would be a gang of outlaws known as the Yōtei Six.</p>
<p>"They killed her family and left her for dead, pinned to a burning ginkgo tree outside her home. But Atsu survived. She learned to fight, to kill, and to hunt, and after years away she has returned to her home with a list of six names: The Snake, The Oni, The Kitsune, The Spider, The Dragon, and Lord Saito," Sucker Punch teases.</p>

<p>Today's trailer is but a small taste of what players can expect on Ghost of Yōtei's release, the developer added. Sucker Punch previously said it is going to ensure <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-tsushima-follow-up-will-have-a-less-repetitive-open-world">Ghost of Yōtei has a less repetitive open world compared to its predecessor</a>, with criticisms for Ghost of Tsushima often directed at its somewhat repetitive activities, so this remark is in keeping with the studio's overall plan for the sequel.</p>
<p>Those interested in pre-ordering Ghost of Yōtei will be able to do so from next week, with those pre-orders starting on 2nd May (how is it May next week?!). As is the case with many releases these days, there will be a number of different editions to choose from. </p>
<p>Regardless of which edition you plump for, those who do pre-order will receive a unique in-game mask, as well as a set of seven PSN avatars featuring concept art of Atsu and each member of the Yōtei Six (see below).
</p>

</figure>
<p>Anyway, onto those editions, and what they include. The standard edition of Ghost of Yōtei which includes the game (obviously) will retail for £69.99 / €79.99. This edition will be available at certain retailers or via the PlayStation Store.</p>
<p>A Digital Deluxe Edition of Ghost of Yōtei will also be available for  £79.99 / €89.99. This chap will have the game itself, as well as some bonuses such as The Snake's armor set, as well as an alternate dye for your starting armour. </p>
<p>
Ghost of Yōtei's  Digital Deluxe Edition will also come with a unique horse color and unique saddle dye, as well as an in-game Charm, gold Sword Kit, and an early unlock of Traveler’s Maps. These will help you find statues throughout the world, which in turn will be useful for upgrading your skills.
</p>

</figure>
<p>Lastly, Sucker Punch is releasing a Ghost of Yōtei Collector's Edition. The developer is yet to announce pricing for this edition, but we do know what it will include.</p>
<p>Those who opt for Ghost of Yōtei Collector's Edition will get:</p>
<ul>
<li>All of the pre-order bonuses</li>
<li>All in-game items from the Digital Deluxe Edition</li>
<li>A digital copy of the game, as well as a replica display edition of Atsu's Ghost mask</li>
<li>A replica of Atsu's sash, complete with the names of all six members of the Yōtei Six</li>
<li>A replica of the Tsuba from Atsu's katana</li>
<li>A pouch of coins</li>
<li>Instructions to play Zeni Hajiki, a game of skill you'll play throughout Ghost of Yōtei.</li>
<li>A foldable papercraft ginkgo tree along with a wolf at its base</li>
<li>A set of four 5 x 7-inch art cards featuring the sash, the wolf, Atsu's Ghost mask, and our key art</li>
</ul>
<p>As a general point, an account for PlayStation Network will be required to redeem things such as digital items available via a voucher code. </p>

<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-yotei-update-sparks-speculation-of-new-in-game-economy-and-bounty-system">Sucker Punch said it remained committed to Ghost of Yōtei's 2025 release window</a> on PS5. </p>
<p>There had been some speculation the studio and PlayStation may nudge it back a touch to make way for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/with-gta-6-looming-ea-says-its-willing-to-delay-its-biggest-ever-battlefield-to-make-its-launch-all-it-needs-to-be">a game many expect will dominate the gaming landscape when it releases this autumn</a> (unless it gets delayed).

            <p>After plenty of rumours, speculation and leaks, Bethesda finally announced and released the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-reveals-the-elder-scrolls-4-obivion-remake-gameplay">spruced up version of The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion last night</a>.</p>
<p>Soon after this, the studio stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-say-no-official-mod-support-for-its-oblivion-remaster">there was no official mod support for its Oblivion remaster</a>, but that hasn't stopped plenty of players already releasing mods for it anyway.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, there are currently 96 Oblivion Remastered mods <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/games/oblivionremastered/mods?sort=updatedAt&amp;page=1">available on Nexus Mods</a> (at least as I can see while not being logged in), but I suspect it will soon pass 100.</p>
<p>These mods include things like <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/100">Faster (And Slower) Levelling</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/97">Slower Item Degradation</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/13">improved HUDs</a>. There's also the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/15">Adoring Fan desktop shortcut icon replacer</a>, because <em>of course </em>he is going to pop up.</p>
<p>So, yes, people have certainly been busy since <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered</a> debuted yesterday. Meanwhile, I am sitting here just chuffed that I have at least managed to get it installed on my Xbox in the time since last night.</p>

<p>Away from my not-very-impressive-Xbox-flex, The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered has pulled in some impressive player numbers for Bethesda and co-developer Virtuos on Steam, where it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-off-to-a-good-start-on-steam">has an 182,298 concurrent player peak so far</a>. Are you one of them?</p>
<p>Earlier this month our Jim <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remake-morrowind-not-oblivion-you-cowards">called upon Bethesda to remake Morrowind rather than Oblivion</a>. "You cowards," Jim wrote, calling Morrowind a "special game, where a beautifully unique fantasy setting is locked away behind technology and interface design that has aged particularly badly".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>New Final Fantasy VII Rebirth mods released today introduce two new full-fledged playable characters as well as new abilities for playable Sephiroth.</p>
<p>Following the video preview shared <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-new-playahble-characters-pc/">last week</a>, D3DNieR released today on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy7rebirth/mods/976?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a> a new <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy7rebirth/mods/976?tab=description">mod</a> that introduces playable versions of Reno and Rude. The two new characters, which replace Cloud and Tifa, have some small issues, but they feel like proper playable characters with some unique mechanics, such as Rude's ability to use more basic attacks after using the Unbridled Strength skill, the ability to cancel some animations by pressing the strong attack button, a counterattack, and much more.</p>
<p>While Sephiroth has been made playable past the flashback sequence at the beginning of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth already, his moveset is considerably limited compared to the other playable characters. <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy7rebirth/mods/980?tab=videos">The new mod</a> released by Eulymedon today, however, partially addresses this issue by introducing abilities taken from the boss version of Sephiroth, including Heartless Angel, Errant Whisper, Wicked Augment, and more. You can check how these abilities work in the video below.</p>

			<p>Ghost of Yotei has been rated in Taiwan today, suggesting that, judging from some precedents, the game may not be too far from release.</p>
<p>As reported by Gematsu, the second entry in the series developed by Sucker Punch received an R rating for violence, tobacco and alcohol and inappropriate language, which was predictable looking at the first entry in the series. While the rating also highlights how a launch date has not been revealed yet, we are likely going to hear more about it very soon, as not much time usually passes from the first ratings in Asian countries to the release date announcements. For Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, another big PlayStation 5 exclusive launching in 2025, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-launches-on-june-26-pre-orders-begin-soon/">launch date</a> was confirmed a little over a month after the game was rated in <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-gets-korean-rating-hinting-at-imminent-launch/">South Korea.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Ghost of Yotei has been rated in Taiwan.</p>
<p>Gematsu page: <a href="https://t.co/Kbfm65SWCI">https://t.co/Kbfm65SWCI</a> <a href="https://t.co/vBIef8RHMH">pic.twitter.com/vBIef8RHMH</a></p>
<p>— Gematsu (@gematsu) <a href="https://twitter.com/gematsu/status/1914870872667488508?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 23, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>We haven't seen much of Ghost of Yotei since its announcement last year. <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-gets-new-details-from-official-website/">Back in March</a>, the game's official website confirmed some details regarding the new protagonist, Atsu, and some new gameplay mechanics, including new weapons like the odachi, kusarigama, and dual katanas, more varied environments that players will be able to take advantage of, and more.</p>
<p>Ghost of Yotei is scheduled to release in 2025 on PlayStation 5. A PC version has yet to be officially announced, though there's little doubt that a port will be coming at some point.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tenderfoot-tactics">Tenderfoot Tactics</a> is a wistful and dreamlike turn-based indie that I had a real soft spot for the year it released.

Nintendo does not have the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> stock to meet customer demand in Japan, it has admitted, in a stark warning from the company's president.
</p>
<p>
Writing on social media this morning, <a href="https://x.com/Nintendo/status/1914982671522083155">Nintendo boss Shuntaro Furukawa revealed</a> an astonishing 2.2 million people had applied to buy a Switch via the My Nintendo Store as part of a lottery process.
</p>
<p>
Furukawa admitted this was a number that "far exceeds expectations" and "far exceeds the number of Nintendo Switch 2 consoles that can be delivered" at launch.

</figure>
<p>In Japan, Nintendo has offered a cheaper, region-locked version of Switch 2 that will only play Japanese games and only be compatible with Japanese Nintendo accounts. The thinking here is that this version can be offered to Nintendo's key home market, which is currently impacted by a weak Yen, while also ensuring it cannot be bought up and resold online to those elsewhere. 
</p>
<p>But creating a Japan-only version of Switch 2 may also present its own problems - such as creating an additional line of stock that has to be manufactured separately, and cannot be topped up by additional units made for elsewhere.</p>
<p>
Nintendo is now telling its Japanese fans that "a significant number of customers" will be unable to get Switch 2 at launch. Anyone who has applied to buy the console so far will be automatically entered into a second lottery - but this too will result in an undisclosed number of applications being unsuccessful.
</p>
<p>
"We deeply apologise for not being able to meet your expectations despite our prior preparations," Furukawa wrote.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo says it is "further strengthening" its Switch 2 production as a result, and that pre-orders via other Japanese retailers will open tomorrow, should fans want to try their luck there.
</p>
<p>
"With the cooperation of retailers, we will continue to ship the console and make efforts to get as many Nintendo Switch 2 consoles as possible into your hands," Furukawa added.
</p>
<p>
"We plan to continue producing and shipping a considerable number of Nintendo Switch 2 units in the future. We apologise for the delay in our ability to meet your expectations, and we appreciate your understanding."
</p>
<p>
Writing on social media, <a href="https://x.com/serkantoto/status/1914985844189933700">Dr Serkan Toto</a>, CEO of Japanese game industry consultancy firm Kantan Games, described the amount of interest in Switch 2 as "ridiculous", but also noted Nintendo had "originally promised enough supply for launch - which of course immediately sounded like a fairy tale for anybody with a basic understanding of the game market".
</p>
<p>
Overseas, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-delays-us-switch-2-pre-orders-due-to-tariffs">Switch 2's launch has already proven bumpy in North America</a> - where Nintendo has had to factor in the current US trade war with China into its launch pricing. In the US, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-raising-cost-of-switch-2-accessories-in-us-due-to-tariffs-but-console-price-to-remain-same-1">Switch 2 will still arrive on 5th June alongside the rest of the world, though prices for its accessories have now been raised</a>.

            <p>It may have now released its own remaster of The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion, but that doesn't mean Bethesda is planning on shutting down work on the fan-made Skyblivion mod.</p>
<p>Let's be honest, we all knew a spruced up version of Oblivion was on the cards. Along with those <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remaster-is-real">screenshots on developer Virtuos' website</a>, references to the project were also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake-references-now-found-on-bethesdas-website">spotted on Bethesda's own website</a> before Bethesda had made any official announcement. Then last night, it finally got around to telling us what we all knew already: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-reveals-the-elder-scrolls-4-obivion-remake-gameplay">Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered is real</a>, and available to play now.</p>

<p>However, while this was an exciting bit of news for many, there is one particular group this announcement was perhaps less than welcome for, at least in terms of timing. That would be TESRenewal, the team working Skyblivion, a volunteer-based project seeking to remake Oblivion in the Skyrim engine.</p>
<p>When word of The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion remaster started gaining more traction last week, project lead Rebelzize said Bethesda's then-impending announcement "changes nothing" as far as the Skyblivion team were concerned. Rebelzize, on the outside at least, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skyblivion-fan-project-lead-reacts-to-oblivion-remake-news-with-all-love-and-no-hate">remained positive about the project and the upcoming remaster being able to both thrive</a>, stating it was a "win-win" for fans of Oblivion.</p>
<p>Now, the TESRenewal team has gone one step further and assured its Skyblivion community Bethesda has "no intention of shutting down our project". It additionally thanked the studio for the Oblivion Remastered game keys Bethesda gifted the entire modding team.</p>
<p>"This means so much to us. Thank you for everything," the <a href="https://x.com/TESRSkyblivion/status/1914754195674333459">TESRenewal team shared on social media</a>.</p>

<p>While this is good news for the Skyblivion team and all those looking forward to the project's release (which is slated for some time this year), <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-say-no-official-mod-support-for-its-oblivion-remaster">Bethesda itself has said it has no plans for Oblivion Remastered official mod support</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile since its release last night, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered</a> has pulled in some impressive player numbers for Bethesda and co-developer Virtuos. Over on Steam, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-off-to-a-good-start-on-steam">Oblivion Remastered has an 182,298 concurrent player peak so far</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>There's no official mod support for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>. But when has that ever stopped modders from forcibly isekai-ing their favourite anime characters into the wrong realm? Not even 24 hours have passed since the fantasy RPG remaster was released in a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bethesda-release-oblivion-remastered-for-50">"surprise" announcement</a> by Bethesda, and the modding scene has already created <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/games/oblivionremastered/mods">90+ mods and counting</a> (and that's just on one popular modding website). What's most intriguing is that they've discovered some old mods for the original game still work in the remaster. It's an exciting time to be an Elder Scrolls modder. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>As <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivionmods/comments/1k5c77z/from_the_bethesda_discord/">posted on Reddit</a>, one curious player dusted off a simple mod from 2008 which <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/20947">adds late game armour</a> to your prison cell at the start of the game. When they tested this in the new remaster it "worked perfectly" - but only after manually updating a plugins.txt file in the game's folders. </p>
<p>This plugins file is usually handled by the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/2097">Oblivion mod manager</a> but that won't work in the remaster, so you have to add an extra line to the end of the .txt file by hand. But aside from that bit of fiddling, it works. Another user followed the same steps and found that, yes, the spiffy Daedric armour from late in the game <a href="https://imgur.com/a/iHwxwHu">does indeed appear</a> in your shiny remastered cell. </p>
<p>While this opens up a lot of possibilities, it'll likely take time for the roving gangs of modders to scrounge their way through the ancient library of Oblivion mods in search of the most compatible ones. Right now it looks like simpler mods which involve model swaps are doable, provided you add new models to Unreal's paks (paks are basically beefy little folders full of assets). But not everything is going to be so cut and dry. Also, this is all in service of a fancy schmancy remaster, which means many older glow-up mods, like texture packs, are somewhat redundant. But others which involve new quests or characters, or rejigged systems of magic, might feasibly be ported. Who knows.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/khajiit.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=70&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Bethesda</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Meanwhile, modders are cracking on with other straightforward alterations for the remaster. On NexusMods, there's a mod that <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/72">bumps up the colour</a> so that the world looks as bright and saturated as you remember. Another <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/109">removes the need to repair weapons</a>. And, of course, there's one that lets you <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/14">skip the Bethesda and Virtuos logo screens</a> on startup. </p>
<p>The current most popular mod lets you <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/48">remove carry weight restrictions</a> altogether. Which I find deeply insulting to the spirit of Oblivion. Is it even an Elder Scrolls game if you don't spend half your time by the roadside dumping surplus arrows and pots you accidentally picked up in a neighbour's house? Come on, folks. Embrace the chafe.</p>
<p>The remaster changed a lot of stuff. The user interface, for instance, has been completely reworked. And your character's movement has seen a lot of tweaks and improvements. There are new sound effects, VFX, and it's all slathered in Unreal's real-time lighting. Most significantly, the levelling system has been redesigned, so the divisive level scaling you may remember from - ugh - two decades ago is no longer present in the same form. I can't wait to see some absolute masochist mod it back in.</p></div>

            <p>
Who would have suspected Bethesda to shadow drop Oblivion yesterday! Well, quite a lot of us, in fact. 
</p>
<p>
But regardless of whether fans had already prepped themselves for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered</a> or not, they turned up in huge numbers.
</p>
<p>
Over on Steam, which <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2623190/charts/">publicly reveals its player data</a>, Oblivion Remastered has an 182,298 concurrent player peak so far - placing it ahead of anything else on Steam except stalwarts <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/counter-strike-two">Counter-Strike 2</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">PUBG</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dota-2">Dota 2</a>.

<p>
Oblivion Remastered is, perhaps unsurprisingly, the best-selling game on Steam right now, and has launched with a Very Positive user review rating from those who have played.
</p>
<p>
Of course, Steam's numbers only count for a fraction of those who have jumped in so far. Oblivion Remastered is also available via the Microsoft Store on PC, and via the PC Game Pass subscription, as well as on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, including via Game Pass Ultimate.
</p>
<p>
We'll be keeping an eye out for combined player numbers from Bethesda when they're available.
</p>
<p>
As announced - and launched - yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-reveals-the-elder-scrolls-4-obivion-remake-gameplay">the Oblivion Remaster is really more of a ground-up remake</a> using Unreal Engine 5 from talented co-developer Virtuos. 
</p>
<p>
The new version of Bethesda's classic role-player includes the game's previous expansion content and boasts various gameplay tweaks such as a refreshed levelling system inspired by Skyrim, additional dialogue, modern controls including sprinting. It now also runs at 4K 60fps.
</p>
<p>
Last night, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-say-no-official-mod-support-for-its-oblivion-remaster">Bethesda said it had no plans for Oblivion Remastered official mod support</a>, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-already-almost-100-mods-for-oblivion-remake-even-without-official-support-from-bethesda">plenty of unofficial mods have popped up now anyway</a>. Bethesda also made the welcome gesture of gifting access to the Oblivion Remaster to the team of fans currently remaking Oblivion in the Skyrim engine, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-has-no-intention-to-shut-down-fan-made-skyblivion-mod">which it has indicated it approves of</a>.

			<p>Shortly following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-looks-gorgeous-and-its-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiling and release</a> of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, the legion of Elder Scrolls modders jumped on it to see what could be done. There seems to be good news: since the game logic still runs on the original Gamebryo engine, several of the mods made for the original game are being ported and appear to be working. The usual Bethesda plugin structure based on .esp files is also intact, so users can simply add new mods (.esps) to the data folder and then make sure to also add the .esp name to the plugins.txt file.</p>
<p>In the span of mere hours, there are already around ninety mods on Nexus. Some of these are simple, run-of-the-mill skip-the-intro mods, but others are far more interesting. For example, modder sammilucia has already <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/27" target="_blank" rel="noopener">uploaded</a> a version of their Ultra + mod, which was previously released for many PC games (Hogwarts Legacy, RoboCop: Rogue City, Silent Hill 2 Remake, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl, Star Wars: Jedi Survivor, Ghostrunner 2, Cyberpunk 2077, Avowed, Runescape: Dragonwilds, Black Myth: Wukong). Interestingly, this mod adds NVIDIA DLSS Ray Reconstruction to Oblivion Remastered, which is not supported by default (DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation are natively available, though). The game offers hardware-accelerated ray traced Lumen global illumination, and Ray Reconstruction can boost its quality. Ultra + also makes other tweaks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved fog quality</li>
<li>Fix fog ghosting</li>
<li>Fix fog artifacting against the sky</li>
<li>Include fog in Lumen tracing for GI and reflections</li>
<li>Increase lighting quality in general via modifying the game's PostProcessVolumes</li>
<li>Add several lighting quality levels, allowing maximum theoretical lighting quality</li>
<li>Improved reflection quality</li>
<li>Fix screenspace reflection issue when Hardware Lumen is enabled</li>
<li>Performance tuning</li>
</ul>
<p>But there are already many more mods on Nexus. Some attempt to <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/44" target="_blank" rel="noopener">restore the original game's colors through ReShade presets</a>. Others ensure that <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/113" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quest rewards are unleveled</a> so that they are always received by the player at their maximum quality.</p>
<p>There are also tweaks to game mechanics, such as equipment degradation, which can either be <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/101" target="_blank" rel="noopener">removed</a> or significantly <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/97" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slowed down</a>; carry weight can be <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/48" target="_blank" rel="noopener">boosted to infinity</a>; spell restrictions to spellcrafting or enchanting can be <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/138" target="_blank" rel="noopener">removed</a>; the HUD can be made <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/13" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sleeker and less intrusive</a>. But, as mentioned earlier, arguably the most promising aspect is that Oblivion Remastered appears to be compatible with some original mods, such as <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/87" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NPCs Catch Fire</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/153" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horse Whistle - Summon and Follow</a>. It remains to be seen if the same will hold true for more complex mods, but if that were to be true, the game's modding potential could be enormous. We'll keep a close eye on the modding scene's development, that's for sure.</p>

It’s ahead of the likes of Valve’s own Counter-Strike 2, viral hit Schedule I, and Blizzard’s Overwatch 2, which itself received a significant new update.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Oblivion remastered was also the fourth most-played game on Steam yesterday, behind only Counter-Strike 2, PUBG, and Dota 2. It’s currently the most-played single-player RPG on Steam, ahead of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/with-baldurs-gate-3s-steam-player-count-booming-following-patch-8-larian-now-has-room-to-focus-on-making-our-next-big-thing-as-good-as-we-can">the resurgent Baldur’s Gate 3</a>, and has a ‘very positive’ user review rating.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Steam stats do not tell the whole story, of course, and when it comes to Oblivion Remastered, there’s much more to its success. As a Microsoft-owned game (Microsoft owns Bethesda parent company ZeniMax Media), Oblivion Remastered launched straight into Xbox Game Pass for Ultimate subscribers. It seems likely the game will have many players through the subscription service alone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And then there’s the PlayStation 5 and standard Xbox Series X and S release to add in. So, while neither Microsoft nor Sony make player numbers public, Oblivion Remastered’s true peak concurrent player count on launch day will be much higher than 180,000.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It seems like a big success already, although Bethesda is yet to announce a total player or sales number.
