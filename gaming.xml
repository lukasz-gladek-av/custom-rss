<p>With mouse controls and 120fps, too!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Japanese developer ITL is returning to one of its DSiWare titles, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/handy-hockey">Handy Hockey</a>, and bringing it to the Switch 2 in just two days — on 31st July 2025 — for the bargain price of <strong>£5.00 / $7.00</strong>.</p>
<p>The original game launched as a DSiWare title back in 2010 and is a simple, neon-coloured air hockey game. However, it was exclusive to Japan. This version <em>looks</em> to be a polished-up version of the original, making it the first time it's available in the West.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://itl.ne.jp/Products/HandyHockey/en/">the official website</a>, ITL confirms the game is entirely playable in Mouse Mode, and players can take one Joy-Con 2 each and use the mice to play against one another. Even cooler, you can place the Switch 2 screen on the table and play the game as though it were a real air hockey table.</p>
<p>Up to four players can take part in a match, and the game will also run at 120fps, making it one of the first games on the system to reach that cap.</p>

<p><em>Handy Hockey launches later this week on Switch 2. Will you be grabbing this one? Aim for the goal in the comments</em>.</p></section></article><div><p>Alana has been with Nintendo Life since 2022, and while RPGs are her first love, Nintendo is a close second.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> is now set to get an endgame revamp earlier than originally advertised, with Capcom having opted to chuck their established update plans for the next few months out of a window. Well, I say that, all they've really done is move around some bits.</p>
<p>While <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-brings-hope-with-newly-lowered-pc-requirements-then-dashes-it-with-a-benchmark-tool">performance issues</a> have proven to be the main achilles heel of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action game</a> about hunning mons, the stuff you're left to do once you've slapped up Arkveld has been another source of player ire.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Capcom announced this change in plans via Twitter, outlining via both text and graphic that the "expansion of endgame content" they'd originally penned in for late September's title update three will now be dropping as part of August's version 1.021 update.</p>
<p>The latter update's also had its release date penned in for August 13th, 2025. As for what you can expect from this endgame embiggening, there'll be a new level of quest difficulty and a new rewards system for those quests which'll be based around "Talismans with random skill combinations". That's in addition to 1.021's weapon balance adjustments, which Capcom say "will cover more weapons than originally planned".</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>An update on release date and content of update Ver.1.021</p><p>The expansion of endgame content which was originally planned as part of Title Update 3 in late September will now be released ahead of schedule as part of the Ver.1.021 update. To accommodate this change, this update… <a href="https://t.co/aQF1oFMCFR">pic.twitter.com/aQF1oFMCFR</a></p></div>— Monster Hunter (@monsterhunter) <a href="https://twitter.com/monsterhunter/status/1950139099160949156?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 29, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>
<p>The studio are also teasing some "other improvements and adjustments", so you may well not be out of luck if you're desperate for more performance tweaks. The ones the developers made <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-two-aims-to-defeat-the-biggest-beasts-of-all-shader-compilation-and-vram-issues">late last month</a> do seem to have helped some players, but judging by the still <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/latest-monster-hunter-wilds-update-aims-to-rally-the-steam-reviews-and-slay-the-wildest-monster-of-all-fomo">overwhemingly negative recent Steam reviews</a>, Wilds is still a ways from running as well as your hunter would have to if their Seikret were to suddenly take off without them.</p>
<p>Here's hoping that this Wilds update does bring the game a lot closer to what folks ideally want, because clearly the addition of water guns and swimwear as part of its <a href="https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1947814137326936487">summer update</a> hasn't quite gotten the entirety of the MonHun masses back on board.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-is-getting-an-endgame-expansion-ahead-of-schedule-as-capcom-keep-hunting-player-approval]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lies-of-p">Lies of P</a> is absolutely the biggest draw here, the popular Pinocchio-inspired soulslike from South Korean developer Round 8 Studio.</p>
<p>The game recently received a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lies-of-p-overture-difficulty-options">DLC expansion called Overture</a>, but presumably that's not included in this PS Plus offer.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/peak-is-a-playground-for-slapstick-comedy.1256241/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There’s something acutely hilarious about <a href="https://medal.tv/games/peak/clips/kFOTIugoqZOAM6FMD" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a video my friend Tyler clipped</a> when we played <em>Peak</em> for the first time. It’s him turning his camera to look for me, and in the distance you see me standing there looking up at the new, even more treacherous jungle terrain we have to scale. Over voice chat, I just go, “Oh <em>no</em>.” The phrase and flat affect escaping from my cherubic character’s mouth as my friend whip-pans his camera back to the terrain to reference what I’m looking at was completely improvised but seemed as taut as a scripted sequence in a movie. This is the most fun I’ve had in a game in a long time.</p><p><em>Peak </em>alchemizes several trends in gaming from the past few years, taking bits of the structure from other popular streamer-friendly multiplayer games like <em>Phasmophobia</em>, <em>Repo</em>, and <em>Lethal Company</em> and mixing them with the cartoony designs and environmental polish of titles like <em>Among Us</em> and <em>Fall Guys</em>. Undergirding all of this is two teams’ (<a href="https://landfall.se/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Landfall</a> and <a href="https://aggrocrab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aggro Crab</a>) talent with strong game writing, eye-popping art direction and clever mechanical choices, coming from scores of people who made both the goofy <em>Totally Accurate</em> simulator series as well as <em>Going Under</em>. Their combined forces have given players not just the ability to fail their way up (and very much down) a mountain, but also acts as a sandbox for their funniest impulses.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Peak</em> does a lot of clever heavy lifting with physics and the camera to make everything from players to items to the environment operate with the kinetic silliness of a cartoon. This creates a space for players to really fuck around, usually punctuated by a swift emphasis on finding out, whether it’s slipping on jellyfish, falling into a poison puffball, or throwing an item to watch it roll downhill. Truly, the best way forward in the game is to fail spectacularly, and when fully embraced, <em>Peak</em> becomes <em>America’s Funniest Home Videos</em>-levels of pranks, pratfalls, sabotaging and hubris.</p><p>Part of the game’s popularity on social media and places like Twitch does seem to come from that cooperatively funny gameplay but also how legible it is to an audience. Camera movement is tied to head and eye adjustments in a naturalistic way, meaning you can see what another player is looking at in real time. Useful teamplay features like little hand widgets for pinging the terrain, using handgrabs and hoisting other players up aid collaboration in a concrete visual way. Proximity-based voice chat that indicates distance between team members but is also animated on character’s faces, with basic lip flaps moving in time with what anyone is saying or looking at. It feels less like a survival game at times and more like if <em>Survivor</em> was populated by vtubers. Streamers have been making quick work at capturing the hilarity in real time, but you can have fun playing it without it being “for content.”</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Ludwig Crashes Out After Getting Tilted in Peak" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pPfJCgdxyaY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Even just my friend and I playing alone elicited so many funny moments involving cussing coming out of tiny scout mouths or dying unceremoniously, punctuated by the easy bantering back and forth that comes naturally to us after playing games together for nearly 10 years. The game is so well-designed for this kind of Laurel and Hardy relationship, even if no one will ever see it. It made me drift away from some of the cynicism I have around games seeking to create performance from content creators, rather than generating that impulse organically. What ultimately changed my mind is that <em>Peak</em>’s mechanics inspire teamwork as much as pranking your friends. It reminded me that <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/adventure/bing-bong-is-talking-to-you-peak-players-are-getting-jump-scared-by-what-seems-to-be-the-developers-possessing-a-little-green-plushie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">all adults love to play</a> and goof off, especially in the era when the spaces and frameworks we have for those things (especially in gaming) have largely been boxed into creating value for platforms.</p><p>Games are not always supposed to be fun, but I admire that games like <em>Peak</em> are leaning into that idea. The fact that there’s another gaming space that has a potential for communal mirth only makes me happier post-COVID, and I’ve become increasingly reliant on those things to bridge the gap in my social schedule when my friends all live far away. Spending hours messing up and laughing feels like a cathartic release for the kind of perfectionism a lot of the other games that I normally play demand from me—or perhaps what I demand from myself. When we do finally reach the goal, it feels so much the better.</p><figure><video controls="" src="https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2025/07/O1Um84eEL94eptSQqdGVzA.mp4"></video><figcaption>Nico Deyo</figcaption></figure><p>In the age of <a href="https://aftermath.site/friendslop-peak-lethal-company-social-media-discourse" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">social media</a> and digital video, any video game can have the potential to be funny even if unintentional, from streamers getting hit by a boulder during their first time in <em>Dark Souls</em> to random clips of people wiping out in Mario Kart. What <em>Peak</em> does is create a framework for the old Mel Brooks maxim about <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/mel-brooks-film-excerpt-the-difference-between-comedy-tragedy-is/2585/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">comedy and tragedy</a>, except the open sewer is instead a big rock. A game getting one over on us turns the experience from one of isolated frustration to a human moment where we’re all in on the joke.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/new-york-times-video-games-ai-nyt"><h3>The New York Times Will Never Learn</h3></a><p>We kept getting fed the same bullshit, and it’s being laundered in the same kind of stories</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/anime-manga-disney-jail-netflix-fragrant-flower"><h3>The World Is Conspiring Against Me Legally Experiencing The Fragrant Flower Blooms With Dignity</h3></a><p>The enshittification of manga and anime have reached absurd new heights, courtesy of Netflix and Kodansha’s collective bullshit.

			<p>PlayStation has <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/29/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-august-lies-of-p-day-z-my-hero-ones-justice-2/">announced</a> the three games that PS Plus subscribers from the entry-level Essential tier and up will be able to redeem, with Round 8's Lies of P as the headline game for August, and the only game with a native PS5 version available. </p>



<p>The other two games players will be able to redeem are the hardcore zombie survival game DayZ and the 3D arena fighting game My Hero One's Justice 2. All three titles will be available for players to redeem on August 5, 2025, which means that the last chance you'll have to redeem Diablo IV, Jusant, and The King of Fighters XV, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-celebrates-ps-plus-15-year-anniversary-reveals-july-2025-ps-plus-essential-games-including-diablo-iv-and-jusant/">three games for July,</a> is August 4, 2025.</p>

<p>Lies of P entering the service next week is perfect timing for players who've perhaps been looking at Round 8's excellent take on action-RPG games with a more lustful eye since the release of its recent DLC, Lies of P: Overture.</p>



<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lies-of-p-review/">Wccftech's Francesco De Meo reviewed Lies of P</a> at launch in 2023, he called it "<em>a solid imitation of FromSoftware's Bloodborne that manages to stay fun for the entire duration of a single playthrough of around 20 hours despite a marked lack of innovation.</em>" When he <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lies-of-p-overture-one-more-lie/">reviewed the Overture DLC</a> earlier this year, he called it "<em>an expansion in the true sense of the word,"</em> and "<em>a worthy purchase for those who loved the original and still want more.</em>"</p>



<p>Now you can get the base game for no extra cost beyond your existing PS Plus subscription, and pick up the DLC for a fraction of the cost of the original game. All together, not a bad deal for Bloodborne and FromSoftware fans who've not yet checked out Lies of P.</p>

Developer Ballistic Moon added a reworked prologue and adjusted the story's pacing so that several characters were given more screen time, threw in new collectibles to discover, and added several accessibility settings. Visually, the game also has updated character models, environments, visual effects, and animations alongside new interactive props and artistic changes that heighten the spooky atmosphere.</p>                      </div><p>Until Dawn's live-action movie adaptation released in April and finished its theatrical run with over $53 million worldwide. Not exactly a smash hit, but it brought in more than three times its $15 million budget. It's a fun horror movie and a solid take on the source material with some clever new ideas mixed in. Until Dawn's 4K Blu-ray edition released earlier this month for $50. Along with the 4K UHD disc, you'll get a standard Blu-ray disc, a code to redeem the digital edition, and a number of bonus materials that explore how this gruesome film was produced.</p><p>Here's the full list of Until Dawn special features:</p><ul><li>Adapting a Nightmare - Director David F.

                <p>News about the future of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4</a> doesn't sound like it will be coming soon, as Blizzard has said it will next update the community on what's next for its ARPG around the launch of Season 10.</p><p dir="ltr">In a reply to a fan on X asking for Diablo 4 updates, Diablo's director of social and content marketing Adam Fletcher <a href="https://x.com/PezRadar/status/1948505796410835265" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a> the following.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/PezRadar/status/1948505796410835265" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">We are in between seasons so nothing to share yet. Next update around PTR for S10/S10 Launch.</p>  — Adam Fletcher (@PezRadar) <a href="https://twitter.com/PezRadar/status/1948505796410835265?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 24, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">"We are in between seasons so nothing to share yet. Next update around PTR for S10/S10 launch," Fletcher said.</p><p dir="ltr">According to Diablo 4 Season 9's in-game timer, Season 10 is likely to start September 23. Typically, public test realm tests for a season are done several weeks prior, which would put the PTR around early September or perhaps late August. That means the game's next Campfire Chat, where Blizzard regularly outlines its future Diablo 4 plans, will be around that same time.</p><p dir="ltr">What that translates to is that, for about a month, there will likely be no news about what's next for Diablo 4. It's a bit confusing for fans, as a handful of Diablo 4 content creators recently revealed they attended a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-content-creators-just-got-a-secret-glimpse-of-the-games-future/1100-6533139/" data-ref-id="1100-6533139">Blizzard meeting on Diablo 4's future</a>. During the meeting they were shown what sounds like some of the significant changes fans have been asking to be currently in the works for Diablo 4.</p><p dir="ltr">News of the content creator meeting led many to believe some major announcements about how Blizzard will improve Diablo 4 to be imminent. Fletcher himself said in June that players' "warcries of wanting more change aren't going unnoticed," and stated that the team "has been cooking on some of the biggest changes that really hit home on things people have been asking for and more."</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-2025-roadmap-highlights-new-crossovers-endgame-updates/1100-6530666/" data-ref-id="1100-6530666">Diablo 4 2025 roadmap</a> states that Season 10, Infernal Chaos, will be the last season for 2025, and will bring changes to the game's Infernal Hordes activity, new seasonal powers, and a new IP crossover.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Those keen to get their hands on Xbox's recently announced handheld consoles ROG Ally and Ally X may be able to preorder the devices as of next month.</p>
<p>According to the ever reliable <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/rog-xbox-ally-on-vous-devoile-la-date-douverture-des-ventes-60300">Dealabs</a>, preorders will go live on 20th August. That's the day <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a> kicks off, with the convention in Cologne running between 20th and 24th August. During this time, attendees will be able to go <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsofts-xbox-branded-asus-handheld-finally-gets-an-official-reveal">hands-on with the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X</a>.</p>
<p>Dealabs added that the devices will be priced thus: €599 for the Xbox Ally and €899 for the Xbox Ally X. That's around £518 and £777 here in the UK. Current suggestion is Xbox's handheld devices will then be available in October, although an exact date has not yet been specified. Previously, Xbox said the devices would be available this "holiday" period, across select countries.</p>

<p>The Xbox ROG Ally and ROG Ally X are both powered by Windows 11, and feature an "immersive" full-screen Xbox experience, plus an aggregated gaming library with access to installed games from a range of PC stores, including Steam, Battle.net, and GOG. And, of course, the machine supports Xbox Play Anywhere titles, of which there are now over 1,000.</p>
<p>Those opting for the standard Xbox ROG Ally can expect an AMD Ryzen Z2 A Processor within, alongside 16GB of RAM and 512GB of SSD storage, while the Ally X upgrades that to an AMD Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme processor and 24GB of high-speed RAM.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Xbox laid out its Gamescom plans, when it confirmed that not only will those in attendance be able to give the ROG Ally and Ally X a shot, but also that<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-has-laid-out-its-gamescom-plans-and-they-include-a-playable-demo-of-hollow-knight-silksong"> its booth will include a playable demo of Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>.

            <p>Microsoft is implementing age verification for Xbox users, in compliance with the UK's new Online Safety Act.</p>
<p>From today, players aged 18 and over based in the UK and accessing Xbox with a Microsoft account will be encouraged to verify their age. This, Microsoft said, is a one-time process to ensure access to age-appropriate experiences.</p>
<p>Then, starting early next year, age verification will be required for players in the UK to retain full access to Xbox social features, such as game invites and communication via voice and text. Without age verification, use of social features will be limited to friends only.</p>
<p>Microsoft has detailed the process on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/07/28/xbox-age-verification-uk/">Xbox Wire</a>, including a QR code to scan to begin the age verification process away from a console. Secure methods include proof of government-issued ID, age estimation, mobile provider check, and credit card check.</p>
<p>"As this age verification process rolls out across the UK, we'll continue to evaluate how we can keep players around the world safe and learn from the UK process," reads the Xbox Wire post from Xbox vice president of gaming trust and safety Kim Kunes.</p>
<p>"We expect to roll out age verification processes to more regions in the future. There is no one-size-fits-all solution to player safety, so these methods may look different across regions and experiences. We'll work with local communities, publishing partners and regulators to determine the right approach that both respects player privacy and doesn't take away from the Xbox gameplay experience. We'll continue to communicate the changes we're making to our practices and the data we collect so we can better protect players on our platform."</p>
<p>Xbox advises parents and caregivers to set up child or teen accounts, which do not require age verification and allow for gaming activities to be managed appropriately, including screentime and spending limits.</p>
<p>At present, Sony and Nintendo have not implemented similar measures. Eurogamer has contacted both companies for details on how they will comply with the new UK Act.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-introduces-new-safety-features-including-an-ai-to-estimate-a-teenagers-age-through-video-selfies">Roblox recently implemented new safety features</a> to ensure it's compliant, including a new age estimation tool.</p>
<p>"Safety has always been foundational to everything we do at Roblox, and we've spent nearly two decades building advanced safety tools," a Roblox spokesperson told Eurogamer. "Our Community Standards prohibit various types of content including content defined as harmful to children under the OSA. For some time, we've made certain features accessible only to ID-verified users over the age of 17.</p>
<p>"Two weeks ago, as part of our global roadmap to deliver age-appropriate content and features, we introduced a new facial age estimation tool, which unlocks access for users 13 and over to communicate more freely with people they know and trust - adding to a suite of more than 40 recent safety updates, such as updated parental controls and communications restrictions for our youngest users, which we have rolled out over the past 12 months.</p>
<p>"We take our legal obligations seriously and are working hard on the assessment and implementation of the Children's Code and will continue to engage with Ofcom."</p>
<p>Years in the making, the UK's Online Safety Act came into effect last Friday. Its aim is to make the internet safer, especially for children, which will impact social media, video-sharing platforms, and video games.</p>
<p>To find out <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-online-safety-act-explainer">how the UK's Online Safety Act will impact the games industry</a>, Eurogamer spoke with the experts.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-users-will-now-need-to-verify-their-age-in-compliance-with-uks-online-safety-act]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Atari has agreed to acquire an 82% stake in Swedish indie publisher and developer Thunderful Games, purchasing shares worth SEK 50 million (around €4.5 million). Thunderful is best known for&nbsp;SteamWorld, Islanders and Lost in Random.</p>
<p>Sadly, a restructuring of the company’s studios will take place following the acquisition.</p>


<p>The purchase is subject to a shareholder vote, scheduled for 28th August, but has already received support of Thunderful’s Board of Directors and the two largest shareholders right now – Owe Bergsten and Brjann Sigurgeirsson – who currently hold 29.9% of the company’s capital and voting rights. The purchase is being made possible by issuing new shares, so their stake and voting rights going forward will be significantly diminished.</p>
<p>Wade Rosen, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Atari said, “This Transaction marks another important milestone in Atari’s development with the expansion of its publishing and development capabilities in the European region. Thunderful is recognized for publishing and developing critically acclaimed games, and with the announced transformation plan, as well as the quality and commitment of Thunderful’s teams, we are confident that Thunderful will be returning to a profitable growth path while helping to further develop Atari operations in Europe.”</p>

<p>Thunderful has a complicated business history, but boils down to having started as a merger between indie developers Image &amp; Form (best known for the SteamWorld series) and Zoink (Stick it to the Man!, Fe, Lost in Random), and Swedish retailer and distributor Bergsala in the 2019. In the following years, Thunderful has acquired more developers and publishers, including Headup Games (for a while), Coatsink and others, but the company has struggled in the last couple years. Through 2024, they made layoffs, divested Headup Games, and branched off the distribution businesses to make Thunderful Group a purely game development and game publishing entity, which is what Atari is now acquiring.</p>

			<p>Godbreakers is a new four-player co-op action hack'n'slash game from publisher <a href="https://wccftech.com/atari-to-acquire-82-6-stake-in-thunderful-group-with-e4-5-million-investment-amid-restructuring-and-layoffs/">Thunderful Games</a> and its subsidiary studio, To The Sky, and it'll be arriving on PS5 and PC through Steam and the Epic Games Store later this year. But you can play it right now if you want to, thanks to a demo currently available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2687400/GODBREAKERS/">Steam</a>.</p>



<p>Godbreakers sets players against an unbound and presumably evil artificial intelligence called Monad, whose legions of creatures you'll defeat by absorbing their powers and turning their own strength back on them. </p>



<p>The reveal trailer also shows how movement and learning enemy patterns seem key to gameplay, especially if you're taking on the challenge on your own.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>"<em>As the first title for our studio, we wanted to create a game that feels fast, fluid and fun, where every moment is a chance to unleash chaos alongside your friends,"</em> said chief executive officer and executive producer at To The Sky, Jugo Mirkovic, in a press release. </p>



<p>"<em>We’ve poured years worth of knowledge into crafting the best gameplay experience possible in&nbsp;</em><em>Godbreakers,</em>&nbsp;and we’re so excited to finally share it with the world."</p>



<p>Though there's no release date currently set for Godbreakers, the fact that there's a demo already available when Thunderful and To The Sky are announcing the game is a strong sign that they'll be able to hit its 2025 release window. Hopefully we'll have an official release date to look forward to soon.</p>
