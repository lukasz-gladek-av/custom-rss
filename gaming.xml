		<p>Nightmare Frontier wants you to live in fear. Not of its genre-mashing tactical-extraction-looter setup, but of the terrifying creatures that spawn from your characters’ fears. This is one collection of gameplay styles that feel as though they shouldn’t work together, but, in practice, this is a tight, thoughtful tactical game, that has you thinking multiple levels, rather than moves, ahead.</p>
<p>In Nightmare Frontier, you’re tasked with leading a team through a progressively tough series of missions, advancing through the 1900s-based fictional American city that the game is set in. Lead developer, Mateusz Pilski, tells me, “It’s basically infinite, but you have to plan ahead and make a decision when to extract your team, because you lose everything if you die.”</p>
<p><iframe title="Nightmare Frontier || Official Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dFoqfJ0CTwg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The route follows a branching path, with each step giving you a string of options to choose from. They’ll each tell you what kind of loot you might get, or what modifiers are active, or they might be a special location where you can partially heal up the more battered members of your team. Straightaway, you can see the risk and reward of your route selection, and before you’ve even set foot in a stage, there’s something to think about.</p>
<p>Those stages are tight and enclosed. Seemingly, this is to promote short, sharp battles, and also to provide tactical choices from the off, getting you straight into the action. It also allows you to utilise one of the most important aspects of Nightmare Frontier’s combat: collisions. Similar games like Marvel’s Midnight Suns, this is a tactical game that embraces impact, and factors it in.</p>

<p>What that means in practice is that a punch from your character will send an enemy sprawling back, and while you can move into their space to press their advantage, they’ll also take more damage from colliding with barrels, crates and other enemies that might lie in their path. If it’s another enemy then they’ll take damage as well.</p>

<p>You’ll really want to press that advantage too, as Nightmare Frontier rewards you with an additional action for every enemy you kill. This means that, in theory, your team could clear a stage in one go with careful planning and thought. These levels are as much of a puzzle as they are a tactical battlefield, and it works especially well to keep up the pace, and that frenzied feeling of being right on the edge.</p>
<p>Frenzy extends into the gameplay itself as well. As you progress further into the city, the Nightmare level rises, and the enemies will get progressively tougher the longer you stay in this horrific place. They’ll gain additional boons, like entering a frenzied, more powerful state, until they’re even more terrifying than they were to start with.</p>
<p>As the enemies are drawn from the character’s nightmares, they’re an undeniably horrible bunch. Our playthrough saw us facing off against the terrifying Wendigo, an avenging, deer-headed, antlered spirit. These huge enemies were more than capable of wasting our team in moments, and I relied on the fact that you can reverse every decision you’ve made in a stage to retry my strategy multiple times. Wraiths and other supernatural creatures also lie waiting for you in the shadows of each level, and for the foolhardy, your run is likely to come to a swift end.</p>

<p>You’ll need your loot, though. Through each run you can collect and equip different weaponry and items to help increase your chances of success, hoping to get out with everything you’ve collected, rather than leaving it behind with the beaten remains of your team. Here, during our hands-on, it already feels great, and I can see it becoming something of an obsession as it reaches completion.</p>
<p>Visually, Nightmare Frontiers is doing absolutely everything right. Its terrifying, horrific beasts are suitably gruesome and showcase a clear sense of purpose and vision, while the downtrodden remains of a 1900s town, provide a fitting, if overly brown, locale for the tactical battles to play out.</p>
<p>Nightmare Frontiers has immediately made its way into my wishlist, with its unexpected mix of genres proving tantalising in action. If you fancy trying it out for yourself, there’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3310950/Nightmare_Frontier/">a demo that’s just become available on Steam</a> that gives you a taste of the looter strategy extraction genre before the game enters Early Access sometime this month.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2%E2%80%99s-ram-storage-and-nvidia-dlss-support-let-it-surpass-playstation-4-according-to-cd-projekt-red-vp-of-technology.1204335/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-ram-storage-dlss-push-past-playstation-4/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 may be comparable to the PlayStation 4 in terms of system specifications, but some of its features allow the system to push past the quality level offered by the previous-generation system.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-cd-projekt-red-got-cyberpunk-2077-running-on-switch-2">IGN</a> about the soon-to-be-released <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-early-comparisons/">Nintendo Switch 2 version of Cyberpunk 2077</a>, CD Projekt Red VP of Technology Charles Tremblay commented on the development of the port, which began in Summer 2023, and some of the challenges the developer had to overcome to get the game running on the system, such as the many changes that had to be done on the engine level due to the system using a different architecture than the x86 architecture upon which the game was built. NVIDIA DLSS was also a key tool in ensuring the game could run as well as possible on the Nintendo Switch 2, allowing CDPR to bring the quality to another level, besides their technology scaling well across all platforms.</p>
<p>NVIDIA DLSS is just one of the Nintendo Switch 2 features that allow the system to push past the PlayStation 4 level of quality. According to Tremblay, the biggest problem with previous-generation consoles was the mechanical drive, an issue the next-generation Nintendo console doesn't have. The increased amount of available RAM is another thing that helps the Nintendo Switch 2 push past the PlayStation 4 level of quality, as it allows not only Cyberpunk 2077 to run better on the system, but also to have the Phantom Liberty expansion included in this new version of the game.</p>
<p>While Cyberpunk 2077 on Nintendo Switch 2 is not comparable to the PC version in terms of visuals, and it was never intended to be the goal, CD Projekt Red has ensured it will be a very enjoyable experience tailored to the platform, with a 30 FPS that promises to stick to the target, and a 40 FPS which the CDPR VP of Technology feels that is a good compromise to the standard 60 FPS offered by most modern console games.</p>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077 launches on Nintendo Switch 2 this week, on June 5th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-cancelled-black-panther-game-would-have-featured-an-evolved-take-on-shadow-of-mordors-nemesis-system<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Towards the end of last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/despite-black-panther-cancellation-ea-still-has-at-least-three-marvel-games-in-the-works">EA cancelled its single-player Black Panther game and closed the developer behind it</a>, Cliffhanger Studios. At this time, an email seen by the media said this decision would enable the publisher to "sharpen our focus and put our creative energy behind the most significant growth opportunities".</p>
<p>Since then, a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-05-30/why-ea-canceled-a-new-black-panther-video-game-and-closed-cliffhanger-studios?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0ODYyODA1OSwiZXhwIjoxNzQ5MjMyODU5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTWDM2MEFEV1JHRzAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.5NJqkn46ldc6n5M7d2faM7HRVe-P6bpFT21kj1vHHl8&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg</a> report has revealed a few more details from Cliffhanger Studios' now-cancelled Marvel game, including that the project was looking to build upon ideas from Monolith's Shadow of Mordor game, such as its Nemesis System. The Nemesis system is a clever in-game mechanic, which in Shadow of Mordor tracks a player's actions to create enemies who remember past encounters.</p>
<p>Cliffhanger was going to expand on this mechanism, with playable heroes such as T'Challa, Killmonger and Shuri all competing to earn the title of Black Panther. According to the report, players would select one character to play as, with the others then becoming rivals they could build a relationship with.</p>
<p>Additionally, Cliffhanger's Black Panther game would feature Marvel's fictional race of extraterrestrial shapeshifters, the Skrulls. In the game, the Skrulls would be attempting to invade Wakanda, with some of the alien creatures posing as allies. Meanwhile, other members of the Skrulls "might have remembered the player's behaviour and acted accordingly, sort of like in Shadow of Mordor," the report stated, calling it an "ambitious system".</p>
<p>However, despite its vision, the Black Panther developer had a hard time showcasing the game's procedural narrative experiments, with those close to the project stating that processes were slowed due to the team building both a new game and a new studio at the same time.</p>
<p>Reportedly, the game had begun gaining more momentum prior to its shock cancellation, with many of those laid off only being hired within the last year. However, according to sources, EA executives had been left frustrated by the fact the game had not yet left the pre-production phase, despite it being in the works for nearly four years.</p>

<p>While EA may have cancelled its Black Panther Project, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-confirms-iron-man-single-player-game-in-the-works">the company still has an Iron Man game in the pipeline</a>. In October 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-iron-man-part-of-three-game-marvel-deal">EA signed a multi-game deal with Marvel</a>.</p>
<p>Away from EA, Amy Hennig's own Black Panther-starring game is also still in development. Known as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</a>, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amy-hennigs-marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-delayed-into-next-year">upcoming release is slated for next year</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-a-jaw-dropping-look-at-amy-hennigs-new-captain-america-and-black-panther-game">will focus on four central characters</a>: a young Steve Rogers, AKA Captain America; Azzuri, T'Challa's grandfather and the WWII-era Black Panther; Gabriel Jones, a US soldier and member of the Howling Commandos; and Nanali, a Wakandan spy embedded in Occupied Paris.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A new trailer has been released for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-2025-conference-schedule-all-dates-times-streams">Summer Game Fest</a> ahead of the event this Friday. This montage of big releases - some already playable, others highly anticipated - is clearly a tone setter for the annual gaming showcase, set to kick off a weekend of new trailers and reveals.</p>
<p>Some notable titles featured in this sizzle reel include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune Awakening</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing: Crossworlds</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mafia-the-old-country">Mafia: The Old Country</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marathon">Marathon</a> will also be making an appearance too, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-morale-reportedly-in-free-fall-as-it-grapples-with-stolen-marathon-assets-fallout">its first since an art plagiarism scandal reportedly left morale at Bungie in "free fall"</a>.</p>
<p>As for representation from games you can just go out and buy right now, you've got titles like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</a>. It's unclear as of yet what sort of presence these games will have at the show, but one can assume smaller updates, post-launch content, and so on.</p>

<p>Indeed many of the games briefly shown off in this new trailer will likely be making some manner of appearance at the show. We know of course that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojimas-upcoming-death-stranding-2-panel-and-gameplay-showcase-will-be-streamed-online">Death Stranding 2 is getting its own premiere</a> separate from the main Summer Game Fest stage on June 8, and <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1927754199594307658">thanks to a recent Twitter post by Summer Game Fest founder and host Geoff Keighley</a> we know 2K will be there, hopefully with Mafia in hand.</p>
<p>Of course that same tweet does point towards other big studios that surely will be dropping something exciting during the weekend. Studios like Bandai Namco, Capcom, Digital Extremes, Embark and far more have logos proudly spread across official Summer Game Fest material.</p> <div>

			<p>A new Elden Ring Nightreign patch has gone live today, introducing changes to the single-player mode, tweaked Relics rewards, and some bug fixes.</p>
<p>The 1.01.1 patch, which is a little over 131 MB big on Steam, introduces the promised balance changes for the game's single-player mode, such as the introduction of the Automatic Revival Upon Defeat effect, which revives the Nightfarer once per night boss and an increase in runes gained, which should both make things slightly easier for solo players.</p>
<p>The new Elden Ring Nightreign patch also introduces some general balance changes, increasing the number of high-rarity Relics that can be obtained as a reward for reaching Day 3 and the increased probability of obtaining them from purchasing Scenic Flat stones from the Small Jar Bazaar. The patch also addresses a variety of bugs, including some PC-specific bugs like graphics not rendering properly at the low quality setting, and issues with Climb Up actions. You can find the full details about the fixes introduced by the new patch <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-notes-version-1011?utm_source=SM_Official&amp;utm_medium=official_post&amp;utm_campaign=NIGHTREIGN-Patch1011">here.</a></p>
<p>Elden Ring Nightreign is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One. You can learn more about one of FromSoftware's most interesting games by checking out my<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/"> review.</a></p>
<p><em>Elden Ring: Nightreign is one of the most unique titles ever developed by FromSoftware, and arguably one of their best to date. Adapting the traditionally slow-paced Souls formula into a fast-paced, co-op-focused experience with roguelike elements was no easy feat, but the Japanese studio has fully delivered, once again proving why they remain masters of their craft.</em></p>

            <p>Sci-fi action-RPG Hell is Us will receive a demo later today on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1620730/Hell_is_Us/">Steam</a>, ahead of its release in September.</p>
<p>The demo will be available from 2nd - 16th June but won't be available on console due to "technical constraints". <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1620730/view/515211349279638275">Said developer Rogue Factor</a>: "Please rest assured: Hell is Us will launch simultaneously on PC and consoles, with the same content and the same level of polish. Development is progressing equally across all platforms - this limitation only concerns the demo."</p>
<p>The demo will take place at the start of the game and offer players a taste of its gameplay, though Rogue Factor promises some "key elements, like exploration and the player plattering experience, truly come into their own as the world opens up and the layers unfold".</p>

<p>So what is Hell is Us? The game has been shown at a couple of PlayStation State of Play events - it's a new action-RPG from Mordheim studio Rogue Factor, combining soulslike combat with dungeons filled with puzzles and survival gameplay.</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>It's all set in a hostile land without a map or quest markers, meaning players will need to focus carefully on exploration, while battling supernatural creatures due to a mysterious calamity.</p>
<p>And while the soulslike combat is meant to be challenging, the demo will have three difficulty levels and further customisation options.</p>

<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1620730/view/515211349279638277">PC specs</a> have been revealed as per the image above. Recommended specs are as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Graphic Settings:</strong> 1080P 60 FPS AVG High Settings</p>
<p><strong>GPU:</strong> "NVIDIA RTX 2080Ti 11GB or AMD RX 6750 XT 12GB</p>
<p><strong>CPU:</strong> Intel i7-11700K or AMD Ryzen 5 7600</p>
<p><strong>RAM:</strong> 16GB</p>
<p><strong>OS:</strong> Windows 10 - 64bit</p>
<p><strong>STORAGE:</strong> 30GB SSD</p>
<p>The Ultra settings on PC suggest an NVIDA RTX 4090, but note this will still be at 30fps.</p>
<p>Eurogamer's Lottie Lynn went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/atmospheric-slasher-hell-is-us-abandons-maps-and-quest-markers-and-channels-brilliant-immersion-in-return">hands-on with Hell is Us</a> at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a> last year and was impressed with its immersive exploration.</p>
<p>"The narrative already has me hooked - the human story of a country drowned in war, its people barely surviving, running alongside a supernatural mystery of unknown horrors emerging from the dark - while combat mechanics show excellent promise for when Hell is Us is released next year. But it's that twist on navigation that brings the real magic of a chilling atmosphere."</p>
<p>Hell is Us will release on 4th September across PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/atmospheric-slasher-hell-is-us-lands-september-release-date-as-well-deus-exs-elias-toufexis">game's protagonist Rémi is voiced by Elias Toufexis</a>, best known as Adam Jensen from the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deus-ex">Deus Ex</a> series.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Resident Evil 9 has high chance of being revealed during this year's Summer Game Fest, according to a reliable insider.</p>
<p>Speaking on <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X</a> today, well-known insider Dusk Golem said that, while they cannot 100% confirm it, they are like 95% positive that the next main entry in the survival-horror series by CAPCOM will be revealed during Summer Game Fest. This assumption is based on the fact that this is the first time behind the scenes that there's a lot of buzz in the grapevine, lots of rumblings, and the type of activity that is usually a sign that a new Resident Evil game is being announced very soon. Hopefully, the insider is correct, and we will finally see exactly how Resident Evil 9 will <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-reinvention-series/">reinvent the series</a> in a few days.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">(1/3) Again, not like I can give 100% confirmation, no one's directly told me or the like. But at this point I'm like 95% positive we're on the verge of RE9 being revealed at SGF. This is the first time behind the scenes there's a lot of buzz in the grapevine, lots of rumblings <a href="https://t.co/5po7XsOsVA">https://t.co/5po7XsOsVA</a></p>
<p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1929468556498153933?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">(3/3) and I'd say if you're tuning into Summer Game Fest on June 6th hoping that Resident Evil 9 will show up, there's an incredibly high chance you won't be disappointed. I'm getting into hype mode for it myself.</p>
<p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1929468559148605517?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Resident Evil 9 has been in development for quite some time, and the game went through different iterations before becoming the game we will likely be able to play <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-still-reportedly-planned-for-2025-reveal-and-2026-launch/">next year</a>. Back in 2017, the game started development as an <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-open-world-multiplayer-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open-world multiplayer game</a> that was meant to be the exact opposite of Resident Evil VII: Biohazard, which wasn't doing too well on the market. In 2021, development was rebooted, and most of the original version's concept and features were scrapped, though the final game still retains some elements of the premise and Leon as the main protagonist.</p>
<p>This year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/summer-game-fest-has-record-setting-60-partners-for-this-years-showcase/">Summer Game Fest show</a>, where Resident Evil 9 has a high chance of making an appearance, airs&nbsp;later this week on June 6th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/hi-fi-rush-developer-tango-gameworks-launches-new-website-starts-hiring-for-unannounced-action-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hi-fi-rush-stealing-the-show-with-style-sss/">Hi-Fi Rush</a> and The Evil Within series development studio Tango Gameworks launched its new website today to celebrate the studio's rebranding and the start of hiring for its next unannounced project.</p>
<p>The studio's new website, which can be reached <a href="https://tangogameworks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, features the studio's new logo, representing the beginning of a new era for the developer and the studio's vision as a "creative workshop." As mentioned above, the studio now also has several open positions for the development of an unannounced action game that will likely be the sequel to the popular Hi-Fi Rush.</p>
<p>Tango Gameworks was originally shut down<a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-a-couple-more-bethesda-softworks-studios/"> last year</a>, together with Arkane Austin and a few other studios. While the closure of the developer of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/redfall-dishonored-meets-far-cry/">Redfall</a> didn't exactly come as a shock, considering how the game failed to deliver on all fronts, the closure of the Hi-Fi Rush and The Evil Within development studio was way more surprising, considering the success of their action game and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tango-gameworks-seemingly-had-at-least-one-unannounced-title-in-the-works-ex-programmer-resume-mentions/">the unannounced projects</a> that were seemingly in the works. Thankfully, the Japanese Studio didn't stay disbanded for long, as it was acquired by Krafton, PUBG's publisher, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tango-gameworks-and-its-hi-fi-rush-ip-have-just-been-acquired-by-pubgs-krafton/">last August</a>, alongside the intellectual property of the popular action game. The other franchises developed by the studio, The Evil Within and Ghostwire Tokyo, are still owned by Microsoft, so it may be a long time before we see new entries in the series, if ever.</p>

  </p>

    

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gears-of-war-e-day">Gears Of War: E-Day</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/outriders">Outriders</a> developers People Can Fly are cancelling two video game projects and laying people off due to "a lack of communication" from one game's publisher, and "a lack of prospects for securing organizational resources and funds" for the other.</p><!--more-->
<p>The projects in question were codenamed Gemini and Bifrost. It's not clear what either of them involved. People Can Fly haven't named the aforementioned publisher, but Square Enix were <a href="https://peoplecanfly.com/strategy-update/">listed as Gemini's publishers back in January 2023</a>. Here's a gristly slab of industryspeak from CEO Sebastian Wojciechowski, via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/people-can-fly_important-update-from-sebastian-wojciechowski-activity-7334906069715972096-lZaD?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAANxzosB8Nu3u0E3e0D-T9TYAyXUCoJsByM">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>"The suspension of the Gemini project is a consequence of the fact that the Publisher has not presented us with a draft of the subsequent content rider to the Publishing Agreement covering the terms and conditions of further milestones on project Gemini and the lack of communication from the Publisher as to its willingness to continue or terminate the Gemini project."</p></blockquote>
<p>To rephrase the above in language my puny microchip-deficient brain can withstand, Wojciechowski is essentially saying that the publishers have stopped talking and left the developers in doubt about whether they want to publish the game at all. For context, a rider is an addition or amendment to a primary contract. As for "further milestones", this presumably refers to an agreement on what the publishers would pay People Can Fly in return for reaching certain stages in the game's development. </p>
<p>As for Bifrost, this "was suspended due to the above and the analysis of the Group's cash flow, which showed a lack of prospects for securing organizational resources and funds necessary to continue the production and release of this project," Wojciechowski continues.</p>
<p>"As a result, we have to significantly regroup as a studio and scale down our teams, which hurts the most."</p>
<p>This is the latest in a string of cancellations and layoffs from People Can Fly. In January last year, they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/people-can-fly-and-black-forest-games-hit-by-layoffs-according-to-sources-and-leaked-emails">dismissed 30 people</a> who were working on Gemini. In April 2024, they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bulletstorm-and-outriders-studio-have-cancelled-development-on-a-co-op-action-rpg">washed their hands of Project Dagger</a>, a Take-Two Interactive joint. And in December 2024, they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bulletstorm-and-painkiller-devs-people-can-fly-let-over-120-people-go-and-suspend-or-downsize-projects">laid off over 120 people</a> and shelved another game. All this followed a period of expansion that saw the studio grow to over 600 people and seven projects as of July 2023.</p>
<p>Gears Of War: E-Day (aka Project Maverick) is a return to roots, of sorts - back in 2011-2013, People Can Fly collaborated with original Gears devs Epic on Gears Of War: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/judgment">Judgment</a>, though how much of the Judgment team remains at PCF is anybody's guess. As Coalition studio head Mike Crump <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bulletstorm-and-painkiller-devs-people-can-fly-to-co-develop-gears-of-war-e-day-following-spate-of-layoffs-and-cancellations-last-year">commented back at announcement</a>, "we’re pleased to be partnering with the talented folks at People Can Fly who have been a part of our franchise’s legacy for so long.”</p>
<p>While the scale of the layoffs is undetermined, a number of former Bifrost and Gemini contributors have spoken publicly about their time with People Can Fly, praising the departing staffers on LinkedIn.</p>
<p>"Although I was only part of Project Bifrost for two short weeks before being laid off last Dec, I could clearly see how talented, passionate, and capable the team was," <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lipan-liu-rock-d-1a15aa95_important-update-from-sebastian-wojciechowski-activity-7334986446140776448-PYWW?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAANxzosB8Nu3u0E3e0D-T9TYAyXUCoJsByM">writes</a> concept artist Lipan Liu. "It was a group filled with amazing developers, and the project itself had so much potential. It's hard to believe it ended this way."</p>
<p>Writer and designer James B Jones <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jamesbertonjones_important-update-from-sebastian-wojciechowski-activity-7334982833700032512-9N_h?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAANxzosB8Nu3u0E3e0D-T9TYAyXUCoJsByM">adds</a> that "though my time at PCF was relatively brief, the folks I worked with on Project Gemini were S-tier talent and even better people." Best of luck to all affected.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>New Elden Ring Nightreign mods shared online over the past few days address some of the game's biggest issues, making the experience more enjoyable for PC players.</p>
<p>The first of these new mods is the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenringnightreign/mods/25" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UnlockTheFPS mod</a>, a fork of the same mod developed for the original Elden Ring, which allows players to set a maximum FPS value. As the vanilla game is unsurprisingly locked at 60 FPS, this mod is highly welcome for all those who want to play the game at higher framerates.</p>
<p>The Elden Ring Nightreign UnlockTheFPS mod is fully compatible with another mod that was<a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-mod/"> teased</a> shortly after the game launched last week, the<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenringnightreign/mods/3"> Seamless Co-op mod</a>, which introduces a two-player mode. As this mod doesn't connect to the matchmaking servers and uses a different save file from progression, it is also safe to use without getting banned.</p>
<p>As the entire experience was balanced around co-op, Elden Ring Nightreign is quite challenging in solo mode, and many are struggling even getting to the final day without the help of other players or being forced to use certain Nightfarers and strategies. While a patch is coming at some point this week to introduce some balance changes for solo play, those who do not want to wait can test out the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenringnightreign/mods/34?tab=files">Balancing For Solo Players mod</a>, which introduces better stats scaling per level and reduces received damage considerably.</p>
<p>Elden Ring Nightreign is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One. You can learn more about the game by checking out my<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/"> review.</a></p>

			<p>Yet another <a href="https://wccftech.com/more-battlefield-6-gameplay-has-leaked-with-over-90-minutes-of-ps5-gameplay-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Battlefield 6 video</a> has been leaked on YouTube. It's a six-minute-long footage that primarily shows off the amazing destruction that players will see in the upcoming installment of the military first-person shooter franchise.</p>
<p>Battlefield games have become synonymous with destruction since 2008's Bad Company, which featured the debut of DICE's Frostbite engine. However, 2021's failed Battlefield 2042 toned it down considerably. With the new game, DICE seems to be focusing on one of the IP's most distinctive features once again.</p>
<p>As a reminder, DICE is being helped by Motive Studios, Ripple Effect Studios, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-co-developed-criterion-need-for-speed-on-hold/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Criterion</a> on Battlefield 6.</p>
<p><iframe title="Battlefield 6 Destruction Full HD" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/naqI1yhobIU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>One of those teams, Motive Studios (which recently did the Dead Space remake and is also working on an Iron Man game), is in charge of the campaign mode of Battlefield 6. In a recent interview, the Creative Director (Roman Campos-Oriola) and Executive Producer (Philippe Ducharme) mentioned influences from Alex Garland's Civil War film and the TV show Lioness. They also detailed some of the themes that will be featured in the story:</p>
<p><em><strong>Campos-Oriola:</strong> The elements we’re really interested in is the concept of talented but ordinary people put in extraordinary situations. That creates a very interesting dynamic in terms of relationships with other people. These are elements we’re looking to capture in the single player.</em></p>
<p>Motive is also looking to bring over the team's mentality acquired during the development of the Dead Space remake to Battlefield 6.</p>
<p><em><strong>Campos-Oriola:</strong> Dead Space allowed us to know the quirks and strengths that we all have, and how we complement each other as a team.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Ducharme:</strong> On Dead Space, we talked a lot about the curve of tension. How to go from beat to beat, having the highs and the lows to keep players hooked, and even play with their expectations a little bit. It’s obviously very different in a game like Battlefield. But we still brought that mentality over.</em></p>
<p>Electronic Arts has confirmed that Battlefield 6 will be officially unveiled this Summer.</p>

            <p>You know how it is: you rush to the bus stop because you think you're going to miss it, then it arrives 12 years late. Typical. The makers of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/euro-truck-simulator-2">Euro Truck Simulator 2</a> have shown off a short trailer with a big shiny European coach in it. It confirms that the sim will add driveable buses in some form soon, fulfilling a long-forgotten tease that was first made by the developers back in the cloudy days of 2013. </p>

<p>The trailer was included in a brief <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/227300/view/547862446583318213?snr=1_5_9_">update post on Steam</a>, showing a big white bus pulling out from behind a Scania truck. Surprise! The game is basically now Euro Truck And/Or Bus Simulator 2. </p>
<p>"We’ve crossed borders, hauled freight, and explored countless cities across Europe," say developers SCS Software. "But just like any great journey, the road is always full of surprises. Something different is pulling into view, a new way to experience the world of Euro Truck Simulator 2. See you at the next stop."</p>
<p>The devs haven't said exactly what form the buses will take, or which lurching road carriages will appear (please, not Megabus) but it'll likely be a big DLC pack. It is the culmination of a desire the developers seem to have harboured for over a decade. They first pondered the possibility of adding buses back in February 2013, writing in <a href="https://blog.scssoft.com/2013/02/a-coach-bus.html">a blog post</a> they were "exploring an opportunity to go beyond just trucks" and saying they were off "recording sounds and taking tons of photos of a Scania Touring HD Bus". But it looks like those plans got delayed on the roadside until now. </p>
<p>It's a pleasant possibility to some but not surprising to all. Some players have noted the appearance of more detailed bus stops along their usual trucking routes in recent updates, and say the bussification of the sim makes sense. Although others in the game's Steam forums seem grumpy that buses aren't getting their own dedicated sim. However you feel, it's a move that's in keeping with the studio's recent plans for their other sim, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/american-truck-simulator">American Truck Simulator</a>, which plans to introduce driveable pickup trucks and other smaller cars as part of <a href="https://blog.scssoft.com/2025/04/project-road-trip.html">a "Road Trip" expansion</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/warhammer-40-000-speed-freeks-review.1204236/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/02/warhammer-40000-speed-freeks-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Orks screaming “Red wunz go fasta!” as they smash their bashed-together death-bringing vehicles into each other is part of the fundamental vision of the Warhammer 40,000 universe. Nearly 30 years ago, Games Workshop released a game called Gorkamorka, a game of vehicular carnage – basically the tabletop version of Twisted Metal – that was a bright, but short-lived flame amongst the grim darkness of the Imperium. It was fun, and I liked it, not least because it was basically Destruction Derby with green idiots and guns.</p>
<p>Here we are in 2025 with Warhammer 40,000: Speed Freeks, a game of vehicular carnage that makes good on Gorkamorka’s original promise, but without any of that pesky painting, dice, or having to use a ruler. It is, like its Orkish stars, pretty straightforward, but there’s a lot of fun to be found in its arena battling and racing.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Speed Freeks Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s2_3ZKi1ZRE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>You, and your team of green-skinned online buddies – or random people you’ll never hear from again – are dropped into different arenas to do battle. You’re given a selection of vehicle types, armed with boosts, special abilities and a variety of guns and bombs, and you want to blow up the enemy team’s cars more often than they blow yours up.</p>
<p>There’s two main modes here, with Deff Rally – seriously, Orks can’t spell anything – tasking players with racing to different waypoints while trying to destroy each other. You earn points for your team by making it to the waypoint first, or by blowing up enemy drivers, and both tactics seem like legitimate choices, hopefully sharing the roles between your team.</p>

<p>There’s a batch of different vehicles to choose from, with each boasting their own unique set of abilities, as well as different stats for speed, damage and armour. They broadly fit into classes like any other multiplayer shooter, so slower, more heavily armoured tanks are… well, they’re tanks, while faster damage dealers take the role of DPS. I found myself gravitating to support, as I often do, and it’s a great vehicle class that launches explosive Squigs for damage, or alternate ones that can heal your teammates.</p>

<p>The second main mode is Kill Konvoy, and it’s easily my favourite of the two. Combining Capture The Flag with Deathmatch, there’s two giant Stompas – hulking great Ork mechs – and they’re moving steadily towards a finish line. Your aim is to collect bombs and drive them straight up to these mechs’ feet, with each successful detonation slowing the Stompa down and giving your team the advantage.</p>
<p>There’s a great push and pull to these encounters, as you frantically try to get your teammate with the bomb to the enemy Stompa, while the enemy team aim to stop you by any means necessary, while doing the same things. It’s glorious, chaotic fun, and it gets your heart racing as fast as your war buggy.</p>

<p>Speed Freeks was set to be a free-to-play game, but as Wired Productions stepped in to publish it, they’ve altered the business model to make it it a single payment release. There’s a faint aftertaste of the free-to-play model that existed through the open beta, and Speed Freeks is undoubtedly a relatively slim game because of it; there’s two main modes, two free battle pass pathways, and a series of unlockable cosmetics and further vehicles. You will have grasped the fundamentals within a couple of hours and unlocked a chunk of its wares a few hours later.&nbsp;That said, it’s launched at an extremely reasonable £12.99, and even once the introductory offer is done, £19.99 is a great jumping on price for what is a hugely enjoyable multiplayer experience.</p>
<p>That’s even more true if you have any love whatsoever for Warhammer 40,000 – especially Gorkamorka – and there’s a lightness of tone that you’re not getting from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/04/space-marine-2-review-warhammer-40k/">Space Marine 2</a> or <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/12/19/warhammer-40000-darktide-review/">Warhammer 40,000: Darktide</a>.</p>

<p>There aren’t loads of multiplayer vehicular combat options right now, and Speed Freeks feels like something of a throwback to a simpler time. There’s unlockables, a sense of progression, and a heap of multiplayer shenanigans, but it feels less serious and less regimented than we’re probably used to. It’s just… well, fun.</p>
<p>Speed Freeks is a perfect example of how smaller, more focused, multiplayer titles can find a place in the swollen games market. It’s all the better for losing its free-to-play status, and it deserves to find a committed community of players. Here’s hoping that it’ll find its way to console, as I think it’s a great fit for pick up and play action, especially for people who want to play online, without having to devote their entire life and personality to gaining access to the next tier league or justifying a battle pass purchase.</p>

			<p>We're now officially less than a year from the release date of GTA VI, provided that there are no further delays, that is. Even GTA V modders are starting to look with anticipation at Rockstar's massively anticipated sequel; Razed, the creator of the stunning <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-v-enhanced-edition-natural-vision-enhanced-mod-next-gen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NaturalVision visual overhaul mod</a> for Grand Theft Auto V, has discussed the upcoming game's modding potential <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/grand-theft-auto/according-to-steam-i-have-around-10-000-hours-logged-says-the-modder-whos-spent-a-decade-turning-gta-5-into-a-photo-realistic-wonderland/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in an interview with PC Gamer</a>.</p>
<p><em>I think modding is going to be bigger than ever once GTA VI eventually drops on PC. I'm hopeful Rockstar will give players official tools to mod the game, especially with the direction they're heading with FiveM. There's a ton of potential here. Imagine if they took a page out of Bethesda's playbook and introduced a proper marketplace for user-generated content. It could benefit both mod creators and Rockstar in a big way. I'd like to see something like that happen.</em></p>
<p><em>I'd love to create mods for GTA VI, but it still feels a little too early to get into the specifics of what that might look like. Honestly, I don't think visual overhaul mods will be in high demand this time around. The game already looks incredible. If anything, I think I'd really enjoy making content for people to use on their custom servers, like exterior map packs or custom interiors.</em></p>
<p>Razed was referring to the popular FiveM roleplaying servers that Rockstar originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-bans-users-affiliation-fivem-gta-multiplayer-mod/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">banned</a> and later <a href="https://wccftech.com/previously-banned-gta-5-fivem-and-rdr2-redm-creators-are-now-part-of-rockstar-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired</a>. It is indeed likely to see them playing a major role in Grand Theft Auto VI, at least on PC. There was even a <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-reportedly-planning-fortnite-roblox-style-ugc-push/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumor</a> recently that Rockstar was indeed looking to place a much bigger focus on Roblox-style user-generated content.</p>
<p>Of course, PC gamers will have to wait longer to actually play the game, although the CEO of Corsair Gaming previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-pc-might-launch-early-next-year-according-to-corsair/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that it could be just a few months rather than a full year before the PC version is released. For PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X, GTA VI is now <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scheduled to debut on May 26, 2026</a>.</p>

            <p>We might rightly judge Batman Arkham-style combat by how cool the counters make you feel, what with the core of it melting into second-nature rhythmic meditation that renders you basically unkillable after a few minutes of practice. You will win the fight. This is guaranteed. The combat is designed to make you win. Usually the second tutorial prompt is "here's the button that makes you win. Don't worry if you don't know when to press it. We'll tell you".</p>
<p>Likewise, you will win the fights in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-as-disco">Dead As Disco</a>'s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3404260/Dead_as_Disco/">Steam demo</a>. Maybe the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> after the demo gets harder. I dare not predict the future. But this is not the important part. The important part is that you will feel very cool as you easily win. You can hold down a button to beat your enemies with a glowstick that hits about three times to every beat in the music. It feels like doing violence with a turbo maraca made of steel and also filled with steel balls. You can also import your own music, so maybe this doesn't exactly line up with, say, <a href="https://youtu.be/qc98u-eGzlc">Meshuggah's Bleed</a>. But it certainly lines up with Michael Sembello's She's A Maniac. Here's a trailer.</p>

<p>There are two types of finishers. Two. One you can do just before an attack to counter, and another you can do just after a dodge. Each one displays more physical activity than I have performed this year, combined. But you can just keep doing them. Such is the power of disco. Also, your enemies dance when the stage starts. Also also, one of the stages has dangerous trains. Does hearing about dangerous trains make you hungry? Understandable. Here's a menu of features.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Fight to music:</strong> attack, dodge, and take-down enemies in perfect sync with the music. Master the musical path of each Idol to unlock new talents, moves, and dances. The groove isn’t just for the show: it’s your ultimate Beat Kune Do.</p>
<p><strong>Rockstar Customizatio</strong>n: Collect over-the-top fashion from all the stars in the world of Disco. No matter what look you choose, you’ll always leave an impression.</p>
<p>Customize your home away from home, the Dive Bar, by collecting memorabilia from past and present, and in the process unlock the true story of what really happened to the band.</p>
<p><strong>Jam Together:</strong> Team up in Co-op, or compete on the leaderboards to be king of the dancefloor.</p>
<p><strong>Upload, Mods, And Ugc:</strong> Upload your own music, edit music videos, and craft your own music-synced gameplay spectacle! Dead as Disco is a UGC mosh pit ready for modding.</p></blockquote>
<p>Your character is named 'Charlie Disco'. I can't believe our little Charlie Disco grew up to love disco music. That's such a lovely coincidence. Dead As Disco's release is still TBA.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>This week is the week of Summer Game Fest and its entourage of accompanying showcases. As such, the feeling right now is of preparing for an avalanche. Join me as I play out the next few days in my head.</p>
<h2>Monday 2nd June</h2>
<ul>
<li>All is calm beneath the Treehouse, and yet, there is something in the air. I look up from my game of dark fantasy creature collector <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2754370/Voidsayer/">Voidsayer</a> and watch a single leaf cartwheeling along the forest floor. I frown and turn my attention to budding Beyond Good &amp; Evilalike, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1344990/Zefyr_A_Thiefs_Melody/">Zefyr: A Thief's Melody</a>.</li>

<h2>Tuesday 3rd June</h2>

<li>A few more leaves flitter down from the canopy. The ground seems blurry and something peculiar is going on in my lower intestine, but it's not enough to distract me from 80s business builder <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2532490/Rise_of_Industry_2/">Rise Of Industry 2</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Wednesday 4th June</h2>
<ul>
<li>Across the clearing, Brendy breaks off from his tentative nosing of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deltarune">Deltarune Chapters 1-4</a>. He sits on his hindlegs, lifts his muzzle to the sky and begins to howl.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Thursday 5th June</h2>
<ul>
<li>There is no time to consider <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2864560/Rune_Factory_Guardians_of_Azuma/">Rune Factory: Guardians Of Azuma</a>, as Nic and Oisin burst from the undergrowth in a circus of blindfire and swearing. Nic has taken a boulder to the knee, so Oisin is carrying him over one shoulder while he unloads a sawed-off into the vibrating shrubbery. How many times must we tell you, Nic, that you can't defeat natural disasters with shotguns?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Friday 6th June</h2>
<ul>
<li>All of a sudden the daylight vanishes as no less than three video game showcases rear above the canopy in furiously mechanical succession. First, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tbuFnsaR50">Access-Ability Summer Showcase</a> at 8am PDT, 11am EDT and 4pm BST. Then, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hr6Q2hln_M&amp;list=PLi9Mlnjwioo-ml1tAcHqOvAh4NDBmSG7h&amp;index=4">Summer Game Fest Live</a> at 2pm PDT, 5pm EDT and 10pm BST. Then, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DayoftheDevs/videos">Day of the Devs SGF Edition</a> at 4pm PDT, 7pm EDT and 12am BST. The individual fragments of rock and ice all sport the sleepily smiling face of Geoff Keighley. I see Graham on a surfboard high above the trees, carving the froth of advertising.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Saturday 7th June</h2>
<ul>
<li>The weekend offers no reprieve from the tumult! Ollie and I have made it back into the Treehouse with bloody elbows and a few broken ribs. The tree itself bends sickeningly but does not break: the Founders chose their primeval refuge well. Three more showcases - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ZRXGcmDlM">Wholesome Direct</a> (9am PDT, 12pm EDT, 5pm BST), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@FutureGamesShow">Future Games Show</a> (1pm PDT, 4pm EDT, 9pm BST) and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@thegameawards/videos?view=2&amp;sort=dd&amp;live_view=502&amp;shelf_id=1">Green Games Showcase</a> (1pm PDT, 4pm EDT, 9pm BST) - sweep through the woods like dervishes.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Sunday 8th June</h2>
<ul>
<li>Hell is empty, and all the marketing VPs are here. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@xbox">Xbox Games Showcase</a> (10am PDT, 1pm EDT, 6pm BST) and <a href="https://www.pcgamingshow.com/">PC Gaming Show</a> (12pm PDT, 3pm EDT, 8pm BST) obliterate all the lesser trunks that remain. Ollie and I let off signal flares. Where is Jeremy? Is that his fist emerging from the fusillade of Keighley particulates, forming one last defiant thumbs-up? Oh look, here's James in a helicopter. He brings word of a secondary calamity: the other side of the mountain has been annihilated by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ign-live-event-schedule-2025">Ian Games Network Live</a>.</li>
<p>What are you up to this week? If you plan to steer clear of all of the above, my hearty congratulations to you.</p></ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Rune Factory</em> has been in a weird spot over the last few console generations. Despite surviving the collapse of its original developer, the eventual release of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="54043841-6dfb-4e03-a6e6-7e41d32465df" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/rune-factory-5-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Rune Factory 5</em></a> was — to put it bluntly — a bit of a disaster. However, rather than disappearing for another 10 years, Marvelous ended up revealing that not one but two more games were on the way.</p>

<p>While<em> Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma </em>might not be a numbered title, it held all the expectations of a mainline entry regardless. It needed to fix up the issues with<em> Rune Factory 5</em> and bring the franchise into the modern era. But while it certainly manages the latter with a big boost in production values, <em>Guardians of Azuma</em>’s different take on farming and fighting fails to do either of these elements particularly well.</p>



<p><em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em> takes place some time after the events of <em>5</em> in the eastern lands of Azuma. Devastated by an event known as “The Celestial Collapse”, Azuma is slowly withering away. Enter the protagonist, one of two playable amnesiacs who finds themselves trying to restore the lands and regain their memories along the way.</p>

<p>This leads to the protagonist’s new life of both adventuring and village building as they work to bring life back to each area. It definitely tries to set up a more plot-heavy story, thanks in part to the addition of full voice acting and much improved character models. In practice, though, the story often takes a backseat to character events instead.</p>

<p>You start off with access to Spring Village, quickly becoming its leader and given free rein to start building new facilities and decorations. Being able to design sections of each village is the main new gimmick in <em>Guardians of Azuma</em>, improving them to both entice villagers back and increase your stats in the process.</p>

<p>You’re only able to build within specific zones, adding in facilities like blacksmiths, farmland, or more housing as new villagers move in. It’s all easy to understand, with simple Village Missions guiding you towards specific goals. Completing missions lets you level up villages, granting access to more buildings, build areas, and an increased villager cap.</p>

Village building never increases in complexity as you continue, and you don’t have to put much thought into how you construct each one. In fact, <em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em> does a pretty terrible job of making any of the village-specific stats actually matter.</p>

<p>Some buildings can increase the percentage bonuses for certain aspects like farming or mining, but this never feels impactful. Villagers also come with an Output value, though you have no real incentive to actively pay attention to this. Regardless of what I chose, it never seemed like my choices changed much about how villages functioned day to day.</p>

<p>I’m reminded a lot of Dondoko Island in <em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d457caa8-dd69-475b-bdc8-503b77c65ea1" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/like-dragon-infinite-wealth" rel="nofollow">Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</a></em>, where you're not expected to try that hard in building things up. At least in that game, it was only a side mode, rather than a key component of the main gameplay loop.</p>

<p>By the end of the story, I stopped paying much attention to any of the village building mechanics, outside of cramming stat boost decorations into one corner. Since build space is quite limited in most villages — only one has a large area to work with — it’ll be hard to really make a village that's distinct from what other players will end up creating anyway.</p>

<p>What makes this an issue is the fact that a lot of <em>Guardians of Azuma</em> is cut back when compared to mainline <em>Rune Factory</em> entries. Farming is even less important, there are few side activities, and the world is still kept relatively small. I could understand if this was done to make way for an in-depth village-building system, but that’s just not the case.</p>



<p>In regard to the small world, this is something that’s shared by all games in the franchise. But in <em>Guardians of Azuma</em>, it almost feels like you were intended to have access to larger zones at some point. You have four main zones, with smaller sky islands and linear dungeons. None are particularly big, and everything is shown on the map, which kills the feeling of exploration.</p>

<p>At the very least, combat has seen some improvements over <em>Rune Factory 5</em>. Movement and combos are generally faster, with timed dodges opening up enemies to counterattacks as you slow down time. Weapon choices aren’t that exciting, and you can get by using pretty much anything, though the bow does at least allow for manually aimed charge attacks.</p>

<p>As with earlier <em>Rune Factory</em> games, combat still remains easy overall. Keeping your gear up to date and placing decorations in each village is enough to keep your stats up to date. Level grinding is nonexistent too — if you enter an area with enemies higher than your current level, you gain massively increased XP. Conversely, you get barely any XP for enemies at or below your level.</p>

<p>Adventuring outside the villages is still fun enough, I just wish that there was more going on in each area. As mentioned earlier, there’s no real sense of exploration due to the small areas and abundance of map markers. Outside of gathering wood and stone, there’s often not much of an incentive to retread old ground either.</p>



<p>With village building lacking substance and exploration being limited, it's the character events that really carry <em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em>. I enjoyed getting to know the main cast, chatting to them daily while unlocking new friendship and romance events.</p>

<p>Like with the main story, events are all fully voiced with both an excellent English dub and what seemed like solid Japanese voice acting (though I used the former for most of my playthrough). Combined with the more expressive character models, this is the best events have ever been in <em>Rune Factory</em>.</p>

<p>What’s strange is that, despite having strong character events, the actual main story is mostly terrible. Things aren’t so bad starting out, as you get to visit each village and meet its inhabitants. But after that, the story becomes very sloppy and poorly paced, with multiple characters or plotlines introduced and dropped at a moment's notice.</p>

<p>Like with some elements of exploration, there’s a feeling that major parts of the story had to be cut at some point. It all culminates in a main plot that just ends up being rushed, despite still taking a while to complete.</p>

<p>I also can’t talk about the story and characters without specifically highlighting that multiple characters have events locked behind day 1 DLC. With events being the highlight of the game, I can’t really condone cutting some of this from players who don’t want to pay more at launch.</p>

<h2><em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Strong character events and improved presentation aren’t enough to carry a weak story and cut-down content. There’s still fun to be had when it comes to <em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em>’s characters, but here’s hoping <em>Rune Factory 6</em> improves upon everything else.</p>
