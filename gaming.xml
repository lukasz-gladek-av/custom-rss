                <p>Reanimal is an upcoming horror game for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch 2, and PC, created by Tarsier Studios, the folks responsible for the Little Nightmares series. It follows a brother and sister as they explore a mysterious island in search of their missing friends, discovering all sorts of mutated animals and other abominations along the way. Based on the brief glimpses we've seen of the game through trailers, there's a strong emphasis on its chilling atmosphere and surviving tense moments. Reanimal does not yet have a release date, though <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FKWMRB5M,B0FKWDMYH8,B0FKWP7N5P,B0FKWRQZZZ,B0FKW5HRBK,B0FKWBTJNW,B0FKVZVK5D,B0FKW5LN3X,B0FKWMP4XP&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">preorders</a> are open at most retailers. Three versions of the game are up for grabs, including a $40 standard edition, $60 Deluxe Edition, and a massive $200 Collector's Edition that's packed with physical extras.</p><h2>Reanimal Preorder Bonuses</h2><p>Since Reanimal doesn't yet have a firm release date, details about preorder bonuses are scarce. The Collector's Edition does make a mention of some sort of "Preorder DLC," though it's unclear what exactly this will be. Once more details become available, we'll be sure to update this section with specifics.</p><div title="6533670 - Reanimal Preorder Guide" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4035" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6533670 - Reanimal Preorder Guide" data-collection="">                                                                                                                                          <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FKWRQZZZ,B0FKW5HRBK,B0FKWBTJNW&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FKWRQZZZ,B0FKW5HRBK,B0FKWBTJNW&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FKWRQZZZ,B0FKW5HRBK,B0FKWBTJNW&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Reanimal Deluxe Edition</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FKWRQZZZ,B0FKW5HRBK,B0FKWBTJNW&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FKWRQZZZ,B0FKW5HRBK,B0FKWBTJNW&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FKWRQZZZ,B0FKW5HRBK,B0FKWBTJNW&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$60 | Release Date TBA</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>The $60 Reanimal Deluxe Edition features the base game, plus access to the<strong> Season Pass and post-launch DLC</strong>--though we don't know exactly what these in-game bonuses will include.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bioshock-4-isn%E2%80%99t-getting-canceled-despite-%E2%80%98some-ups-and-downs%E2%80%99.1265214/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>It’s been <a href="https://kotaku.com/2k-games-officially-announces-its-working-on-a-new-bios-1840310449">almost six years</a> since 2K revealed that a new <em>BioShock</em> was in development with recently minted Canada-based studio Cloud Chamber at the helm. But the only real news about the game since then was a report last week <a href="https://kotaku.com/bioshock-4-delay-cloud-chamber-2k-take-two-remake-2000614413">from <em>Bloomberg</em></a> that <em>BioShock 4</em> has changed leaders after failing an internal review. But amid questions from fans about whether the game could ultimately be canceled and concerns about future layoffs at Cloud Chamber, parent publisher Take-Two is adamant it won’t be. “It’s going to come out,” CEO Strauss Zelnick <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioshock-4-is-going-to-come-out-take-two-ceo-strauss-zelnick-promises-that-i-can-say-hand-on-heart-without-question">told <em>IGN</em></a> this week. “That I can say hand on heart, without question.”</p> <p>When it comes out is another question entirely. The executive admitted that things haven’t gone smoothly with the sequel–it’s been over a decade now since <em>BioShock Infinite</em>–but steered clear of addressing any specific issues with the game’s development. “We have had some ups and downs along the way,” he said. “That is accurate. And we have had changes in studio leadership. That said, we have very big shoes to fill on<em> BioShock</em> because of the legacy of Ken Levine, the legacy of what has gone before, which has been so successful. And we need to make sure that this experience is true to the <em>BioShock</em> DNA on the one hand, and a massive step forward on the other hand. That’s always challenging. We think we’re up to the challenge, but it has not been seamless.”</p> <p>What’s especially odd about the situation is that Take-Two is currently <a href="https://kotaku.com/report-ken-levines-ghost-story-studio-is-nowhere-near-1848297126">paying Ken Levine</a> to make another game <a href="https://kotaku.com/judas-previews-bioshock-ken-levine-1851367642">called <em>Judas</em></a> which has also been in development for years and looks suspiciously like <em>BioShock</em> in space. It’s clear these games need more time. What’s not clear is if more time will be enough. “I think some of our competitors have realized maybe a little late in the day that consumers are not okay with okay,” Zelnick said. “Good is the new bad, great is the new great. And our goal here is to make everything exceptional.”</p> <p>2K Games reiterated this sentiment in its statement <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioshock-4-is-going-to-come-out-take-two-ceo-strauss-zelnick-promises-that-i-can-say-hand-on-heart-without-question">to<em> IGN</em></a> about <em>BioShock 4</em>‘s recent troubles. “We are working hard to set <em>BioShock</em> up for the best possible future,” it said. “Right now, we have a good game, but we are committed to delivering a great one. We are working closely with leadership at the studio to define this path.” Great games, it seems, can now take decades to make.&nbsp;The publisher had previously contracted with Certain Affinity for a sequel back in 2015, <a href="https://kotaku.com/sources-the-new-bioshock-has-been-in-the-works-for-yea-1840314561"><em>Kotaku</em> reported in 2019</a>. That project, codenamed Parkside, was also rebooted, though never officially announced. With the next <em>BioShock</em> out in the open this time, 2K sounds committed to keeping the franchise alive. A <em>BioShock</em> movie is also in the works at Netflix, though reportedly on a <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-bioshock-movie-adaptation-budget-lowered-1851606225">much smaller scale than once planned</a>.</p>

              <p>Shoot ’em ups were one of the first video game sensations to sweep through arcades. The novelist Martin Amis became so obsessed with 1978’s <em>Space Invaders</em> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/nov/05/martin-amis-invasion-of-the-space-invaders-1982-gaming-book-republished">he wrote an entire guide/appreciation of sorts for it</a> long before the idea of games criticism was considered anything worth thinking about. From fixed-screen shooters like <em>Galaxian</em> and <em>Galaga</em> were born side-scrolling shooters like <em>Defender</em> and vertical scrollers like <em>Xevious</em>. Modern shooters prioritize precision aiming but old-school shoot ’em ups are all about precision positioning. The result is a series of spatial awareness puzzles infused with the nail-biting tension of futuristic guns, close calls, and endless carnage.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/gradius-iii-was-fun-and-hard-as-bullet-hell-1840017080">When Konami’s <em>Gradius</em> arrived in 1985</a> it quickly became one of the cornerstones of the genre thanks to its novel upgrade system, catchy music, and memorable boss fights. While its success, especially in the West, was short-lived, its cult status, which includes admiration for its unflinching difficulty, lives on. The road from <em>Space Invaders</em> to<em> Doom</em> to <em>Call of Duty</em> runs through <em>Gradius</em>. It’s an important legacy that’s now been admirably preserved thanks to the excellent <em>Gradius Origins</em> collection.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="GRADIUS ORIGINS Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yA3UFCx8nqQ?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>Out August 7 on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC, Konami’s tribute to its shmup history was developed by emulation experts M2 and contains <em>Gradius</em>, <em>Gradius II</em>, <em>Gradius III</em>, <em>Life Force</em>, <em>Salamander</em>, <em>Salamander 2</em>, and <em>Salamander 3</em>, an entirely new game in that lineage that satisfyingly recreates the old magic with new levels (M2 was also responsible for 2007’s franchise reimagining, <em>Gradius ReBirth</em>). It’s hard not to notice what’s missing.<em> Gradius</em> <em>Gaiden</em>, <em>Gradius IV</em>, <em>Gradius V</em>, and more are all MIA. Perhaps Konami is holding out for a second collection. At $40, <em>Gradius Origins</em> isn’t cheap, but what’s there is a polished and fulsome assembly of the past that doesn’t cut corners.</p>

 <p>You can consult <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2mBaTEjmVE">Digital Foundry’s fantastic breakdown</a> for more on the series’ history and M2’s emulation in this collection. The games are tough as nails, especially for anyone unfamiliar with the unforgiving grind of quarter-based gameplay. Thankfully, the new collection includes modern aids like gameplay rewinding and quick-save reloads. Crisp presentation and quality-of-life additions are only half the story, though.<em> Gradius Origins</em> also includes alternative arcade versions of every game, with helpful documentation explaining what was changed between releases, including updates to make the game easier for American players or to fix high score exploits being taken advantage of in Japan. Console editions are unfortunately missing, but it’s still a really neat window into ’80s arcade gaming history.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Earthion | Digital Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KBJmYcrMx-4?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>While <em>Gradius Origins</em> is a great, authentic look at the shoot ’em up genre’s past,<em> Earthion</em> brings it forward into the present with a new entry that oozes retro charm. Arriving on PC last week (console versions will be available in September), <em>Earthion</em> is a 16-bit shmup directed by famous<em> Streets of Rage</em> composer Yuzo Koshiro and developed natively for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive (cartridges won’t be available until next year). All I can say is it’s the real deal: crunchy pixel art, snappy controls, and tight gameplay balanced to be approachable (at least if you’re playing on normal difficulty) with a top-notch soundtrack that keeps you coming back.</p> <p>The art is what stands out most, with gorgeous backgrounds full of parallax scrolling effects that remind you what true “next-gen” upgrades used to feel like back in the ’90s. <em>Earthion</em> is also much more forgiving than its inspirations like <em>Gradius</em> and <em>R-Type</em>. Health bars and shield meters make it much easier to stay alive and snowball your upgrades. It’s a great debut game from Koshiro’s new studio, Ancient Corporation. There are apparently pirated ROMs of it going around, which the composer <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/08/please-support-us-pleads-yuzo-koshiro-as-pirated-earthion-rom-appears-online">has begged</a> people to avoid so the group can stick around long enough to make its next game.</p> <p>The back-to-back releases are fitting considering <em>Gradius</em>‘ soundtrack was <a href="https://games.kikizo.com/features/yuzo_koshiro_iv_oct05_p1.asp">one Koshiro has cited</a> as a powerful inspiration for his own work. As a genre, the shmup hasn’t gotten the same classic revival some other retro genres have over the last decade, but taken together, these games are a great start.</p>

And our goal here is to make everything exceptional."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/bioshock-next">BioShock 4</a> has reportedly been in development for more than a decade at various studios under the 2K Games banner. But <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioshock-4-reportedly-getting-a-narrative-overhaul-amid-development-struggles">it has suffered yet another overhaul</a> after it reportedly failed a review by executives and the head of its developer, Cloud Chamber, was ousted. Now, the fourth BioShock feels further away than ever. So, what’s going on?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview ahead of 2K parent company Take-Two reporting its latest 2025 quarterly earnings, I asked CEO Strauss Zelnick flat out if BioShock 4 was in danger of being canceled. Zelnick was clear in his response: “It’s going to come out,” he promised. “That I can say hand on heart, without question.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Zelnick sounds pretty confident, then. But it’s hard to get away from BioShock’s tumultuous — and lengthy — development. On this, Zelnick held his hands up, admitting BioShock 4 has had its troubles. But he also explained why it’s proving such a hard nut to crack.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We don't talk about how long our development cycles are,” Zelnick began. “We have had some ups and downs along the way. That is accurate. And we have had changes in studio leadership. That said, we have very big shoes to fill on BioShock because of the legacy of Ken Levine, the legacy of what has gone before, which has been so successful. And we need to make sure that this experience is true to the BioShock DNA on the one hand, and a massive step forward on the other hand. That's always challenging. We think we're up to the challenge, but it has not been seamless.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This week, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-01/next-bioshock-game-changes-leaders-after-development-turmoil" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier broke the news of BioShock 4’s overhaul</a>, and offered some insight into its troubles. “The game’s narrative was identified as an area that was particularly in need of improvement and will be revamped in the coming months,” Schreier reported.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“In a recent all-hands meeting, Cloud Chamber staff were told that the company needs to become more agile and efficient, leading to worries that layoffs may follow,” Schreier continued.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">BioShock: The Collection Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There hasn’t been a new BioShock game since 2013’s BioShock Infinite (Ken Levine is still working under the 2K banner on Judas). But BioShock 4 is not alone in having a lengthy development cycle, and we’ve seen — very recently — some publishers cancel games that were in development for six, seven, or even eight years. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-concords-failure-and-marathons-delay-sony-admits-playstations-live-service-strategy-is-not-entirely-going-smoothly">Sony’s live service flop Concord</a>, for example, was in the works for years before its disastrous release. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rares-everwild-reportedly-canceled-as-microsoft-layoffs-sweep-across-xbox">Microsoft just canceled Rare’s Everwild</a>, which was revealed six years ago.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It is clear from the outside looking in that triple-A video game development is getting longer, which is something Zelnick not only agrees with, but offered an explanation for.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think it's a reflection of the fact that as entertainment businesses mature, consumers seek quality and everyone realizes that the consumer is highly demanding and properly so,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The strategy of this company has always been to make the best entertainment, not necessarily the most entertainment. Of course, sometimes we've fallen short, but frankly a precious few times.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And I think some of our competitors have realized maybe a little late in the day that consumers are not okay with okay. Good is the new bad, great is the new great. And our goal here is to make everything exceptional.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zelnick added that he didn’t mean to be critical of other video game companies “because this is really hard stuff, and you don't want to criticize someone for sticking with their creative talent, supporting them and trying to get a great result.” But he did say that Take-Two “would like to fail fast if we're going to fail.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And we have made some hard decisions relatively early on. But we too have occasionally canceled titles well into their development. So it's hard. What we're all doing is hard.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">2K Games issued the following statement to Bloomberg on BioShock 4:</p><blockquote>We are working hard to set BioShock up for the best possible future. Right now, we have a good game, but we are committed to delivering a great one. We are working closely with leadership at the studio to define this path.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">The question now is, when might we see BioShock 4 actually come out?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

But if you want more info about any of the games, keep on reading.</p><p id="watergate"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Watergate">Watergate</h2></p><div catalogid="c0d3b784-f26b-4365-8b66-8362a0bd07dc" id="226597"><div id="226597" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Watergate</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In Watergate, two players take on the roles of either the Press or the Nixon administration during <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watergate_scandal" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Watergate scandal</a> from 1972 to 1974. Players use their custom decks of cards to try and secure, or bury, enough evidence to either convict the president if you are on the side of the press, or to finish out your term if you are playing as the administration. Cards are adorned with actual historical photographs and events that took place during this period, with additional blurbs and details that give Watergate an intricate look at what transpired.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game itself is a fun tug-of-war that's also a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-quick-playing-board-games">quick-playing board game</a>, with average games only taking maybe a half hour or so. And thanks to its small box, it makes it easy to take with you to the coffee shop, brewery, or on vacation. As an added bonus, the back half of the rule book provides even more information about the people, places, and events that are represented on the cards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more information on the Watergate scandal, check out this paper from <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Watergate-Scandal" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Britannica</u></a> or this documentary from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tV9JT4pZH_o" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Timeline</u></a>.</p></div><p id="molly-house"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Molly House">Molly House</h2></p><div catalogid="c0d3b784-f26b-4365-8b66-8362a0bd07dc" id="226598"><div id="226598" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Molly House</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Set during the 18th century in London, Molly House is an exploration of the <a href="https://mollysteinsapir.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Molly community</a> of the era (think LGBTQ+) as they looked to spread joy throughout their community while navigating around the Society for the Reformation of Manners and police. Molly House has players maneuvering around a board, managing cards to grow their reputation, and throwing parties to score points. There is always a danger, however, of constables and rebels trying to tear it all down, so players will also have to work to prevent the various houses from being raided, shut down, and individuals from being indicted. Some players can even choose to secretly become an informer, working against the others and the Molly community, adding a "hidden motive" mechanic to mix.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the game itself is a fun and complex game of strategy and bluffing, it's also a game whose subject matter and historical ramifications are worth considering. Molly House showcases actual people who lived and were prominent members of the Molly community at the time, with the rulebook's last few pages dedicated to further elaborating and giving context to the time and people involved.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it's also a game where "getting hanged" is one of the end-game outcomes, including imagery of a noose. Molly House is a game that highlights both the joy of that community (yay throwing parties), but also the dire situations that members could find themselves in and suffer through. Something to be aware if you are looking to introduce this game to your game night with fellow history buffs!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more information on this period and topic, here are two articles from <a href="https://historicengland.org.uk/research/inclusive-heritage/lgbtq-heritage-project/meeting-and-socialising/cross-dressing-and-queer-socialising/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Historic England</u></a> and the <a href="https://blog.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/2020/06/19/18th-century-molly-houses-londons-gay-subculture/#:~:text=18th%20century%20London%20was%20home,they%20met%20up%20in%20secret." data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>British Newspaper Archive</u></a>.</p></div><p id="pax-pamir"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pax Pamir">Pax Pamir</h2></p><div catalogid="c0d3b784-f26b-4365-8b66-8362a0bd07dc" id="226599"><div id="226599" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pax Pamir</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Set during the period that Western historians refer to as “The Great Game,” Pax Pamir has players assume the roles of Afghan leaders after the fall of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durrani_Empire" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Durrani Empire</a> in the 19th century. One of the central aspects of this game is managing your relations with Russia and Britain, who at the time were gain a foothold in the Central Asian region, while also attempting to create your new state. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">From a gameplay standpoint, Pax Pamir is a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-strategy-board-games"><u>strategy board game</u></a> that has you drawing and playing cards in order to perform actions, build your armies, and establish coalitions with groups in an effort to gain dominance in the region. It’s an intricate and surprisingly complex tableau builder of a game with a lot of moving parts that players have to keep their eyes on and work around, to secure a lead of at least four victory points to win.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Inside its box, the Pax Pamir 2nd Edition contains lavish components, including a cloth game board and detailed resin pieces. Perhaps most impressive are the 150+ cards, which all feature archival imagery. In typical Wherlegig style, the back of the rule book contains additional historical information for those who want to know more. The ramifications of the events presented in this game are still felt today, so make sure your players are comfortable with the setting before sitting at the table. </p></div><p id="john-company-second-edition"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="John Company: Second Edition">John Company: Second Edition</h2></p><div catalogid="c0d3b784-f26b-4365-8b66-8362a0bd07dc" id="226600"><div id="226600" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>John Company: Second Edition</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps the most complex game on this list, John Company 2nd Edition is a game about positioning your family within various roles and using the historically problematic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_India_Company" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">British East India Company</a> for your own personal gain. Your characters will inhabit a variety of roles throughout, including the company’s Chairman, Director of Trade, or of Military Affairs, while you try to manage various crises and negotiations in the attempt to build this state-sponsored trade monopoly. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game has you guiding the company as opposed to letting you directly control it, as most games would. Turns consist of retiring family members, choosing how they will invest in the company, hiring for new positions, and accepting bonuses, and moer. The game is a lot, with a lot of moving parts, making John Company a title you probably would only want to introduce to a seasoned group that's comfortable with complex board games. Still, when you figure it out, it's a game whose web of systems results in a thought-provoking experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">John Company is also a game that doesn’t try to mask or hide the themes of imperialism, globalization, or colonization that the British East India Company took part in. Playing this game can stir conversations, but the subject matter may be heavy for some players around your table.</p></div><p id="memoir-44"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Memoir '44">Memoir '44</h2></p><div catalogid="c0d3b784-f26b-4365-8b66-8362a0bd07dc" id="226601"><div id="226601" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Memoir '44</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you and a friend enjoy World War II and find yourself with a couple of hours of free time, then Memoir ‘44 is a game to check out. This tactical grid-based <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games">war game</a> puts one player in the boots of allied forces and the other in the Axis, roughly recreating specific battles that took place during the war. Utilizing card-based movement and three regions of combat to assign orders to, Memoir is relatively easy to pick up and teach, but offers plenty of room for strategy. It also has numerous expansions to not only increase the number of players it allows but also the number of scenarios you can play out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As mentioned previously, the different battlefield scenarios you can set up and play are based around actual battles, and accompanying each setup guide are historical details of it. These include both the name and date it occurred, which is a neat inclusion, so if you are interested, you can look up additional details after playing.</p></div><p id="omert-the-five-families"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Omertà: The Five Families">Omertà: The Five Families</h2></p><div catalogid="c0d3b784-f26b-4365-8b66-8362a0bd07dc" id="226602"><div id="226602" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Omertà: The Five Families</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Omertà: The Five Families takes players back to 20th-century New York City as members of five of the most powerful mafia families of the time as they work to push out their competition and secure territory. Included in the box are nine scenarios that highlight various years from 1905 to 1985, including events such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Mafia_War" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Second Mafia War</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Havana_Conference" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Havana Conference</a>, or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castellammarese_War" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Castellamerse War</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game itself is an area control title where each player moves their forces around Manhattan, Brooklyn, and New Jersey, playing cards to take actions, gain respect, and unfold the story. As you can expect, though, sometimes violence is required, so players can expect some fighting too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For fans of mafia history, or just the period of New York, Omertà provides you with a more historical approach, one that isn’t tied to a film or other series, and is more rooted in moments in history. The variety of scenarios also does a good job mixing things up, with different victory conditions and setup alterations, helping keep the game feeling fresh, longer.</p></div><p id="votes-for-women"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Votes for Women">Votes for Women</h2></p><div catalogid="c0d3b784-f26b-4365-8b66-8362a0bd07dc" id="226603"><div id="226603" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Votes for Women</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In this asymmetrical card-driven area control game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/votes-for-women-board-game-review">Votes for Women</a> puts one to four players in the roles of either the Suffragists or members of the Opposition in the campaign to pass the Nineteenth Amendment. Players will be playing cards and trying to win the support of enough states around the United States to secure a victory for their side. The suffragists need 36 states to ratify and win, while the opposition only needs 13 states to reject it to win.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Votes for Women showcases artwork and imagery from the period and movement, including posters and other propaganda used during this contentious moment. As an extra bonus for fans of the period, Votes for Women also includes a number of document replicas, including stories from the August 19, 1920, issue of the New York Times and a supplementary designer notebook detailing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more information about the suffrage movement, check out this article over at the <a href="https://www.theworldwar.org/learn/about-wwi/womens-suffrage" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>National WWI Museum and Memorial site</u></a> and this short <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ERshnPxI8" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>documentary from LucasFilm</u></a>.</p></div><p id="twilight-struggle"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Twilight Struggle">Twilight Struggle</h2></p><div catalogid="c0d3b784-f26b-4365-8b66-8362a0bd07dc" id="226604"><div id="226604" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Twilight Struggle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Set during the events of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cold War</a> from 1945-1989, Twilight Struggle has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-2-player-board-games">two players</a> facing off, playing cards and struggling to gain control of regions around the map, while reducing the influence of the other. Both sides draw and play cards that can be used either for a specific effect or for action points they can use to perform various actions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The cool twist is that the cards (which are broken into Early War, Mid War, and Late War decks) can lean towards North America, the USSR, or neutral. And if you have to play a card that is geareed toward the other side, you may get the action points but your opponent gets the beneficial effect. Depending on the actions that players take and in what regions, it may lower the Defcon rating, pushing the world closer to Nuclear War and instantly losing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For the Cold War buffs out there, the cards that you play – similar to those in Watergate earlier on this list – feature real photographs and mention of events that transpired during the war. For even more details, the back of the rulebook features more robust descriptions and breakdowns of the events the cards represent, which is a really neat touch.</p></div><p id="axis-allies"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Axis &amp; Allies"><strong>Axis &amp; Allies - Various Theater Games</strong></h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Axis &amp; Allies franchise has been around for more than four decades, letting wargame aficionados command the forces of the Allies and Axis powers during the World Wars. While the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/axis-allies-40th-anniversary-edition-board-game-review">mainline games</a> offer a fun representation of the wars themselves, for those looking for something more specific, the series also features a variety of games set around specific encounters in World War II. These games tend to have their own little tweaks to the traditional A&amp;A gameplay but still maintain the same rich strategy gameplay, just on a smaller, more intimate scale.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While some games are out of print, Renegade Games is doing a great job with the brand, not only creating new entries like A&amp;A North Africa but also reprinting previously out-of-print games like A&amp;A Battle of the Bulge, Guadalcanal, and Stalingrad. These are excellent options and may be of more interest for historical war buffs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em> Scott White is a freelance contributor to IGN, assisting with tabletop games and guide coverage.

Cronos is shaping up to be another nightmare-inducing adventure with a sci-fi twist that looks unlike anything the studio has made. Cronos takes place in a futuristic rendition of Eastern Europe where an event known as The Change has radically altered the landscape, which is now stalked by horrific, mutating creatures. Players take the role of the Traveler, who searches the twisted environment for rifts that connect back to 1980s Poland so they can rescue key people from the past on behalf of a mysterious group known as The Collective. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cronos-PlayStation-5/dp/B0FKNMXH4V?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Preorders</a> are open ahead of its September 5 release, with two editions up for grabs--including a $60 standard edition and a $70 Deluxe Edition--both of which include their own exclusive extras.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Opening up Quakecon with yet another back catalogue remaster, id Software and Nightdive Studios have announced and released a collection of Heretic + Hexen, which is out now across PlayStation, Xbox, Switch and PC, and available on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Game Pass</a></p>
<p><iframe title="Heretic + Hexen Official Launch Trailer (4K) | Now Available" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IheADxVkpI4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Originally developed by Raven Software using a modified Doom engine and released in 1994 and 1995, the games pushed in the direction of RPGs, building in inventory systems, vertical aiming, character classes and more. While Nightdive avoid calling their releases remasters – technically I think they’re being fed into the KEX Engine to gain these new features – it’s still a handy shorthand.</p>
<p>This is an all-encompassing and even an expanded collection, that includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Heretic: Shadow of the Serpent Riders</li>
<li>Hexen: Beyond Heretic</li>
<li>Hexen: Deathkings of the Dark Citadel</li>
<li>Two all-new episodes created in collaboration between individuals at id Software + Nightdive Studios:
<ul>
<li>Heretic: Faith Renewed</li>
<li>Hexen: Vestiges of Grandeur</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond that, the games have been furnished with support for up to 4K and 120FPS on consoles, widescreen, modern controllers, in-game mod support, online cross-platform and local split-screen. There’s also an enhanced soundtrack from&nbsp;Andrew Hulshult, but you can stick with the originals.</p>

<p>In a great move, existing owners of <em>any</em> of the games will receive a free upgrade to the new combined game, and will still have access their previously owned versions.</p>

      <div><p>Go On Board's <em>Tekken: The Board Game</em> is a runaway success. The crowdfunding campaign for the tabletop adaptation of Bandai Namco's iconic fighting game has been topping the charts on the platform, reaching its funding goal in a short 35 minutes.</p>



<p>&nbsp;According to its campaign page, <a href="https://gamefound.com/en/projects/go-on-board/tekken-the-board-game#/section/project-story" rel="nofollow"><em>Tekken: The Board Game</em></a> is an asymmetric fighting game set in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/tekken-8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Tekken</em></a> universe. It is a game for one to eight players, and a single game can take between 20 and 60 minutes. This is the second high-profile board game adaptation Go On Board is hosting on the platform. The other is the fantasy board game, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/witcher-legacy-board-game-brings-more-narrative-monster-hunting-to-table" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>The Witcher: Legacy</em></a>.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tekken-the-board-game-display.jpg?itok=6Z8zZSlE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tekken-the-board-game-display.jpg?itok=-y8ZGk0X 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Like the fighting game source material, you and your opponent duke it out in a one-on-one match in a hex-based arena. You each choose a character that comes with its miniature and deck of cards. Each card represents different moves: attack, push, defend, etc..You choose one of three areas to attack: low, mid, or high. If your opponent can predict where your attack is coming from, they can block, or worse, counter-attack.</p>

<p>Much like any high-end fighting game match, a game of <em>Tekken: The Board Game</em> becomes one of psychology and resource management. String together combos. Bluff your opponent with your next move. Know the right time to activate Heat and Rage Mode. The game even has an environmental destruction mechanic, letting you deal extra damage to your opponent.</p>

<p>Lastly, for dedicated <em>Tekken</em> fans, this board game has highly detailed miniatures of the franchise's iconic characters. These miniatures are larger than normal miniatures, ranging between 57.4 mm and 60 mm.

<section><p>Ninja Gaiden 4 is shaping up to be a fun reunion for series veterans, as well as a great entry point for newcomers.</p></section>

                <p>Since its announcement earlier this year, Ninja Gaiden 4 has seemingly met just as much skepticism as excitement. Yes, after over a decade, we <em>finally </em>have a new Ninja Gaiden--but with Team Ninja and Platinum Games collaborating on its development and Microsoft publishing, is the series' identity at stake? It's a question that's been on many long-time fans' minds, as well as my own.</p><p dir="ltr">After all, there's no denying that some of what makes Ninja Gaiden such a beloved series are the little quirks we overlook out of affection. And, more often than not, these are the very same friction-inducing qualities that are promptly removed when a series is remade or rebooted. At the same time, does opting to retain each and every one of these qualities prevent the game from evolving, or becoming an exciting, modern entry-point? After spending around four hours with Ninja Gaiden 4 and speaking with the team behind it at Platinum Game's Tokyo office, I've come to a preliminary conclusion: Ninja Gaiden 4 is whatever style of Ninja Gaiden you want it to be.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Ninja Gaiden 4 Is Exactly The Ninja Gaiden Game You're Hoping It Will Be | Hands-On Impressions</p>
      </div>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Flexible and fluid</strong></h3><p dir="ltr">More so than previous entries in the series, Ninja Gaiden 4 emphasizes flexibility. If you're a Ninja Gaiden veteran who loathes the idea of executing perfect dodges, locking on to enemies, and watching your Karma--the game's scoring system that rewards players for executing combos--rack up in the top left corner, you can either ignore or remove all of it. At the same time, these options, an impressively robust accessibility menu, and the game's beginner-friendly Hero mode--which auto-blocks most incoming damage--make the game extremely approachable for new audiences and those who might have been turned off by the series' brutal reputation.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4545758-283a6bf1-d3ec-4366-83b0-26a243dfb3d5.png" data-ref-id="1300-4545758" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2048" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4545758-283a6bf1-d3ec-4366-83b0-26a243dfb3d5.png" data-ref-id="1300-4545758"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4545758-283a6bf1-d3ec-4366-83b0-26a243dfb3d5.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">That said, you'd be wrong to dismiss Ninja Gaiden 4 itself as easy. Much like previous titles, Master Ninja mode is brutal, with higher difficulties bringing increased enemy intelligence and toughness, as well as more challenging enemy staging. However, the existence of one mode of play doesn't negate the existence of the other, and thus Ninja Gaiden 4 feels wonderfully malleable.</p><p dir="ltr">"While it is true that Ninja Gaiden 4 does include these new parry mechanics and also just dodges, they're not necessarily required for you to overcome. You don't have to lean on them exclusively. They're just another addition to the wide toolset that you have available," Ninja Gaiden 4 co-director Masakazu Hirayama said. "Ninja Gaiden 4 isn't necessarily more of a defensive game than the past Ninja Gaiden titles. They're just a wider array of tools at your disposal and the effort to give players as much controllability and playability as possible.</p><p dir="ltr">"And while it may seem at first glance that the defensive techniques such as the parry and just dodge are very powerful, you might have noticed that there's this berserk gauge, and that gauge will actually decrease if you're being too defensive," he continued. "The combat is designed in a way for you to have to really engage with that back-and-forth, that high-speed back-and-forth between offense and defense."</p><p dir="ltr">In a way, this design choice reflects a larger theme in Ninja Gaiden 4: the merging of the old and the new. Ninja Gaiden 4 makes a very conscious effort to respect long-time fans, former protagonist Ryu Hayabusa, and Team Ninja's original vision. At the same time, the introduction of Platinum Games as co-developer, new protagonist Yakumo, and a vastly expanded tool kit highlight the fact that this is, in fact, a reinvention. And though this has always been the case with the Ninja Gaiden series, even 4's setting--which sees cyberpunk elements and traditional Japanese qualities come together to form a moody, cyber-ninja dystopia--exemplifies this dynamic.</p><p dir="ltr">Yet despite Ninja Gaiden being known for its brutality, this collision isn't violent. Instead, all these different components complement each other and ultimately highlight what each aspect brings to the game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4545765-f6ababd0-060f-421e-94e3-2298bdc18e51.png" data-ref-id="1300-4545765" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2048" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4545765-f6ababd0-060f-421e-94e3-2298bdc18e51.png" data-ref-id="1300-4545765"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4545765-f6ababd0-060f-421e-94e3-2298bdc18e51.png"></figure><h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Yakumo vs. Ryu</strong></h3><p dir="ltr">This dynamic is perhaps most obvious when switching between the game's main characters, Yakumo and Ryu. During this preview, I finally got the chance to see how a slightly older Ryu controls. While he and Yakumo are similar mechanically and can even execute some of the same moves, there are clear distinctions in how they control. Yakumo feels lighter, faster, and dare I say a bit edgier, thanks to his Bloodraven form and ability to enter a berserk state. Ryu, on the other hand, packs a harder punch, feels more professional and precise, and comes with some of his classic Ninpo Arts in lieu of a new winged form, adding to the sense that he is truly a master ninja at this point.</p><p dir="ltr">"We wanted to design a character that would contrast with Ryu Hayabusa," Hirayama said. "Ryu Hayabusa is already the apex of super ninja status, and Yakumo is this young ninja prodigy who's starting to climb the ranks."</p><p dir="ltr">"If I were to distill the differences between the two characters into one word, Ryu is powerful, whereas Yakumo is clever," co-director Yuji Nakao added. "Both characters can utilize legacy abilities, whether it's the Izuna Drop or the Flying Swallow. But there are these elements that really distinguish the characters in these really subtle but very noticeable ways."</p><p dir="ltr">Another major difference between Yakumo and Ryu that reinforces these design principles is the fact that while Ryu sticks to his trusty blade, Yakumo has a handful of weapons to choose from, with some being more experimental than others. We were introduced to Yakumo's drill weapon, which allows him to plunge into enemies and, well, drill; it's silly, satisfying, and, like I said, he's certainly the edgier of the two, so it tracks. Another reason why Yakumo has multiple weapons, however, is simply because he is Ninja Gaiden 4's primary protagonist, so don't expect the same level of treatment--or number of chapters--for both characters.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4545766-8a7346ea-96ce-4e17-958d-e939be93d142.png" data-ref-id="1300-4545766" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2048" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4545766-8a7346ea-96ce-4e17-958d-e939be93d142.png" data-ref-id="1300-4545766"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4545766-8a7346ea-96ce-4e17-958d-e939be93d142.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">"There are dedicated chapters for Ryu Hayabusa in the story of the game. In terms of the ratio, it leans more towards Yakumo since he is the protagonist," Hiriyama said. "But after you beat the game, it will unlock Chapter Challenge, where you can play all the chapters as Ryu Hayabusa. Likewise, can play as Yakumo in Hayabusa's dedicated chapters."</p><p dir="ltr">Fortunately during my preview, Platinum took the liberty of unlocking the game's Chapter Challenge mode, meaning I got to take both Yakumo and Ryu through the handful of included chapters, challenges, and boss fights. Doing so further drove home the differences between Yakumo and Ryu, as with Ryu I noticed that I completed objectives more quickly, but with Yakumo I had more combo-building fun. Both characters felt equally viable and fun to use, hopefully meaning that players won't dread playing through chapters that are initially bound to a certain character.</p><h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Bullet hell boss battles, cyberpunk cities</strong></h3><p dir="ltr">After going through the game's first chapters and completing a few challenges, I opted to face off against two of Ninja Gaiden 4's first bosses: a lightning sword-wielding commander and the Kitsune Cortesean. Though neither one was abnormally brutal, both offered up the same vital lesson: Unless you're playing on Hero mode, you cannot get through this game if you're just button-mashing. Whereas the fights your ninjas stumble into can be overwhelming thanks to the sheer number of strong and intuitive enemies tossed your way, these bosses were overwhelmingly powerful, and thus required me to pay attention, learn attack patterns, and intentionally move about the arena while utilizing my environment.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4545761-abcf9828-8c95-4b82-9034-1d7b0be427d0.png" data-ref-id="1300-4545761" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2048" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4545761-abcf9828-8c95-4b82-9034-1d7b0be427d0.png" data-ref-id="1300-4545761"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4545761-abcf9828-8c95-4b82-9034-1d7b0be427d0.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">I had a great time with both of these enemies. Each felt appropriately challenging on normal difficulty and were immensely satisfying to take down. That said, traversing my environment while doing so was not as enjoyable. Due to Ninja Gaiden 4's arena sizes, I frequently found myself a bit annoyed as I tried to grapple to safety only to be just out of reach of one of the designated grappling areas. Granted, some of this could be attributed to user error, and large arenas are necessary considering Platinum (naturally) adds some of its iconic bullet hell-style combat moments to the game, such as in the Kitsune Cortesean fight. That said, it still felt a bit stilted and made traversal feel slightly less fluid for me.</p><p dir="ltr">The locations I explored in Ninja Gaiden 4 didn't vary too much from one another visually. All of them were set in a rain-drenched, dystopian Tokyo, and lean into cyberpunk visuals, complete with shadows, grime, and neon lights. That said--and although I would have loved to see variation in environments to help break things up--those included in the preview were striking and featured plenty of vistas, cinematic imagery, and interesting set pieces, such as the gargantuan, floating dragon skeleton that ensnares the city.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4545759-62b90bec-34cb-4f9f-8fee-6faf354581b8.png" data-ref-id="1300-4545759" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2048" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4545759-62b90bec-34cb-4f9f-8fee-6faf354581b8.png" data-ref-id="1300-4545759"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4545759-62b90bec-34cb-4f9f-8fee-6faf354581b8.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">I was ultimately reassured by both the introduction of traditional Japanese elements as the story unfolds and the game's directors that not all of Ninja Gaiden 4 will take place in Tokyo's gritty underbelly. According to Hiriyama, Yakumo and Ryu will get the chance to dismember their enemies in more natural environments, too.</p><p dir="ltr">"The game itself takes place within the greater Tokyo area, but within that area there are also stages other than the cyberpunk aesthetic," Hiriyama said. "There are stages set in more natural environments, such as forests or caves. There's other environments as well. If you notice in Stage 1-3 of the build, you might have noticed that there's more of this traditional Japanese aesthetic in the stage environment, so you can expect that kind of variety in the full game."</p><p dir="ltr">That being the case, I'm certainly excited to see more of Ninja Gaiden 4's Tokyo. But what I'm most anticipating about its full release is something the Ninja Gaiden series' isn't typically praised for: its story and characters.</p><h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Unlikely allies--and enemies</strong></h3><p dir="ltr">It's still early days, but I am intrigued by the story Ninja Gaiden 4 is setting up. Though nothing of particular interest happens in the game's first chapter--which, it should be noted, is the same one that was revealed during this year's Summer Game Fest--Ninja Gaiden's prologue establishes several fun relationship dynamics. For starters, Yakumo is a member of the Raven Clan, a rival clan to Ryu's Hayabusa Clan. Things are further complicated when we discover that, in the seven years since Ryu essentially failed to completely kill the dragon whose corpse hangs over Tokyo and causes the city's blighted rain, he has since aligned himself with the Divine Dragon Order, the Raven Clan's enemy. As such, when Ryu and Yakumo finally might, it seems likely it will be as enemies.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4545768-e9e7588e-a722-411d-b150-36edc5647ffc.png" data-ref-id="1300-4545768" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2048" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4545768-e9e7588e-a722-411d-b150-36edc5647ffc.png" data-ref-id="1300-4545768"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4545768-e9e7588e-a722-411d-b150-36edc5647ffc.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">The prologue also introduces us to Ninja Gaiden 4's main heroine, the Dragon Priestess Seori. It took me all of one scene to completely adore her and the dynamic she has with Yakumo. Whereas Yakumo is quiet, edgy, and serious, Seori is filled with confidence, charm, and humor, making their forced pairing excruciating for him--even if she is exceptionally pretty. On the surface, their relationship feels a lot like Cloud and Aerith's from Final Fantasy 7, so naturally, I'm eager to see where things go.</p><p dir="ltr">Fortunately for me (and all you extremely patient Ninja Gaiden fans), we won't be waiting much longer to see how things play out. Ninja Gaiden 4 is scheduled to release on October 21 and will be available on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. If you're an Xbox Game Pass subscriber, Ninja Gaiden 4 will be available to play at no additional cost on day one.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nightdive-studios-and-id-software-shadow-dropped-heretic-hexen-a-remaster-collection-of-the-two-magic-fps-classics-on-pc-and-consoles.1265154/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Announced during QuakeCon 2025, id Software and Nightdive Studios have shadow dropped Heretic+Hexen, a remaster collection of the two magic-based FPS games built off the back of id Software's DOOM Engine originally developed by Raven Software in 1994 (Heretic) and 1995 (Hexen).</p>



<p>The collection is available right now on PC and all major console platforms, meaning you can grab it on Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Nintendo Switch, though there's no specific Nintendo Switch 2 version. For Xbox players, it's also available on Xbox Game Pass on PC and consoles, so Game Pass subscribers can download it to their preferred device and begin reliving the mid-90's shooters.</p>



<p>It'll also soon be playable through <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-mafia-the-old-country-titan-quest-ii-stormgate/">GeForce Now</a>, though a specific date for its inclusion in the GeForce Now roster has not been confirmed.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Heretic + Hexen Official Launch Trailer (4K) | Now Available" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IheADxVkpI4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>A nice boon for fans of the games who might've already purchased the digital versions of Heretic and Hexen available on the Xbox Store or Steam is that <a href="https://slayersclub.bethesda.net/en-US/article/heretic-hexen-release-notes">a free upgrade is available</a> for owners of Heretic: Shadow of the Serpent Riders, Hexen: Beyond Heretic, and/or Hexen: Deathkings of the Dark Citadel.</p>



<p>And if you're new to both shooters and are picking up the collection to play them for the first time, you'll be able to play through the three titles mentioned above, along with two brand new episodes made by Nightdive and id Software, titled: Heretic: Faith Renewed and Hexen: Vestiges of Grandeur.</p>



<p>The remasters feature improved performance on the classic titles with both games playable at a 4K resolution and at 120FPS, a wide range of accessibility options and game balancing options, widescreen support, mod support, and a new Vault section that includes early concept art for the development of both games and some unused sprites for fans of the originals to sink their teeth into.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i-spend-a-lot-of-time-in-my-real-life-trying-to-find-the-perfect-seat-so-why-not-do-it-in-a-game-too.1265130/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I relate a lot to the puzzles of <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3035120/Is_This_Seat_Taken/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Is This Seat Taken?</a></em> I often do a lot of mental math to choose a suitable seat in a doctor’s waiting room or movie theater. I don’t want to sit near anyone wearing cologne or perfume, because it gives me a headache; in fact, I’ll try to avoid sitting near <em>anyone,</em> which I don’t think is particularly unique. (It’s actually quite diabolical to take a seat near someone else in a near empty room.) In a car or on a bus, I’m particularly prone to motion sickness in certain spots towards the back. And on an airplane, I always choose the aisle; I get up to pee a lot.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Is This Seat Taken? </em>is a puzzle game from developer Poti Poti Studios in which you’re tasked with creating a seating chart for people with particularities like me in cars, buses, diners, movie theaters, concerts, and elsewhere. Developers Ausiàs Dalmau and Sergi Pérez told me that <em>Is This Seat Taken?</em> is supposed to be relatable but relaxed. Spend as much time as you want on the puzzles; it’s both a game and a toy that’s meant to be played with.&nbsp;</p><p>“We want people to explore the different reactions between characters without any negative repercussions,” the developers said. “Also, there is no single way to solve the levels, allowing people to be creative and come up with their own resolutions.”</p><figure><figcaption><em>Poti Poti Studios</em></figcaption></figure><p>In a park, I start by dragging and dropping a person who hates bugs onto a picnic blanket furthest away from a streetlight attracting mosquitos. Another person wants to sit by her, so I drag her over to a nearby spot. But now someone <em>else</em> is angry: The second person is listening to loud music, and a person snoozing nearby on the bench has been rudely awoken. This means reorganizing the scene over and over again until everyone is happy.&nbsp;</p><p>In a movie theater, several patrons are inexplicably wearing massive cowboy hats. No one wants to sit behind those people, nor does anyone want to sit near people using their phones. (Unfortunately, I can’t kick those jokers out!) Others want to be able to sneak popcorn from someone nearby, while others simply want to sit in the middle of the theater.&nbsp;</p><p>You replay each little scenario a few times before moving on to the next level, as people come and go from, say, the bus or movie theater. Once you’ve got the perfect seating chart, a person who forgot to shower may come wandering in — so you’ll have to switch people around to account for those who don’t want to sit near someone smelly.</p><p>The game moves through different, increasingly complex scenarios in separate stages broken into European cities, like London, Brussels, and Barcelona. Each has a little overarching narrative to it all, about one of the humanoid shapes following an actor from city to city. But the narrative is just a little part of what makes <em>Is This Seat Taken?</em> a real delight. The animations are silly, and the increasing demands of the people you’re seating are even sillier. It’s satisfying to click around playing matchmaker, moving stuff around until suddenly something <em>clicks</em>.</p><p>There are no timers, which makes <em>Is This Seat Taken?</em> a more chill version of the logic tests you may have taken during high school exams. Poti Poti Studios told me that the original idea for <em>Is This Seat Taken?</em> was simply to create a game about sorting people. They played with ideas, including scoring systems based on the speed at which a player solved a level. “But in the end, we found the game was more fun if we simplified the entire scoring system and let the player freely experiment with the characters without restrictions,” they said.</p><p>Removing the barriers to completion — you don’t have to find the right seat for everyone in a level — means reaching a larger audience: “We believe that some puzzle games struggle to reach a general audience because they tend to make levels that are too difficult, or end up making levels with too many concepts added one after the other,” the developers said. If you can’t find the right spot for someone, you can move on. The benefit for getting an entire level completed with 100% satisfaction for the people you’ve seated means unlocking an extra level.</p><p>All five cities in <em>Is This Seat Taken?</em> should take most people a couple hours to complete. There’s a bit of repetition to the game and across its levels, but it doesn’t feel grating or like unnecessary padding. It’s one of those games that I want more of, but appreciate for being a short, contained experience; more levels just for the sake of levels runs the risk of the repetition becoming a problem.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Is This Seat Taken?</em> was previously available to play as a demo through the Steam Next Fest (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3035120/Is_This_Seat_Taken/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and it’s still available for free now, too</a>); the demo is just one city, Barcelona, but it’s a good taste of what <em>Is This Seat Taken?</em> Is. The full game was surprise released during Thursday’s Nintendo indie showcase for PC, Switch, and mobile.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/pc-desk-floor"><h3>Wait, Are We Not All Keeping Our PCs On Top Of Our Desks</h3></a><p>Why would you put one of the most expensive things you own on the floor where your feet go</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/eddington-ari-aster-covid-movie-pedro-pascal-joaquin-phoenix"><h3>Eddington Is A Compelling COVID Drama Until It Isn’t</h3></a><p>The film is neither good nor bad, but a secret third thing.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/akane-banashi-shonen-jump-manga-anime"><h3>The Best Shonen Manga Right Now Is About A Niche Performance Artist’s Fall From Grace</h3></a><p>Akane-banashi getting an anime isn't shocking because it's the best ongoing Shonen Jump manga</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/is-this-seat-taken-impressions-indie-direct]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<article id="article">
<header><section>
<p>And it's out now</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>If you thought the day's surprises were over, think again, as Bethesda, id Software, and retro specialists Nightdive Studios have announced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/heretic_plus_hexen">Heretic + Hexen</a>, the "definitive re-release" of two classic spell shooters. Oh, and it's also out <em>right now</em> (thanks, <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/heretic-hexen-announced-for-ps5-xbox-series-ps4-xbox-one-switch-and-pc-now-available">Gematsu</a>!).</p>
<p>For just $14.99 (it's not up on the EU eShop at the time of writing this), you'll be able to pick up two of Raven Software's iconic first-person shooters which introduced inventory systems, vertical aiming, and character classes to the genre.</p>
<p>Heretic originally launched in 1994 on PC and was made in the DOOM engine; <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/hexen">Hexen</a> is a direct sequel that followed in 1995 and got a Nintendo 64 release in North America in 1997.</p>
<p>This release bundles together all of the games' content — <strong>Heretic: Shadow of the Serpent Riders</strong>, <strong>Hexen: Beyond Heretic</strong>, and <strong>Hexen: Deathkings of the Dark Citadel</strong> — plus two new episodes created by Nightdive and id Software: <strong>Heretic: Faith Renewed</strong> and <strong>Hexen: Vestiges of Grandeur</strong>.</p>
<p>But, given that it's Nightdive at the helm, you probably want to see all the shiny new enhancements, right? Here they are (from the eShop page):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>New Enhancements</strong><br>
• Online cross-platform and local split-screen deathmatch and co-op modes<br>
• Toggleable enhanced soundtrack from Andrew Hulshult<br>
• In-game mod support (Nintendo Switch™ only supports featured mods, curated by the team at id.)<br>
• An array of accessibility options, quality-of-life improvements, and engine fixes</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nightdive Studios just continue to keep impressing — we've only <em>just</em> got our mitts on the excellent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/system_shock_2_25th_anniversary_remaster">System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster</a>, so it looks like we'll be dipping into Nightdive's seemingly endless pool of retro rereleases once again.</p>
<p><em>Have you played either Heretic or Hexen before? Will you be grabbing this on Switch? Let us know in the comments</em>.</p>

For one week only, players have the ability to complete a special Satellite Hijack Contract that lets them destroy the Stadium's roof. Completing this specific contract also grants special rewards.

Additionally, multiple squads must complete the contract in the same match to initiate the Stadium breach. This means instead of killing every opponent you see, it's in your best interest to ignore some of the other squads around you, and let them work on their contract steps as well.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4545950-contractsupplyboxes.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545950" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4545950-contractsupplyboxes.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545950"></a><figcaption>Look for these smoke signals on the map</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4545950-contractsupplyboxes.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Find_a_contract_box">Find a contract box</h3><p dir="ltr">The Satellite Hijack contracts can be found randomly in boxes around the map that look like loadout drops.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/friendslop-is-coming-for-the-switch-2.1265097/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>During today’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/719807/nintendo-switch-2-indie-world-direct-showcase-livestream">Nintendo Indie World showcase</a>, I had two epiphanies. The first was the realization that friendslop games are about to hit the Switch 2 like a falling piano in a Road Runner cartoon. The second was that I love that for me, because that means I can finally play them.</p><p>My friends love “friendslop,” the <a href="https://aftermath.site/friendslop-peak-lethal-company-social-media-discourse">initially derisive but now descriptive nickname</a> given to indie co-op games with a loose gameplay structure that permits the kind of chaos that can make games go viral on social media. And from what I’ve seen, I would love it, too. Friendslop is known for low-quality graphics (hence the “slop” part) that give a game a stylized look that’s common among other indie games. The term hasn’t become a ubiquitous genre descriptor like metroidvania or soulslike, but it’s still useful for labeling the kinds of casual co-op games that have <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24043555/lethal-company-best-entry-level-horror-game/">recently exploded in popularity</a>, primarily on Steam.</p><p>The problem is that playing them typically requires me getting off the couch, something I do not do. I’m a comfort gamer. If a game cannot be played from my couch, I don’t want it. Co-op games with a console release like <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/13/23759589/phasmophobia-console-xbox-series-s-x-ps5-psvr2-release-date">Phasmophobia</a></em> are perfectly fine, but PC-only games like <em>Peak</em> are nonstarters to me.</p><div><p>GameChat opens the door for a ton of similar games making their way to the Switch 2</p></div><div><p>Seeing the trailer for <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/754198/dont-forget-to-like-and-sub-die">Content Warning</a></em> during Indie World showed how <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/642290/nintendo-switch-2-online-figuring-out-gamechat">the Switch 2’s GameChat feature can solve the problem</a> and close that gap, opening up more multiplatform releases for previously PC-only games. Before its arrival, playing co-op games like <em>Among Us</em> with your Switch-having friends required either being in the same room, time-consuming triangulation via Discord, or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/30/20833244/nintendo-switch-voice-chat-headphones-games-app">attempting to use the Nintendo Switch App</a>.</p></div><p>GameChat sands down those spiky bits of friction, allowing you to connect with friends at the press of a button to play online together like in<em> Mario Kart World</em>, or play together separately, each person in the little four-player lobby chatting away while doing their own thing.</p><p>The Switch 2 GameChat feature eliminates my barrier to entry in these kinds of games. There’s no worry of trying to figure out my Steam Deck’s text or voice chat or playing on my Deck while I chat through a Discord call on my phone. (Remember, I’m lazy.) <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/24343637/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-c-button-controller">With one button on one device</a>, I can connect with my friends and yap to my heart’s content as we’re all eaten alive by underwater cryptids.</p><p><em>Content Warning</em>, for example, is a game where you and your friends explore an underwater ruin in hopes of filming supernatural phenomena to farm clout and ad revenue on social media. How you do that, and whether all your friends survive the trip, is up to you. In friendslop games, cooperation is important but not required. And in fact, working against each other can be just as fun as working together.</p><p>GameChat breaks open the door for a ton of similar games to make their way to the Switch 2. <em>Peak</em>, for example, <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/peak-has-surpassed-4-5m-sales-within-a-month">sold almost 5 million copies in under a month</a> and is the exact kind of casual, indie co-op game the Switch is suited for. <em>Peak</em> and games like it on the Switch 2 have the potential to be incredibly successful. These games aren’t graphically or mechanically intensive — and even if they were, the Switch 2’s hardware upgrades can handle it. And they’re focused on partying with your friends, a key feature in some of the most popular games out there right now. People want to play with their friends on the platforms their friends play on and with GameChat, the Switch 2 can finally be that platform.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/756236/content-warning-coop-games-nintendo-switch-2-lethal-company]]></content:encoded>

                <p>In 2023, rapper and occasional actor <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-brings-eminem-to-the-game-next-week-as-skins-leak/1100-6519403/" data-ref-id="1100-6519403">Eminem lent his likeness to Fortnite</a> for three different skins based on his different personas. That was just a small blip in Eminem's two-decade-plus career as an entertainer. But the rapper was recently recognized as "the guy from Fortnite."</p><p>The Eminem Bible shared the video on X, and the rapper himself had a great response. Eminem simply cracked up at the joke, and the fan immediately admitted that he was only kidding.</p><p>Eminem returned to Fortnite last year as Epic Games debuted <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-eminem-minigun-spits-out-bullets-and-lyrics-in-leaked-clip/1100-6527562/" data-ref-id="1100-6527562">the Mythic RG Minigun</a>. This weapon could actually shoot bullets and drop Eminem's music and lyrics in tune to the gun's rate of fire. Eminem was also featured in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-remix-finale-features-snoop-dogg-eminem-ice-spice-and-juice-wrld-tribute/1100-6527943/" data-ref-id="1100-6527943">the star-studded concert event that closed out Fortnite Remix Chapter 2</a> alongside Snoop Dogg, Ice Spice, and a tribute to the late rapper Juice WRLD.</p><p>Although Eminem hasn't made many video game appearances, his music has been used to promote titles before, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-15s-launch-trailer-brings-on-eminem/1100-6445808/" data-ref-id="1100-6445808">the launch trailer for Final Fantasy 15</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wwe-2k19-soundtrack-features-eminem-metallica-post/1100-6461867/" data-ref-id="1100-6461867">the soundtrack for WWE 2K19</a>. In 2022, Kirk Ewing shared a story about a Hollywood producer approaching Rockstar Games about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/eminem-could-have-starred-in-a-gta-movie-from-top-gun-director/1100-6509155/" data-ref-id="1100-6509155">a Grand Theft Auto movie starring Eminem</a> and directed by Top Gun helmer Tony Scott. According to Ewing, Rockstar's Sam Houser turned down the pitch.</p><p>As for Fortnite, some of the game's next collaborations include <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/its-morphin-time-in-fortnites-incredible-live-action-power-rangers-teaser/1100-6533692/" data-ref-id="1100-6533692">the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-might-be-getting-jason-voorhees-and-ghostface-for-halloween/1100-6533777/" data-ref-id="1100-6533777">potentially Friday the 13's Jason Voorhees and Scream's Ghostface</a>.</p>

                <p>Writer-director Hideo Kojima has revealed the two deceased Hollywood legends that he would have enjoyed working with for one of his games. Speaking to <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/features/interviews/death-stranding-2-hideo-kojima-interview-1235143146/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IndieWire</a>, Kojima singled out Steve McQueen (Bullitt, The Great Escape) and David Lynch (Twin Peaks).</p><p>Kojima said McQueen was his "childhood hero," and he's not giving up on the possibility of him showing up in a future project, even though the actor died 45 years ago. "If it were possible, even with CG, I would love for him to be in one of my games someday," he said.</p><p>Kojima went on to say that he had "always hoped" to cast Lynch in a video game of his. The visionary filmmaker and actor passed away earlier. Kojima was a big fan of his, saying he was "devastated" like so many others when Lynch died in January this year.</p><p>While Kojima didn't get to work with McQueen or Lynch, he has worked with numerous Hollywood directors on his projects over the years. The filmmakers Jordan Vogt-Roberts, Edgar Wright, Guillemo del Toro, and Nicolas Winding Refn all appeared in Death Stranding, for example. Looking ahead, Kojima is teaming up with Oscar-winning Jordan Peele for the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kojima-teases-new-game-od-people-will-love-it-or-hate-it/1100-6533580/" data-ref-id="1100-6533580">OD</a>, though the exact nature of the partnership is unknown.</p><p>Kojima's latest game was Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, which was released in June on PS5. In addition to OD, Kojima is working on an espionage game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/physint/">Physint</a> with Sony--he revealed in the IndieWire interview that the game is still early in development and is in the conceptual phase where he is the only person working on it.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-od-xbox-horror-game-still-in-development/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hideo-kojima%E2%80%99s-xbox-horror-game-od-is-still-in-development-amid-multiple-project-cancellations-at-microsoft.1265070/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-layoffs-funding-increased-spending-ai-infrastructure/">Microsoft laying off 9,000+ people</a> across its whole company resulted in a number of projects being cancelled, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/spencer-reportedly-loved-playing-zenimax-onlines-new-game-in-march-only-to-cancel-it-in-july/">a new MMO from ZeniMax Online</a>, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/">Perfect Dark reboot</a>, Rare's <a href="https://wccftech.com/rare-everwild-cancelled-microsoft-gaming-layoffs/">Everwild</a>, and as we just learned earlier today, <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-reportedly-stopped-contraband-development-avalanche-studios/">Contraband, from Avalanche Studios</a>. One game that isn't cancelled however, according to a Microsoft spokesperson, is Hideo Kojima's horror game he's making in collaboration with Xbox, OD.</p>



<p>That news comes from Bloomberg's Jason Schreier, who in his reporting on Contraband, asked after the status of OD, which is another project from Microsoft that was announced years ago, though we've heard very little of since. He reports that he was told by a Microsoft spokesperson that OD "<em>is still in development</em>."</p>







<p>OD was first announced during <a href="https://wccftech.com/od-hideo-kojima-horror-game-xbox-revealed-jordan-peele/">The Game Awards 2023 showcase</a>, and was such an exciting announcement at the time, that it was the one game out of everything else announced that year that <a href="https://wccftech.com/kojimas-od-topped-tga-2023-press-coverage-says-fancensus/">dominated press coverage of TGA 2023</a>.</p>



<p>Since then, however, we've heard very little about OD. Kojima has mentioned it and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/kojima-provides-update-on-death-stranding-2-and-his-many-other-productions/">work he's doing on it in passing</a>, and has also talked about how his goals with OD is to make something that players have not necessarily seen before. He's called it a <a href="https://wccftech.com/kojima-says-o-d-is-risky-talks-death-stranding-movie-and-physint-crossmedia-plans/">"<em>risky</em>" game</a> that will be<a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-disappointed-industry/"> "<em>divisive</em>,"</a> but at the same time it sounds like he's excited to be making something that he knows will push players, something he knows that not everyone will fall head-over-heels for.</p>



<p>Horror-director Jordan Peele is also meant to be working on OD alongside Kojima and Xbox, though what we know about Peele's involvement so far is equal to what we know about OD itself, which is very little.</p>



<p>Perhaps now that <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review-in-progress-one-more-for-the-road/">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> has launched and is on store shelves, we'll soon start to hear more about what's happening with OD, and get a more official word/sign on if it's happening at all. </p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/splinter-cell-enhanced-mod-pc-steam-deck-2000616399</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-incredible-splinter-cell-mod-offers-the-definitive-experience-of-a-stealth-classic.1265064/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>When the original <i>Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell</i> arrived in 2002, it threatened to dethrone <i>Metal Gear Solid</i>’s tight grip on the stealth genre. And for some purists, it likely succeeded, given its groundbreaking technical displays of light and shadow that were more than just pretty to look at. The game also pushed you to move with more caution, with enemies that, in some instances, were far more perceptive than what <i>Metal Gear Solid 2</i> offered at the time. <i>MGS3</i> would arrive shortly after to up its stealth game, perhaps having learned a thing or two from <i>Splinter Cell</i>, but the original <i>SC</i> and its two direct sequels remain incredible challenges for those of us who like to lurk around in the shadows. And if you’ve been craving a return to Sam Fisher’s first outing, then let me tell you about this incredible mod that makes it hard to go back to the original.</p> <p><i>Enhanced SC</i> is a project from modder Joshhhuaaa that you can <a href="https://github.com/Joshhhuaaa/EnhancedSC">grab on GitHub</a> right now for both Windows and Steam Deck. It introduces a suite of improvements, which include a mission statistics tracker that lets you know just how stealthy your current run is, proper widescreen support, fixes to movement speed, better controller support, maps based on original Xbox versions, the Nuclear Power Plant level from the PS2 version, and <a href="https://github.com/Joshhhuaaa/EnhancedSC/blob/main/PatchNotes.md">so much more</a>.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000616402" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616402"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616402">© Ubisoft / Joshhhuaaa / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>While many mods of this kind sometimes make for an experience that feels quite different from the original game, <i>Enhanced SC</i> feels remarkably faithful to what it was like to play <i>Splinter Cell</i> on PS2 or Xbox back in the day. There are some notable tweaks to the gameplay, such as the inclusion of whistling (which would show up in later <i>SC</i> games), and distinct commands for opening a door fully or partially to peek into the next room. These feel like very natural inclusions to the original game–in fact, until I read through the patch notes, I didn’t realize they <em>weren’t</em> in the first <i>SC</i>.</p>

 <p>Steam Deck support, however, is where this mod really shines. It runs surprisingly well for such an old game on a Linux machine. There’s also a dedicated “EnhancedSC Layout” controller scheme you can download from the community layouts that allows for precision aiming by way of the right touchpad, and a quicksave and load feature mapped to the left one (this makes quickly resetting to your last save for save-scummy playthroughs a breeze).</p> <figure id="attachment_2000616403" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616403"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616403">© Ubisoft / Joshhhuaaa / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>If it’s been a while since you’ve jumped into Sam’s sneaking suit, do yourself a favor and check out this mod. Who knows when (or if) we’re getting <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-7-canceled-games-splinter-cell-assasin-s-creed-1849976552">that damn remake anyway</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>For all of the completionists out there, Mafia: The Old Country provides you with plenty to work towards to complete the entire game. </p>



<p>Hangar 13 returned to the franchise’s roots for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mafia-the-old-country-release-date-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mafia: The Old Country</a>. Instead of an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mafia-the-old-country-open-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open world</a> as seen in Mafia 3, the latest installment is a linear-narrative driven game. As such, the game has a similar expected run time to the first two games of the series, meaning you can expect around <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-long-to-beat-mafia-the-old-country-game-length-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10-12 hours of content</a>. </p>



<p>Some fans assumed that less content is what led to the game receiving a $50 pricetag, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mafia-the-old-country-devs-say-game-isnt-short-just-because-its-only-50/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hangar 13</a> assured players that they won’t be “disappointed” by the final package. And although Mafia: The Old Country is shorter than other Triple AAA single-player offerings, there is still a long list of trophies and achievements to earn. </p>

However, there are a few trophies in particular that require skill and patience, such as killing Mazzone without alerting his men and infiltrating the villa without being seen. </p>

Releasing on September 5 for PS5, Switch, and PC, it's looking like a fresh take on the classic golf video game series, featuring simple controls, a variety of solo and multiplayer gameplay modes, and a long list of character customization options. While preorders are available on all platforms, PC players should consider <strong>preordering at Fanatical, where it's on sale for $33.59 (was $40)</strong>. This is the best price we've seen for the upcoming game, and the discount is only available before launch. Preordering the game unlocks the playable Pac-Man character early. You'll also get an additional 5% off voucher for your next Fanatical purchase.</p><p>As if that weren't enough, Everybody's Golf Hot Shots preorders are also eligible for Fanatical's Summer Bonus Drop deal, which gets you a random bonus prize when you spend $15 or more during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fanatical-summer-sale-2025/1100-6533680/" data-ref-id="1100-6533680">Fanatical's Summer Sale event</a>. The possible prizes include free game keys and bonus coupon codes. Grabbing the game at Fanatical gets you an official key redeemable via Steam.</p><p>Everybody's Golf Hot Shots is the first new game in the popular Hot Shots Golf series (known as Everybody's Gold in Japan) since 2017. It's also notable as the first game in the series to launch on PC and Nintendo platforms--all previous games in the series have been exclusive to PlayStation consoles and handhelds, and many were never localized outside of Japan. While the series features many of the core mechanics of other golf sim games--including swing strength meter, varied courses, and even weather conditions to contend with--Everybody's Golf offers a more arcadey take on the genre, with simple controls, cartoony visual style, and multiple gameplay modes, including challenge modes and high-score leaderboards.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4545933-golfpacmanbonus.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545933" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4545933-golfpacmanbonus.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545933"></a><figcaption>Everybody's Golf Hot Shots preorder bonus</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4545933-golfpacmanbonus.jpg"></figure><p>As mentioned above, Everybody's Golf Hot Shots digital preorders are also available on PS5 and Switch. While the game isn't discounted on those platforms, you can still get the early Pac-Man unlock preorder bonus by securing your copy early. Pac-Man will be available as a character in the full game after launch, too, but preorders unlock him early.

Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a> is also performing well, resulting in yet another week in which <em>two</em> MK titles have made the top ten.

<p>Hardware this week yields no change in the top ten, with the Switch 2 once again claiming the top spot. Cumulative Switch sales reach 18,637 units this week, while the PS5 has managed a total of 7,141. So yes, despite Nintendo launching a <em>brand new console</em>, mind you, the previous-gen Switch managed to outsell the PS5 by more than 2:1.</p>

However, if you don’t want to wait for what’s next, you can currently save on the <strong>Samsung Galaxy Buds FE</strong>, which are down to $46.99 ($53 off) at <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/new-samsung-galaxy-buds-fe-true-wireless-bluetooth-earbuds-9" rel="sponsored">Woot</a>. That’s their best price yet and a deal that will run until September 2nd or while supplies last.</p><p>Despite being nearly two years old, the Buds FE remain a solid pair of wireless earbuds. They offer good sound and impressive noise cancellation for the price, but it’s the fit that really stands out. Unlike the pricier Galaxy Buds 3 and Buds 3 Pro, the Buds FE feature a wing tip design that provides a more comfortable, secure fit. Meanwhile, a flattened touchpad area makes pausing, playing, and skipping tracks more foolproof.</p><p>The Buds FE miss out on more advanced features, including a conversation mode and proper multipoint Bluetooth support. They also lack wireless charging and carry a meager IPX2 rating for water resistance, which means they could get damaged if dropped into a pool of water. That being said, a transparency mode ensures you stay aware of your surroundings by letting ambient noise in, and battery life is solid enough to last a full day.</p><div><p id="more-deals-to-check-out"><h2>More deals to check out</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>The <strong>second-gen Backbone One with USB-C</strong> is down to $69.99 ($30 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BACKBONE-Mobile-Gaming-Controller-Lightning-iOS/dp/B0CCT2LWT8?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fbackbone-one-usb-c-mobile-gaming-controller-for-iphone-15-16-series-and-android-2nd-generation-black%2F6558725.p" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>, and <a rel="sponsored" href="https://backbone.sjv.io/c/482924/2186621/25186?u=https%3A%2F%2Fbackbone.com%2Fproducts%2Fbackbone-one-usb-c">Backbone’s storefront</a>, matching the largest discount we’ve seen this year. The controller is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525741/backbone-one-iphone-ios-controller-gaming-portable-review">one of our favorites</a> for gaming on the go, especially when playing titles like <em>Resident Evil 2</em>. It boasts a compact design complete with analog sticks, a D-pad, and a 3.5mm headphone jack to connect wired headphones. Meanwhile, its USB-C connector means it can work with both Android smartphones and the iPhone 15 or newer. It also supports passthrough charging, so you don’t have to stop your game because of a low battery notification.</span></li><li><span>The <strong>Dyson Zone</strong> are currently down to $199 ($500 off) at <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/new-dyson-zone-active-noise-cancelling-headphones-5" rel="sponsored">Woot</a> through the end of the day, the lowest price we’ve seen on the noise canceling headphones. What makes them unique — aside from their retro-future look — is the Zone come with an air purifier you wear over your mouth. The magnetic visor does a decent job filtering pollutants, giving you clean air wherever you may be. They also deliver top-notch noise cancellation — better than the AirPods Max — and are comfortable despite being relatively heavy at 1.3 pounds. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23698352/dyson-zone-review-headphones-wearables-air-purifier">Read our review</a>.</span></li><li><span>The starting price of the <strong>Switch 2 Pro Controller</strong> was recently raised to $89.99 following <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/717610/nintendo-switch-original-price-increase">Nintendo’s sweeping price hikes</a>. However, you can still get it for $74.99 ($15 off) at <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.costco.com/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller.product.4000371761.html" rel="sponsored">Costco</a> if you have a membership. The controller features two extra programmable buttons embedded into its grips, a dedicated GameChat button, and a 3.5mm headphone jack that can output game audio to wired headphones. While it’s a nice upgrade over the original Switch Pro Controller, it still includes drift-prone potentiometer joysticks instead of the more durable Hall effect or TMR joysticks. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/684602/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-review">Read our review</a>.</span></li></ul></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6Njg3NzE5"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Brandon Russell</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/756210/samsung-galaxy-buds-fe-nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-deal-sale]]></content:encoded>
