            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Earlier this year, Bethesda Game Studios briefly captured the interest of many gamers with the mystery surrounding the remaster of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. Rumors had swirled for months about it, but they did not confirm anything until the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-looks-gorgeous-and-its-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcement and immediate release of Oblivion Remastered on April 22, 2025</a>.</p>



<p>It was a veritable 'shadowdrop', an unusual marketing strategy where the developer and publisher do not market their product in advance but instead focus entirely on maximizing the surprise effect. <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-elder-scrolls/after-oblivion-remastered-and-hi-fi-rush-bethesda-game-studios-director-wants-more-shadowdrops-because-we-all-have-short-attention-spans-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking to Gamesradar</a> during the recent Golden Joystick Awards, Bethesda Game Studios Director Tom Mustaine, who was in charge of the Oblivion remaster project as Director of External Projects (Virtuos handled the game's Unreal Engine 5 port), mentioned the previous shadowdrop of Tango Gameworks' Hi-Fi Rush as a successful test run and suggested the studio would like to do more.</p>



<p><em>We had a real successful shadowdrop with Hi-Fi Rush through Xbox and through Bethesda. Todd Howard, the boss man, he's wanted to shadowdrop things for a long time because it's so great to be able to say, 'Here's the thing, get it today.' It's very valuable.</em></p>



<p><em>We all have short attention spans now. There's Grand Theft Auto, for example. I want that today, right? So it is an interesting strategy… I don't have any ideas of what would be next, but I hope it's not the last. Personally, I think it was great to own the internet for that day and, you know, give people exactly what they want the moment we talk about it. I'm a fan of that personally, but I'd love to see more people do it.</em></p>



<p>Indeed, the penchant of Bethesda Game Studios boss Todd Howard for shadowdrops is well known. Just recently, he <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-still-a-long-way-off-says-todd-howard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commented</a> that he'd love for the studio's next highly anticipated game, The Elder Scrolls VI, to 'just appear' eventually once it is ready to ship to fans.</p>



<p>It seems unlikely Microsoft would agree to let them do this to such a massively anticipated title, sequel to one of the best-selling games of all time, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. Going with a more traditional marketing campaign would be the safest route, although perhaps a middle ground could be a Fallout 4-style reveal at E3 (now Summer Game Fest) and subsequent release in November. </p>



<p>A game that could be shadowdropped by Bethesda, similar to Oblivion Remastered, is the Fallout 3 remaster. <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-new-vegas-remastered-reportedly-in-the-works-fallout-3-remastered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to rumors</a>, it's in development alongside a remaster of Fallout: New Vegas.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry">Far Cry</a> is set to be turned into a live-action TV series on FX, something Ubisoft <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-far-cry-tv-show-that-doesnt-shy-away-from-the-darkest-most-absurd-parts-of-humanity-is-reportedly-in-development-at-fx">reportedly let slip</a> back in August, but has now been <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-ca/article/7sST77RTZF7s9GKsxETUy4/far-cry-tv-series-ordered-by-fx.">formally announced</a> by the publisher in a post that's yet to be randomly zapped into the ether.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The series is set to be co-created by Alien: Earth director Noah Hawley and It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia's Rob McElhenney, now going by Rob Mac. Streaming on Hulu in the US and Disney+ internationally, each season of the show will be its own standalone actiony shindig just like a fresh Far Cry game, with a new setting and cast of characters.</p>
<p>So, probably your usual Far Cry affair of touring the world in search of civil wars or strife revolving around one bloke who's very good at making evil speeches. It's a formula that I've enjoyed plenty over the years, even if the last couple of entries have failed to really light my shrubbery on fire as well as Far Cries 2 and 3 did back in the day. Or maybe it'll gop for something a bit like caveman-filled spin-off Primal or 80s homage Blood Dragon, just to spice things up a bit.</p>
<p>"What I love about the ‘Far Cry’ game franchise is it’s an anthology," Hawley said. "Each game is a variation of a theme, the same way each season of ‘Fargo’ (another show he worked on for FX) is a variation on a theme. To create a big action show that can change from year to year, while always exploring the nature of humanity through this complex and chaotic lens is a dream come true. I’m excited to partner with Rob and bring our shared irreverent, ambitious sensibility to the screen."</p><p>Mac, who'll star and produce, added that Ubisoft have been "remarkably generous" and that he's keen to work with Hawley. It's worth noting that Mac and Ubi have previously collabed Apple TV+ series Mythic Quest, in which the actor played the creative director of an MMORPG alongside prolific game voice actress Ashly Burch.</p>
<p>Maybe it's time for me to finally dig that 2008 Uwe Boll-directed Far Cry movie out and see if it lives up to its <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1219216-far_cry">reputation</a>.</p>

            <p>Activision has announced the full suite of new additions coming to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> in its Season One update, which looks to be bringing a vast spread of new toys across all three game modes on the 4th December. It'll also let players skip the single player campaign and jump into the Warzone-style Endgame mode immediately.</p>
<p>Prior to Season One, players would have to complete the Black Ops 7 campaign before accessing the Endgame. Makes sense right? You'd want to know what the story is before hopping into the post-launch narrative vehicle which is the Endgame. Well, for those who want to farm out weapon cosmetics as fast as possible, you can skip past all the pesky narrative nonsense and get right into the action.</p>
<p>When you do you'll be facing a host of new world events, including a giant robot, and toxin-induced hallucinations. Later in the season you'll also be able to fight a VTOL aircraft that is, according to the official Season One blog post, "manifested by fear". It's a super scary VTOL, guys.</p>

<p>You'll also get new exotic skills to mess around with, and there'll be a Christmas-themed event near the end of the year to keep you festive. As for Black Ops 7 multiplayer, more than six new maps and modes are coming alongside a new scorestreak: the Deadeye Drone. Finally, multiplayer is gaining 12 returning loadout items from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Black Ops 6</a> too which should mix things up as you journey through the prestige ranks.</p>
<p>To conclude, Black Ops 7 Zombies is getting a new round-based zombies map, new modes for both a narrative-led and challenge-focused experience, returning loadout items, and a festive-themed limited-time-event.</p>
<p>It all seems rather jam packed with engaging pursuits for every kind of Call of Duty fan. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-underperforms-on-steam-during-launch-weekend-but-does-that-mean-the-games-sold-badly">popularity of this Call of Duty is a bit of a mystery right now</a>, with the public data we can look at pointing to a less successful launch for the military FPS series than we've seen in recent years. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-european-sales-are-63-down-on-battlefield-6-and-50-down-on-black-ops-6">We do know the game is selling far less than Battlefield 6 in Europe so far, and is looking worse off than Black Ops 6 was in the same region</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review">why not give Eurogamer's review a read</a>!</p>

            <p>Promising half-vampire, half-human role-playing game The Blood of Dawnwalker used AI during development to test spoken lines before hired actors came in to record them. Game director Konrad Tomaszkiewicz - formerly director of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> - told me this during a recent interview, in which he shared a fairly balanced take on AI use in general.</p>
<p>"We used AI for voices during the testing period of time before the recordings," Tomaszkiewicz told me, "because my experience from the previous projects was that you [understand] a lot more when you hear the voices, and we wanted to have it as soon as possible to test the game and iterate on it. And then when we decided the story was great and it worked, we started the proper recordings with the actors. This is the use of the AI we had in our company," he said, "and I think that it's quite reasonable.</p>
<p>"But on this subject," he added. "I think that AI should help people and AI shouldn't replace them. If we can use AI to make people's lives easier..." Here, he gave an example. He said his quality assurance team on Dawnwalker is currently combing the game's world for intersections between environment meshes to check they all line-up correctly, and that there aren't any holes where, presumably, players can fall through. Their time, he believes, could be better spent elsewhere.</p>

<p>"To be honest, I'd prefer to do it automatically - we have the tools for that; not AI but our own tool - and use the time of the people to tell me if the game is good," he said. "If the feel of the gameplay is proper. If the story is good and the dialogues: they understand it, they feel emotions and so on. This is the way we should use the skills of creative people.</p><p>"I'm not totally against AI," he added, "but it needs to evolve to the place where it will be the tool which helps us, like Google Translate, not something which steals the author rights and creates the graphics or the animations because it learns from the creations of people."</p>
<blockquote><em>"You need to have people who feel, who have this creative fire, who want to prove something"</em></blockquote>
<p>Ultimately, he said, creative people will always be at the heart of a project. Replace them with AI and people will notice, because the human element will be absent. And it's that human element that's irreplaceable. "I don't believe that it will replace the creative people," Tomaszkiewicz said. "It can help, but not replace them. I don't feel that games created with only AI will have soul. I don't believe it. Really.</p>
<p>"I finished Dispatch recently," he went on, "which is my game of the year. I love this game. And I don't believe that AI could create something like this. It's not possible. You need to have people who feel, who have this creative fire, who want to prove something, who want to tell you a particular story and create emotions in these particular moments. A machine will not understand us as much."</p><p>Blood of the Dawnwalker is in development for PC, PS5 and Xbox Series S/X, and scheduled for a release sometime next year. It follows the adventures of Coen, a recently not-quite-turned vampire, who has 30 days and 30 nights to rescue his family. But how he goes about it - and where he goes in the world - is up to you; <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-3-directors-new-rpg-the-blood-of-dawnwalker-is-different-to-that-classic-cd-projekt-red-game-in-one-big-way-it-doesnt-have-a-main-quest">there is no main quest in The Blood of Dawnwalker to guide you</a>.</p>

            <p>An anthology series based on Ubisoft's Far Cry games has been announced.</p>
<p>The FX series will feature a new cast and setting, with the team promising "the exact level of chaos your therapist told you to avoid". That sounds up Vaas' street, or beach, anyway!</p>
<p>Attached to the upcoming Far Cry project is Rob Mac (née McElhenney), known to many as Mac from Always Sunny in Philadelphia, a show he created and co-developed with Charlie Day (the voice of Luigi in the recent Mario Movie adaptations) and Glenn Howerton. Mac will produce the series alongside Alien Earth creator Noah Hawley.</p>

<p>"FX has had magnificent partnerships with Rob Mac and Noah Hawley for a combined six series and 32 seasons of television, and we couldn't be more excited that they are teaming up for Far Cry," said Nick Grad, President, FX Entertainment. "I have no doubt that they will tell this story in a way that is original, gripping and wildly entertaining. We also want to thank our partners at Ubisoft for entrusting us with this beloved property."</p><p>"Getting to work alongside Noah Hawley is a dream realised," Mac added. "Ubisoft has been remarkably generous, entrusting us with one of the most iconic video-game worlds ever created. And through it all, my FX family continues to lift me up with their constant belief and support."</p>
<p>"What I love about the Far Cry game franchise is it's an anthology. Each game is a variation of a theme, the same way each season of Fargo is a variation on a theme," Hawley furthered. "To create a big action show that can change from year to year, while always exploring the nature of humanity through this complex and chaotic lens is a dream come true. I'm excited to partner with Rob and bring our shared irreverent, ambitious sensibility to the screen."</p>
<p>In addition to a producer role, Mac - who also played Ian Grimm on comedy series Mythic Quest - will star in the Far Cry series, but as who remains for now unknown.</p>

<p>Word of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-far-cry-tv-show-that-doesnt-shy-away-from-the-darkest-most-absurd-parts-of-humanity-is-reportedly-in-development-at-fx">FX's Far Cry series first leaked back in August of this year</a>. Who leaked it? Well, Ubisoft itself, with the company accidentally posting about the show on its own site before quickly fixing its error and redirecting users back to the main page again.</p>
<p>Along with Far Cry, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-splinter-cell-animated-series-arrives-next-month-but-theres-no-sign-of-a-new-game">Ubisoft also recently released an anime series based on its Splinter Cell games</a>.</p>

<p>There's no information yet on the characters or series that might be included, but Paramount has a huge roster of popular franchises, with its portfolio including both Nickelodeon and Comedy Central. Some of its biggest series include SpongeBob SquarePants, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Transformers, South Park, Dora the Explorer, and Paw Patrol--though it seems unlikely that the franchises aimed at younger kids will be added to a video game like Fortnite.</p><p>Fans are also hopeful that the Paramount collaboration may mean an actual Sonic skin in Fortnite, with the Sonic the Hedgehog films being one of Paramount's major IPs. While Fortnite got a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rocket-leagues-best-rocket-pass-ever-just-dropped-especially-for-fortnite-players/1100-6534836/" data-ref-id="1100-6534836">Sonic collaboration earlier this year</a>, the cosmetics were mostly designed for Rocket League, and included only Sonic-inspired items rather than a full skin.</p><p>Two Paramount franchises were already rumored to be in line for future Fortnite collabs--SpongeBob and <a href="https://x.com/SamLeakss/status/1982196155606786464" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">South Park</a>--though it's unclear if those leaks were referring to the Sidekick integration, or if they will be getting more extensive collaborations. Fortnite's Simpsons mini-season has been hugely successful for the game, bringing in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-simpsons-update-led-to-a-huge-surge-in-players-the-most-in-a-long-time/1100-6535919/" data-ref-id="1100-6535919">largest number of new and returning players</a> in at least a year and boosting the game's <a href="https://fortnite.gg/player-count" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">average player count</a> higher than it has been for most of 2025. With such a successful cartoon collab, it wouldn't be surprising if Epic planned more mini-seasons for other nostalgic cartoons like those in Paramount's library.</p>

                <p>It's coming up to a decade since Nintendo released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-fox-zero/" data-ref-id="5000-285306">Star Fox Zero</a> for the Wii U in 2016. But if Nintendo won't get around to it, someone else has something very similar. Giles Goddard--one of the programmers of the original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-fox/" data-ref-id="5000-17652">Star Fox</a>--is working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/wild-blue-skies/" data-ref-id="5000-667522">Wild Blue Skies</a>, a new on-rails sky shooter that looks and feels a lot like his former franchise.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/wild-blue-skies-official-re-reveal-gameplay-video" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN </a>debuted the new gameplay video for Wild Blue Skies, which covers the entirety of the second stage, Hurricane. It's enough to give you <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-fox-64/" data-ref-id="5000-1946">Star Fox 64</a> flashbacks as Bowie Stray, an anthropomorphic pilot dog, leads his squadron--Chuck, Roe, and Thorne--into battle during a raging storm. And it gives us enough of the new team's personalities that we can say Thorne is definitely the Slippy Toad of this group.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25wVPzOTSLU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/25wVPzOTSLU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Goddard and his team at Chuhai Labs keep up the banter between Bowie and his group throughout the stage. And when Boss--that is his name--shows up to fight them at the end of the level, even he gets in on the chatter. The final version of the game will feature multiple biomes for the team to fly over, and Bowie can already do a Fox McCloud-style barrel roll.</p><p>Wild Blue Skies, formerly known as Wild Blue, is being published by Humble Games, and it's currently only planned to be released on PC through <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1921490/Wild_Blue_Skies/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, though there's no confirmed release date as yet. It's also not the only Star Fox tribute game on Steam. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-hasnt-made-a-star-fox-in-seven-years-but-heres-the-next-best-thing/1100-6516158/" data-ref-id="1100-6516158">Whisker Squadron: Survivor</a> was released in its final version on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-hasnt-made-a-star-fox-in-seven-years-but-heres-the-next-best-thing/1100-6516158/" data-ref-id="1100-6516158">Steam</a> earlier this year.</p><p>Although the Star Fox franchise is currently dormant, comedian Adam Conover has revealed that Nintendo was planning to team up with his former employer, CollegeHumor, for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-cancelled-the-legend-of-zelda-star-fox-series-due-to-netflix-leaks/1100-6487011/" data-ref-id="1100-6487011">a Star Fox stop-motion animated series</a>. That series, and a proposed live-action Legend of Zelda show on Netflix, fell apart after the projects were leaked, according to Conover.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/far-cry-tv-series-by-fx-is-now-official-produced-by-fargo-creator-noah-hawley.1363771/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Three and a half months ago, Ubisoft briefly <a href="https://wccftech.com/far-cry-tv-show-fx-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted</a> the announcement of a Far Cry TV series adaptation on its official website before quickly removing it. Usually, this kind of mistake happens a few hours before the news is supposed to go live, but everything went silent afterward, prompting fans to wonder whether this project was still going forward.</p>



<p>That seems to be the case now. The blog post <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-gb/article/7sST77RTZF7s9GKsxETUy4/far-cry-tv-series-ordered-by-fx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is once again live</a> and has stayed that way for a few hours. The details are largely the same: FX has placed an order for the series, which will follow an anthology format, where each season will feature a different setting and cast of characters. This is, after all, the same formula that has always been used in the Far Cry games, so it appears fitting.</p>



<p>It's also one that Noah Hawley, one of the two producers, is very familiar with, having successfully created the award-winning series Fargo. Hawley, who's also known for Legion and most recently for Alien: Earth, said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>What I love about the Far Cry game franchise is it's an anthology. Each game is a variation of a theme, the same way each season of Fargo is a variation on a theme. To create a big action show that can change from year to year, while always exploring the nature of humanity through this complex and chaotic lens is a dream come true. I'm excited to partner with Rob and bring our shared irreverent, ambitious sensibility to the screen.</em></p>



<p>Rob is the other producer, Rob Mac, whose birth name is Rob McElhenney. He's primarily famous as the creator of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Mythic Quest, and Welcome to Wrexham, the latter being a documentary series focused on the Welsh football club Wrexham A.F.C. that he co-owns with Ryan Reynolds. In a statement, Rob Mac added:</p>



<p><em>Getting to work alongside Noah Hawley is a dream realized. Ubisoft has been remarkably generous, entrusting us with one of the most iconic video-game worlds ever created. And through it all, my FX family continues to lift me up with their constant belief and support.</em></p>



<p>The Far Cry series will also be executive produced by Emilia Serrano for 26 Keys, Nick Frenkel for 3 Arts, Jackie Cohn for More Better Productions, John Campisi, and Gerard Guillemot, Margaret Boykin and Austin Dill for Ubisoft Film &amp; Television.</p>



<p>This FX adaptation joins a growing list of upcoming TV shows based on game IPs, including the likes of <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-tv-crystal-dynamics-amazon-mgm-sophie-turner-lara-croft-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tomb Raider</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-live-action-tv-series-officially-greenlit-by-netflix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin's Creed</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/life-is-strange-tv-series-amazon-charlie-covell-kaos-writer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Life is Strange</a>, Beyond: Two Souls, <a href="https://wccftech.com/life-is-strange-disco-elysium-amazon-series-fallout-walton-goggins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Disco Elysium</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-god-of-war-tv-show-begins-filming-march-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">God of War</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-tv-series-in-development-at-prime-video-with-fast-and-furious-9-writer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mass Effect</a>, Pacific Drive, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/wolfenstein-tv-show-amazon-fallout-producer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wolfenstein</a>, in addition to ongoing successful series like <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-show-will-have-a-shorter-season-2-but-season-3-will-be-larger-and-there-may-even-be-season-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Last of Us</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-season-2-lands-december-17-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/twisted-metal-tv-series-anthony-mackie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twisted Metal</a>.</p>



<p>Far Cry is one of the three big IPs that Ubisoft is focusing on with the new Vantage Studios subsidiary, which just <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-announces-imminent-closing-transaction-with-tencent-minority-stakeholder-vantage-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received</a> a significant cash infusion from Tencent. <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-2026-27-lineup-ghost-recon-far-cry-assassins-creed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to rumors</a>, Ubisoft is busy with two projects based on the first-person shooter series: a full-fledged sequel and an extraction shooter.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/charlie-cox-says-clair-obscur-expedition-33-nominations-should-be-credited-to-motion-actor/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/charlie-cox-says-clair-obscur-expedition-33-nominations-for-gustave-should-be-credited-to-the-motion-actor.1363765/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>British actor Charlie Cox was among those who received a nomination for their work on the game Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 at Geoff Keighley's The Game Awards.</p>



<p>Cox, a renowned film and TV actor whose credits include Stardust, Boardwalk Empire, The Theory of Everything, Daredevil, Kin, and Treason, was featured for the first time in a videogame in the role of Gustave, a resourceful engineer with a mechanical arm. In a reaction to the nomination news, though, he noted that most of the credits for Gustave should really go to the motion actor instead of himself.</p>



<p>At a recent panel hosted during the Mexican convention LaConve 64 in Monterrey, as <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@posta.entretenimiento/video/7575433617237642517" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recorded by Posta Entretenimiento</a>, Charlie Cox said:</p>



<p><em>Yes, I'm thrilled for this nomination. I have said this before, and I think it is important to say that there's an amazing French actor by the name of Maxence Cazorla who did almost all of the motion capture for that role. So, any nomination or any credit I get, I really have to give to him, because I really believe that the performance of that character is down to him, and my voice was just part of that process.</em></p>



<p>This isn't the first time the actor has shrugged off the accolades that came his way for the role of Gustave in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. Charlie Cox previously admitted that he's not a gamer, did not play the game, and only spent about four hours in the studio doing the voiceover after his agent signed him up for it, which now made him feel like a 'total fraud' when people praised him.</p>



<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 <a href="https://wccftech.com/golden-joysticks-awards-2025-winners-full-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has already won seven prizes at the Golden Joystick Awards</a>, including two for the performers (Jennifer English for Maelle and Ben Starr for Verso). It's set to win many more at The Game Awards and elsewhere throughout the award season.</p>



<p>As for Charlie Cox, fans are already wondering if he'll be in the already announced movie adaptation. He might have some competition from Glen Powell, though, who <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollywood-star-glen-powell-loves-clair-obscur-expedition-33/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> he played and loved the game.</p>
