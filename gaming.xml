			<p>Despite having been released over four years ago, Cyberpunk 2077 continues to be one of the best-looking open-world games ever released, and the latest version of the DreamPunk mod makes the game almost feel like a next-generation game.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.patreon.com/NextGenDreams" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The new version of the mod</a> introduces new features and improvements over its previous version, such as Dynamic Contrast and Realistic Cloud Lighting, improved weather conditions to make them look as realistic as possible, remade core LUT to allow for a higher dynamic range and more realistic sunlight and more. The new version of the mod also introduces some graphics configuration improvements to better fit NVIDIA DLSS 4 and the improved capabilities of the recently released RTX 5000 series. The end results are incredible, as showcased in the 8K resolution video below provided by NextGen Dreams.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cyberpunk 2077 on RTX 5090 with New DreamPunk 3.0 Graphics - Ultra Realistic Modded Showcase in 8K" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/etXFdqPu1Wk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077 was among the<a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nvidia-dlss-4/"> first games</a> to support the aforementioned <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-8x-faster-dlss-3-multi-frame-generation-enhanced-upscaling-rtx-20-above/">NVIDIA DLSS 4</a>. The new version of the upscaler, whose release coincided with the launch of the RTX 5090 GPU back in late January, introduces plenty of improvements over the previous version, including a new Transformer model that brings significant image quality improvements. DLSS 4 also comes with an RTX 5000 series exclusive feature, <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-rtx-5080-path-tracing-120-fps/">Multi Frame Generation</a>, which brings significant performance improvements in supported titles.</p>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series X, and Xbox One worldwide. You can learn more about how the game was changed with the 2.0 patch and the Phantom Liberty expansion by checking out Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-shiny-firmware-update/">review.</a></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/secret-mode-sumo-independent</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ex-sumo-publisher-secret-mode-goes-independent.1123854/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/secret-mode-sumo-independent<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ex-Sumo Group publisher Secret Mode has announced that it will split from the group and go independent, having secured the backing of investment firm Emona Capital.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/secret-mode-splits-from-sumo-to-become-independent-publisher" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Game Developer</a>, Secret Mode execs James Schall and Ed Blincoe led the buyout alongside Emona, and the goal is to focus on discovering and publishing indie games for PC and console without the backing of former owner Sumo Group.</p>

<p>Although the publisher technically has significant investment from Emona, it will remain entirely independent from a business perspective, with Schall and Blincoe continuing to lead the company.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/a-little-to-the-left-secret-mode.jpg?itok=5GLJBmVH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/a-little-to-the-left-secret-mode.jpg?itok=HOJ8iom7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>A Little to the Left&nbsp;</em>is just one of Secret Mode's publishing endeavors.</figcaption></figure><p>Schall says that becoming independent will allow Secret Mode to put "all [its] efforts into uncovering the indie gems that gamers never knew they needed in their lives".</p>

<p>He goes on to say that the studio is "committed to bringing [its] players the very best indie titles", but not just the ones being released in the future; Schall also says the mission is to help people "discover existing indie masterpieces that have undeservedly flown under the radar".</p>

<p>This news comes after Sumo Group, Secret Mode's former owner, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sumo-group-layoffs-refocus" rel="nofollow">announced it would lay off a number of staff</a> and refocus on support and work-for-hire projects rather than developing its own IP.</p>

<p>That move doesn't affect anything Sumo Digital, which is the development wing of Sumo Group, already has in the pipeline, so you can rest easy; there shouldn't be any more delays to&nbsp;<em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>as a result of this shakeup.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-sumo-group.jpg?itok=zuvLfQwE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-sumo-group.jpg?itok=x68r_sPu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Work on&nbsp;<em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>should be unaffected by Sumo Group's layoffs.</figcaption></figure><p>As Game Developer points out, Secret Mode isn't Emona's first gaming industry investment; the company has also invested in the likes of&nbsp;<em>Company of Heroes&nbsp;</em>developer Relic Entertainment, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sega-relic-entertainment-layoffs" rel="nofollow">also went independent last year</a>&nbsp;(a decision which preceded Relic's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/relic-entertainment-layoffs" rel="nofollow">own round of layoffs</a>, sadly).</p>

<p>As for Secret Mode itself, it's not entirely clear what's next for the publisher, although Schall says that he and the studio "hope to make some exciting announcements" regarding their future plans "in the coming months".</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a> developers Rockstar Games have announced the acquisition of Video Games Deluxe, the Sydney-based team who collaborated with them on the 2017 re-release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/l-a-noire">L.A. Noire</a>, virtual reality spin-off <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/l-a-noire-the-vr-case-files">L.A. Noire: The VR Case Files</a> and, most recently, post-launch updates for Grove Street's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-trilogy-definitive-edition">Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition</a>. The studio will now be known as (drum roll please) Rockstar Australia.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Video Game Deluxe were founded by Brendan McNamara in 2013. You might remember McNamara as the founder of original L.A. Noire developer, Team Bondi. Team Bondi had an outsized reputation for long hours, tyrannical management and high turnover, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-team-bondi-part-ways">as explored in an IGN report from 2011</a> based on anonymous developer interviews, which led to an investigation from the International Game Developers Association. The studio <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/la-noire-developers-team-bondi-in-administration">went into administration later that year</a>, after Rockstar announced they would not publish their next title.
</p>
<p>
McNamara and other former L.A. Noire developers subsequently got together to make a spiritual successor, Whore Of The Orient, at new studio KMM Interactive Entertainment, but the project and studio were eventually shuttered after publishing partner Warner Bros Interactive Entertainment pulled funding.</p>
<p>I'm not aware of any reporting about what it's like to work at Video Game Deluxe, who have done good work over the years. They're the outfit credited with "saving" Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition, a technical disaster of such magnitude that Rockstar felt moved to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pc-owners-of-the-gta-trilogy-can-claim-another-rockstar-game-for-free-right-now">hand out free games as compensation</a>.</p>
<p>
It's likely that the newly rebranded Rockstar Australia will be pitching in with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> development - Rockstar's latest is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/grand-theft-auto-6-is-still-hitting-consoles-in-autumn-says-take-two-boss-promise">due for release on console</a> later this year, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-publishers-think-pc-is-of-increasing-importance-in-2025-but-still-wont-announce-the-magic-date">a PC release date forthcoming</a>. "It's been an honour to work closely with Rockstar Games this past decade," McNamara said <a href="https://www.take2games.com/ir/news/rockstar-games-acquire-video-games-deluxe">in a statement regarding today's announcement</a>. "We are thrilled to be a part of Rockstar Games and to continue our efforts to make the best games possible."

And amid <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-pocketpair-gives-employees-monster-hunter-wilds-launch-day-off-after-receiving-mysterious-notes-from-staff-who-said-theyd-probably-be-too-unwell-to-work">indie developers saying its launch stopped sales of their games and Palworld developer Pocketpair giving staff the day off to play</a>, it seems Monster Hunter Wilds has caused an unlikely surge in sales of cheese naan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As reported by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/monster-hunter-wilds-causes-sales-of-actual-cheese-naan-to-skyrocket-in-japan-as-food-cutscenes-drive-players-into-cheese-craving-crisis/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Automaton</a>, Monster Hunter Wilds’ release has caused fans to rush out to Nepalese restaurants to buy cheese naan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But why cheese naan in particular? It’s because of one cutscene in the game that revolves around the cooking and eating of cheese naan. It shows it in great detail, complete with steaming hot melted cheese, as the player character and their companions sit down for a meal in Kunafa Village.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As you progress through the story in the Windward Plains, your hunter will be invited to a meal in the village of Kunafa, where those who live in the desert reside. These villagers who know nothing of hunting and haven't even seen weapons before treat you to a dish that resembles a freshly baked cheese naan. As you bite into its crispy surface with charred spots, both steam and melted cheese come pouring out. The meal is an unbelievable feast for a hunter from the outside world, making it a scene that shows just how much you're welcomed by these villagers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Automaton translated a number of social media posts from fans who were so inspired by the Monster Hunter Wilds cutscene that they sought out cheese naan in real life. A Nepalese restaurant in Tokyo called Salam Namaste also got in on the fun, tweeting: “Salam Namaste when we get 99 cheese naan orders at midnight.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr">深夜にチーズナン99個注文が入った時のサラムナマステ<br> <a href="https://t.co/WA7E2pYlNP" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/WA7E2pYlNP</a></p>— サラムナマステ Salam Namaste Tokyo सलाम नमस्ते👂🥘🌕🍗🥃 (@salamnamaste01) <a href="https://twitter.com/salamnamaste01/status/1896048091155054753?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">March 2, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">“The cheese naan is too popular,” <a href="https://x.com/salamnamaste01/status/1896188428393537908" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the restaurant added</a>. “Even though I had a lot of cheese, I started to run out so I had to go to the supermarket to buy more. Thank you, Monster Hunter!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-capcom-explains-how-cooking-works-in-the-seamless-world-ign-first">interview with IGN</a>, Kaname Fujioka, Executive Director and Art Director for Wilds as well as the Director of the first Monster Hunter game, explained how Capcom filled this short yet memorable food scene with attention to detail.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We spent quite a lot of time coming up with what those villagers eat,” Fujioka said. “Since they aren't a hunting people, what could they normally be eating? When we thought about how they get animal-based nutrients, we decided that they must raise livestock and eat dairy-based foods. You're able to get a grain similar to wheat when you go out to a more wide-open part of the map, right? So maybe they make something like naan using that grain. On top of that, we wanted it to be something made from simple ingredients, and not too complicated. We thought that a dish like cheese naan would be simple yet possible to depict in a delicious way, and so we put a good amount of effort into that."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So while it may appear to be a casual dining scene, it seems that a lot of labor went into showing this dish similar to one that exists in real life, cheese naan, in a delicious and meaningful way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's actually incredibly difficult to depict something that's crispy on the surface but springy on the inside using CG,” added Fujioka. “We'd been making attempts at the food scene in Kunafa from early on in development, even at the prototype stage, and we just couldn't get it to look the way we wanted. Still, the Wilds development team is incredibly talented, and I was shocked to see them ultimately reach the way it looks in the released version after a lot of trial and error. It really does look tasty..."</p><div id="monster-hunter-wilds-weapons-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Monster Hunter Wilds Weapons Tier List</h3><h3>Monster Hunter Wilds Weapons Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">To help get your Monster Hunter Wilds adventure started, take a look at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Things_Monster_Hunter_Wilds_Doesn%27t_Tell_You_-_Tips">what Monster Hunter Wilds doesn’t tell you</a>, and a guide to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Weapons">all 14 weapon types</a> in the game.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/clair-obscur-expedition-33-the-final-preview.1123827/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-the-final-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Years ago, a mentor told me that the most important part of any story is surprise. A few years later, a writer I deeply respect wrote that perhaps the difference between good and great writing is technique, though even that was probably not as important as conviction. But what keeps us invested in a story is curiosity, the gap between what we know and what we want to know, the questions that drive us. Combine all three, and you tend to create something special. Each and every one of us has played a game that grabbed us from the jump, that connected with us in some unexpected way. A game that surprised us. Whose belief in itself was obvious from the first frame. That made us want to explore. I have played <em>a lot</em> of video games, friends, and that feeling is increasingly rare for me, especially in the AAA space. So when I tell you that Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 grabbed me by the throat from the jump and didn’t let go for a single second of the three-and-a-half-hour demo I played, twice, believe me when I tell you that’s some powerful magic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re unfamiliar, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has a pretty fascinating setup. See, there’s this being called the Paintress, and every year, she paints a new number. When she does, every person of that age dies. Poof. Vanishes. Turns to dust. Do not pass go, do not collect $200. And the thing is, she’s counting down. Every year, the people dying get younger. So every year, the people of Lumiére send a volunteer Expedition of people with one year left to live on a desperate, impossible, doomed mission: go to The Continent across the sea and kill the Paintress so she can never paint death again.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 - March 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Expeditions have been going on for a while now; you’ll find journals from Expedition 84, so if you can do the math in your head, you’ll get how desperate this whole thing is and how young (but still older than the average RPG protagonist) your characters are.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Things get weirder once your crew lands on The Continent. They almost immediately run into an old man who nearly dispatches the whole Expedition single-handedly. You play as Gustave, one of the survivors: traumatized and alone, walking through countless corpses from other expeditions and his own. He’s about to shoot himself when he’s found by Lune, another member of the Expedition. She’s not blind to reality (they’re probably both going to die), but Expedition members swear an oath: “When one falls, we continue.” As long as one of them stands, their fight isn’t over.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Lune and Gustave clearly care about each other, but they don’t always get along. When they find an unsigned message indicating another member of Expedition 33, Maelle, might be alive, Gustave wants to drop everything and try to save her and then get out of Dodge; Lune is worried that the whole thing is a trap. Expedition members are always supposed to sign their messages. At one point, later on, Lune asks Gustave if he’s a coward because he just wants to get Maelle and get out. He’s not; he’s just dealing with watching almost everyone he knows die. And Lune? She’s the one that said they should land on that beach in the first place. Neither one of them has it easy. These characters are adults, and they’re written like it. They don’t always agree; they’re dealing with guilt and loss and trauma, and they’re not always kind to one another in the heat of the moment. But they care about each other. And at the end of that exchange, once they’ve calmed down, they share a laugh. Compelling characters are complex and flawed, and Expedition 33 seems to understand that.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Compelling characters are complex and flawed, and Expedition 33 seems to understand that.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Even if they weren’t, Expedition 33 could probably skate by on the world. My demo was fairly linear: there were branching paths with hidden grapple points, platforming, goodies and secrets to find, and tough optional enemies to take on, but this isn’t an open-world game. And it’s better for it. Expedition 33 reminds me of Final Fantasy X; these environments may be linear, but they’re gorgeous, whether you’re standing atop a hill looking at the Indigo Tree or both underwater and somehow not, Expedition 33 is a visual feast and I stopped in every environment I entered to marvel at the beauty and composition on display. There’s even a world map you traverse to get from place to place, like the RPGs of old.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What really hooked me, however, was the combat. Clair Obscur may be turn-based, but it’s not a DVD menu. There’s <em>a lot</em> of depth here. Every character has a melee and ranged attack, the latter of which must be aimed manually. Melee attacks build AP and ranged attacks spend it. You’ll also need AP for Skills, unique attacks that each character has in their arsenal. And on top of that, each character has a particular attribute. Gustave can use certain skills to build up stacks of Overcharge, which he can spend to cash out for a devastating attack; Lune’s spells grant elemental Stains that can supercharge her other spells for additional effects and damage; and my favorite, Maelle (you do rescue her; this is not a spoiler. She’s in Clair Obscur’s trailers), can switch between three different stances offering buffs to attack, AP generation, and defense. Managing your AP, setting up a big combo, and planning ahead matters; like FFX, the turn order is displayed on the left side of the screen, so you can plan every turn in advance, but strategy is only half the battle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The other half is moment-to-moment execution. You don’t just choose an option and wait for a canned animation to play out. When an enemy attacks you, you can dodge, parry, or jump to avoid it. Dodging avoids attacks while parrying nets you a potentially huge counter-attack and awards AP, but has a tighter window. Sometimes, the only way out is to jump over something. Sure, you can engage in the time-honored tradition of blocking with your face, but the harder fights are gonna force you to engage with these defensive mechanics. And if you parry an attack that hits your whole squad? All of them strike back in a beautifully choreographed counterattack that never gets old.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Early on, I ran into a very powerful enemy who could kill my characters in a single hit. But the thing was, he had to hit me. If I could parry him, I could win. It took me a couple tries on my first run (he had a tricky attack that forced me to parry or dodge twice in a row), but once I figured out I could parry the first hit and dodge the second, I managed to take him down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then there’s the backend stuff called Pictos and Luminas. You can equip up to three Pictos to any character, which provide buffs like “shooting this enemy might light them on fire” or “attacks do more damage” or “killing an enemy grants more AP” as well as stat upgrades. Win enough battles with a Picto equipped, and you can have everyone equip its effects, minus the stat bonuses, provided they have the required points. And this is where you can do some really degenerate stuff. Sure, Maelle has a skill that puts her in Virtuose stance (where she does 200% damage) if she uses it while the enemy is burning. Normally, you’d have to have somebody use another skill to set this up, but what if you give Gustave and Lune a Lumina that means their ranged attacks are likely to set enemies on fire? Or maybe you equip a Picto that cranks up your Base Attack damage or that awards more AP for nailing a parry, allowing you to stay on the offensive longer than you’d normally be able to. Then you’re cooking with gas.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Combine all that and battles offer a lot of interesting choices. Does this character dodge or do you risk more to try to land that parry? If someone’s low on health, do you spend an item or AP to bring them back up, or do you bet it all on dodging or parrying the next attack? How do you level up your characters? Who gets what skill as a Picto so they can stack the right stats and they don’t have to spend Lumina points to get that effect? And on and on it goes.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Expedition 33 is constantly finding new ways to make itself interesting.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">And through it all, Expedition 33 is constantly finding new ways to make itself interesting. What’s a Gestral, and why is Lune obsessed with them? Who is the Paintress, and what does she want? Why is the world the way that it is? Are all these beings actually hostile? Some of them seem pretty friendly, and you have the option to fight them or leave them alone. What’s the deal with that old man? How does any of this stuff work? In my demo, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 didn’t stop to explain itself, and I appreciated that. It trusted me to figure stuff out, and I was more invested in what was going on as a result. Most importantly, I could never predict what would happen next. By the time “Thank you for playing” came up on my screen at the end of my demo, I was thoroughly hooked. On my second runthrough, I found even more hidden areas, and laid the smackdown on one of the optional fights that had flummoxed me the first time around.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When my time Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was up, I wasn’t ready to stop. I wanted to fight more battles, learn more about the world, and spend more time with these characters. Sandfall Interactive is a new studio, but you’d never know this was their first game from playing it. Surprise. Conviction. Curiosity. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 nails all three. It had my interest before I played it; now it has my undivided attention. If Sandfall can stick the landing, they’ll have put together something remarkable.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Call of Duty publisher Activision has been blasted over its use of cheap AI once again, this time for a clearly-generated piece of artwork designed to announce a new Guitar Hero game for smartphones.
</p>
<p>
You'd think that the announcement of a new entry in the legendary Guitar Hero series would be worth... I don't know, paying an artist to put something original together.
</p>
<p>
Instead, the first announcement of Guitar Hero Mobile, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DGn9-qkAR3F/">posted to Activision's Instagram</a>, comes with its logo splashed over some weird AI backdrop, where four suspiciously-similar silhouettes hold red guitars in identical poses surrounded by towers of amps that look like washing machines. 
</p>
<p>
But clearly this is fine now, apparently, because it's only been a week since Activision admitted it had begun using cheap-looking AI artwork for its flagship Call of Duty franchise. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-admits-call-of-duty-includes-generative-ai">Players spotted a note from Activision confirming Call of Duty "uses generative AI tools to help develop some in-game assets"</a> that was belatedly added to the Steam page for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Black Ops 6</a>.
</p>
<p>
As well as AI-generated in-game calling card 2D art assets, Black Ops 6 promotional artwork used last Christmas featured a Santa Claus zombie with six fingers. Maybe they should get him in Guitar Hero, he might be pretty good at it.

<p>
Response to Activision's new Guitar Hero Mobile ad is as you'd expect. 
</p>
<p>
"AI Hero looks awesome 🔥" reads one comment. 
</p>
<p>
"I was actually excited, but then I saw the cover it's made out of AI, so I won't touch this, sorry," wrote another. 
</p>
<p>
"Ruin my fav game with AI slop," said a third, "I hope Activision falls over dude."
</p>
<p>
Earlier this month, Microsoft unveiled its new Muse AI tool designed to aid "gameplay ideation" and the preservation of older video games, supposedly - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsofts-generative-ai-model-muse-isnt-creating-games-and-its-certainly-not-going-to-solve-game-preservation-expert-says">a claim one expert branded as "idiotic"</a>.

                <p>A new competitive mode called Seek and Deploy Extraction is coming to Halo Infinite this year, and to celebrate, Halo Studios has partnered with ForgeHub for a contest to build a multiplayer map for it. The event runs now through May 13 and features a $20,000 prize pool.</p><p dir="ltr">Halo Studios recently released <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3sCBLERWYs" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a sneak-peek video on YouTube</a>--seen below--for S&amp;D Extraction that included info on the Halo Infinite map contest.

Winning six rounds first in S&amp;D Extraction will see your team come away victorious. The video notes that players won't have to "worry about carrying a bomb," as a designated area will prompt you to plant it. The starting weapon for Spartans is the Bandit Evo, though you can buy different weapons and equipment between rounds.</p><p dir="ltr">One mode that's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-infinites-battle-royale-mode-could-have-been-a-game-changer-dev-says/1100-6527192/">seemingly not coming to Halo Infinite is a battle-royale experience</a>.

		<p>Double Cross Studio and publisher 2P Games have confirmed that the twisted card game Sultan’s Game will be released on March 31st for PC via Steam. Sultan’s Game has the label of being a twisted narrative card game because you, as his advisor, have to complete different acts within a week or suffer the consquences of failure.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sultan's Game | Story Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x8KOjHJ-_As?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“Sultan’s Game&nbsp;is finally launching soon and we appreciate the overwhelming support from the community along the way,”</em> said Yin Li, Producer and Developer, Double Cross Studio. <em>“Both long-time supporters and newcomers will be able to immerse themselves in the Sultan’s turbulent world soon; stay tuned for the upcoming new information!”</em></p>
<p>Every seven days in Sultan’s Game players draw one of four card types; Carnality, Extravagance, Conquer, and Bloodshed. Carnality cards instruct players to seek pleasures of the body like sex, Extravagance instructs players to spend obscene amounts without a care, Conquer sends players on adventures to complete, and Bloodshed demands a blood sacrifice to please the Sultan. To complete these demands, players will be navigating court politics, the back alleys of the city, and wandering into brothels. Every decision made will have an impact on relationships with other people in your life from political rivals, allies, and family members. The various paths will lead to a variety of different endings, with decisions allowing you to try and control the Sultan, to outright killing him.</p>

<p>There is a demo available for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3117820/Sultans_Game/">Sultan’s Game on Steam</a> right now.</p>

<p>In&nbsp;<em>Take this Down: Being an Accurate Accounting of Doty and Taryon Darrington in the Basilisk’s Den</em>&nbsp;Barber manages to embody the voice and observations of an Automaton that has a vocabulary smaller than can be counted on two hands. Picking up in the Mincing Mongoose Tavern the quick talking Taryon is matched in pace by the intuitive and calculated observations of Doty, and TechRaptor has been provided with an exclusive excerpt.</p>

<p>Tary and Doty are about to be greeted by a group of adventurers looking to hire some assistance to take on a Basilisk that has been terrorizing the town of Lichenvel. This new party is comprised of a half-orc and two Eisfuura, a race of birdfolk on Exandria.</p>

<h2>Excerpt from&nbsp;<em>Take this Down: Being an Accurate Accounting of Doty and Taryon Darrington in the Basilisk’s Den</em>, by Jess Barber</h2>

<hr><p paraeid="{f11b0dcd-820f-446b-8980-86b8d9141e13}{96}" paraid="1618617820">Current location: The Mincing Mongoose Tavern, Beaded Alley, Port Damali, Menagerie Coast, Wildemount, Exandria, Mortal Plane. Recommended maximum occupancy: seventy-five medium-sized creatures. Current occupancy: six.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{f11b0dcd-820f-446b-8980-86b8d9141e13}{110}" paraid="1225477402"><em>The tavern where I established myself to commence the search for questing partners was a squalid little affair in the most dangerous part of town, absolutely teeming with cutthroats and villains. Risky, yes, but a necessary evil if I wanted to find like-minded compatriots willing to brave the trials and hardships of adventuring life. As I swilled rotgut whiskey, the only thing the tavern had on offer, I returned the steely-eyed glares of the other patrons, and wondered whether I would manage to escape with my life.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p paraeid="{f11b0dcd-820f-446b-8980-86b8d9141e13}{116}" paraid="1369027242">"Are you still working on your wine there, m'dear?"&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{f11b0dcd-820f-446b-8980-86b8d9141e13}{126}" paraid="275252197"><em>Name: Hilda Thurgood. Occupation: Tavern Proprietress. Ancestry: Gnomish. Apron: Blue Gingham. Cheeks: Rosy.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p paraeid="{f11b0dcd-820f-446b-8980-86b8d9141e13}{132}" paraid="23731557">"Oh dear, is it not to your liking?" Hilda's brow furrowed in concern as she noted Tary's mostly-full glass. "It's one of my favorite vintages, but I suppose it is a little on the sweet side. Shall I bring you something else to try?"&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{f11b0dcd-820f-446b-8980-86b8d9141e13}{142}" paraid="1593204177">"Oh! No, no, it's quite delightful, actually." Tary turned on his most sparkling smile. "The perfect terroir for my palate. In fact, I was just about to ask if you had any additional recommendations. It's so difficult to find a good sommelier these days, one must cherish the opportunity when one can."&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{f11b0dcd-820f-446b-8980-86b8d9141e13}{150}" paraid="746195104">Hilda's cheeks grew even rosier. "Well, that's awfully kind of you to say. I was actually just sampling from a new vineyard in Kamordah—" She was cut off by the bell on the tavern door jingling cheerfully.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{f11b0dcd-820f-446b-8980-86b8d9141e13}{164}" paraid="1621728785"><em>New occupant analysis: Ancestry: Human. Age: Early thirties. Hair: Close-cropped black curls. Eyes: Dark, with a roguish sparkle. Lips: Full, with the slightest smiling tilt, hinting at shared secrets. Shoulders: Broad. Jawline: Chiseled.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p paraeid="{f11b0dcd-820f-446b-8980-86b8d9141e13}{170}" paraid="1713494016">Tary was no longer looking at Hilda, his attention having shifted fully to the new patron. His heart rate had increased approximately ten percent. Doty recalled the protagonists from Tary's favorite romance novels, and Lawrence, and in general the sort of faces that tended to lead to Tary making bad decisions.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{f11b0dcd-820f-446b-8980-86b8d9141e13}{176}" paraid="996700783">This was concerning.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{f11b0dcd-820f-446b-8980-86b8d9141e13}{182}" paraid="821747334">The human lifted a hand in Tary and Doty's general direction, smiling. He had a tiny, fetching gap between his front teeth. "Afternoon!" he said. "You wouldn't happen to be Sir Darrington, would you? The one looking for a new adventuring party?"&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{f11b0dcd-820f-446b-8980-86b8d9141e13}{188}" paraid="590837791">"Wh—" said Tary. "I'm—was I—oh! Sir Darrington. Yes. Yes! Indeed, that's me. Please, do sit. All of you."&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{f11b0dcd-820f-446b-8980-86b8d9141e13}{198}" paraid="570955009"><em>Analyzing additional party members. One: larger-than-average half-orc. Long tusks, roughspun clothing, significant tattoo coverage. Analysis: Intimidating. Two: smaller-than-average eisfuura. Fluffy feathers, jaunty cap, leather vest with elaborate stitching. Analysis: Adorable.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p paraeid="{f11b0dcd-820f-446b-8980-86b8d9141e13}{214}" paraid="723162557">It took a little doing to replace two of the chairs with a bench capable of supporting the half-orc's weight, but eventually the newcomers got settled in around the table, with the concerningly handsome human sitting catty-corner to Tary—a little closer to Tary, in fact, than Doty would like. "I'm Clarke," he said, extending a hand, which Tary shook warmly.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{f11b0dcd-820f-446b-8980-86b8d9141e13}{220}" paraid="904875354">"Charmed, I'm sure," said Tary. "And your friends?"&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{f11b0dcd-820f-446b-8980-86b8d9141e13}{226}" paraid="947337582">&nbsp;"This is Dayner—" The small eisfuura. "And Bex." The half-orc.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{f11b0dcd-820f-446b-8980-86b8d9141e13}{240}" paraid="1357058711">"Pleasure," chirped Dayner, extending a wing to Tary.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{f11b0dcd-820f-446b-8980-86b8d9141e13}{250}" paraid="843914930">Tary took careful hold of the longest primary feathers. "The pleasure is all mine."&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{1}" paraid="1402955125">Bex lifted one large hand in a wave. "Hope you don't mind if I don't shake your hand," she said. Her voice was much quieter than Doty expected, and a little shy. Up close, he could see she had an assortment of twigs and dried leaves carefully woven into the unkempt reddish-brown curls of her hair. "Sometimes I accidentally, uh." She made a crushing gesture with both hands that very effectively conveyed broken bones, snapped ligaments, and general agony.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{7}" paraid="621031090">"When you put it like that, I certainly don't mind at all," said Tary. "And while we're at it, let me introduce my traveling companion, Doty. Say hello, Doty."&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{13}" paraid="746592624"><em>Creak</em>, said Doty.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{23}" paraid="1230810895">"<em>Fascinating</em>," said Clarke. "Your flyer mentioned an automaton, but I'll admit this isn't what I was expecting. Where did you get it?"&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{33}" paraid="62174805">"Well," said Tary, "I built him."&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{39}" paraid="1187222330">"Built! Well, damn." Clarke sat back, looking impressed. "You really are an inventor and an adventurer, huh. I figured that was an exaggeration, but I see now it wasn't one bit."&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{49}" paraid="1475600979">"Oh, well." Tary's cheeks pinked. "I like to stay busy, I suppose. You mentioned you saw my flyer…?"&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{59}" paraid="1111385143">"Right, your flyer. We saw it down by the waterway this morning, and as soon as I read it I thought, maybe we could help you. Or, more accurately, we thought maybe <em>you </em>could help <em>us</em>."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{77}" paraid="1855420558">"Please," said Tary, leaning forward and balancing his chin on his hand. "Say more."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{83}" paraid="1140380410"><em>Body angle: Fifteen degree incline toward conversational partner. Blink ratio: One-point-seven times standard. Currently remaining below threshold for 'fluttering eyelashes'.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{103}" paraid="1002606636">Clarke smiled, leaning forward, too, until the angle of his body matched Tary's. When he braced his elbows on the table, the swell of his biceps strained the fabric of his shirt.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{109}" paraid="841066796">This was very concerning.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{115}" paraid="1348720607">"Let me start at the beginning," said Clarke. "There's a small fishing village about a day's ride from here, name of Lichenvel. They've been having trouble lately with a basilisk. It's just been a general nuisance so far: getting into the storehouses, interfering with the catch, that sort of business. So far, nobody's been hurt, but, well." His expression grew somber. "I'm sure a seasoned adventurer such as yourself is familiar with basilisks. You know as well as I do that it's only a matter of time."&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{125}" paraid="559770756">Tary went from <em>Expression: Enchanted</em> to <em>Expression: Serious</em> one-point-one seconds too late. "Ah, yes. Yes, I certainly do."&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{139}" paraid="404277764">If Clarke noticed the delay, he didn't show it. He continued, "They put out a call for help, and we answered. The three of us have traveled together a long time, doing this sort of work. For coin, of course,&nbsp; but we also try to do some good in the world, and we're no strangers to monster-hunting. We felt we were well-equipped to take the beast on. And we would have been—"&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{149}" paraid="168470672">"We would have been!" cut in Bex. <em>Tone: Distressed.</em> "If it weren't for Swink being a rotten little—"&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{159}" paraid="1441881376">Clarke winced, and Bex stopped, frowning. "Sorry," said Clarke. "There's been some—inter-team conflict—"&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{165}" paraid="663646985">"We got ditched," interrupted Dayner.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{175}" paraid="517993732">Clarke sighed, rubbing his forehead. "One of our members abandoned us. It's not that the three of us aren't capable—we've taken on plenty of challenges on our own. But Swink was a skilled warrior, and to defeat a basilisk, you need someone who knows how to handle a sword. And that's not any of us."&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{185}" paraid="281501348">"It's not?" asked Tary. Doty calculated that the natural variation in Tary's line of sight had decreased significantly, in a way that indicated Tary was trying very hard to keep his focus on Clarke's face and nowhere else. "I'm just—surprised," Tary said, when Clarke looked puzzled. "You look like you might have trained a bit, is all."&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{195}" paraid="1267103819">Dayner covered her beak with a wing, muffling a cough. The blood flow to Tary's cheeks doubled.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{203}" paraid="12693597">"That's kind of you to say," said Clarke. "I mean, I do carry this." He gestured to a dagger slung at his waist; fairly standard-issue adventuring gear. "But honestly that's mostly for show. Really, I'm more of an academic. Here, look—may I?"&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{213}" paraid="563580536">There was a bit of spare thread clinging to the collar of Tary's cloak. Clarke reached long, elegant fingers towards it, then looked up at Tary, waiting for permission.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{219}" paraid="1312901962">Tary, holding his breath, nodded.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{225}" paraid="972174843">Clarke plucked the thread away from the fabric of Tary's cloak, and made a flourishing little gesture. There was a spark, and then, instead of the thread, he was holding a sleek, green feather.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{235}" paraid="470655775">"Of course," said Clarke. "I have plenty of spells in my repertoire that can hit harder in a fight; it's not all parlor tricks. But I'd barely know the pointy end of the sword from… the other one."&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{241}" paraid="1517605121">"The hilt," said Tary. <em>Expression: Helplessly Charmed.</em>&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/naoki-yoshida-square-enix-directors<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>producer Naoki Yoshida has seemingly been removed from Square Enix's list of its board of directors, suggesting that he's either been removed from the post or that he's voluntarily stepped down.</p>

<p>As spotted by the folks at <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/square-enixs-naoki-yoshida-no-longer-on-companys-board-of-directors/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Automaton Media</a>, a recent Square Enix <a href="https://www.jp.square-enix.com/company/en/news/files/9ac53f2f381de8e15cecedaae031d93e.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> regarding a change in executive structure names Yoshida as an executive officer rather than a director, although he's still listed as a director on the company's official <a href="https://www.jp.square-enix.com/company/ja/officer/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">executive list</a>.</p>

<p>While it's possible Yoshida has been demoted to executive officer rather than executive director, it's also possible he's finally been allowed to step down; he said <a href="https://dotesports.com/ff/news/square-enix-wont-let-naoki-yoshida-leave-its-board-of-directors" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">back in 2023</a> that he "[doesn't] want to be on the board" and that "it's much more fun just to make games".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-fantasy-xiv-producer-naoki-yoshida-square-enix-valigarmanda.jpg?itok=mbsA4oCk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-fantasy-xiv-producer-naoki-yoshida-square-enix-valigarmanda.jpg?itok=fTHbn7zq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>producer Naoki Yoshida may have been demoted from his position as executive director, but he may also simply have stepped down.</figcaption></figure><p>If Yoshida has indeed been demoted against his will, it may well have something to do with the fact that one of the games in which he was heavily involved, 2023's&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XVI</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-16-rebirth-profits-square-enix" rel="nofollow">underperformed compared to Square Enix's expectations</a>.</p>

<p>However, it's also worth noting that&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>'s most recent expansion&nbsp;<em>Dawntrail</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-outsold-expectations" rel="nofollow">along with&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remaster</em></a>,&nbsp;contributed to a softening of what might otherwise have been a rough quarter for Square Enix.</p>

<p>Of course, it's entirely possible that the situation is a mixture of both; Yoshida wanted to step down, and thanks to the lackluster performance of&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XVI</em>, he was allowed to do so.</p>

<p>Since there hasn't been any kind of official announcement from either Yoshida or Square Enix specifically regarding his change in role, it's hard to say, but I'm sure Yoshida is much happier away from the board.</p>

<p>Samsung has taken to the stage at MWC 2025 to unveil a stunning lineup of technology ranging from new OLED television sets to immense gaming monitors – and everything in between. The set included an incredible <strong>500 Hz OLED monitor </strong>and a gorgeous 240 Hz OLED laptop – and a conceptual handheld gaming device <strong>that folds in the middle</strong>.</p>



<p>This is following on from Samsung’s success with foldable mobile phones and tablets, and it’s a natural enough progression point, but is anyone asking for it?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-foldable-gaming-experiences">Foldable Gaming Experiences</h2>



<p>At MWC 2025, <a href="https://global.samsungdisplay.com/31346" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Samsung revealed</a> Flex Gaming, a conceptual device with a 7.2-inch screen that folds down the middle for ease of storage. It was revealed at the showcase, and a demo was held, but it wasn’t confirmed if the device was usable.</p>



<p>It looks as though it boasts a relatively traditional layout featuring a pair of joysticks and a d-pad, but there’s a recess on either side of the device. This is to allow the joysticks to ‘enter’ the device when it’s collapsed, which means it takes up even less space. </p>



<p>It was sat alongside a Steam Deck and Razer Blade 16, and all these devices were being used to run KRAFTON’s ‘popular games’, which included InZOI, a realistic competitor to The Sims.</p>



<p>Tech aficionados flocked to the event to check out Samsung’s new 77-inch QD-OLED televisions, as well as a 31.5-inch QD-OLED monitor, both of which boast utterly remarkably visuals and colour expression.</p>



<p>One of the more bizarre elements of the Samsung lineup was the Flexible Cabinbag, a bag-like device that unfolds into an 18.1-inch display. It can be compacted to fit inside a briefcase, and it comes equipped with – you guessed it – an OLED screen. That’s the order of the day where Samsung is concerned.</p>



<p>Do you think you’d invest in a folding handheld gaming device? Let us know in the comments.</p>

All game data has been completed, and we are currently making the final balance adjustments. Compared to the version shown at Tokyo Game Show 2024, it has become even more fun. After release, I’d love to jump into online play and enjoy it together with everyone!</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>I believe that once you try the full version, you’ll find yourself thinking like: “Oh? This is even more fun than I expected!” → “Wait, this is seriously amazing!” → “Wow?! So many things to explore!”</p><p>In terms of content volume, this is the largest <em>FANTASY LIFE</em> game yet in every aspect. I apologize for the delay in the release, but this extra time has allowed us to bring full multi-platform support, cross-save (so you can carry your save data across different consoles), and cross-play (letting players on different platforms enjoy online <a title="Genres > Multiplayer [454 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer">multiplayer</a> together). We’ve also made major user interface improvements, ensuring a more polished and seamless experience. Now, we’re finally bringing this game to completion in the best possible form. Please look forward to it!</p><p><strong>Behind this Project…</strong></p><p>In mid-2024, <em>FANTASY LIFE</em> faced an unexpected challenge. At that time, producer Keiji Inafune left the company, and we had to reassess and restructure the project.</p><p>Meanwhile, internal test players had given the game harsh evaluations, making it clear that major revisions were necessary. In response, I decided to take on the role of producer, shifting the core development team from Osaka to our headquarters.</p><p>While the Osaka team had been dedicated from the start, the project evolved into a collective effort across our whole company—with developers from Fukuoka, Tokyo and beyond, we were able to significantly strengthen our development capabilities.</p><p>This restructuring allowed us to expand the team and create an environment where we could focus on fine-tuning the game’s quality right up until the very end.</p><p>From that point onward, we undertook a complete overhaul of the game: adding <a title="Genres > Open-World [574 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/open-world">open-world</a> exploration and parkour-style <a title="Genres > Action [2,530 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s, restructuring the system’s progression flow, improving the core mechanics, and refining the scenario to be even more emotionally impactful.</p><p>Thanks to the solid foundation of the game’s core mechanics, these additions didn’t just fit in—they enhanced what was already great about the game, making the experience significantly more enjoyable. The improvements received high praise from our internal testers too, marking a major milestone: <em>FANTASY LIFE i</em> was finally nearing completion after its long development journey.</p><p>For us, watching Tokyo, Osaka, Fukuoka (and Hokkaido, too!) come together as one to push the game’s quality to a higher level was a powerful reminder of the true joy in creating a large-scale game.</p><p>The day that we can deliver the ultimate Fantasy Life experience to all of you is almost here! Get ready for it!</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

As for the movie, the film debuts on Netflix on March 14.</p><p>The game hails from the Russo brothers' production company, AGBO, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/chris-hemsworths-netflix-movie-extraction-might-become-a-game-under-agbos-new-deal-with-nexon/1100-6499357/" data-ref-id="1100-6499357">received $400 million in funding from gaming giant Nexon in 2022 to produce video games.</a> Anthony Russo told <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/the-electric-state-video-game-prequel-netflix-russos-1236325355/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Variety</a> that the game, which focuses on the characters Michelle and Chris, will provide more depth than what's possible in the movie alone.</p><p>"There's just a limit in a two-hour medium to how much ground you can cover, in terms of story. So the game does hold something very special in terms of like, who these people are, what their relationship is to one another, and how it evolves and grows over time," he said. "And I think people will find it very relatable. It's a wonderful, complicated brother-sister relationship in everything that that entails."</p><p>AGBO is likely to produce more video games in the future, as Anthony Russo said a "very important" aspect to the company's mission is to have its film and TV projects work "hand-in-hand with our gaming efforts." While Kid Cosmo is a mobile game, Anthony Russo said it's possible future games could land on other platforms.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0g_7kEqKdU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/y0g_7kEqKdU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"Every idea has a different way that it can best be explored and best be brought to audiences or gamers for an experience," he said when asked if future games could be AAA console or PC games.

		<p>Rockstar Games has announced it is acquiring the Australian based game developer Video Games Deluxe, though it has not disclosed the fee. Video Games Deluxe has been a long time partner studio of Rockstar Games, having worked on the re-release of LA Noire and LA Noire: The VR Files, along with updating Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition. Going forward, the name Video Games Deluxe will be dropped and the studio renamed to Rockstar Australia.</p>

<p><em>“After working together closely over many years, we are excited to have Video Games Deluxe join the team as Rockstar Australia,</em>” said Rockstar Games Head of Publishing, Jennifer Kolbe in a statement.</p>
<p><em>“It’s been an honor to work closely with&nbsp;Rockstar Games&nbsp;this past decade,”</em> said Video Games Deluxe founder&nbsp;Brendan McNamara. <em>“We are thrilled to be a part of&nbsp;Rockstar Games&nbsp;and to continue our efforts to make the best games possible.”</em></p>
<p>Video Games Deluxe was born out of the ashes of Team Bondi, developer of LA Noire, and was founded by Brendan McNamara. We do not know what this means going forward. It could be that Rockstar Australia will support with content and updates for Grand Theft Auto VI, or it could be a signal of intent by Rockstar to have another studio out there that can create more games.</p>

After playing a few hours of Sandfall Interactive’s dark fantasy RPG, I can say that <em>Expedition 33 </em>grasps the melodrama of modern <em>Final Fantasy</em> and marries it with the tactical turn-based combat fans of that series have been craving a return to for decades. On top of this, the game also has a <em>Paper Mario</em>-like timing mechanic to make that combat about more than just picking which attacks and items you use during a turn. Sandfall Interactive is cooking with some excellent ingredients, and the small taste I’ve gotten has me eager to try the full meal.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195840" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Take A Tour Through Halo Infinite's Newest Arena Maps" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="284" data-playlist="195840,196789,195624" data-current="195840"><div><p>Take A Tour Through Halo Infinite's Newest Arena Maps</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195840/195840_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195840/195840_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195840/195840_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195840/195840_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21353.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>If I wasn’t already on board for the incredible voice cast led by standouts like <em>Daredevil</em> actor Charlie Cox, <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>’s Jennifer English, and Clive Rosfield himself, Ben Starr, I would have been pulled in by <em>Expedition 33</em>’s tragic premise. In this world, a malevolent sorceress paints a number each year, and everyone in the world who is of that age is Thanos-snapped away. The titular expedition is made up of people who go on a journey to try and stop her, but even in thee early hours I played, there’s little hope that they’ll actually succeed. The expedition seems more concerned with carving a path for those who eventually can. No one hopes for much in a world where everything you know and love can be gone in the stroke of a paintbrush. Growing old is so improbable that meeting a senior citizen is like finding a member of an endangered species. The world of <em>Expedition 33</em> feels so far gone to the cast trying to save it that the act of trying feels like a futile suicide mission. It is deliciously dreary, like listening to the most heartbreaking emo song I’d ever heard on a loop, reveling in the melancholy just to feel something.</p><p>In the short time I got to play <em>Expedition 33</em>, it introduced plenty of lore and jargon that I hope will make more sense when seen in the context of the full game, but even if I don’t know what all its proper nouns mean yet, I’m already intrigued by how the game commits to a broken world that feels beyond saving. And yet, the party moves forward anyway. It’s tantalizing, and luckily the turn-based combat is just as compelling.</p><figure id="" data-id="e18f6a0cb0166d95480e9d340e0c092c" data-recommend-id="image://e18f6a0cb0166d95480e9d340e0c092c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A turn-based battle in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A turn-based battle in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sandfall Interactive</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e18f6a0cb0166d95480e9d340e0c092c" data-recommend-id="image://e18f6a0cb0166d95480e9d340e0c092c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A turn-based battle in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Expedition 33 </em>has most of the standard pillars of a turn-based battle system such as elemental weaknesses and party members who specialize in different roles. But there’s a refreshing blend of active combat systems to make fights feel more involved and less repetitive. Each character has original mechanics; as he uses standard attacks, for instance, the swordsman Gustave builds up a reserve of stored power which you can unleash after you’ve charged up enough for your liking, while the mage Lune makes use of “stains” that can be inflicted upon foes and used to increase the power of certain spell combinations. But in between those strategic decisions, you also have quick time events to juice up attacks, ranged attacks that you aim by hand to target weak points, and a dodge and parry mechanic to waste your opponents’ turns. I enjoy these defensive options in premise, but I’m not sold on the execution of them just yet. Some attacks that enemies dish out have a rhythmic quality that makes them easy to read and execute dodges or parries. Others feel more clunky, arbitrary, and difficult to react to. Some of that game sense will likely come with more time, but it was still a frustrating obstacle in some of the more difficult boss fights.</p><p>That small wrinkle aside, <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> oozes drama, tactical depth, and style. I can’t wait to dive into it when the game launches on April 25. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Whisper it, but the release of Pokémon&nbsp;Champions instantly gives a Pokémon&nbsp;Stadium feeling. The Pokémon&nbsp;Company surprised everyone with its announcement, but now it’s out in the wild, it’s time to prepare yourself for battle.</p>



<p>Older Pokémon&nbsp;fans will remember the glory of Pokémon&nbsp;Stadium 1 and 2. The larger-than-life titles focused on the series’ core combat and head-to-head encounters. Exhilarating battles brought to life in huge arenas with flashy visuals and sizzling sound effects. The last 25 years have seen a slew of Pokémon&nbsp;titles, but none similar to Stadium. </p>



<p>Say hello to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-champions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon&nbsp;Champions</a>—a seemingly spiritual successor to the Stadium years. It’s an entirely new AAA release, and its launch might surprise you for a couple of reasons.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-when-pokemon-champions-is-coming-out">Do we Know When Pokémon&nbsp;Champions is Coming Out?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Stadium vibes. Credit to The Pokémon Company.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Pokémon&nbsp;Champions doesn’t have a release date or an estimated window. All we know for sure is it’s “Now in Development,” and updates on its progress will arrive as and when they are ready.</strong></p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-presents-february-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">February 2025 Pokémon&nbsp;Presents</a> showcase is where we first learned of Pokémon&nbsp;Champions. A new Pokémon&nbsp;title was rumored to be shown off during the presentation. But it was expected to be another remake or perhaps a remaster. </p>



<p>Instead, a full trailer for Pokémon&nbsp;Champions was revealed—showing off its glitz, glamor, and gameplay. You can check out the debut announcement trailer right here.</p>

<h2 id="h-all-pokemon-champions-platforms">All Pokémon&nbsp;Champions Platforms</h2>



<p><strong>Pokémon&nbsp;Champions is a multi-platform release for Nintendo Switch and mobile.</strong></p>



<p>It’s not just an exclusive Nintendo release and that’s it. Pokémon&nbsp;Champions is also coming to mobile platforms too. The official <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ik6IGiCzFzQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube trailer</a> announcement’s description confirms as much.</p>



<p>“Look forward to cross-platform battles alongside your favorite Pokémon on Nintendo Switch and mobile, with a variety of different modes available for your desired experience,” it says.</p>



<p>For now, we presume it’s the Nintendo Switch, but a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2</a> release is likely on the cards as well.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-pokemon-champions">What is Pokémon&nbsp;Champions?</h2>



<p>Even though a lot of the content is quite cryptic, there’s a definite Pokémon&nbsp;Stadium feeling with big-time battles in large arenas again. It also looks like Pokémon&nbsp;can turn into Tera Types too. </p>



<p>It’s also confirmed Champions “Will feature familiar mechanics such as Pokémon types, Abilities, and moves, creating an environment conducive to rich and varied strategies for new and experienced Trainers alike.”</p>



<p>We’re sure we’ll learn much more about Pokémon Champions as time passes.</p>

                <p>Rockstar Games made a big announcement today--but it seemingly has nothing to do with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a>. The company announced that it has acquired the Sydney, Australia-based game developer Video Games Deluxe, a studio with ties to LA Noire. Going forward, the studio will be re-named Rockstar Australia.</p><p>Video Games Deluxe had a long history of working with Rockstar prior to this acquisition, as the studio teamed up to help co-develop LA Noire and GTA The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition. Video Games Deluxe founder Brendan McNamara previously established the Australian studio Team Bondi, which created LA Noire for Rockstar Games.</p><p>McNarmara said in a statement, "We are thrilled to be a part of Rockstar Games and to continue our efforts to make the best games possible."</p><p>Financial terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.</p><p>As for Team Bondi, the Sydney-based studio named after the iconic beach, released LA Noire in 2011 with Rockstar Games as the publisher, and it was the company's one and only release. The game was a success by some measurements, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rockstar-at-odds-with-team-bondi-report/1100-6322180/" data-ref-id="1100-6322180">Rockstar and Team Bondi reportedly butted heads</a>. Team Bondi also faced allegations of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/igda-investigating-team-bondi-workers-rights-complaints/1100-6321475/" data-ref-id="1100-6321475">"absolutely unacceptable"</a> working conditions.</p><p>Happy Feet and Mad Max director George Mitchell's company, Kennedy Miller Mitchell, bought the rights to Team Bondi's next game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/whore-of-the-orient/">Whore of the Orient</a>. Warner Bros. was signed on as the publisher of the project, before backing out, leading to the game's cancellation.</p><p>Rockstar's global network of development studios are understood to collaborate on big games, so it's possible Rockstar Australia is also working on GTA 6. Nothing is confirmed, however, and Rockstar is known to be one of the more secretive gaming companies. Officially speaking, there is no word on what Rockstar Australia is working on.</p><p>Rockstar's new development studio in Australia joins the company's <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/careers" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">big network of international studios</a>. These include:</p><ul><li>Rockstar Dundee</li><li>Rockstar India</li><li>Rockstar International</li><li>Rockstar LA</li><li>Rockstar Leeds</li><li>Rockstar Lincoln</li><li>Rockstar London</li><li>Rockstar New England</li><li>Rockstar New York</li><li>Rockstar North</li><li>Rockstar San Diego</li><li>Rockstar Toronto</li></ul><p>GTA 6 is set for release this year on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. It's projected to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-could-make-3-billion-in-first-year-alone/1100-6528605/" data-ref-id="1100-6528605">sell 40 million copies and bring in more than $3 billion in revenue during its first year.</a> The game's first trailer was released in December 2023, and since then, Rockstar Games has not uttered a word about the game.</p>
