                <p>The Mega Man franchise has largely been dormant since 2018 when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mega-man-11-review-an-uneven-retro-romp/1900-6417003/" data-ref-id="1900-6417003">Mega Man 11</a> was released. Aside from the title character's guest appearances in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/monster-hunter-world-iceborne-review-a-very-ice-ti/1900-6417288/" data-ref-id="1900-6417288">Monster Hunter: World</a><span> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/super-smash-bros-ultimate-review-me-and-you-and-ev/1900-6417051/" data-ref-id="1900-6417051">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a>, there haven't been many Mega Man sightings since. However, Capcom recently addressed Mega Man's potential future and stated that the franchise remains "important" to the company. </span></p><p><span>During <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/assets/pdf/stock/2025capcom_c.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a recent shareholder Q&amp;A</a> (via <a href="https://noisypixel.net/capcom-mega-man-46th-shareholders-meeting/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Noisy Pixel</a>), Capcom was asked about plans for Mega Man, and a company spokesperson replied, "</span><span>The Mega Man series is one of our most important IPs, and we are continuously </span>considering ways to develop it further. However, we do not have any additional information we can share at this time." Capcom's representative went on to note that there is "a particularly high volume of inquiries" about Mega Man from overseas markets without elaborating any further. </p><p>The company's latest remarks are very similar <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mega-man-hasnt-been-forgotten-capcom-insists/1100-6525220/" data-ref-id="1100-6525220">to a Mega Man update from 2024</a>, where Capcom noted that it is "considering how to create games for it on an ongoing basis." While the classic games in the series are readily available online, there's been no word about any further sequels.</p><p>In 2018, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-mega-man-live-action-movie-is-finally-official/1100-6462263/" data-ref-id="1100-6462263">a live-action Mega Man movie was in development</a> at 20th Century Fox.

So far, there haven't been any concrete developments with that project.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/game-pass-profitability-apparently-doesn%E2%80%99t-take-into-account-first-party-costs.1237518/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The question of Game Pass profitability has been debated within the games industry ever since the debut of Microsoft's subscription service in June 2017. The way many saw it, Microsoft could use its near-endless pockets to subsidize the service for a while, but not forever. At some point, Game Pass had to become profitable on its own.</p>



<p>Over time, Microsoft has always maintained that Game Pass was indeed profitable and sustainable. In December 2019, Phil Spencer, head of the gaming division, <a href="https://wccftech.com/phil-spencer-on-xbox-game-pass-sustainability-its-doing-very-well-for-us-and-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>:</p>



<p><em>The only concern I ever see is people saying, "Is it sustainable? Can you continue this?" I'll say, Xbox Game Pass right now is doing very well for us and the people who are in it, and it's something … I think it's going to be really interesting, as Xbox launches next year, and it will be an interesting thing as people think about, "Wait a minute, I already have this library of games on this platform." We've never had a console that's launched with a library of games that people are going to have available day one.</em></p>



<p>However, between the slow growth of the subscriber base and the recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">studio closures and layoffs</a>, Game Pass is once again under fire by <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-bet-wrong-horse-subscriptions-says-analyst/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">analysts</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-pass-unsustainable-harmful-industry-arkane-founder/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">developers</a> alike who believe that Microsoft may have bet on the wrong horse and that ultimately, it won't be sustainable in the long run.</p>



<p>Now, Chris Dring, former GamesIndustry.biz Editor in Chief and now co-founder of The Game Business, has shared some important details on how Microsoft is allegedly calculating the profitability of the subscription service. Writing on X, he <a href="https://x.com/Chris_Dring/status/1941918116218638368" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>:</p>



<p><em>So costs associated with the Game Pass business is fees paid to third-parties, marketing, service costs… and by that measure, it’s profitable. What they don’t count is the lost revenue that Xbox’s first-party studios are seeing as a result of the service. I have to imagine if first-party studios received similar compensation, that profitability might not be correct. </em></p>



<p>Dring later clarified that he explicitly asked for clarification and was told that first-party costs were not included. Needless to say, that changes a lot, especially now that Xbox first-party studios include not only the likes of The Coalition, Halo Studios (formerly 343 Industries), et cetera, but also Bethesda and Activision Blizzard, two large publishers that own some of gaming's most prized intellectual properties. There's inevitably going to be some lost revenue by putting the likes of Call of Duty, Diablo, and DOOM on a subscription service like Game Pass from day one. How long Microsoft can afford to keep doing that remains to be seen.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/andrew-webster">Andrew Webster</a> <span>is an entertainment editor covering streaming, virtual worlds, and every single Pokémon video game. Andrew joined The Verge in 2012, writing over 4,000 stories.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>A bigger, more powerful Switch means bigger, more intensive games that take more time and money to make. But as development costs skyrocket across the industry, Nintendo seems to have a plan to keep things in control <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686603/nintendo-switch-2-review">as it transitions into the Switch 2 era</a>.</p><p>In response to a question during <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/qa2506e.pdf">a recent shareholders meeting</a> about the increased costs of making games for its new console, Nintendo president Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa admitted that “recent game software development has become larger in scale and longer in duration, resulting in higher development costs. The game business has always been a high-risk business, and we recognize that rising development costs are increasing that risk.”</p><p>However, he said that Nintendo’s development teams are “currently devising various ways to maintain our traditional approach to creating games amidst the increasing scale and length of development. We believe it is important to make the necessary investments for more efficient development.”</p><div><p>“The game business has always been a high-risk business.”</p></div><div><p>The early lineup of first-party Switch 2 games has already shown Nintendo being more ambitious with its franchises on the enhanced hardware. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/interview/678097/mario-kart-world-nintendo-switch-2-interview-kosuke-yabuki"><em>Mario Kart World</em> introduced an open-world structure to the long-running racing series</a>, while the upcoming <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/694183/donkey-kong-bananza-preview-switch-2"><em>Donkey Kong Bananza </em>adds an impressive destructive element to a more traditional 3D platforming experience</a>. This has come with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/642868/nintendo-switch-2-price-console-games-accessories">increased costs for consumers</a>; <em>World</em> sells for $79.99, $10 more than most Nintendo games, while the Switch 2 itself is $449.99, a $100 jump over the Switch OLED. (In response to a question about these prices making it harder to reach younger audiences, Furukawa said that “we are closely monitoring to what degree the price of the system might become a barrier.”)</p></div><p>Of course, Nintendo is not alone, and the increased scale of game development has been disastrous for many of its competitors. Just last week <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/697125/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-2025">Microsoft’s gaming division was hit hard by layoffs and game cancellations</a>, while high-profile games like <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/675923/black-panther-cancelled-cliffhanger-studios-shut-down-ea">Black Panther</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24282900/sony-shutting-down-concord-firewalk-studios">Concord</a></em> were both shut down alongside their development studios. Nintendo has been one of the rare exceptions in the floundering game industry, but keeping that up will become increasingly challenging as games get bigger. Then again, Furukawa offered one concrete way of combatting this: more smaller games.</p><p>”We also believe it is possible to develop game software with shorter development periods that still offer consumers a sense of novelty,“ Furukawa said. ”We see this as one potential solution to the concern aboutrising development costs and software prices, and we will explore it from various angles within thecompany.“</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/699429/nintendo-switch-2-game-development-costs]]></content:encoded>

Sure, before that, Duke had starred in some genuinely good games in the ‘90s, like <em>Duke Nukem 3D</em>. Since then, the famous (?) character has mostly stayed dormant. (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/VIZ4v5_j6aE&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/VIZ4v5_j6aE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">He did appear in a digital pinball table in 2023</a></span>.) But he’s finally back. Not in a new game, oh no, but instead as a sad crossover character in a free-to-play game featuring tanks. </p><p>Over the weekend, <em>World of Tanks</em> announced that Duke Nukem was going to be part of the game’s latest battle pass. They did so with a reveal trailer that harkens back to<em> Duke Nukem 3D</em>. It also features John St. John voicing Duke once more, a role he’s had since 1996. But this time, John barely sounds interested in what he’s reading. It’s the same lines again. At one point, Duke Nukem shouts “Shake it, baby!” at a tank. Mr. Nukem, are you okay? </p><p>Anyway, the new Battle Pass Special: Heroes’ Paths event starts on July 10 in <em>World of Tanks</em> and runs until July 21. Actual video game icon Lara Croft <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/4vpDPWJ9iRo&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/4vpDPWJ9iRo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is also part of the new pass</a></span>. Maybe one day her new game from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tomb-raider-lara-croft-crystal-dynamics-amazon-games-1849898949&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tomb-raider-lara-croft-crystal-dynamics-amazon-games-1849898949">Amazon will actually launch</a></span>? </p><p>Neither character makes a physical appearance in the game, as <em>World of Tanks</em> is about giant tanks fighting each other. So don’t expect Duke Nukem running around killing pig cops. Instead, the devs have picked two real-world tanks and modified them to better reflect Duke and Lara. Here’s how the developers describe Duke’s tank:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>[Duke’s tank is] the <strong>TS-6</strong>,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>a Tier IX U.S. assault heavy tank. A powerhouse of destruction, this tank mirrors Duke’s “all guns blazing” approach. It boasts a custom nuclear reactor, enhanced weapon systems, and aesthetic nods to Duke’s arsenal, including laser machine guns and grenade launchers. The tank’s design draws inspiration from classic Duke Nukem weapons such as the incinerator and fire extinguisher.</p></blockquote><p>No pricing information was included in the press release I received. The Heroes’ Paths battle pass is split into two chapters. One will provide 30 stages for Lara Croft, and the other will feature 40 stages for Duke Nukem. You’ll be able to unlock various cosmetics inspired by each character and their franchises. Hopefully, one of those is a good <em>Duke Nukem</em> game.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/duke-nukem-world-of-tanks-battle-pass-lara-croft-sad-1851785719]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">Just days after its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-adds-this-underrated-call-of-duty-game-today/1100-6532845/">Game Pass release</a>, Activision has taken the PC version of Call of Duty: WWII offline. The publisher didn't provide specific details on the issue, but the game's removal comes shortly after severe hacking claims.</p><p dir="ltr">Call of Duty players are pretty familiar with hacking situations in multiplayer and Warzone, but the ones seemingly plaguing the 2017 World War II shooter weren't the average variety of aimbots or wall hackers. The hacks reportedly being used in Call of Duty: WWII were RCE (Remote Code Execution) attacks, meaning players were losing control of their PCs through a security exploit. A similar attack happened to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dark-souls-servers-shutdown-after-exploit-allows-attackers-to-access-players-pc/1100-6499889/">Dark Souls 3 back in 2022</a>, which led to the entire trilogy being taken offline while the security issue was addressed.</p><p dir="ltr">Some Call of Duty players posted clips on social media to spread awareness on the hacking issue before the game was pulled, showing their PCs being hacked while playing WWII. One of the viral clips from the weekend comes from "<a href="https://x.com/wrioh75753/status/1940597447467979053" rel="nofollow ">Wrioh</a>," who shows an apparent RCE attack during a multiplayer match.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1941286795565728085" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">📢 Call of Duty: WWII<br>Call of Duty: WWII on PC Microsoft Store was brought offline while we investigate reports of an issue</p>  — Call of Duty Updates (@CODUpdates) <a href="https://twitter.com/CODUpdates/status/1941286795565728085?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 5, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">Activision didn't acknowledge these security risks with the game, and it instead made a <a href="https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1941286795565728085" rel="nofollow ">Twitter post</a> on July 4 to simply announce Call of Duty: WWII was brought offline on PC while it investigates reports of "an issue." There's also no mention of when the game will return to PC.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, there are still plenty of Call of Duty games available to play. Black Ops 6 and Warzone both feature the new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-4-reloaded-adds-beavis-and-butt-head-and-cel-shaded-maps/2900-6709/">Season 4 Reloaded</a> content, which includes new game modes, cel-shaded map variants, and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/call-of-duty-beavis-and-butt-head-event-all-weapons-skins-and-all-rewards/2900-6729/">Beavis and Butt-Head limited-time event</a>.

The game's full reveal is coming later this summer.</p>

            <p>Fans eager to hear more about the next <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider game</a> are still being kept rather in the dark, with Lara Croft popping up in a number of other game collaborations instead of her own standalone adventure.</p>
<p>Since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider">Shadow of the Tomb Raider</a> wrapped back in 2018, Lara has appeared in the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-animated-tomb-raider-series-is-returning-for-season-2-and-laras-teaming-up-with-an-old-pal">Netflix's animated series</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.brawlhalla.com/news/lara-croft-joins-brawlhalla-patch-3-57">Brawlhalla</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-dutys-lara-croft-mixes-classic-and-reboot-tomb-raider-designs">Call of Duty</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raiders-lara-croft-coming-to-dead-by-daylight">Dead by Daylight</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lara-croft-coming-to-in-magic-the-gathering-as-a-mechanically-unique-card">Magic the Gathering</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lara-croft-tumbles-into-fall-guys-with-tomb-raider-crossover">Fall Guys</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DLFpqOJIdTN/?igsh=a3U0NHFzNDR1dW4x">Pinball FX</a>, and now even <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/world-of-tanks">World of Tanks</a> as a part of a themed Battle Pass chapter. She's <a href="https://worldoftanks.eu/en/news/general-news/battle-pass-special-july-2025/">again being voiced by Keeley Hawes here</a>, in my opinion the best Lara.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lBQNNFi1AQ">new trailer for World of Tanks</a>, which you can see below, does give Tomb Raider fans like myself another look at Lara's unified design. As a reminder, the Tomb Raider team has said it will be uniting the original Tomb Raider games with the recent 'Survivor' trilogy reboots - which began in 2013 - in its next mainline game.</p>

<p>Lara's look in World of Tanks reflects this unification. Her style in the latest Tomb Raider collaboration takes most of its inspiration from the 'Classic Lara' look of old, with her tank top and braid taking pride of place, but she also has her jade necklace from the last three mainline games.</p>
<p>As well as Lara, Jonah from the Tomb Raider reboot trilogy is featured, as is - somewhat to my surprise - Amanda Evert. Amanda first cropped up in Tomb Raider Legend as a former friend turned antagonist of Lara's. Her look in World of Tanks is perhaps most different from her original design, with the goth aesthetic toned down quite significantly. Personally, I have questions about why she is there at all, given her timeline is the Legend Timeline, which is the second game timeline in the Tomb Raider series.</p>
<p>But this question aside, as a fan of Tomb Raider <em>games</em> rather than Tomb Raider collaborations, I really do wish we were being fed more than just Lara Croft in other franchises. I understand the need to keep the character relevant, but at this rate Lara is at risk of being featured more in games that aren't Tomb Raider than games that are. Truth be told, I am becoming increasingly frustrated by the comparative silence around <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/crystal-dynamics-announces-next-tomb-raider-game-made-in-unreal-engine-5">the next mainline Tomb Raider game</a>.</p>

<p>In 2022, Amazon said it would provide its "full support" to Crystal Dynamics, as it works on "the biggest, most expansive" series entry to date. Then, in August last year, Amazon Games boss Christoph Hartmann said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-tomb-raider-huge-huge-task-but-things-are-going-well">development on the upcoming Tomb Raider game from Crystal Dynamics and Amazon was "going well"</a>. Since then, however, developer Crystal Dynamics <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-developer-crystal-dynamics-announces-layoffs">has been subject to layoffs</a>, and nothing more has been officially said of the next Tomb Raider entry for some time.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Embracer alluded to a AAA release on its docket, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-plans-to-release-76-different-games-in-the-next-year-despite-previous-layoffs-and-studio-closures">the company previously expected to debut in FY 25/26 but will "likely need a few more quarters to polish"</a>. Therefore, this particular game will likely release the following fiscal year. While Embracer did not specify which game under its umbrella it was talking about, I suspect it was Tomb Raider.</p>
<p>I really hope the Tomb Raider series can continue on successfully without the need to pimp Lara out to other franchises every couple of months. But right now, I am not too sure.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/lara-croft-is-popping-up-everywhere-except-in-a-new-tomb-raider-game]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Wild Sheep Studio has announced a new exploration title called Adorable Adventures, and it is a game where players play as Boris the baby boar who is looking for his family. The events take place in the aftermath of a forest fire, and Boris has to use his nose to sniff out his family across a forest, highlands, and caves where all sorts of activities await.</p>
<p><iframe title="Adorable Adventures - Announce trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/es_AnXYMiA0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The story of Adorable Adventures is told by a forest guard, who narrates the events and the things Boris does. The game is about having a good time and exploring the forest while interacting with its elements. As the game progresses, Boris will be able to interact with various wildlife, complete a herbarium, and take part in some light hearted activities. Adorable Adventures is coming to PC and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3840230/Adorable_Adventures/">can be wishlisted on Steam now.&nbsp;</a></p>

We can't; it only feels like yesterday we started taking our phones with us for 'mon-catching trips.</p>
<p>The official <a href="https://x.com/PokemonGoApp/status/1941995623567290393">GO X account</a> shared some brand new artwork to celebrate the 9th anniversary, and it seems to include a couple of hints on what we can expect to see in the coming months.</p>
<p>The artwork, from Pokémon GO's character designer Yusuke Kozaki, has a couple of small hints, but the big one is Paradox Pokémon, a new type of Pocket Monster introduced in Scarlet &amp; Violet on Switch.</p><div><figure data-videoid="2sj2iQyBTQs" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2sj2iQyBTQs?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2sj2iQyBTQs?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2sj2iQyBTQs?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed390852xkuvtw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sj2iQyBTQs" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>These are usually past or future-versions of Pokémon, and in the artwork you can see Ancient Tusks and Iron Treads, the Ancient and Future version of Donphan.</p>

<p>A more vague teaser in the artwork comes from the character with the thumbs-up icon in front of the Metagross; some think this could be hinting at remote trading, while others think its related to emotes. It could mean nothing, of course, but it's more likely a little teaser.</p>
<p>Zygarde's 50% form could be hinting at a new event based on the 'mon — a logical conclusion given that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> seems to be focusing on Order Pokémon, and that's out this October. Mega Butterfree also features, and that Mega Evolution is yet to appear in Pokémon GO. Our guess is we'll hear more about this during the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/the-next-pokemon-presents-is-coming-in-july">Pokémon Presents later this month</a>.</p>
<p>The game has been making headlines throughout the year following <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/03/niantic-sells-pokemon-go-and-entire-gaming-division-for-usd3-5-billion">Niantic Spatial's decision to sell off its entire gaming division</a> to publisher Scopely — which is part of Savvy Games Group and Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund — for $3.5 billion earlier this year.</p>
<p>Since then, the team behind the hugely popular AR game have stressed that the sale won't impact the game and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/03/pokemon-go-promises-it-wont-introduce-intrusive-ads-or-playtime-restrictions">"intrusive ads" won't be part of the experience</a>. The devs have also <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/pokemon-go-doubling-amount-of-daily-remote-raids-has-nothing-to-do-with-new-owners">doubled the amount of daily remote raids</a> players can take part in, but that was reportedly in the works before the sale too.</p>
<p><em>Let us know if you're looking forward to Paradox Pokémon in GO in the comments.</em></p>

			<p>Capcom has cancelled a <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-devs-talk-optimization/">lecture</a> it was meant to give at the Computer Entertainment Developers Conference 2025 event (CEDEC) in Japan on Monster Hunter Wilds PC performance and optimization amid harassment and threats made to developers from players upset with the game's performance on PC.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/capcom-cancels-lecture-about-monster-hunter-wilds-optimization-as-devs-face-threats-and-harassment/">Automaton</a>, the decision to cancel the event is likely a choice made by Capcom to protect the members of its development team who would have been in attendance, though no official reason for the cancellation has been stated. </p>



<p>The lecture was titled "<em>Making 'Monster Hunter Wilds' Run Smoothly! Everything You Need To Know About Optimization</em>," and according to its <a href="https://cedec.cesa.or.jp/2025/timetable/detail/s67ad32469773b/">description</a>, would have delved into Capcom's journey of trying to ensure that Monster Hunter Wilds would run smoothly on the wide variety of machines used by players across the globe.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>' performance on PC has been an issue since the game launched earlier this year. Capcom has made it clear that it is aware of the issues players are facing, and this talk was intended to be part of the company's ongoing work to fix the problems the game has and communicate with players who are having trouble running the game on their devices. </p>



<p>The recent<a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-2-nvidia-dlss-4-amd-fsr-4/"> Title Update 2</a> was also meant to include several fixes for PC players, though not everything was addressed, and there are still a number of bugs and optimization issues that have yet to be squashed. Capcom <a href="https://x.com/MH_Wilds/status/1941110323005857917">released a patch</a> following the Title Update 2, though several issues still persist. According to Automaton, individual members of the Monster Hunter Wilds team have been threatened by players upset over the game's PC performance, along with harassment towards the whole Monster Hunter Wilds team. </p>



<p>Capcom has also published <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/support/faq/information_info2025_0266919.html">a statement on its website</a> regarding harassment and threats to its employees, making it clear that while it takes feedback from players seriously, it will "<em>respond appropriately</em>" to threats and acts of harassment, and in severe cases, it will contact the appropriate authorities and pursue criminal proceedings.</p>

            <p>If you had been planning to play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-ww2">Call Of Duty: WW2</a> - an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> widely agreed by critics to be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-ww2-review">among the games released in 2017</a> - maybe do not do that, for the moment, because certain versions of Call Of Duty: WW2 may randomly show you pornography, send you insulting notepad messages and, at worst, fill your computer with ransomware.</p><!--more-->
<p>As written up by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/call-of-duty/call-of-duty-ww2-pulled-from-pc-following-reports-of-remote-code-exploit-trolling-players-with-notepad-pop-ups-pc-shutdowns-and-desktop-wallpaper-of-a-lawyer/">PCGamer</a>, Activision have taken the Xbox PC version of the World War shooter offline amid social media reports of a remote code execution exploit, or RCE - this being a vulnerability that lets a hacker meddle with a game's code from afar using the developer's own programming language.</p>
<p>WW2 players have been posting <a href="https://x.com/vxunderground/status/1940639088576811516">screens</a> and <a href="https://x.com/wrioh75753/status/1940597447467979053">footage</a> of peculiar sights and sounds during recent gunshooting expeditions. One message references lawyers <a href="https://www.msk.com/newsroom-news-2847">who were involved in an Activision lawsuit</a> against German companies selling cheat codes for Call Of Duty games. Activision have yet to confirm or deny that these disruptions are due to an RCE, <a href="https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1941286795565728085">stating only</a> that they've yanked the game's online while they address an "issue".</p>
<p>Call Of Duty: WW2 recently released on Microsoft's PC Game Pass service, so the apparent hack is precisely timed. The game is still available via Steam and Battle.net - it's unclear whether those versions are also affected, but I would probably hold off loading them up to find out.</p>
<p>Among those commenting on the situation is VX-Underground, a white hat hacker group akin to the Ghostbusters, who claim to have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vx-underground">the largest online repository of malware</a>. The group's admin Smelly has posted <a href="https://x.com/vxunderground/status/1940889734269501446">a longer speculative post</a> explaining why the Call Of Duty: WW2 hullabaloo is probably an RCE situation.</p>
<p>Smelly shares concerns that the attackers are "capable of deploying information stealer malware, a RAT (remote administration tool), or ransomware". But they conclude based on the shared videos and screens that "thankfully, it appears this attacker is primarily interested in memeing and fucking with people." What japes. </p>
<p>I'll let you know as and when Activision comments properly on any of this. In the meantime, maybe resist the call of the Western Front. Play <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3659990/hatenet/">hate.net</a> instead. The bots there aren't exactly friendly, but they will not try to encrypt your computer and charge you a bucket of Bitcoin for the unlock key.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-ww2-pulled-offline-amid-hacking-claims-after-it-starts-messing-with-pcs-and-citing-random-lawyers]]></content:encoded>

Whether it’s losing HP every turn with Poison or going apeshit from Berserk, you’ll always need to be aware of what types of status effects can disrupt battles in this exciting role-playing romp. We’ll dive into all these status effects in this guide, so bounce on down below to check it out.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196452" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Clear Your Calendar For Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="149" data-playlist="196452,196001,195273" data-current="196452"><div><p>Clear Your Calendar For Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196452/196452_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196452/196452_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196452/196452_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196452/196452_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22004.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h608921"><a id="1"></a>All status effects in <em>Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD</em></h2><h2 id="h608922"><a id=""></a></h2><p>Here are the status effects you’ll encounter while playing <em>Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD</em>. </p><p><strong>Berserk</strong>: This status effect raises a character’s Physical Attack by a whopping 50 percent, but you lose control of them for a while, which means they’ll attack at random. <em>You can cure it with Esuna/Esunaga.</em></p><p><strong>Blind</strong>: This status effect reduces the accuracy of a character’s physical attacks. You can’t hit what you can’t target, you know. <em>Silver Glasses make you immune to this status. You can cure it with Esuna/Esunaga.</em></p><p><strong>Charm</strong>: This status effect removes your ability to control a character temporarily. During this time, they may heal enemies or attack your other characters. <em>Rebuff Locket makes you immune to this status. You can cure it with Esuna/Esunaga.</em></p><p><strong>Confusion</strong>: This status effect removes your ability to control a character temporarily. While under the effect, the character may randomly attack enemies and allies. <em>Peace Ring makes you immune to this status. You can cure it with Esuna/Esunaga.</em></p><p><strong>Death</strong>: This status effect kills a character outright. Ouch. <em>The Safety Ring makes you immune to this status.</em></p><p><strong>Doom</strong>: This status effect places a counter above a character’s head. When it reaches 0, that character will die. Sucks to be them!</p><p><strong>Dread</strong>: This status effect makes it impossible to use Brave or Default. How dreadful. <em>You can cure it with Esuna/Esunaga.</em></p><p><strong>Love</strong>: This status effect causes a character to fall in love with another ally. Because of this, they will receive all of the same damage and status effects of the ally they’re in love with, as well as copy the ally’s moves. </p><p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: This status effect causes a character to be unable to use any actions for a few turns. <em>The Earthing Rod makes you immune to this status. You can cure it with Esuna/Esunaga.</em></p><p><strong>Poison</strong>: This status effect causes a character to take damage on each turn. Come on, you knew this one already. <em>The Star Pendant makes you immune to this status. You can cure it with Esuna/Esunaga and Poisona. </em></p><p><strong>Silence</strong>: This status effect makes it so that a character is unable to use magic. <em>The White Cape makes you immune to this status. You can cure it with Esuna/Esunaga.</em></p><p><strong>Sleep</strong>: This status effect puts a character to sleep, rendering them incapable of using any actions for a few turns. How cozy! <em>Clothespin makes you immune to this status. You can cure it with Esuna/Esunaga.</em></p><p><strong>Status Down</strong>: This status effect reduces one of your character’s stats temporarily. <em>You can recover from this with Despell.</em></p><p><strong>Stop</strong>: This status effect renders a character unable to move, opening them up to attacks. <em>Despell will knock this out.</em></p><hr><h2 id="h608923"><a id="2"></a>How long does it take for status effects to go away?</h2><p>Good news: Some of these status effects have a chance to go away on their own on the next turn. The chance of these debuffs vanishing increases, though not at the same rate for each status. Here are the following chances of recovering from certain statuses on your own (by “turn”, we mean <em>your character’s </em>turn, not just any turn:</p><p><strong>Charm</strong>: Charm follows the same pattern as Confuse for auto-recovery. </p><p><strong>Confuse</strong>: You have a 20-percent chance to recover from Confuse on your next turn. This increases by 10-percent for the next two turns, followed by a 60-percent chance. After six turns, Confuse will go away on its own. </p><p><strong>Dread: </strong>Starts at a 25-percent chance on the next turn, followed by a 25-percent chance of an automatic recovery with each passing turn.</p><p><strong>Paralysis: </strong>20-percent chance for recovery, followed by a 5-percent increase on the following turn and a 25-percent chance for each subsequent turn thereafter. </p><p><strong>Sleep:</strong> 25-percent chance for recovery on next turn. Adds an additional 25 percent chance with each proceeding turn. </p><p><strong>Stop:</strong> Starting with a 20-percent chance of recovery, the next turn sees your recovery chance increase by five-percent, then a 25-percent increase with each passing turn of yours.</p><hr><p>Now that you know what status effects to expect in <em>Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD</em>, you’ll be far more prepared for battle. The game is available now exclusively on Nintendo Switch 2, so go save the world!  </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/bravely-default-flying-fairy-hd-status-paralysis-sleep-1851785720]]></content:encoded>

There's every chance Amazon will get more stock allocation before release, but if you don't want to miss out on launch, I'd highly reccomend securing preorders with a reputable seller on TCG Player. If this set is anything like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-cards-most-expensive-surge-foils">MTG: Final Fantasy</a>, launch day stock is going to be none existent.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Where To Preorder MTG: Edge Of Eternities</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-edge-of-eternities-preorder-guide">MTG: Edge of Eternities preorders</a> are the exception to the rule in this weeks MTG deals round-up.

                <p>An exciting prospect for the Nintendo Switch 2 outside of just "Switch, but bigger and more" is that the tech under the hood should allow for some more hardware-intensive games on the platform. However, bigger and flashier games could lead to increased development costs, a concern raised in a recent <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/qa2506e.pdf" rel="nofollow ">investors call</a>. To assuage this concern, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa spoke of the ways the company is planning to keep development costs down, noting how it's considering shorter dev periods as a way to do so.</p><p dir="ltr">"Recent game software development has become larger in scale and longer in duration, resulting in higher development costs," Furukawa explained. "The game business has always been a high-risk business, and we recognize that rising development costs are increasing that risk. Our development teams are devising various ways to maintain our traditional approach to creating games amidst the increasing scale and length of development.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Romero Games has been caught in the fallout of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/02/microsoft-confirms-mass-layoffs-across-xbox-gaming-and-all-its-divisions/">Microsoft’s wide-ranging cuts and layoffs that were made last week</a>. The decision by Microsoft to pull funding for Romero’s unannounced FPS has effectively led to the closure of the studio, laying off its 42 internal employees in Galway, Ireland, and affecting a total network of around 100 developers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/theromerogames/p/DLpFZkdsC1X/">In a statement last Wednesday</a>, Brenda Romero confirmed that funding had been pulled for their project, and while not naming Xbox or Microsoft specifically, the connection was quickly made. “This was a strategic decision made at a high level within the publisher, well above our visibility or control. We deeply wish there had been something, anything, we could have done to prevent this outcome.” Romero writes.</p>


<p>“This absolutely isn’t a reflection of our team’s work, performance, or the quality of the project itself. We hit every milestone on time, every time, consistently received high praise, and easily passed all our internal gates. We are incredibly proud of the work being done, and of the talented team behind it. The best we’ve worked with.”</p>
<p>Since then, there have been reports that Romero Games had had conversations with Microsoft just a day before funding was cut. Speaking to <a href="https://www.thejournal.ie/100-staff-laid-off-galway-romero-games-6753674-Jul2025/">The Journal</a>, an anonymous employee said that “Everyone is out of a job,” continuing that “We had meetings with the publisher the day before this happened, there was no mention of it.”</p>
<p>There is a chance that this situation can still be salvaged, though with Romero Games working under contract, they were dependent on Microsoft’s financial support for the day-to-day running of the studio. In Brenda Romero’s statement, she said that they are “evaluating next steps and working quickly to support our team”, while the anonymous employee said to The Journal that “We’re trying to find other ways of funding the project, but for now, it’s completely closed, and the studio is closed.”</p>

<p>Hopefully another publisher is able and willing to step in, and this could be an attractive proposition with indications that the game was already rather far along.</p>
<p>Romero Games was founded back in 2015 by John and Brenda Romero, making a splash with a pair of unofficial Doom continuations – Sigil and Sigil II, which were both adopted for the Doom remasters by Nightdive a few years later – which were released on either side of their prohibition era mobster strategy game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/12/15/empire-of-sin-review/">Empire of Sin</a>.</p>

<p>"I... so unhappy..."</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Happy 25th anniversary to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/final_fantasy_ix">Final Fantasy IX</a>, the final mainline Final Fantasy game to launch on the original PlayStation and one of the most beloved entries in the entire franchise.</p>
<p>Today, Square Enix <a href="https://na.finalfantasy.com/topics/599">posted an update</a> on the Final Fantasy IX anniversary website — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/03/final-fantasy-9-remake-hopes-rise-as-square-enix-teases-anniversary-projects">which opened earlier this year</a> — to celebrate. And, the question on everybody's lips is obvious; where is the rumoured Final Fantasy IX remake, Square??</p>
<p>Well, it's not here! Square Enix has been running a number of projects for the RPG over the past few months, from brand new artwork to new merchandise reveals. The 7th July 2025 <em>could</em> have been something big, and many thought the celebrations would lead up to the long-rumoured remake, which was one of the many games that was revealed as part of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/09/huge_nvidia_database_leak_lists_unannounced_third-party_games">Nvidia GeForce leak in 2021</a>.</p>
<p>Instead, we got an <a href="https://youtu.be/oFDDlEaUXxw?si=ScDX2lCL-u6AaGgI">anniversary video</a> and <a href="https://support.na.square-enix.com/ceform.php?id=441&amp;la=1&amp;h=cbf426fd&amp;_gl=1*1o6y2zy*_gcl_au*NTg4MjIyODgxLjE3NTE4OTM0MTQ.">a fan art project</a>, which is running until 31st October 2025.</p>

<p>Sooo... not the big blow-out fans were hoping for, but there's still time, right? Well, there might be cause for concern.</p>
<p>Podcaster and notable industry "leaker" NateTheHate has shared a potential (with a big pinch of salt) update on the progress of the remake on the forum <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/square-enix-launches-final-fantasy-ix-25th-anniversary-news-page-on-the-final-fantasy-portal-site.1149465/page-31#post-142366968">Resetera</a> (via <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ltbe6h/natethehatenate_drake_on_resetera_final_fantasy/">GamingLeaksAndRumours</a>).</p>
<p>"As of last check it remains in development, to my knowledge," Nate starts his message, but admits he needs to do a "fresh check" as "I did hear a month or so ago that it was in trouble &amp; possibly cancelled." This only came from one source, though, so don't take it to mean much until it's fully verified.</p>
<p>While the Nvidia leak has proven to be pretty accurate up until this point, it's worth reminding everyone that the Final Fantasy IX remake hasn't been officially announced. The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles">Final Fantasy Tactics remaster</a> was only just revealed, and that was on there, so we're still praying Final Fantasy IX will get the love it deserves.</p>
<p>You know when Domino's Pizza is asking for the remake that people are desperate for it.</p>

<p>In the meantime, go and enjoy some of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/final-fantasy-9-gets-some-gorgeous-new-artwork-and-it-has-fans-in-a-frenzy">that stunning anniversary artwork</a> Square Enix was posting on social media last week.</p>
<p><em>Are you worried about the Final Fantasy IX remake? Do you think we'll see it later this year? Let us know in the comments</em>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-patch-notes-deep-desert-changes/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dune-awakening-patch-1-1-15-0-adds-deep-desert-pve-changes-bug-fixes-and-more.1237392/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Funcom's latest update for Dune: Awakening, Patch 1.1.15.0, adds a few more significant changes to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-update-1-1-0-0-adds-deep-desert-and-vehicle-changes-removes-sietch-visiting-restrictions-and-more/">PvE parts of the Deep Desert the developer recently added</a>, while also pushing several bug fixes and stability improvements.</p>



<p>While most of these changes will be applied right when you download the update, <a href="https://duneawakening.com/news/dune-awakening-1-1-15-0-patch-notes/">Funcom does warn</a> that some of them will only be applied after scheduled downtime, though it doesn't specify which changes need downtime to be applied. So best to wait until after the next instance of maintenance to expect to see all of these changes.</p>



<p>The most significant change is that tier 6 resources can now be found in the PvE areas of the Deep Desert. Prior to this update, players would have still had to brave the PvP parts of the Deep Desert for the highest tier of resources. You'll still have to head into a PvP area to find a higher density of these resources, but being able to find tier 6 resources in PvE Deep Desert areas rounds out the endgame experience for those solo players and anyone who doesn't want to engage in PvP.</p>



<p>Spawn rates for medium spice fields have also gone back up to 8 after being dropped down to 5 with the update that first added PvE zones to the Deep Desert, and the number of small spice fields has increased from 22 to 30.</p>



<p>Regarding some of the fixes introduced, the most significant fixes are the ones applied to contracts that couldn't be completed, and the issue of players losing out on rewards from completed contracts because their inventory was full. Now, players will receive their rewards for completing contracts only when there is enough space in their inventory for them.</p>



<p>In the weeks since Funcom added PvE areas to the Deep Desert, the response from the player base has been mixed. Some believe Funcom should have never implemented these changes, arguing that having the entirety of the Deep Desert be PvP was tonally correct for a survival game based on Dune. Players who don't want to engage in PvP, however, felt differently, and that even after the tens of hours they spent getting to the endgame, their time with the game was 'cut short' because they could no longer participate in endgame activities without dealing with PvP hazards. </p>



<p>Regardless of where you fall in that argument, Funcom will continue to try and find the right balance between its PvE-focused players and PvP-focused players. </p>

            <p>How do you sort of resurrect a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/minecraft">Minecraft</a>y sandbox game that's been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/minecrafty-sandbox-game-hytale-cancelled-after-a-decade-in-development-as-hypixel-studios-prepare-to-close">blown up</a> by a feature creeper before it could be released? Well, in the case of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hytale">Hytale</a>, it looks like one of the answers is going to be a new mode in another Minecrafty sandbox game.</p>
<p>Yep, amid much chatter about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-studio-founder-says-hell-reach-out-to-riot-in-an-effort-to-buy-back-and-revive-the-game">potential Hytale revivals</a> since the news of its cancellation and Hypixel Studios' impeding closure broke last month, the devs of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-you-played-vintage-story">Vintage Story</a> are trying to make sure that at least some of the game's spirit lives on.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Perhaps we can put together a small sub-project within our team of developers to bring out an additional game mode for Vintage Story that can at least in part deliver on the vision of what Hytale set out to become," wrote VS team lead Tyron in <a href="https://www.vintagestory.at/blog.html/news/hytale-fans-you-are-very-welcome-here-r412/">a blog post</a>, not long after learning of Hytale's fate.</p>
<p>His <a href="https://www.vintagestory.at/blog.html/">latest post</a> is an update confirming that that team is pressing go on plans to at least "attempt" to make that adventure mode a reality. "The new mode would be departing significantly in aesthetics, setting and game mechanics compared to Vintage Story," he wrote, "More focused towards fantasy and adventure/rpg-y compared to the gritty, realism-based nature of the current experience. Personally, I would love to see some Elves and Dwarves in there.</p>
<p>"For the time being it would ship alongside Vintage Story at no additional cost, but in the purely hypothetical scenario where it really takes off we could spin it off into a fully separate game," Tyrion went on. "We'll be very open about it, release early and the sub-team will be given significant agency over development direction and communication style with players. There will also be some areas where the goals of both teams will intersect and both projects will benefit, such as combat, improved enemy AI or better NPCs in general. For existing players - rest assured, the aesthetics and game mechanics of Vintage Story will remain true to its original vision."</p>
<p>Tyron outlined that they're currently going through job applications to be part of that sub-team. "We'll be starting small (3 to 4 people) and expand once the project shows merit and gathers interest," he explained. "A small team might be slower, but is also much more manageable, more effective and can pivot quicker. Slow growth allows us to fund this truly for the long term. And thankfully, we can re-use a lot of the Vintage Story ecosystem."</p>
<p>He's since updated the post responding to some concerns Vintage Story fans have raised, outlining that work on that game will still continue and that he doesn't believe spending the resources this new mode will require on Vintage Story's existing development would be a net positive for that project. </p>
<p>"Vintage Story might have never seen the day of light without Hytale," he added in closing. "Now it is my turn to hand them an olive branch. It is the least that I can do. I know many of you have a significant emotional investment in Vintage Story, I am well aware of it. I will be careful to not lose sight of that."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vintage-storys-devs-are-trying-to-save-some-of-cancelled-hytales-soul-by-turning-it-into-an-adventure-mode]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Last week, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-layoffs-begin-with-200-cuts-in-europe-report/1100-6532905/" data-ref-id="1100-6532905">Microsoft laid off thousands of workers</a> across the company, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xboxs-aaaa-perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shutting-down/1100-6532921/" data-ref-id="1100-6532921">major Xbox studio cuts and even a studio closure</a>. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer has stated that the cuts were necessary and that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-defends-xbox-studio-closures-layoffs-i-have-to-run-a-sustainable-business/1100-6524121/" data-ref-id="1100-6524121">Xbox needs to be a sustainable business</a>. Now, Raphael Colantonio--one of the co-founders of Arcane Studios--has reacted to the wave of layoffs and argued that Microsoft's Game Pass strategy is "unsustainable" and bad for the industry's long-term health.</p><p>"I think [Game Pass] is an unsustainable model that has been increasingly damaging the industry for a decade, subsidized by MS's 'infinite money,'" write Colantonio on <a href="https://x.com/rafcolantonio/status/1941512826687980019" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">X</a>. "But at some point reality has to hit. I don't think GP can coexist with other models. They'll either kill everyone else, or give up."</p><p>Colantonio added that he is also "<a href="https://x.com/rafcolantonio/status/1941516413803581493" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">fed up</a>" with Microsoft's assertions that Game Pass doesn't affect the sales of games. In <a href="https://x.com/rafcolantonio/status/1941929277189976439" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a later post</a>, Colantonio wrote that he can explain at length "why the [math doesn't] work for most publishers/devs, nor for Xbox once they stop investing."</p><p>Raccoon Logic studio head Alex Hutchinson <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dev-who-launched-game-into-game-pass-warns-against-launching-games-into-game-pass/1100-6532306/" data-ref-id="1100-6532306">spoke out about Game Pass devaluing games</a> earlier this year after his game Revenge of the Savage Planet was a day-one title on Xbox Game Pass. Conversely, Rebellion <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-release-atomfall-was-immediately-profitable-report/1100-6531671/" data-ref-id="1100-6531671">touted the launch of Atomfall on Game Pass</a> as a huge success for the company. Earlier this year, Id Software co-founder <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-doesnt-hurt-game-companies-says-doom-co-creator/1100-6529136/" data-ref-id="1100-6529136">John Romero endorsed Game Pass</a> as the Netflix for gamers. Romero's studio <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-and-quake-veterans-new-fps-loses-funding-with-microsoft-seemingly-to-blame/1100-6532939/" data-ref-id="1100-6532939">had funding pulled from its project</a> just last week, with many inferring Microsoft was responsible. It's unclear if the studio will continue to operate in any capacity.</p><p>Regardless, Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford recently stated that it will probably be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dont-expect-borderlands-4-to-hit-game-pass-or-be-dirt-cheap-for-many-years/1100-6532782/" data-ref-id="1100-6532782">years before Borderlands 4 hits Game Pass</a>. Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick has specifically said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-ceo-says-launching-new-games-into-a-subscription-service-like-game-pass-makes-no-sense/1100-6509015/" data-ref-id="1100-6509015">day-one launches on Game Pass do not make sense</a> for the company.</p>

			<p>FBC: Firebreak is an unusual game. Returning to The Oldest House from Control, but this time as a scrappy bunch of volunteer janitors, you have to confront the Hiss-controlled hordes and a slew of existential threats that are as mundane as they are potentially deadly.</p>
<p><iframe title="FBC: Firebreak – Gameplay Overview Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t4YyeHT7spE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>If you come to it expecting a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/08/26/control-review-ps4-xbox-pc/">Control</a>-themed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2009/11/28/review-left-4-dead-2/">Left 4 Dead</a> or <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/03/27/warhammer-vermintide-2-review/">Vermintide</a>, you’ll instead be confronted by something that’s rather different. It’s a little bit Helldivers in some ways, more like horde shooters in others, and with the kind of spooky shenanigans vibe that has permeated the recent wave of co-op horror games like REPO and Lethal Company. Unfortunately, it doesn’t really match up to any of these comparisons.</p>


<p>There’s five missions currently in the game that blend the humdrum with the otherworldly in some very imaginative ways… but it doesn’t quite break through the barrier to make them interesting to play in the long run.</p>
<p>Take the Paper Chase mission, where spooky sticky notes have infested a floor of The Oldest House, covering anything and everything in sight. You have to get rid of them, but the ways you can do so feel so utterly ineffectual as you either shoot them or run through and collect them on yourself – slowing you down in the process – and have to go take a shower to wash them away. That kind of idea is fed through the other stages as well, as you power up turbines, collect radioactive orbs from gloopy wall things, battle through pink…. stuff to reactivate some mechanisms.</p>


<p>The problem is that the structure is so formulaic, with only a small amount of randomisation to mix things up. You start with a small or medium sized area and clear/collect/fix up enough of that stage’s objective to allow access to the next area. This is larger, but now you do the same again with a bigger number to clear. It builds up to the final area which can be a boss fight, rocket launch or similar, and then you have to hustle back to the start point to extract, likely defeating a named Hiss enemy on the way.</p>
<p>There’s really only a handful of different enemies that you’ll encounter, which doesn’t help much with variety. Hordes of Hiss-controlled spanner guys rush you for melee, there’s gun-toting security guards, and floating office chair people for the regular bunch. They’re boosted by bomb squad guys, and then a couple of special enemies, but there’s none of the variety of Left 4 Dead’s special infected, let alone the sheer terror of a Tank appearing. You’ll have some hairy moments, especially when you’re covered in sticky notes or pink gloop, but it always feels like you can handle it by tactically retreating to healing shower stations.</p>
<p>At higher difficulties, you can enable Corrupted Item modifiers, throwing some haunted objects into a level that float around the areas, including a gravity-altering globe map, a snare drum that speeds up enemies, a freezing post box and plenty more. They bring some fun twists and added challenges, but they all have one solution: find the Black Rock Launcher in a safe room or at an ammo station, and then blast the heck out of it.</p>

<p>There’s three player classes –&nbsp;the Fix Kit, Jump Kit and Splash Kit –&nbsp;each of which has a specific and delightfully weird bit of kit, with electric prods, water cannons and fast-fixing spanners. There’s some nice synergies between them, so you can douse enemies with one class and then spark ’em up with another, and their specific additional kit and supers also have different situational uses,</p>
<p>Thankfully Remedy reacted quickly to initial complaints over the game’s introduction. At launch, you were really thrown in the deep end with no explanation over the weird kit classes you could choose, and were forced into a slow level unlock process playing only the first area of a stage, then the first two before the full level was available. It was…. weird. You can now just play a full stage right away, and this is the better approach.</p>
<p>There’s still plenty of muddled design within FBC: Firebreak, though. You unlock perks, abilities and weapon upgrades and cosmetics using research files and level-specific materials that you collect. Levelling up with XP merely unlocks perk slots on the kit you’re using, and and grants access to more perks to throw materials at. The UI for all of this is just a bit too confusing. Going back and forth between the perks research screen and loadout rearranges the icons based on what you’ve unlocked, and it took me forever to understand how to use Resonance.</p>

<p>Resonance is hugely powerful in this game, encouraging you to stick together to boost your team shields at the base level. Perks can also be shared with nearby allies, so you get all of the bullet boosting effects, improved survivability, repairing boosts, and so much more. But first you need to unlock a perk through its three tiers –&nbsp;Weak, Strong and Resonant –&nbsp;and then equip it at the Resonant level, taking up more perk slots to do so. Perhaps its using a controller-oriented UI with a mouse and keyboard on PC, but this took me far, far too long to actually understand. I’m completely unsurprised that Remedy has found a tiny percentage of players actually using perks at this tier.</p>
