The journey to release the curse begins!<br>More information to come!</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>“The game market is tough now,” said Arc System Works chief creative officer Daisuke Ishiwatari during today’s showcase announcing the project. “To overcome that Arc System Works has launched a new project. It’s an action game project… Let me explain. Arc System Works is a fighting game company. I’m sure most of you recognize us as so. However, to achieve a new brand, where we are known for quality mid-range <a title="Genres > Action [2,837 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action games</a>, we decided to establish a new pillar outside of fighting games.</p><p>“You might be wondering why I specifically use the term mid-range. There are many reasons, but one is that even creators themselves can enjoy striving for their dreams. In recent years, with AAA blockbusters and excellent indie titles gaining popularity, it has become extremely risky for companies to create new series. This has led to dwindling opportunities for young creators to have their own projects. We feel the need to focus our efforts towards the future a decade from now, such as to build stable development schemes and to accumulate technology and know-how.</p><p>“Our flagship title <em>Guilty Gear</em> has now become a million selling copy work—but its very first installment was a small-scale project. From there, over many long years, we built a foundation that could guarantee a certain level of quality in the fighting games genre. Similarly we hope to take a step with this project that will eventually lead to bigger dreams. And precisely because they are mid-range titles, this will create many opportunities to produce many titles and cultivate many creators, and we hope that will become one of the future values of Arc System Works.”</p><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p><h2><span>Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="DAMON and BABY | Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sBEFzd4zr-M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/06/arc-system-works-announces-action-game-damon-and-baby]]></content:encoded>

But the real key to winning is the Super Strike: a powerful shot that can net you two points at once! Hone your techniques, deal out big hits and even unleash Chain Chomp onto the field as you aim to score a goal—and crush the opposition. With simple controls, anyone can hit the pitch while playing solo, and in local1 and online multiplayer matches for up to four players.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a trailer below.</p><h2><span><em>Super Mario Strikers</em> Trailer</span></h2><!-- AD: content -->

			<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omnl-EMxfYE">Capcom's Spotlight Showcase 2025</a> event featured several of the games in the studio's portfolio, but it spent more time showing off <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> latest free title update than it did anything else.</p>
<p>The second free title update for Monster Hunter Wilds will be available on <strong>Monday, June 30, 2025</strong>, adding two monsters to the hunt. The long-awaited Lagiacrus, and Seregios, from Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate.</p>
<p>Capcom also revealed a roadmap for more updates coming later this year, with a seasonal event coming in July that'll last from July 23 to August 6, and a Arch-tempered monster, Uth Duna, that gets introduced on July 30 with its own equipment rewards and challenge questline. That'll run until August 20.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>On August 27, a Fender collaboration will arrive, letting players shred in between hunts, which will land just ahead of the third free title update, which is due to arrive sometime in&nbsp;<strong>late September 2025.</strong></p>

<p>Monster Hunter Wilds launched at the end of February 2025 and was instantly one of the best-selling games of 2025, <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-has-sold-10-million-units-establishing-first-month-sales-record-for-capcom/">setting records for Capcom</a>. It's also arguably one of the best games in the Monster Hunter series, if not the best one so far.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">When Wccftech's Francesco De Meo reviewed it</a>, he said that Monster Hunter Wilds is "<em>the natural evolution of the formula introduced in Monster Hunter World, and one of the best entries in the series.</em>"</p>
<p>If you've been wanting to jump into Monster Hunter Wilds, but haven't had the chance yet, it's on sale for the first time this year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-steam-summer-sale-2025-is-officially-here-with-deals-on-indiana-jones-monster-hunter-wilds-oblivion-remastered-and-more/">as part of the Steam Summer Sale 2025</a>.</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> is not having a particularly good time of it over on Steam; thanks to ongoing performance issues and a perceived lack of meaningful content updates, players numbers are routinely dipping below those of the now seven-year-old Monster Hunter World, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-suffering-an-influx-of-overwhelmingly-negative-steam-reviews-can-capcom-turn-around-monster-hunter-wilds-with-the-upcoming-title-update-2">recent reviews have tipped the game into Overwhelmingly Negative territory</a>. Amid all this, Capcom has now outlined Monster Hunter Wilds' next free Title Update, but whether it'll do enough to shift player sentiment remains to be seen.
</p>
<p>
Monster Hunter Wilds' free Title Update 2 officially launches next Monday, 30th June, bringing with it two much-loved monsters from previous games. You've got the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-first-major-content-update-detailed-ahead-of-next-weeks-release">heavily teased return</a> of Monster Hunter 3's serpentine leviathan Lagiacrus, for starters, alongside <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-4-ultimate">Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate</a>'s spiny aerial nuisance Seregios, last seen in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-rise">Monster Hunter Rise</a>'s Sunbreak expansion. For some reason, Seregios immediately brings back memories of chef outfits, but it's entirely possible that's just delirium setting in.
</p>
<p>
Both beasts show off their Wilds' reimaginings in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAf4Z4rCpK4">Capcom's newly revealed Title Update 2 trailer</a>, and Lagiacrus fans may be pleased to know it returns with its underwater combat segments intact, kind of. Capcom describes the underwater portions of Lagiacrus' fight as "accents" (the majority of the battle plays out on land), and while players can't freely swing their weapons while submerged, there <em>are</em> some special actions they can do to add a bit of pizzazz to the encounter. To which I say, Capcom, bring back swimming properly, you cowards.

<p>
Lagiacrus and Seregios feature their own armour and weapons to craft, and they'll appear as 8-star tempered monsters once unlocked. Title Update 2 also promises one additional monster - an arch-tempered version of the delightfully billowy Uth Duna - who'll appear as a limited-time event quest for players at HR50 or above, between 30th July and 20th august.
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere, the update promises several new features. There's new layered weapons, new functionality for photo mode - including brightness settings, new filter effects, and the ability to hide specific characters - plus the option to swap handlers, replacing Alma with Erik. Players can also select which support hunters they want to take out on quests, including new support hunter Mina, a Vespae Unit veteran who's armed with a sword and shield.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, there's talk of new events quests enabling players to forge special armour, a new challenge quest featuring Mizutsune, plus that arch-tempered Uth Duna challenge quest. And from 23rd July to 6th August, players can participate in the latest Festival of Accord seasonal event, Flamefete, which brings a range of summer-inspired rewards.
</p>
<p>
And that all leads up to perhaps the weirdest bit of Capcom's latest showcase: a collaboration event with guitar maker Fender (thre's apparently a real-life Monster Hunter guitar in Japan) running from 27th August to 24th September. This gives hunters a chance to unlock the brilliant/ludicrous Fender gesture, enabling them to rock out and play one of the classic Monster Hunter themes while their Palico pal air guitars merrily alongside them.
</p>
<p>
Will that be enough to placate players increasingly frustrated with Capcom's approach to Monster Hunter Wilds? It remains to be seen, but the publisher has at least confirmed a third Title Update - featuring an additional monster and a new seasonal event - arrives this autumn. "I think Capcom has what it takes to turn the fortunes of Monster Hunter Wilds around," Eurogamer's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-suffering-an-influx-of-overwhelmingly-negative-steam-reviews-can-capcom-turn-around-monster-hunter-wilds-with-the-upcoming-title-update-2">Dom Peppiatt wrote recently</a>. "It took seven patches for the publisher to figure out the issues with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragons-dogma-2-guides-tips-tricks-9422">Dragon's Dogma 2</a> back in 2024, and I'm just hoping Capcom can work that same engineering magic with Monster Hunter Wilds before it's too late."

<p>Capcom recently revealed the Season 3 DLC roster for Street Fighter 6, confirming Sagat, C. Viper, Alex and Ingrid would be joining the battle. Now, in an update during its Spotlight broadcast today, the company has locked in a date for the first fighter.</p>
<p>Along with a brief teaser today, it's now been confirmed the classic character and "emperor of Muay Thai" Sagat will be returning to the game on <strong>5th August 2025</strong>. You'll also be able to experience his new level, located deep within the mountains of Thailand.</p>
<p>In the lead up to this release date, the "Sagat Arrives" Fighting Pass will be made available on <strong>4th July 2025</strong>. It comes packed with EX Colors, more titles and music, avatar gear, new challenger screen illustrations and effects, emotes, stickers and the playable classic game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/tiger_road">Tiger Road</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Capcom's Spotlight Showcase 2025 event started off with a deep dive into <a href="https://www.capcom-games.com/pragmata/en-us/">Pragmata</a>, showing off more of its hacking-shooting-puzzle gameplay and talking a little more in-depth about the story between the android girl Diana and Hugh Williams, an astronaut who ends up on the Moon as part of an investigative team trying to discover why this lunar base has gone silent.</p>
<p>Williams is described as a sometimes sarcastic, though kind man, while Diana is "<em>an android with a heart</em>" and a "<em>curious and enigmatic android</em>."</p>
<p>The combat system works in two parts. First, you'll always need Diana to 'hack' your enemy's armor, otherwise you won't do any damage. Once you've completed the short puzzle of connecting two green nodes on a five-by-five square while passing through as many blue nodes as you can, Hugh is then able to engage in the ranged third-person combat.</p>
<p><iframe title="Capcom Spotlight | 6.26.2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/omnl-EMxfYE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Every encounter in Pragmata is essentially a race at the beginning, with you trying to complete the puzzle before the enemy is able to slowly walk to you and do damage, while you try to finish the puzzle to stun them briefly and gain the upper hand. Once you're dealing with multiple enemies at a time, it's about managing who to take down first and how to keep them from overwhelming you quickly.</p>
<p>Graciously, you do also seem to have a solid maneuverability move set, with thrusters that are helpful in combat and when platforming around the lunar station.</p>
<p>We still don't have a proper release date for Pragmata, as the game is still set to release on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC,<a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-new-trailer-provides-new-look-at-gameplay-confirms-2026-release-window/"> sometime in 2026</a>. Capcom did however confirm that players will be able to try the game themselves if they're in attendance at Gamescom 2025.</p>
<p>Wccftech's Kai Tatsumoto got to try out Pragmata at this year's<a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-hands-on-sgf-2025-demo/"> Summer Game Fest 2025 event</a>, and though it was just a short demo, Kai was already able to see the potential of the game's combat.</p>
<p>"<em>In practice, it all flows very intuitively. The actual hacking minigame is about moving through a grid, bypassing traps, collecting nodes, and targeting the enemy core.</em>"</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom has said that Leon S. Kennedy is a "bad match for horror" amid ongoing speculation he is a yet-to-be-revealed second protagonist for Resident Evil Requiem.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/brief-look-at-resident-evil-requiem-gameplay-reveals-first-person-footage">fresh look at Requiem shown</a> during the publisher's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-spotlight-june-2025-everything-revealed">Capcom Spotlight 2025 broadcast</a>, the floppy-haired fan-favorite was nowhere to be seen. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, his absence was made notable by the fact that Requiem director Koshi Nakanishi offered an umprompted explanation for why Leon, of all past Resident Evil protagonists, had not been picked as this particular game's star.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"The protagonist this time is an intelligence analyst for the FBI, Grace Ashcroft," said Nakanishi, explaining that the new character was a good fit for Requiem's renewed horror focus. "She's introverted and easily scared, which is a new type of character for the Resident Evil series." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We wanted someone that experiences horror from the same perspective as the player," he continued. "She learns to overcome her fears throughout the course of the story, but she's also an analyst for the FBI who's trained with guns, and is able to act with calm deductive reasoning."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom's first trailer for Requiem, aired earlier this month, introduced Ashcroft and the game's returning Raccoon City setting in a manner that only fuelled the flames of fan speculation that Leon would also feature in some capacity. Indeed, fans were quick to spot <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-secretly-stars-leon-fans-believe-as-trailer-easter-eggs-and-actors-resume-potentially-point-to-his-return">a number of clues they said pointed to Leon's presence</a> — including his old truck, still parked outside the ruins of the Raccoon City Police Department.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Resident Evil Requiem First Gameplay Screenshots — Capcom Spotlight 2025</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Is the recent fan speculation around Leon's presence why Capcom has addressed his apparent absence now? Here's what Nakanishi said next, on the character's status in the game:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We always thought about making Leon the protagonist," Nakanishi explained, "but making a horror game based around him is difficult. He wouldn't jump at a bucket falling. No one wants to see Leon scared by every little thing. So he's actually quite a bad match for horror."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Is this Capcom ruling Leon out of Requiem? Nakanishi seems clear that the combat-tested Leon would no longer work as the hero of a game focused around horror. But the publisher also stopped short of ruling the character out altogether. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Leon's status is clearly an important enough talking point that Capcom decided to include discussion of it in tonight's showing — which still showed only a fragment of the full game. With more than six months still to go, Capcom will of course have more up its sleeve to reveal. Could this all be some kind of ruse, and Leon still be a part of it?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Recent entries in the Resident Evil series have taken different approaches to balancing horror and action — some to better results than others — but it's worth remembering how popular the Leon-focused, action-heavy Resident Evil 4 remains among fans. Could Capcom still be holding back a look at Requiem's more action-heavy moments, where Leon <em>would </em>be a better fit? There's still plenty of time left for the publisher to tell.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil Requiem will launch on February 27, 2026 across PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The second free title update for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter: Wilds</a> is imminent, according to today's Capcom Spotlight stream. It's coming on June 30, which we already kind of new <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-2-details-including-release-date-leaked-by-playstation">given that it leaked earlier this week</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The update brings two brand new hunts: Seregios, from Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate, and Lagiacrus. Lagiacrus is a long-desired returning monster from Monster Hunter Tri, and is known for its agility underwater and its rivalry with Rathalos. Though most of Lagiacrus' fight in Monster Hunter: Wilds won't take place underwater due to the player not really being able to fight while swimming, there will be some elements of the hunt that take place underwater, including some special interactions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to the new monsters, there will be a number of other new bits. With the update itself on June 30, new features such as layered weapons (finally), new photo mode settings, the ability to swap handlers, a new collaboration gesture that involves a Fender guitar, a new free gesture set, new paid cosmetic items, and various other rewards and equipment additions hit the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On July 23, there will be a seasonal event entitled Festival of Accord: Flamefete. It will run until August 6 and feature limited-time equipment and other perks. And then on July 30, a new Arch-tempered monster, Arch-temered Uth Duna, will appear, along with its own challenge quest and equipment rewards (that are, frankly, gorgeous).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We gave <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-review"><u>Monster Hunters Wilds an 8 when we reviewed it at launch,</u></a> saying: "Monster Hunter Wilds continues to smooth off the rougher corners of the series in smart ways, making for some extremely fun fights but also lacking any real challenge."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter: Wilds' second free title update is completely free to anyone who already owns the game, and will drop in just four days, on June 30. You can catch up on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-spotlight-june-2025-everything-revealed">everything else from the Capcom Spotlight today</a><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-spotlight-june-2025-everything-revealed"> right here.</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/resident-evil-requiem/" data-ref-id="5000-634330">Resident Evil: Requiem</a>, also known as Resident Evil 9, stars Grace Ashcroft, the presumed daughter of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/resident-evil-outbreak/" data-ref-id="5000-4247">Resident Evil: Outbreak</a>'s Alyssa Ashcroft. The decision to cast a new character in the lead role isn't unheard of for Resident Evil--the last two games have starred Ethan Winters, who was also new at the time. However, fans of the series might've expected a familiar face, such as Leon S. Kennedy, to reappear as the playable character. During the Capcom Showcase for June 2025, the developer-publisher explained why Leon, specifically, isn't a good fit for Requiem.</p><p>"We always thought about making Leon the protagonist," <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DLYYnkbg-F_/?igsh=bjNyazdqd280c29p" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a developer said during the showcase</a>, "but making a horror game based around him is difficult. He wouldn't jump at something like a bucket falling. No one wants to see Leon scared by every little thing. So he's actually quite a bad match for horror." Grace, meanwhile, is said to be an FBI analyst who is trained with guns but must learn to overcome some of her fears over the course of the game's story, as she's initially "introverted and easily scared."</p><p>Leon has previously starred in three mainline Resident Evil entries: Resident Evil 2, alongside Claire Redfield, Resident Evil 4--often lauded as the series' best entry--and Resident Evil 6 as one of multiple playable characters. He's appeared in several other offshoots throughout Resident Evil's history, too, such as ReVerse and Operation Raccoon City, and is widely regarded as one of the most prominent figures in the franchise.</p><p>It's unclear what role, if any, Leon may play in Resident Evil: Requiem, though Capcom tends to thrust its famous faces into its stories even when they aren't the protagonist or playable character. Chris Redfield, for example, plays an important role in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/resident-evil-village/" data-ref-id="5000-513797">Resident Evil: Village</a>.</p><p>If only Leon weren't so hunky and valiant, he may appear once more as the central figure in one of Capcom's more horror-centric entries like next February's Requiem.</p>

In the years since the discovery of Lunam Ore, humanity has developed Lunafilament, a material capable of replicating almost anything. One day without warning, Earth lost contact with the lunar research station dedicated to this Lunafilament, as all signals went dark.</p><p>Today’s footage delves deeper into this out-of-this-world adventure. The journey follows Hugh Williams, who is dispatched to the moon as part of a team to investigate what happened. When a lunar quake suddenly strikes the facility, Hugh is separated from his team, injured, and knocked unconscious. In this moment, he’s rescued by an enigmatic Pragmata, a unique android created using Lunafilament, who has the appearance of a young girl. As the unlikely duo joins forces to fend off the station’s rampaging bots, Hugh nicknames his newfound companion “Diana,” and they embark on a mission to escape the lunar station and return to Earth.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_976420"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
        <blockquote><p>In <em>PRAGMATA</em>, Hacking and shooting are at the core of gameplay. During combat, a panel will appear on screen while aiming at enemies. This represents Diana’s ability to hack into foes’ defenses. By maneuvering the cursor through this panel, she can take down their armor and provide openings for Hugh to blast enemy weak points with his arsenal of weapons. This system will challenge players to think on the fly to overcome multisided situations in the heat of battle.</p><p>Exploration is also a team effort. Diana can utilize her Hacking abilities outside of combat to access the facility’s systems and remove environmental barriers that block progress. Meanwhile, Hugh can make use of his suit’s thrusters to traverse the lunar station’s terrain. By combining their skills and abilities, they can achieve feats that would be impossible alone.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.capcom-games.com/pragmata/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website</a> for <em>PRAGMATA</em> is now fully open. Alongside new information about the game, the site includes a “Hacking Minigame” allowing players to experience part of the game’s unique combat system before <em>PRAGMATA</em> launches.

While Capcom's trailer depicted it fighting on land, it also included underwater combat sections, as well. Meanwhile, Seregios is a medium-sized wyvern with bright gold scales. Both of those monsters will be available on June 30.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4522242-mhroadmap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4522242" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4522242-mhroadmap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4522242"></a><figcaption>The new monsters will be available on June 30, with other features rolling out later.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4522242-mhroadmap.jpg"></figure><p>Capcom also ran down the schedule of new content coming to Monster Hunter Wilds throughout the summer. On June 30, the next wave of cosmetic DLC will arrive, adding new layered armor and emotes. Late July will see the release of the next tempered monster, Arch Temper Uth Duna. Festival of Accord: Flamefete, a summer-themed event with new cosmetics and event quests, runs from July 23 to August 6. On August 27, Capcom is releasing a new emote in collaboration with Fender guitars. Capcom concluded by revealing that Title Update 3, which will add another monster, will arrive in late September.</p><p>The update also adds a number of small quality-of-life features, like layered weapons and improved photo mode options, like new lighting options.

            <p>
Daft but brilliant curation sim Two Point Museum is grabbing its D20s and venturing into the world of medieval fantasy for its first paid DLC release, which promises magical exhibits (and ensuing curses for unsuspecting guests), RPG-inspired expeditions, and more this July.
</p>
<p>
Fantasy Finds, as developer Two Point Studios is calling its DLC, introduces a total of 40 mysterious and magically inclined exhibits. You've got your Flying Carpet, your Teanie Kettle, your Novel Wardrobe, and more, all granting beneficial blessings to guests. Unless, that is, you fail to keep them well-maintained - in which case you'll be dealing with cursed patrons instead.
</p>
<p>
As in the base game, all these curios are acquired out on expeditions, which is where Fantasy Finds' RPG-style twist comes in. In order to track down or maintain the DLC's new exhibits, you'll need to hire new Fantasy Experts. These come in a range of familiar classes - barbarian, wizard, rogue, and bard - each with their own stats. "Does your team have enough combined Strength and Dexterity to counter a dragon attack?", Two Points Studios teases. "Perhaps you need the right combination of Intelligence and Luck to overcome a Picked Lock shortcut."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Featured as part of the Capcom Spotlight stream, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> has some big updates coming soon. Free Title Update 2 launches next week on 30th June, bringing back Lagiacrus and Seregios, and plenty more besides!</p>
<p><iframe title="Monster Hunter Wilds - Free Title Update 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MJQFAfT0T3c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The long-awaited return of Lagiacrus brought an interesting challenge for Capcom, the Monster Hunter Tri star having introduced water battles back in the day. For this reappearance in Monster Hunter Wilds, underwater battles will return, but will be an additive to the surface combat and have some special moves, like the grapple, to help getting in close to deal damage.</p>
<p>Seregios then appeared in Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate, the version of the game that had an international release. As an agile monster that came with a then surprising diagonal kick and speed, these properties have been retained for the Wilds update.</p>
<p>Beyond that, Monster Hutner Wilds Title Update 2 brings new weapon layering – you just need to have crafted the final weapon in the tree, hit the final level for Artian weapons, or high ranked for Palico weapons, and this will give more customisation options.</p>

<p>Photo mode is being enhanced with the ability to hide characters, youll be able to swap Erik in for Alma as you handler, and there’s a new support unit with Mina, a sword and shield user from Vespae Unit.</p>

<p>The summer roadmap for MH Wilds is also stacked. From 23rd July there will be the Festival of Accord: Flamefete, bringing a new look to Grand Hub, and with a bunch of new rewards.</p>
<p>Arch-Tempered Uth Dura will then appear on 30th July, this limited time creature offering new armour sets for those who can overcome its HR 50+ event quest and challenge.</p>
<p>Oh, and then at the end of August? Yeah, then you can grab a Fender and start shredding. This barmy real-world collab is feeding back into the game with a limited event that rewards players with a guitar. You’ll get a rendition of the guitar which has been scanned in with photogrammetry, touched up with scuffs and scratches, and which has then been brought into the game alongside custom motion captured animations, music recorded on this actual guitar, and just a huge attention to detail. Heck, even palicos will start to jump around an air guitar when you use this emote gesture!</p>
<p>Released earlier this year, Monster Hunter Wilds was the long-awaited successor to Monster Hunter Worlds, arriving from the off for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and PC. We said in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/24/monster-hunter-wilds-review/">our review</a>, “Monster Hunter Wilds is the best Monster Hunter game we’ve ever had. The best storyline, the best visuals, and changes to the combat that revolutionise the way the game plays. That said, striving for the widest audience yet has dulled some of the series difficulty, and you may have to wait for the toughest parts of Wilds to fully reveal themselves.”</p>

			<p>Capcom hosted its Spotlight Showcase 2025 event this evening and showcased new gameplay for several of its key upcoming games, including <a href="https://game.capcom.com/residentevil/en/news.html">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, due out next year on February 27, 2026.</p>
<p>Requiem was first revealed at the beginning of this month as part of <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-revealed-officially-called-resident-evil-requiem-arrives-on-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-pc-in-february-2026/">Summer Game Fest 2025's</a> big showcase, with a cutscene that gave us a short look into the game's story, but not a look at gameplay.</p>
<p>While we didn't get a full gameplay deep-dive during the spotlight event, we did get a solid look at gameplay, which was featured between clips of members of the development team talking about different aspects of the game, such as their foundational concept of wanted to create a feeling of "<em>addictive horror</em>" and how challenging the team felt it was to bring players back to Raccoon City, because of how significant the city is in the series history.</p>
<p><iframe title="Resident Evil Requiem - Creators' Message - Capcom Spotlight June 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-hiC3qpghP0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Capcom also dug a bit more into Grace Ashcroft, who they described as being more introverted and frightened than series regular Leon Kennedy would be in the same situations, wanting to create a character that would be closer to how the player feels while playing the game, unsure of what will happen around the next corner.</p>
<p>That said, Capcom clarified that she's still an FBI agent and is more than capable with a weapon. First-person gameplay was described as being more for players who want a horror-focused experience, while action-focused players ought to pick third-person.</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the most significant comments made by the team came from director Koshi Nakanishi, who explained a bit about why it's important for Capcom to be going back to Raccoon City in this game, and the significance of the game's title.</p>
<p>"<em>This game is a requiem, a eulogy to those who came before. Resident Evil is a series that was born from Umbrella and the Raccoon City zombie outbreak. And we chose the title "Requiem" to mark a milestone in the series."</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom has revealed our first look at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> gameplay in brief snippets shown during a livestream.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During the Capcom Spotlight event, Capcom showed a small portion of first-person gameplay, heavy on the horror and featuring new protagonist FBI Agent Grace Ashcroft. We see the character slowly move around creepy corridors with just a lighter for company. At one point, we see Ashcroft turn around to see a hulking humanoid creature close in on her from the shadows.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In another clip of first-person gameplay we see Ashcroft explore a grand hallway, this time holding a handgun (as an FBI agent Ashcroft is handy with guns). She's also able to "act with calm, deductive reasoning," and we see her inspect a toolbox in the classic Resident Evil up close style to demonstrate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And finally, we get a very brief look at third-person Resident Evil Requiem gameplay where Ashcroft is, once again, exploring creepy corridors and poorly lit rooms. We see that horrible creature again, casually stomping in the shadows.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">During the video, Capcom developers explain how the first-person perspective makes for "tense, realistic gameplay," whereas playing in third-person via the over-the-shoulder camera lets you see "more of the action." The third-person persepctive is "great for people who enjoy action-heavy gameplay," Capcom added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil Requiem lets players switch between first- and third-person through the Options menu at any point during the campaign. Check out IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-9-requiem-hands-on-preview">Resident Evil Requiem hands-on preview</a> for more information.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Resident Evil Requiem First Gameplay Screenshots — Capcom Spotlight 2025</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, Capcom confirmed Resident Evil Requiem takes place 30 years after the missile strike on Raccoon City that occurs at the end of Resident Evil 3, which explains the enormous crater we saw in the announcement trailer. Indeed, the name "Requiem" was chosen because, as Capcom explains it: "This game is a requiem, a eulogy to those who came before."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There was no big Leon Kennedy reveal, as some fans had hoped for — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-secretly-stars-leon-fans-believe-as-trailer-easter-eggs-and-actors-resume-potentially-point-to-his-return">and even expected</a>. If the Resident Evil veteran is playable in the game, perhaps that reveal will come later. It's worth noting Capcom developers issued some interesting comments around Leon and Resident Evil Requiem in the video, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-says-leon-s-kennedy-is-a-bad-match-for-horror-as-fan-speculation-swirls-around-whether-hes-still-secretly-playable-in-resident-evil-requiem">which we go over here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil Requiem launches February 27, 2026, across PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S.

However, that doesn’t mean Capcom didn’t make the most of its runtime, with each segment featuring plenty of new information about some of its biggest upcoming games. Some standout moments saw the show reveal new gameplay in a ruined Raccoon City, while others came with a smorgasbord of new content coming to games like Monster Hunter Wilds and Street Fighter 6.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you missed today’s show, or if you’re just looking to refresh your memory, fear not: IGN has gathered all of the highlights for you right here.

"He wouldn't jump at something like a bucket falling. No one wants to see Leon scared by every little thing.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i-love-the-alters-and-all-its-weird-annoying-clones.1229598/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>The Alters</em> is not what I was expecting! Given <a href="https://aftermath.site/summer-game-fest-e3-gamescom-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I now learn about new and upcoming games in a very normal way</a>, I went into it almost blind, knowing absolutely nothing about it, my only prior commentary being, well...</p><p>To find it was a very nice-looking sci-fi game with a unique blend of resource and personnel management, with loads of adventure and dialogue layered over the top, was something of a pleasant surprise!</p><p>You play as the sole survivor of a deep space accident, waking up on an incredibly hostile alien planet to find the rest of your crew is dead. Your base and transportation are still functional, however, leaving you a finite number of days (<em>Majora's Mask</em> style) to stay alive and reach an extraction point. It's a goal you'll never achieve on your own--the mission was originally designed for a whole crew, after all--so before long you need to build your <em>own </em>crew. By cloning yourself.</p><figure><figcaption>While you CAN drive much of the game from menus, it's a lot more fun to get out there and do everything in-person, especially since the WHOOSHING elevators in your base are so much fun to use</figcaption></figure><p>Seems like a straightforward solution, only there's a catch, and this is where the name and cover come in: you're not really cloning yourself, you're creating "Alters". The technology in this future has been able to map brain and body alike, charted via core memories (think <em>Inside Out</em>!) revolving around important decisions you've made in your life, from childhood to school and beyond. <em>The Alters</em> lets you revisit those moments and change the outcome, after which a quantum computer simulates the results and spits out a different you.</p><p>Physically, it's you, but emotionally each clone can be a wildly different person. You've all got some degree of shared histories--the same parents, broadly similar upbringings--but have also lived essentially different lives. This is a cool trick when talking to your new co-workers, everyone the same yet also not, but it also has a practical consequence, because conveniently all the Alters you grow have been trained in the different jobs you'll need to crew your base, from scientists to technicians to refinery experts.</p><p>A big part of <em>The Alters</em> is simply dealing with all of, well, you. The more Alters you create the more they bounce off each other, work themselves into exhaustion, have needs and start fights, and your job as the original is to support everyone, mediate disputes and just generally try to hold the whole operation together.</p><figure><figcaption>Both have a point! How you settle this, or whether you settle it at all, is up to you</figcaption></figure><p>The other part of the game involves running the base, which means constantly tinkering with a resource and production management system. <em>The Alters</em> has a real-time clock and everyone gets tired, but your base and crew always need fuel and food, and you always need to be building and repairing stuff, so it's essential to try to find a balance between all these competing needs.</p><p>This part of the game takes a little while to get your head around; it lives partly as a spreadsheet, with all your numbers and routines and assignments in a menu screen, but it also lives in a 3D space you can directly interact with as a player character. Sometimes because it's more fun to do it that way, plus you often need to leave your base to explore the planet around you, or do some mining.</p><p>There are very clear lines between these parts of the game. The team leader stuff is cool, and there are some interesting implementations of it--your ex-wife is on the phone at one point, for example, and you need to find an Alter who can actually talk to her--but a lot of the dialogue is also kinda boring and repetitive, over-written and overly-wordy in a way that had me turning the subtitles on ASAP so I could skip through sections instead of having to sit through entire conversations. The idea of all these Alters is interesting, but not many of the actual <em>guys </em>are.</p><p>The resource management stuff is also neat, in the way it can be run mostly from menus but also in person, and juggling everything alongside time and energy levels makes it a constant challenge. But it's also kinda artificial; the game's story often intrudes on your plans, so it never <em>quite </em>feels like a proper resource management game.</p><figure><figcaption>This is a very good-looking video game!</figcaption></figure><p>Where I really liked <em>The Alters</em> was the way that, thanks to its context and the way both halves of the game related to each other, none of that mattered, because the lines between them ultimately aren't important. Yeah, many of the Alters are boring and talk too much, but these are your workmates, that's incredibly relatable. And given everything else about this game, particularly its emphasis on story, I didn't <em>want </em>it to be a proper resource sim; I appreciate that it's giving me something to do in between conversations that is trying something different to the usual strategy, FPS or RPG approach. I've honestly never played a game like this, and that's a very cool and fun thing to experience.</p><p>You're playing as a man stranded, stressed and alone, and there's just enough panic and frustration on the resource side of things that I truly felt those things. And the cloning takes the game's setting and runs with it; as a premise in the universe of <em>The Alters</em> it’s dicey and experimental, so its imperfect implementation is just a reflection of that.</p><p>So yeah, I really liked this game! I appreciate fresh swings at familiar genres, I am <em>very </em>into its art design (and menus, which are lovely) and I would love to see more games try interesting new stuff like this.</p><p>I still hate the cover though.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/this-game-sure-looks-a-lot-like-venba"><h3>This Game Sure Looks A Lot Like Venba</h3></a><p>Prolific copycat studio makes a copycat game of Venba, stripping it of any life</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/rent-a-girlfriend-manga"><h3>You win, Rent-A-Girlfriend.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Just a couple weeks after <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/07/resident-evil-9-requiem-revealed-and-is-out-next-february/">Resident Evil Requiem closed out Summer Game Fest</a>, Capcom has shared another good inside look at the hotly anticipated sequel, speaking to the creators about the inspirations and direction that this new game is taking. The game is set to launch on February 27th 2026, for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and Steam.</p>
<p><iframe title="Resident Evil Requiem - Creators' Message - Capcom Spotlight June 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mZ4YPcRZL8A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Director Koshi Nakanishi gave insides on how the game is built around the concept of addictive fear –&nbsp;as in, the cathartic effect of overcoming fears. He also discussed how that ties in with the new protagonist, FBI agent Grace Ashcroft, who is shy and introverted, needing to overcome her fears and leaning on her training to be able to use a gun and fast deduction skills.</p>
<p>Leon had been in consideration to be the lead character for this new game, and would certainly have been popular, so why not return to the franchise staple?</p>
<p>“We always thought about making Leon the protagonist,” Nakanishi-san said. “But making a horror game based around him is difficult. He wouldn’t jump at something like a bucket falling. No one wants to see Leon scared by every little thing, so he’s actually quite a bad match for horror.”</p>

<p>Elsewhere, there’s insights on how RE Engine has evolved to cope with some of the ordeals that Grace is being put through. For example, when hung upside down, the rush of blood to her head will now add redness to her face, while a wig was used to model the hair hanging upside down and the motion that it causes.</p>
<p>For the setting and returning to Raccoon City, Art Director Tomonori Takano said, “we’ve seen a lot of characters face hardship due to Raccoon City, who have faced those hardships and grown. Figuring out how to tell a story which came off of all that came before was actually quite a daunting undertaking that I was nervous about.”</p>
<p>Nakanishi-san then said, “There were a lot of characters involved in the original outbreak who lost their lives or were changed drastically as a result of it. […] This game is a requiem, a eulogy to those who came before.”</p>
<p>Longer developer interviews are available by signing up with a Capcom ID at <a href="http://game.capcom.com/residentevil/">game.capcom.com/residentevil/&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>Resident Evil Requiem is set to be another big shift in style and tone for the long-running horror franchise. Starring Grace Ashcroft, the story drags her back to Raccoon City, 30 years on from its destruction in Resident Evil 3: Nemesis, as she follows the trail of strange deaths at the Renwood Hotel as an FBI technical analyst. That just so happens to be where her mother was herself murdered eight years previously.</p>
<p>The game will call back to some of the most iconic entries of the series to date by having Grace be pursued by a monster, similar to Mr. X and Lady Dimitrescu, and (as was eventually added to RE Village), you’ll be able to switch between first person and third person perspectives, which will help to shift the tone of the game and experience. to your liking.</p>

You'd think that with Summer Game Fest technically being all wrapped up by now we'd all be done with showcases, and yet here <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/capcom">Capcom</a> are with a Spotlight of their own. One little game that got a look-in was, of course, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>. Specifically, the second title update was shown off, which as always is adding a whole bunch of things in, so let's jump in.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
There's two big monsters joining the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> game with this update, which arrives next Monday, June 30th. First up is Lagiacrus, a big, blue, electricity crocodile/ dragon lookin' fella, who was also the flagship monster from Monster Hunter 3. Sure to be a hit, I imagine. There's also Seregios from Monster Hunter 4, a quick-moving, partially flying monster that honestly kind of just looks like a Chocobo.

<p>
July 23rd will see the arrival of the Festival of Accord: Flamefete, a limited time event where the main hub will be decorated all fancy, and you'll be able to get equipment, gestures, and the like.
</p>
<p>
Earlier this year, a Monster Hunter themed Fender guitar was released to celebrate the series' anniversary, and now in an event that's taking place from August 27th to September 24th, you'll be able to get a gesture that lets you shred some sick licks on an in-game version of the same guitar. Video games!
</p>
<p>
On top of that, there's a bunch more outfits that you'll be able to pick up, free DLC like dance gestures, paid DLC like a new cosmetic pack, layered weapons are being added in, you'll be able to swap your handles so you can travel with Erik instead of Alma, and Mina, a sword and shield support hunter, is being added into the game. Oh, and you'll be able to choose which support hunters you bring with you on missions too. Title update 3 should be coming late September, but no exact release date on that one just yet.
</p>
<p>
It's probably also worth noting that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-walkthrough">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> is discounted right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/">Steam</a> thanks to its summer sale. The action game is 20% off, making it £48 down from £60, which still isn't cheap, but hey, take what you can get, especially with a game that only came out this year. Just keep in mind that it seems like your mileage when it comes to performance might vary.

		<p>Having broken its silence over Pragmata earlier this month, Capcom has shared another update on the long-in-development sci-fi romp. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/04/capcoms-pragmata-is-coming-out-in-2026/">The game is set for release in 2026</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Capcom Spotlight (EN-UK) | 26.6.2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SkCA8EnPTgA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>After repeating the State of Play trailer, the showcase dipped into a bit more about some of what makes Pragmata unique. Public hands on will be available at Gamescom, Capcom has confirmed.</p>
<p>Hugh Williams has been sent to a lunar facility to investigate what’s gone wrong there, but after getting split from his team, he’s saved by the android that they eventually settle on should be called Diana – short for DI02367. She immediately jumps in to help Hugh when hostile androids attack, hacking onrushing enemies to break open their armour and let Hugh deal damage with his guns.</p>
<p>We just went <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/26/hands-on-pragmata-exploring-the-enigmatic-lunar-hacking-shooter/">hands on with Pragmata</a>, writing in our preview of the curious blend of hacking and shooting gameplay, “Hacking enemies becomes a vital part of combat right away, as it’s used to open up their armour and expose weaknesses for you to blast away at with Hugh’s guns. This is far from a simple button tap, or even a button hold, but rather throws up a minigame for you to complete to launch the hack at the targeted enemy. Thankfully, it’s not the most mentally taxing of tasks (at least initially), as the grid appears and you simply need to fill blocks to paint a path to the exit point. Along the way, you’ll want to also pass through marked nodes that will power up the attack, while avoiding those marked as a hazard. It’s very simple stuff, but what makes it feel different is that you need your thumb on the left analogue stick in order to move Hugh and Diana away from any dangers, so directional inputs are instead mapped to the shape or letter face buttons.”</p>

<p>Even with this trailer and our hands on, there’s still a lot of mystery surrounding Pragmata, though now there’s a little bit less that when it was announced half a decade ago. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/06/11/pragmata-ps5-capcom-release-date/">First revealed for PS5 in 2020</a>, the game was meant to release in 2022, was delayed to 2023, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/06/12/capcom-delays-pragmata-beyond-2023/">then was delayed again with no further date</a>. Finally, at the latest State of Play stream, it was confirmed for a 2026 launch date.</p>

		<p>Since its reveal in the middle of 2020, Pragmata (pronounced more like ‘prag-matter’) has remained one of the most enigmatic and fleeting games out there. With <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/06/11/pragmata-ps5-capcom-release-date/">years between trailers</a>, and a handful of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/01/12/capcoms-pragmata-project-athia-delayed-release-date-2022-2023/">deeply</a> <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/11/18/pragmata-officially-delayed-by-capcom-to-2023/">apologetic</a> <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/06/12/capcom-delays-pragmata-beyond-2023/">release date delays</a>, we’ve been none-the-wiser about what this game actually is. Until now, that is, as we’ve finally had the chance to go hands on and play this fascinating new sci-fi adventure.</p>
<p><iframe title="PRAGMATA - First Contact Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N6q3XjHKGPc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It would be easy to assume that this is a glitzier, cleaner riff on Dead Space horror. The third-person camera angle, the bulky space suit with a hard-headed helmet cover, the abandoned space station all give that feeling. Heck, in the scene in which the little girl Diana saves stranded astronaut Hugh’s life, she grabs something that looks a heck of a lot like a Plasma Cutter and holds it to his leg. “This is getting very, very dark, very quickly,” I thought to myself, only for this to be revealed as a Lunafilament tool that repairs the broken patches of Hugh’s suit and allows it to start applying emergency aid.</p>


<p>Pragmata is actually forging its own path in a lot of other ways. As IDUS, the Cradle lunar station’s AI, becomes aware of your unsanctioned presence and starts to command nearby robots to expel you. Rather forcefully.</p>
<p>As they stomp towards Hugh, his pistol’s bullets pinging off the armoured skin of the humanoid robot, Diana is determined to help. She has all the appearance of a 6-year-old girl in an oversized puffer jacket, but as she fights to get past the instinctively protective Hugh to help out, she’s immediately revealed to be a highly advanced little android girl instead – her actual designation is DI02367, but let’s stick with Diana – able to shoot hacking laser beams and project a HUD from her hand.</p>


<p>Hacking enemies becomes a vital part of combat right away, as it’s used to open up their armour and expose weaknesses for you to blast away at with Hugh’s guns. This is far from a simple button tap, or even a button hold, but rather throws up a minigame for you to complete to launch the hack at the targeted enemy. Thankfully, it’s not the most mentally taxing of tasks (at least initially), as the grid appears and you simply need to fill blocks to paint a path to the exit point. Along the way, you’ll want to also pass through marked nodes that will power up the attack, while avoiding those marked as a hazard. It’s very simple stuff, but what makes it feel different is that you need your thumb on the left analogue stick in order to move Hugh and Diana away from any dangers, so directional inputs are instead mapped to the shape or letter face buttons.</p>
<p>Jumping deeper into the game, tougher enemies like a big stompy boy that leaves behind puddles or arcing electricity to stun you, provide a larger grid to quickly skim your way through. You also have access to special nodes like Decode, which is able to lower enemy defence further if you are able to integrate it into the path you hurriedly chart through the puzzle. The thing is, nodes are consumables that you collect, rather than a permanent upgrade, so you might want to avoid those spots when battling more standard enemies.</p>

<p>Naturally, there’s different weapon types, so in addition to the unlimited ammo available to Hugh’s standard pistol, there’s a shotgun-like Shockwave Gun, where damage will fall off the further away you are, while the Stasis Net drops a bubble that will stun enemies caught within its radius.</p>
<p>It adds up to a style and tone of combat that’s really rather active and engaging without really feeling overwhelming. Dashing is assigned to a shoulder button, so you’re not having to perform exotic claw grips to play the game to the fullest.</p>
<p>Exploring the Cradle is also interesting, though here we’re left with a lot of questions for the game’s overarching form. Diana unlocks save points by hacking floor hatches with ladders, which could be taken to hint at a Soulslike style where enemies respawn if you use them… or they might just be basic save checkpoints.</p>
<p>There’s definitely a ton of secrets to uncover, though, with hidden fake walls shimmering and certain interactive points that can shift parts of the level around. We also wandered through a room that looked like it had been half generated from a 3D printer, finding a datapad with emails that all about Read Earth Memory technology that can be used to replicate furniture, decorations, and even food for the disappeared residents of this base.</p>

<p>Our hands-on time came to an end, rather abruptly, as the full scale of the moon base is revealed, the dome covering a control room peeling away to show the sprawl across the dusty grey surface. IDUS takes great offence to this, calling once more on nearby robots to come and put an end to your intrusion. In this case, it’s ED-209… or a bipedal bot that looks an awful lot like the RoboCop icon, anyway. Sadly we didn’t get to face off against this boss, but I’m definitely keen to do so whenever the chance does come up.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Latest Dungeons & Dragons 2024 Unearthed Arcana Revisits Arcane Subclasses]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/latest-dungeons-dragons-2024-unearthed-arcana-revisits-arcane-subclasses</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/latest-dungeons-dragons-2024-unearthed-arcana-revisits-arcane-subclasses.1229550/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has released new <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> 2024 Unearthed Arcana. This new playtest material reintroduces some character options originally available in Fifth Edition as well as the return of much older character options from the fantasy TTRPG's storied past.</p>



<p>In an official post on <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/ua/arcane-subclasses" rel="nofollow">D&amp;D Beyond</a>, several members of the design team, Makenzie De Armas, Amanda Hamon, and Ben Petrisor, discuss the contents of the latest <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> 2024 Unearthed Arcana. Notably, the video in the post is the first not to feature Todd Kenrick, who has served as the host of the design videos. This is because he was let go from the company about a week ago.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dungeons-dragons-2024-unearthed-arcana-arcane-archer.jpg?itok=wTVCIfT9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dungeons-dragons-2024-unearthed-arcana-arcane-archer.jpg?itok=Eoj7HPfq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Generally, the character options in this Unearthed Arcana appear to be 2024 updates of pre-existing Fifth Edition subclasses. These include the Arcane Archer Fighter, the Hexblade Warlock, the Arcana Domain Cleric, and four different Wizard schools: Conjurer, Necromancer, Transmuter, and Enchanter. All of which were absent in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-5e-2024-player-handbook-review-mixed-messaging-around-strong" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">2024 Player Handbook</a>.</p>

<p>Thankfully, if you are familiar with the 2014 version of these subclasses, the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> 2024 Unearthed Arcana includes cliff notes on how they have been changed for the new 2024 edition. For example, Arcane Archer's Arcane Shot ability has been reworked with any weapon that uses ammo, including firearms, and the Hexblade's Armor of Hexes is now unlimited and scales with your Warlock Level.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dungeons-dragons-2024-unearthed-arcana-tattooed-monk-artwork.jpg?itok=qwHdr10i 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dungeons-dragons-2024-unearthed-arcana-tattooed-monk-artwork.jpg?itok=A6LYEVO2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>As for the new stuff, there are two new subclasses that haven't been seen since 3.5 Edition. The Tattooed Warrior Monk, originally a Prestige Class, has returned for 2024. In this subclass, your Monk slowly gains a collection of magical tattoos, ones imbued with arcane power. Using these tattoos, and some Focus Points, this will allow you to cast certain spells like Misty Step, Longstrider, or Lesser Restoration.</p>

<p>The second new subclass is the Ancestral Sorceror. These Sorcerors trace their bloodline back to a powerful ancestor who wielded great magic. Maybe your Sorceror is a descendant (or reincarnation) of wizards of legend like Mordenkainen or Bigby? This is reflected in the class features, which include adding Charisma to your spellcasting, having Counterspell always prepared, and having perfect concentration.</p>

<p>Obviously, the material in the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> 2024 Unearthed Arcana is playtest material and will be subject to change. If you want to let Wizards know what you like and dislike, the Unearthed Arcana is available to download for free. The feedback survey will open on July 3.&nbsp;</p>

Remember back in April when I told you about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/abiotic-factor">Abiotic Factor's</a> next update, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/abiotic-factors-next-update-brings-in-an-upgrade-system-a-chilly-new-zone-and-best-of-all-functioning-bins">Cold Fusion</a>? No? What do you mean you can't remember every single news post I've ever written? Fine, whatever, point is, it turns out that said update <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/427410/view/543358846952800257?l=english">turned into the full on 1.0 release of the game</a>. And now, as shown off in a swanky new trailer for developer Deep Field, the release date for the release of 1.0 has been revealed!
</p>

<p>
Drum roll please… it's July 22nd! Which is less than a month away, so you've not got long to wait. That also happens to be when the co-op game is launching on console, but who gives a hoot about that round these parts? In any case, how about a little reminder about what's new in the full release. First up, there's a new area, the Residence Sector, which is where the final chapter of the base game is set. There's a new R.A.I.N shower (no idea what that acronym stands for) that gives you a nice clean.

Plus you can get "something that almost imitates Mexican cuisine" at The Taco Mine, which generally sounds quite inadvisable. And you can even build your own office cubicle, because who doesn't love replicating their workplace in a video game?
</p>
<p>
Deep Field have previously said that a 1.1 update will be coming at some point in 2025 as well, alongside more updates beyond that, but as of yet they haven't set an exact date, or even what that might entail. I expect they're a bit busy prepping that 1.0 release.
</p>
<p>
Oh, and if you want to pick it up at a bit of a discount ahead of its proper launch, the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/427410/Abiotic_Factor/">currently 20% off on Steam</a>. Go wild!
